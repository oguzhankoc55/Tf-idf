gaussian regression and power spectral density estimation with missing  data: the microscope space mission as a case study we present a gaussian regression method for time series with missing data andstationary residuals of unknown power spectral density (psd). the missing dataare efficiently estimated by their conditional expectation as in universalkriging, based on the circulant approximation of the complete data covariance.after initialization with an autoregessive fit of the noise, a few iterationsof estimation/reconstruction steps are performed until convergence of theregression and psd estimates, in a way similar to theexpectation-conditional-maximization algorithm. the estimation can be performedfor an arbitrary psd provided that it is sufficiently smooth. the algorithm isdeveloped in the framework of the microscope space mission whose goal is totest the weak equivalence principle (wep) with a precision of $10^{-15}$. weshow by numerical simulations that the developed method allows us to meet threemajor requirements: to maintain the targeted precision of the wep test in spiteof the loss of data, to calculate a reliable estimate of this precision and ofthe noise level, and finally to provide consistent and faithful reconstructeddata to the scientific community.
