dynamical formation of a reissner-nordstr\"om black hole with scalar  hair in a cavity in a recent letter, we presented numerical relativity simulations, solvingthe full einstein--maxwell--klein-gordon equations, of superradiantly unstablereissner-nordstr\"om black holes (bhs), enclosed in a cavity. low frequency,spherical perturbations of a charged scalar field, trigger this instability.the system's evolution was followed into the non-linear regime, until itrelaxed into an equilibrium configuration, found to be a $\textit{hairy}$ bh: acharged horizon in equilibrium with a scalar field condensate, whose phase isoscillating at the (final) critical frequency. here, we investigate the impactof adding self-interactions to the scalar field. in particular, we findsufficiently large self-interactions suppress the exponential growth phase,known from linear theory, and promote a non-monotonic behaviour of the scalarfield energy. furthermore, we discuss in detail the influence of the variousparameters in this model: the initial bh charge, the initial scalarperturbation, the scalar field charge, mass, and the position of the cavity'sboundary (mirror). we also investigate the "explosive" non-linear regimepreviously reported to be akin to a bosenova. a mode analysis shows that the"explosions" can be interpreted as the decay into the bh of modes that exit thesuperradiant regime.
