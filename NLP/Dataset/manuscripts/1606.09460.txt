intrinsic time in geometrodynamics: introduction and application to  friedmann cosmology an intrinsic local time in geometrodynamics is obtained with using a scaleddirac's mapping. by addition of a background metric, one can construct a scalarfield. it is suitable to play a role of intrinsic time. cauchy problem wassuccessfully solved in conformal variables because they are physical ones.first, the intrinsic time as a logarithm of determinant of spatial metric, wasapplied to a cosmological problem by misner. a global time is exist undercondition of constant mean curvature slicing of spacetime. a volume ofhypersurface and the so-called mean york's time are canonical conjugated pair.so, the volume is the intrinsic global time by its sense. the experimentallyobserved redshift in cosmology is the evidence of its existence. an intrinsictime of homogeneous models is global. the friedmann equation by its sense tiestime intervals. exact solutions of the friedmann equation in standard cosmologywith standard and conformal units are presented. theoretical curvesinterpolated the hubble diagram on latest supernovae are expressed inanalytical form. the class of functions in which the concordance model isdescribed is weierstrass meromorphic functions. the standard cosmological modelis used for fitting the modern hubble diagram. the physical interpretation ofthe modern data from concept of conformal magnitudes is simpler, so ispreferable.
