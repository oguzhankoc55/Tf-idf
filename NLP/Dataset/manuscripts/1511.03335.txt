collision of strong gravitational and electromagnetic waves in the  expanding universe an exact analytical model of the process of collision and nonlinearinteraction of gravitational and/or electromagnetic soliton wave and strongnon-soliton electromagnetic traveling wave of arbitrary profile propagating inthe expanding universe (the symmetric kasner spacetime) is presented. incontrast to intuitive expectations that rather strong traveling waves candestroy the soliton, it occurs that the soliton survives during its interactionwith electromagnetic wave of arbitrary amplitude and profile, but itsparameters begin to evolve under the influence of this interaction. if atraveling electromagnetic wave possesses a finite duration, the solitonparameters after interaction take constant values again, but these values ingeneral are different from those before the interaction. based on exactsolutions of einstein - maxwell equations, our model demonstrates a series ofnonlinear phenomena, such as (a) creation of gravitational waves in thecollision of two electromagnetic waves, (b) creation of electromagnetic solitonwave in the collision of gravitational soliton with traveling electromagneticwave, (c) scattering of a part of soliton wave in the direction of propagationof traveling electromagnetic wave, (d) quasiperiodic oscillating character offields in the wave interaction region and multiple mutual transformations ofgravitational and electromagnetic waves in this region. the figures illustratethese features of nonlinear wave interactions in general relativity.
