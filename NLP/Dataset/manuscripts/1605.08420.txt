gravitational wave transient signal emission via ekman pumping in  neutron stars during post-glitch relaxation phase glitches in the rotational frequency of a spinning neutron star could bepromising sources of gravitational wave signals lasting between a few {\mu}s toa few weeks. the emitted signals and their properties depend upon the internalproperties of the neutron star. in stellar models that assume a super-fluidcore for the neutron star, the most important physical properties are theviscosity of the super-fluid, the stratification of flow in the equilibriumstate and the adiabatic sound speed. such models were previously studied by vaneysden and melatos (2008) and bennett et al. (2010) following simpleassumptions on all contributing factors, in which the post-glitch relaxationphase could be driven by the well-known process of 'ekman pumping'. we explorethe hydrodynamic properties of the flow of super-fluid during this phasefollowing more relaxed assumptions on the stratification of flow and/or thepressure-density gradients within the neutron star than previously studied. wecalculate the time-scales of duration as well as the characteristic strengthsof the resulting gravitational wave signals, and we detail their dependence onthe physical properties of the super-fluid core. we find that it is possiblefor the neutron star to emit gravitational wave signals in a wide range ofdecay time-scales and within the detection sensitivity of aligo for selecteddomains of physical parameters.
