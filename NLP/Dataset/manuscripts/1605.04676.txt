modified bekenstein-hawking system in $f(r)$ gravity the present work deals with four alternative formulation of bekenstein systemon event horizon in $f(r)$ gravity. while thermodynamical laws holds inuniverse bounded by apparent horizon, these laws break down on event horizon.with alternative formulation of thermodynamical parameters (temperature andentropy), thermodynamical laws hold on event horizon in einstein gravity. withthis motivation, we extend the idea of generalised hawking temperature andmodified bekenstein entropy in homogeneous and isotropic model of universe onevent horizon and examine whether thermodynamical laws hold in f(r) gravity.specifically, we examine and compare validity of generalised second law ofthermodynamics (gslt) and thermodynamical equilibrium (te) in four alternativemodified bekenstein scenarios. as dark energy is a possible dominant candidatefor matter in the univerese and holographic dark energy (hde) can giveeffective description of f(r) gravity, so matter in the universe is taken as inthe form interacting hde. in order to understand the complicated expressions,finally the above laws are examined from graphical representation using threeplanck data sets and it is found that generalised/modified hawking temperaturehas a crucial role in making perfect thermodynamical system.
