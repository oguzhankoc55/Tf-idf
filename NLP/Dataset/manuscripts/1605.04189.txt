parameters of innermost stable circular orbits of spinning test  particles: numerical and analytical calculations the motion of classical spinning test particles in the equatorial plane of akerr black hole is considered for the case where the particle spin isperpendicular to the equatorial plane. we review some results of our recentresearch of the innermost stable circular orbits (isco) [p.i. jefremov, o.yu.tsupko and g.s. bisnovatyi-kogan, phys.rev. d 91 124030 (2015)] and presentsome new calculations. the isco radius, total angular momentum, energy, andorbital angular frequency are considered. we calculate the isco parametersnumerically for different values of the kerr parameter $a$ and investigatetheir dependence on both black hole and test particle spins. then we describein details how to calculate analytically small-spin corrections to the iscoparameters for an arbitrary values of $a$. the cases of schwarzschild, slowlyrotating kerr and extreme kerr black hole are considered. the use of theorbital angular momentum is discussed. we also consider the isco bindingenergy. it is shown that the efficiency of accretion onto an extreme kerr blackhole can be larger than the maximum known efficiency (42 %) if the test bodyhas a spin.
