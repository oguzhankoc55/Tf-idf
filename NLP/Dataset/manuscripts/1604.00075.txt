an operator-based local discontinuous galerkin method compatible with  the bssn formulation of the einstein equations discontinuous galerkin finite element (dgfe) methods offer a mathematicallybeautiful, computationally efficient, and efficiently parallelizable way tosolve hyperbolic pdes. these properties make them highly desirable fornumerical calculations in relativistic astrophysics and many other fields. thebssn formulation of the einstein equations has repeatedly demonstrated itsrobustness. the formulation is not only stable but allows for puncture-typeevolutions of black hole systems. to-date no one has been able to solve thefull (3+1)-dimensional bssn equations using dgfe methods. this is partlybecause dgfe discretization often occurs at the level of the equations, not thederivative operator, and partly because dgfe methods are traditionallyformulated for manifestly flux-conservative systems. by discretizing thederivative operator, we generalize a particular flavor of dgfe methods, localdg methods, to solve arbitrary second-order hyperbolic equations. because wediscretize at the level of the derivative operator, our method can beinterpreted as either a dgfe method or as a finite differences stencil withnon-constant coefficients.
