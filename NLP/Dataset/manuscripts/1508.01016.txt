derivation of local-in-time fourth post-newtonian adm hamiltonian for  spinless compact binaries the paper gives full details of the computation within the canonicalformalism of arnowitt, deser, and misner of the local-in-time part of thefourth post-newtonian, i.e. of power eight in one over speed of light,conservative hamiltonian of spinless compact binary systems. the hamiltoniandepends only on the bodies' positions and momenta. dirac delta distributionsare taken as source functions. their full control is furnished by dimensionalcontinuation, by means of which the occurring ultraviolet (uv) divergences areuniquely regularized. the applied near-zone expansion of the time-symmetricgreen function leads to infrared (ir) divergences. their analyticregularization results in one single ambiguity parameter. unique fixation of itwas successfully performed in t.damour, p.jaranowski, and g.sch\"afer, phys.rev. d 89, 064058 (2014) through far-zone matching. technically as well asconceptually (backscatter binding energy), the level of the lamb shift inquantum electrodynamics is reached. in a first run a computation of all termsis performed in three-dimensional space using analytic riesz-hadamardregularization techniques. then divergences are treated locally (i.e., aroundparticles' positions for uv and in the vicinity of spatial infinity for irdivergences) by means of combined dimensional and analytic regularization.various evolved analytic expressions are presented for the first time. thebreakdown of the leibniz rule for distributional derivatives is addressed aswell as the in general nondistributive law when regularizing value of productsof functions evaluated at their singular point.
