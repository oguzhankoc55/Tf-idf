extremal limits and ba\~nados-silk-west effect a fascinating property of extremal kerr black hole (bh) is that it could beact as a particle accelerator with infinite high center-of-mass (cm) energy\cite{bsw}. in this note, we would like to discuss about such fascinatingresult and to point out that this infinite energy at the event horizon comessolely due \emph{to the singular nature of the extremal limit}. we also showthat a non-extremal kerr bh can \emph{not} transform into extremal kerr bh bythe ba\~{n}ados-silk-west mechanism. moreover, we discuss about three possiblegeometries (near extremal, purely extremal and near horizon of extremal kerr)of this mechanism. we further prove that near extremal geometry and nearhorizon geometry, precisely extremal geometry of extremal kerr bhs arequalitatively different. near extremal geometry and near horizon geometry givesthe cm energy is finite, whereas precisely extremal geometry gives thediverging energy. thus, we can argue that extremal kerr bh and non-extremalkerr bh are quite distinct objects. finally, we show that the cm energy ofcollisions of particles not only diverges at infinite red-shift surface($r_{+}$) but it could also diverges at the isco ($r_{isco}$) or at thecircular photon orbit ($r_{cpo}$) or at the marginally bound circular orbit($r_{mbco}$) or at the cauchy horizon i.e. at $r \equivr_{isco}=r_{cpo}=r_{mbco}=r_{+}=r_{-}=m$.
