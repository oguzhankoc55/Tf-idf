the rest mass of an asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetime we study the space of killing fields on the four dimensional ads spacetime$ads^{3,1}$. two subsets $\mathcal{s}$ and $\mathcal{o}$ are identified:$\mathcal{s}$ (the spinor killing fields) is constructed from imaginary killingspinors, and $\mathcal{o}$ (the observer killing fields) consists of allhypersurface orthogonal, future timelike unit killing fields. when thecosmology constant vanishes, or in the minkowski spacetime case, these twosubsets have the same convex hull in the space of killing fields. in presenceof the cosmology constant, the convex hull of $ \mathcal{o}$ is properlycontained in that of $\mathcal{s}$. this leads to two different notions ofenergy for an asymptotically ads spacetime, the spinor energy and the observerenergy. in [10], chru\'sciel, maerten and tod proved the positivity of thespinor energy and derived important consequences among the related conservedquantities. we show that the positivity of the observer energy follows from thepositivity of the spinor energy. a new notion called the "rest mass" of anasymptotically ads spacetime is then defined by minimizing the observer energy,and is shown to be evaluated in terms of the adjoint representation of the liealgebra of killing fields. it is proved that the rest mass has the desirablerigidity property that characterizes the ads spacetime.
