an information-theoretic approach to the gravitational-wave burst  detection problem the advanced era of gravitational-wave astronomy, with data collected in partby the ligo gravitational-wave interferometers, has begun as of fall 2015. onepotential type of detectable gravitational wave is short-durationgravitational-wave bursts, whose waveforms can be difficult to predict. wepresent the framework for a new detection algorithm for such burst events --called \textit{olib} -- that can be used in relatively low-latency to turncalibrated strain data into a detection significance statement. this pipelineconsists of 1) a sine-gaussian matched-filter trigger generator based on theq-transform -- known as \textit{omicron} --, 2) incoherent down-selection ofthese triggers to the most signal-like set, and 3) a fully coherent analysis ofthis signal-like set using the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) bayesianevidence calculator \textit{lalinferenceburst} (lib). these steps effectivelycompress the full data stream into a set of search statistics for the mostsignal-like events, and we use elements from information theory to minimize theamount of information regarding the signal-versus-noise hypothesis lost duringthis compression. we optimally extract this information by using alikelihood-ratio test (lrt) to map these search statistics into a significancestatement. using representative archival ligo data, we show that the algorithmcan detect gravitational-wave burst events of realistic strength in realisticinstrumental noise with good detection efficiencies across different burstwaveform morphologies. we also demonstrate that the combination of searchstatistics by means of an lrt can improve the detection efficiency of oursearch. finally, we show that olib's performance is robust against the choiceof gravitational-wave populations used to model the lrt likelihoods.
