cosmological constant from a deformation of the wheeler-dewitt equation in this paper, we consider the wheeler-dewitt equation modified by adeformation of the second quantized canonical commutation relations. suchmodified commutation relations are induced by a generalized uncertaintyprinciple. since the wheeler-dewitt equation can be related to asturm-liouville problem where the associated eigenvalue can be interpreted asthe cosmological constant, it is possible to explicitly relate such aneigenvalue to the deformation parameter of the corresponding wheeler-dewittequation. the analysis is performed in a mini-superspace approach where thescale factor appears as the only degree of freedom. the deformation of thewheeler-dewitt equation gives rise to a cosmological constant even in absenceof matter fields. as a cosmological constant cannot exists in absence of thematter fields in the undeformed mini-superspace approach, so the existence of anon-vanishing cosmological constant is a direct consequence of the deformationby the generalized uncertainty principle. in fact, we are able to demonstratethat a non-vanishing cosmological constant exists even in the deformed flatspace. we also discuss the consequences of this deformation on the big bangsingularity.
