bulk viscous matter and recent acceleration of the universe we consider a cosmological model dominated by bulk viscous matter with totalbulk viscosity coefficient proportional to the velocity and acceleration of theexpansion of the universe in such a way that$\zeta=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}\frac{\dot{a}}{a}+\zeta_{2}\frac{\ddot{a}}{\dot{a}}.$we show that there exist two limiting conditions in the bulk viscouscoefficients, ($\zeta_{0}$, $\zeta_{1}$, $\zeta_{2}$) which corresponds to auniverse having a big-bang at the origin, followed by an early deceleratedepoch and then making a smooth transition into an accelerating epoch. we haveconstrained the model using the type ia supernovae data, evaluated the bestestimated values of all the bulk viscous parameters and the hubble parametercorresponding to the two limiting conditions. we found that even though theevolution of the cosmological parameters are in general different for the twolimiting cases, they show identical behavior for the best estimated values ofthe parameters from both the limiting conditions. a recent acceleration wouldoccur if $\tilde{\zeta}_{0}+\tilde{\zeta}_{1}&gt;1$ for the first limitingconditions and if $\tilde{\zeta}_{0}+\tilde{\zeta}_{1}&lt;1$ for the secondlimiting conditions. the age of the universe predicted by this model is foundto be less than that predicted from the oldest galactic globular clusters. thetotal bulk viscosity seems to be negative in the past and becomes positive when$z\leq0.8$. so the model violates the local second law of thermodynamics.however, the model satisfies the generalized second law of thermodynamics atthe apparent horizon throughout the evolution of the universe. we also made astatefinder analysis of the model and found that it is distinguishablydifferent from the standard $\lambda$cdm model at present, but shows a desitter type behavior in the far future of the evolution.
