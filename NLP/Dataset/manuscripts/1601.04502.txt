non-thermal effects of acceleration in the resonance interaction between  two uniformly accelerated atoms we study the resonance interaction between two uniformly acceleratedidentical atoms, one excited and the other in the ground state, prepared in acorrelated (symmetric or antisymmetric) state and interacting with the scalarfield or the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state. in this case (resonanceinteraction), the interatomic interaction is a second-order effect in theatom-field coupling. we separate the contributions of vacuum fluctuations andradiation reaction to the resonance energy shift of the system, and show thatonly radiation reaction contributes, while unruh thermal fluctuations do notaffect the resonance interaction. we also find that beyond a characteristiclength scale related to the atomic acceleration, non-thermal effects in theradiation reaction contribution change the distance-dependence of the resonanceinteraction. finally, we find that previously unidentified features appear,compared with the scalar field case, when the interaction with theelectromagnetic field is considered, as a consequence of the peculiar nature ofthe vacuum quantum noise of the electromagnetic field in a relativisticallyaccelerated background.
