scattering of gravity waves in subcritical flows over an obstacle we numerically study the scattering coefficients of linear water waves onstationary flows above a localized obstacle. we compare the scattering ontrans- and subcritical flows, and then focus on the latter which have been usedin recent analog gravity experiments. the main difference concerns themagnitude of the mode amplification: whereas transcritical flows display alarge amplification (which is generally in good agreement with the hawkingprediction), this effect is heavily suppressed in subcritical flows. this isdue to the transmission across the obstacle for frequencies less than somecritical value. as a result, subcritical flows display high- and low-frequencybehaviors separated by a narrow band around the critical frequency. in thelow-frequency regime, transmission of long wavelengths is accompanied bynon-adiabatic scattering into short wavelengths, whose spectrum isapproximately linear in frequency. by contrast, in the high-frequency regime,no simple description seems to exist. in particular, for obstacles similar tothose recently used, we observe that the upstream slope still affects thescattering on the downstream side because of some residual transmission.
