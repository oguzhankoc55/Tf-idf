strong coupling and classicalization classicalization is a phenomenon in which a theory prevents itself fromentering into a strong-coupling regime, by redistributing the energy among manyweakly-interacting soft quanta. in this way, the scattering process of someinitial hard quanta splits into a large number of soft elementary processes. inshort, the theory trades the strong coupling for a high-multiplicity of quanta.at very high energies, the outcome of such a scattering experiment is aproduction of soft states of high occupation number that are approximatelyclassical. it is evident that black hole creation in particle collision atsuper-planckian energies is a result of classicalization, but there is no apriory reason why this phenomenon must be limited to gravity. if the hierarchyproblem is solved by classicalization, the lhc has a chance of detecting atower of new resonances. the lowest-lying resonances must appear right at thestrong coupling scale in form of short-lived elementary particles. the heaviermembers of the tower must behave more and more classically: they must be longerlived and decay into higher numbers of soft quanta.
