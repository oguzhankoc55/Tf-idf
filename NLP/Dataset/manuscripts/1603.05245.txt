on sym theory and all order bulk singularity structures of bps strings  in type ii theory the complete form of the s-matrix elements of three supersymmetric yang-mills(sym), namely a transverse scalar field, two world volume gauge fields and apotential $c_{n-1}$ ramond-ramond (rr) form field has been investigated.basically, in order to find out an infinite number of $t,s, (t+s+u)$ channelbulk singularity structures of that particular mixed closed-open amplitude, weemploy all the conformal field theory techniques to $&lt;v_{c^{-2}}v_{\phi ^{0}}v_{a^{0}} v_{a^{0}}&gt;$ and explore all the entire correlation functions as wellas all order $\alpha'$ contact interactions of these sym couplings. thecomparisons with the other symmetric analysis $&lt;v_{c^{-1}}v_{\phi ^{0}}v_{a^{-1}} v_{a^{0}}&gt;$ and $&lt;v_{c^{-1}}v_{\phi ^{-1}} v_{a^{0}} v_{a^{0}}&gt;$ arealso carried out in detail. various couplings from pull-back of branes, myersterms and several generalized bianchi identities should be taken into accountto be able to reconstruct all order $\alpha'$ bulk singularities of typeiib(iia) superstring theory. finally, we make a comment on how to derivewithout any ambiguity all order $\alpha'$ contact terms of those elements ofthe s-matrix that carry momentum of rr in all involving transverse directionsas well.
