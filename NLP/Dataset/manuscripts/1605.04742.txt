the continuum limit of causal fermion systems this monograph introduces the basic concepts of the theory of causal fermionsystems, a recent approach to the description of fundamental physics. thetheory yields quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory aslimiting cases and is therefore a candidate for a unified physical theory. fromthe mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a generalframework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantumgeometries." the dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, calledthe causal action principle.  in addition to the basics, the book provides all the necessary mathematicalbackground and explains how the causal action principle gives rise to theinteractions of the standard model plus gravity on the level ofsecond-quantized fermionic fields coupled to classical bosonic fields. thefocus is on getting a mathematically sound connection between causal fermionsystems and physical systems in minkowski space.  the book is intended for graduate students entering the field, and isfurthermore a valuable reference work for researchers in quantum field theoryand quantum gravity.
