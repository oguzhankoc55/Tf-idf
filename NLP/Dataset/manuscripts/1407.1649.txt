simple indicators for lorentzian causets several classes of directed acyclic graphs have been investigated in the lasttwo decades, in the context of the causal set program, in search for gooddiscrete models of spacetime. we introduce some statistical indicators that canbe used for comparing these graphs and for assessing their closeness to theideal lorentzian causal sets ('causets') -- those obtained by sprinkling pointsin a lorentzian manifold. in particular, with the reversed triangularinequality of special relativity in mind, we introduce 'longest/shortest pathplots', an easily implemented tool to visually detect the extent to which ageneric causet matches the wide range of path lengths between events oflorentzian causets. this tool can attribute some degree of 'lorentzianity' - inparticular 'non-locality' - also to causets that are not (directly) embeddableand that, due to some regularity in their structure, would not pass the keytest for lorentz invariance: the absence of preferred reference frames. wecompare the discussed indicators and use them for assessing causets both ofstochastic and of deterministic, algorithmic origin, finding examples of thelatter that behave optimally w.r.t. our longest/shortest path plots.
