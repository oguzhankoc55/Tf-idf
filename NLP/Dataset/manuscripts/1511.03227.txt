primordial brusque bounce in born-infeld determinantal gravity we study a particular exact solution to the born-infeld determinantal gravityconsisting of a cosmological model which undergoes a brusque bounce. the latterconsists of an event characterized by a non-null (but finite) value of thesquared hubble rate occurring at a minimum (non-null) scale factor. the energydensity and pressure of the fluid covering the whole manifold are perfectlywell behaved in such an event, but the curvature invariants turn out to beundefined there because of the undefined character of the time derivative of h.it is shown that the spacetime results geodesically complete and singularityfree, and that it corresponds to a picture of an eternal universe in which a(somewhat unconventional) bounce replaces the standard big bang singularity.this example tends to emphasize that, beyond einstein's theory of generalrelativity, and in the context of extended theories of gravity formulated bypurely torsional means, the criterion of a singularity based on pathologies ofscalars constructed upon the riemann curvature tensor, becomes objectionable.
