black hole remnants in hayward solutions and noncommutative effects in this paper, we explore the final stages of the black hole evaporation forhayward solutions. our results show that the behavior of hawking's radiationchanges considerably at the small radii regime such that the black hole doesnot evaporate completely and a stable remnant is left. we analyse the effectthat an inspired model of the noncommutativity of spacetime can have on thethermodynamics of hayward spacetimes. this has been done by applying thenoncommutative effects to the non-rotating and rotating hayward black holes. inthis setup, all point structures get replaced by smeared distributions owing tothis inspired approach. the noncommutative effects result in a colder blackhole in the small radii regime as hayward's free parameter $g$ increases. aswell as the effects of noncommutativity and the rotation factor, theconfiguration of the remnant can be substantially affected by the parameter$g$. however, in the rotating solution it is not so sensitive to $g$ withrespect to the non-rotating case. as a consequence, the noncommutativity andthe rotation may raise the minimum value of energy for the possible formationof black holes in tev-scale collisions. this observation can be used as apotential explanation for the absence of black holes in the current energyscales produced at particle colliders.
