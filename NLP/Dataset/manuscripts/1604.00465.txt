origin of hawking radiation: firewall or atmosphere? the unruh vacuum not admitting any outgoing flux at the horizon implies thatthe origin of the outgoing hawking radiation would be the atmosphere of anear-horizon quantum region without resort to the firewall; however, theexistence of the firewall of superplanckian excitations at the horizon might besupported by the infinite tolman temperature at the horizon. in an exactlysoluble model, it will be shown that the firewall necessarily emerges out ofthe unruh vacuum such that the tolman temperature in the unruh vacuum isdivergent in essence due to the infinitely blueshifted negative ingoing fluxcrossing the horizon rather than the outgoing flux. it is also shown that theoutgoing hawking radiation in the unruh vacuum indeed originates from theatmosphere, not just at the horizon, which is of no relevance to the infiniteblueshift. consequently, the firewall induced from the infinite tolmantemperature and the hawking radiation coming from the atmosphere arecompatible, if we waive the claim that the hawking radiation in the unruhvacuum originates from the infinitely blueshifted outgoing excitations at thehorizon.
