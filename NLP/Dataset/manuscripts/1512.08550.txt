radiating black holes in einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory and cosmic  censorship violation we construct exact, time-dependent, black hole solutions ofeinstein-maxwell-dilaton theory with arbitrary dilaton coupling, $a$. for $a=1$this theory arises as the four-dimensional low-energy effective description ofheterotic string theory. these solutions represent electrically charged,spherically symmetric black holes emitting or absorbing charged null fluids andgeneralize the vaidya and bonnor-vaidya solutions of general relativity and ofeinstein-maxwell theory, respectively. the $a=1$ case stands out as special, inthe sense that it is the only choice of the coupling that allows for atime-dependent dilaton field in this class of solutions. as a by-product, when$a=1$ we show that an electrically charged black hole in this theory can beovercharged by bombarding it with a stream of electrically charged null fluid,resulting in the formation of a naked singularity. this provides an example ofcosmic censorship violation in an exact dynamical solution to low-energyeffective string theory and in a case in which the total stress-energy tensorsatisfies all energy conditions. when $a\neq1$, our solutions necessarily havea time-independent scalar field and consequently cannot be overcharged.
