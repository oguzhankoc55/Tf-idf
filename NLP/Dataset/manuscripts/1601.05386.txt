on solving the constraints by integrating a strongly hyperbolic system it was shown recently that the constraints on the initial data for einstein'sequations may be posed as an evolutionary problem [9]. in one of the proposedtwo methods the constraints can be replaced by a first order symmetrizablehyperbolic system and a subsidiary algebraic relation. here, by assuming thatthe initial data surface is smoothly foliated by a one-parameter family oftopological two-spheres, the basic variables are recast in terms ofspin-weighted fields. this allows one to replace all the angular derivatives inthe evolutionary system by the newman-penrose $\eth$ and $\bar{\eth}$ operatorswhich, in turn, opens up a new avenue to solve the constraints by integratingthe resulting system using suitable numerical schemes. in particular, byreplacing the $\eth$ and $\bar{\eth}$ operators either by a finite differenceor by a pseudo-spectral representation or by applying a spectral decompositionin terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, the evolutionary equations maybe put into the form of a coupled system of non-linear ordinary differentialequations.
