restoration of four-dimensional diffeomorphism covariance in canonical  general relativity: an intrinsic hamilton-jacobi approach classical background independence is reflected in lagrangian generalrelativity through covariance under the full diffeomorphism group. we show howthis independence can be maintained in a hamilton-jacobi approach that does notaccord special privilege to any geometric structure. intrinsic spacetimecurvature based coordinates grant equal status to all geometric backgrounds.they play an essential role as a starting point for inequivalent semi-classicalquantizations. the scheme calls into question wheeler's geometrodynamicalapproach and the associated wheeler-dewitt equation in which three-metrics arefeatured geometrical objects. the formalism deals with variables that aremanifestly invariant under the full diffeomorphism group. yet, perhapsparadoxically, the liberty in selecting intrinsic coordinates is precisely asbroad as is the original diffeomorphism freedom. we show how various ideas fromthe past five decades concerning the true degrees of freedom of generalrelativity can be interpreted in light of this new constrained hamiltoniandescription. in particular, we show how the kucha\v{r} multi-fingered timeapproach can be understood as a means of introducing full four-dimensionaldiffeomorphism invariants. every choice of new phase space variables yields neweinstein-hamilton-jacobi constraining relations, and corresponding intrinsicschr\"odinger equations. we show how to implement this freedom by canonicaltransformation of the intrinsic hamiltonian. we also reinterpret and rectifysignificant work by b. dittrich on the construction of `dirac observables'.
