all correlations must die: assessing the significance of a stochastic  gravitational-wave background in pulsar-timing arrays we present two methods for determining the significance of a stochasticgravitational-wave background affecting a pulsar-timing array, where detectionis based on recovering evidence for correlations between different pulsars,i.e. spatial correlations. nulling these spatial correlations is crucial tounderstanding the response of our detection statistic under the null hypothesisso that we can properly assess the significance of plausible signals. the usualapproach of creating many noise-only simulations is, albeit useful, undesirablesince in that case detection significance is predicated on our (incomplete)understanding of all noise processes. alternatively, destroying any possiblecorrelations in our real datasets and using those (containing all actual noisefeatures) is a much superior approach. in our first method, we perform randomphase shifts in the signal-model basis functions, which has the effect ofeliminating signal phase coherence between pulsars, while keeping thestatistical properties of the pulsar timing residuals intact. we also explore amethod to null correlations between pulsars by using a "scrambled"overlap-reduction function in the signal model for the array. this scrambledoverlap-reduction function should be effectively orthogonal to what we expectof a real background signal. we demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in aset of simulated datasets that contain a stochastic gravitational wavebackground, using bayesian model selection to compare models that do, or donot, account for the correlation between pulsars induced by this signal.finally, we introduce an overarching formalism under which these two techniquescan be seen as natural companions to each other. these methods are immediatelyapplicable to all current pulsar-timing array datasets, and should becomestandard tools for future analyses.
