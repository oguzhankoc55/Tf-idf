emergent horizons and causal structures in holography the open string metric arises kinematically in studying fluctuations of openstring degrees of freedom on a d-brane. an observer, living on a probe d-brane,can send signals through the spacetime by using such fluctuations on the probe,that propagate in accordance with a metric which is conformal to the openstring metric. event horizons can emerge in the open string metric when oneconsiders a d-brane with an electric field on its worldvolume. here, weemphasize the role of and investigate, in details, the causal structure of theresulting open string event horizon and demonstrate, among other things, itsclose similarities to an usual black hole event horizon in asymptoticallyads-spaces. to that end, we analyze relevant geodesics, penrose diagrams andvarious causal holographic observables for a given open string metric. foranalytical control, most of our calculations are performed in an asymptoticallyads$_3$-background, however, we argue that the physics is qualitatively thesame in higher dimensions. we also discuss how this open string metric arisesfrom an underlying d-brane configuration in string theory.
