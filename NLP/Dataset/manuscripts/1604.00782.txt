simulations of inspiraling and merging double neutron stars using the  spectral einstein code we present results on the inspiral, merger, and post-merger evolution of aneutron star - neutron star (nsns) system. our results are obtained using thehybrid pseudospectral-finite volume spectral einstein code (spec). to test ournumerical methods, we evolve an equal-mass system for $\approx 22$ orbitsbefore merger. this waveform is the longest waveform obtained from fullygeneral-relativistic simulations for nsnss to date. such long (and accurate)numerical waveforms are required to further improve semi-analytical models usedin gravitational wave data analysis, for example the effective one body models.we discuss in detail the improvements to spec's ability to simulate nsnsmergers, in particular mesh refined grids to better resolve the merger andpost-merger phases. we provide a set of consistency checks and compare ourresults to nsns merger simulations with the independent bam code. we findagreement between them, which increases confidence in results obtained witheither code. this work paves the way for future studies using long waveformsand more complex microphysical descriptions of neutron star matter in spec.
