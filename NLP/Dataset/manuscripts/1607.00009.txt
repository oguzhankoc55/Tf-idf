near horizon soft hairs as microstates of three dimensional black holes we revisit the three dimensional banados-teitelboim-zanelli (btz) black holesin einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant and the algebra ofcharges associated with nontrivial diffeomorphisms around their near horizongeometry (the near horizon "soft hair"). these soft hairs are arranged by thenear horizon algebra which is the algebra of creation/annihilation operators ofa two dimensional free boson theory. we show that the asymptotic conformalalgebra is a specific subalgebra of the near horizon algebra. we propose thatmicrostates of a generic btz black hole of a given mass and angular momentum,in a microcanonical description, are generic states in the hilbert space ofthis near horizon algebra for which asymptotic virasoro generators vanish. thatis, microstates of a given btz black hole are not distinguishable by theasymptotic two dimensional conformal algebra. we count the microstates usingthe hardy-ramanujan formula for the number of partitions of a given integerinto non-negative integers, recovering the bekenstein-hawking entropy of thebtz black hole. we discuss possible extensions of our black hole microstateconstruction to astrophysical kerr-type black holes.
