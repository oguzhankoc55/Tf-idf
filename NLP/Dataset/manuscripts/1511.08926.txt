noise kernel for reissner nordstrom metric: results at cauchy horizon we obtain point separated noise kernel for the reissner nordstr\"{o}mmetric.the noise kernel defines the fluctuations of the quantum stress tensorand is of central importance to semiclassical stochastic gravity.the metric ismodeled as gravitationally collapsing spacetime, by using suitable coordinatetransformations, defined earlier. the fluctuations of the quantum stresstensor, at the final stage of collapse are then analysed for both, the nakedsingularity and black hole end states. the behavior of this noise kernel, atthe cauchy horizon for naked singularity shows markedly different behaviourfrom self similar tolman bondi metric, which was obtained earlier. in thelatter a very unique divergence was seen, which does not appear for thereissner nordstr\"{o}m metric, here . it is known that the quantum stresstensor itself, diverges at the cauchy horizon (ch) for both of these metrics .in contrast, it can now be seen that the the fluctuations of the stress tensorbehave differently for the two cases. we give a discussion and furtherdirections for investigations of this interesting behaviour in the two cases(regarding the collapse scenario).
