stability of the einstein static universe in $f(r,t)$ gravity the einstein static (es) universe has played a major role in various emergentscenarios recently proposed in order to cure the problem of initial singularityof the standard model of cosmology. in the herein model, we study the existenceand stability of es universe in the context of $f(r,t)$ modified theories ofgravity. considering specific forms of $f(r,t)$ function, we seek for theexistence of solutions representing es state. using dynamical system techniquesalong with numerical analysis, we find two classes of solutions: the first oneis always unstable of the saddle type while the second is always stable so thatits dynamical behavior corresponds to a center equilibrium point. theimportance of the second class of solutions is due to the significant duty theyhave in constructing non-singular emergent models in which the universe couldhave experienced past-eternally, a series of infinite oscillations about suchan initial static state after which, it enters through a suitable physicalmechanism, to an emergent inflationary era. our results suggest thatmodifications in $f(r,t)$ gravity would lead to stable solutions which areunstable in $f(r)$ gravity model.
