frequency and time domain inspiral templates for comparable mass compact  binaries in eccentric orbits inspiraling compact binaries with non-negligible orbital eccentricities areplausible gravitational wave (gw) sources for the upcoming network of gwobservatories. in this paper, we present two prescriptions to computepost-newtonian (pn) accurate inspiral templates for such binaries. first, weadapt and extend the post-circular scheme of yunes {\it et al.} [phys. rev. d80, 084001 (2009)] to obtain a fourier-domain inspiral approximant thatincorporates the effects of pn-accurate orbital eccentricity evolution. thisresults in a fully analytic frequency-domain inspiral waveform with newtonianamplitude and 2pn order fourier phase while incorporating eccentricity effectsup to sixth order at each pn order. the importance of incorporatingeccentricity evolution contributions to the fourier phase in a pn consistentmanner is also demonstrated. second, we present an accurate and efficientprescription to incorporate orbital eccentricity into the quasi-circulartime-domain {\texttt{taylort4}} approximant at 2pn order. new features includethe use of rational functions in orbital eccentricity to implement the 1.5pnorder tail contributions to the far-zone fluxes. this leads to closed formpn-accurate differential equations for evolving eccentric orbits and theresulting time-domain approximant is accurate and efficient to handle initialorbital eccentricities $\leq 0.9$. preliminary gw data analysis implicationsare probed using match estimates.
