generalized holographic ricci dark energy and generalized second law of  thermodynamics in bianchi type i universe generalized second law of thermodynamics in the bianchi type i universe withthe generalized holographic ricci dark energy model is studied in this paper.the behavior of dark energy's equation of state parameter indicates that it ismatter-like in the early time of the universe but phantom-like in the future.by analysing the evolution of the deviations of state parameter and the totalpressure of the universe, we find that for an anisotropic bianchi type iuniverse, it transits from a high anisotropy stage to a more homogeneous stagein the near past. using the normal entropy given by gibbs' law ofthermodynamics, it is proved that the generalized second law of thermodynamicsdoes not always satisfied throughout the history of the universe when we assumethe universe is enclosed by the generalized ricci scalar radius $r_{gr}$. itbecomes invalid in the near past to the future, and the formation of thegalaxies will be helpful in explaining such phenomenon, for that the galaxies'sformation is an entropy increase process. the negative change rates of thehorizon entropy and internal entropy occur in different period indicates thatthe influences of galaxies formation is wiped from internal to the universe'shorizon.
