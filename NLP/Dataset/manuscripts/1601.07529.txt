canonical hamiltonian for an extended test body in curved spacetime: to  quadratic order in spin we derive a hamiltonian for an extended spinning test body in a curvedbackground spacetime, to quadratic order in the spin, in terms ofthree-dimensional position, momentum, and spin variables having canonicalpoisson brackets. this requires a careful analysis of how changes of the spinsupplementary condition are related to shifts of the body's representativeworldline and transformations of the body's multipole moments, and we employbitensor calculus for a precise framing of this analysis. we apply the resultto the case of the kerr spacetime and thereby compute an explicit canonicalhamiltonian for the test-body limit of the spinning two-body problem in generalrelativity, valid for generic orbits and spin orientations, to quadratic orderin the test spin. this fully relativistic hamiltonian is then expanded inpost-newtonian orders and in powers of the kerr spin parameter, allowingcomparisons with the test-mass limits of available post-newtonian results. boththe fully relativistic hamiltonian and the results of its expansion can informthe construction of waveform models, especially effective-one-body models, forthe analysis of gravitational waves from compact binaries.
