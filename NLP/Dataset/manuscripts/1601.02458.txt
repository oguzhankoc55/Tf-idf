kaluza theory with zero-length extra dimensions a new approach to the kaluza theory and its relation to the gauge theory ispresented. two degenerate metrics on the $4+d$-dimensional total manifold areused, one corresponding to the spacetime metric and giving the fiber of thegauge bundle, and the other one to the metric of the fiber and giving thehorizontal bundle of the connection. when combined, the two metrics give thekaluza metric and its generalization to the non-abelian case, justifying thushis choice. considering the two metrics as fundamental rather than the kaluzametric explains why kaluza's theory should not be regarded as five-dimensionalvacuum gravity. this approach suggests that the only evidence of extradimensions is given by the existence of the gauge forces, explaining thus whyother kinds of evidence are not available. in addition, because the degeneratemetric corresponding to the spacetime metric vanishes along the extradimensions, the lengths in the extra dimensions is zero, preventing us todirectly probe them. therefore this approach suggests that it is not justifiedto search for experimental evidence of the extra dimensions as if they aremerely extra spacetime dimensions. on the other hand the new approach uses avery general formalism, which can be applied to known and new generalizationsof the kaluza theory aiming to achieve more and make different experimentalpredictions.
