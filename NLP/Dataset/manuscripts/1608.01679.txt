distinguishing interactions in 3-form dark energy models in this paper we consider 3-form dark energy (de) models with interactions inthe dark sector. we aim to distinguish the phenomenological interactions thatare defined through the dark matter (dm) and the de energy densities. we do ouranalysis mainly in two stages. in the first stage, we identify thenon-interacting 3-form de model which generically leads to an abrupt late-timecosmological event which is known as the little sibling of the big rip (lsbr).we classify the interactions which can possibly avoid this late-time abruptevent. we also study the parameter space of the model that is consistent withthe interaction between dm and de energy densities at present as indicated byrecent studies based on bao and sdss data. in the later stage, weobservationally distinguish those interactions using the statefinder hierarchyparameters $\{ s_{3}^{(1)}\,,\, s_{4}^{(1)}\} \,,\,\{ s_{3}^{(1)}\,,\,s_{5}^{(1)}\} .$ we also compute the growth factor parameter $\epsilon(z)$ forthe various interactions we consider herein and use the composite nulldiagnostic (cnd) $\{ s_{3}^{(1)}\,,\,\epsilon(z)\} $ as a tool to characterisethose interactions by measuring their departures from the concordance model. inaddition, we make a preliminary analysis of our model in light of the recentlyreleased data by sdss~iii on the measurement of the linear growth rate ofstructure.
