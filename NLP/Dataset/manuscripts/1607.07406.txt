modes of the kerr geometry with purely imaginary frequencies in this paper, we examine the behavior of modes of the kerr geometry when themode's frequency is purely imaginary. we demonstrate that quasinormal modesmust be polynomial in nature if their frequency is purely imaginary, andpresent a method for computing such modes. the nature of these modes, however,is not always easy to determine. some of the polynomial modes we compute arequasinormal modes. however, some are simultaneously quasinormal modes and totaltransmission modes, while others fail to satisfy the requisite boundaryconditions for either. this analysis is, in part, an extension of the resultsknown for schwarzschild black holes, but clarifies misconceptions for thebehavior of modes when the black hole has angular momentum. we also show thatthe algebraically special modes of kerr with m=0 have an additional branch ofsolutions not seen before in the literature. all of these results are inprecise agreement with new numerical solutions for sequences of gravitationalquasinormal modes of kerr. however, we show that some prior numerical andanalytic results concerning the existence of quasinormal modes of kerr withpurely imaginary frequencies were incorrect.
