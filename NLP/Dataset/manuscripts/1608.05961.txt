on geometry of deformed black holes: ii. schwarzschild hole surrounded  by a bach-weyl ring we continue to study the response of black-hole space-times on the presenceof additional strong sources of gravity. restricting ourselves to static andaxially symmetric (electro-)vacuum exact solutions of einstein's equations, wefirst considered the majumdar--papapetrou solution for a binary of extremeblack holes in a previous paper, while here we deal with a schwarzschild blackhole surrounded by a concentric thin ring described by the bach--weyl solution.the geometry is again revealed on the simplest invariants determined by themetric (lapse function) and its gradient (gravitational acceleration), and bycurvature (kretschmann scalar). extending the metric inside the black holealong null geodesics tangent to the horizon, we mainly focus on the black-holeinterior (specifically, on its sections at constant killing time) where thequantities behave in a way indicating a surprisingly strong influence of theexternal source. being already distinct on the level of potential andacceleration, this is still more pronounced on the level of curvature: for asufficiently massive and/or nearby (small) ring, the kretschmann scalar evenbecomes negative in certain toroidal regions mostly touching the horizon frominside. such regions have been interpreted as those where magnetic-typecurvature dominates, but here we deal with space-times which do {\em not}involve rotation and the negative value is achieved due to the {\emelectric}-type components of the riemann/weyl tensor. the kretschmann scalaralso shapes rather non-trivial landscapes {\em outside} the horizon.
