vacuum statistics and stability in axionic landscapes we investigate vacuum statistics and stability in random axionic landscapes.for this purpose we developed an algorithm for a quick evaluation of thetunneling action, which in most cases is accurate within 10%. we find thatstability of a vacuum is strongly correlated with its energy density, withlifetime rapidly growing as the energy density is decreased. the probability$p(b)$ for a vacuum to have a tunneling action $b$ greater than a given valuedeclines as a slow power law in $b$. this is in sharp contrast with the studiesof random quartic potentials, which found a fast exponential decline of $p(b)$.our results suggest that the total number of relatively stable vacua (say, with$b&gt; 100$) grows exponentially with the number of fields $n$ and can getextremely large for $n\gtrsim 100$. the problem with this kind of model is thatthe stable vacua are concentrated near the absolute minimum of the potential,so the observed value of the cosmological constant cannot be explained withoutfine-tuning. to address this difficulty, we consider a modification of themodel, where the axions acquire a quadratic mass term, due to their mixing with4-form fields. this results in a larger landscape with a much broaderdistribution of vacuum energies. the number of relatively stable vacua in suchmodels can still be extremely large.
