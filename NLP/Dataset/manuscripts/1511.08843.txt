holographic quenches towards a lifshitz point we use the holographic duality to study quantum quenches of a stronglycoupled cft that drive the theory towards a non-relativistic fixed point withlifshitz scaling. we consider the case of a lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$close to unity, where the non-relativistic field theory can be understood as aspecific deformation of the corresponding cft and, hence, the standardholographic dictionary can be applied. on the gravity side this amounts tofinding a dynamical bulk solution which interpolates between ads and lishitzspacetimes as time evolves. we show that an asymptotically lifshitz black holeis always formed in the final state. this indicates that it is impossible toreach the vacuum state of the lifshitz theory from the cft vacuum as a resultof the proposed quenching mechanism. the nonequilibrium dynamics following thebreaking of the relativistic scaling symmetry is also probed using both localand non-local observables. in particular, we conclude that the equilibrationprocess happens in a top-down manner, i.e., the symmetry is broken faster foruv modes.
