thermodynamic implications of the gravitationally induced particle  creation scenario a rigorous thermodynamic analysis has been done at the apparent horizon of aspatially flat friedmann-lemaitre-robertson-walker universe for thegravitationally induced particle creation scenario with constant specificentropy and an arbitrary particle creation rate {\gamma}. assuming a perfectfluid equation of state $p=(\gamma -1)\rho$ with $\frac{2}{3} \leq \gamma \leq2$, the first law, the generalized second law (gsl), and thermodynamicequilibrium have been studied and an expression for the total entropy (i.e.,horizon entropy plus fluid entropy) has been obtained which does not contain{\gamma} explicitly. moreover, a lower bound for the fluid temperature $t_f$has also been found which is given by $t_f \geq 8\left(\frac {\frac{3\gamma}{2}- 1} {\frac{2}{\gamma} - 1}\right)h^2$. it has been shown that gsl is satisfiedfor $\frac{\gamma}{3h} \leq 1$. further, when $\gamma$ is constant,thermodynamic equilibrium is always possible for $\frac{1}{2} &lt;\frac{\gamma}{3h} &lt; 1$, while for $\frac{\gamma}{3h} \leq \text{min}\left\lbrace \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2\gamma -2} {3\gamma -2} \right\rbrace$ and$\frac{\gamma}{3h} \geq 1$, equilibrium can never be attained. thermodynamicarguments further lead us to believe that during the radiation phase, $\gamma\leq h$. when $\gamma$ is not a constant, thermodynamic equilibrium holds if$\ddot{h} \geq \frac{27}{4}\gamma ^2 h^3 \left(1-\frac{\gamma}{3h} \right)^2$,however, such a condition is by no means necessary for the attainment ofequilibrium.
