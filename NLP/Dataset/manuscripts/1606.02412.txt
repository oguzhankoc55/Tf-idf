hidden markov model tracking of continuous gravitational waves from a  neutron star with wandering spin gravitational wave searches for continuous-wave signals from neutron starsare especially challenging when the star's spin frequency is unknown a priorifrom electromagnetic observations and wanders stochastically under the actionof internal (e.g. superfluid or magnetospheric) or external (e.g. accretion)torques. it is shown that frequency tracking by hidden markov model (hmm)methods can be combined with existing maximum likelihood coherent matchedfilters like the f-statistic to surmount some of the challenges raised by spinwandering. specifically it is found that, for an isolated, biaxial rotor whosespin frequency walks randomly, hmm tracking of the f-statistic output fromcoherent segments with duration t_drift = 10d over a total observation time oft_obs = 1yr can detect signals with wave strains h0 &gt; 2e-26 at a noise levelcharacteristic of the advanced laser interferometer gravitational waveobservatory (advanced ligo). for a biaxial rotor with randomly walking spin ina binary orbit, whose orbital period and semi-major axis are knownapproximately from electromagnetic observations, hmm tracking of thebessel-weighted f-statistic output can detect signals with h0 &gt; 8e-26. anefficient, recursive, hmm solver based on the viterbi algorithm isdemonstrated, which requires ~10^3 cpu-hours for a typical, broadband (0.5-khz)search for the low-mass x-ray binary scorpius x-1, including generation of therelevant f-statistic input. in a "realistic" observational scenario, viterbitracking successfully detects 41 out of 50 synthetic signals without spinwandering in stage i of the scorpius x-1 mock data challenge convened by theligo scientific collaboration down to a wave strain of h0 = 1.1e-25, recoveringthe frequency with a root-mean-square accuracy of &lt;= 4.3e-3 hz.
