comprehensive all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in the  sixth science run ligo data we report on a comprehensive all-sky search for periodic gravitational wavesin the frequency band 100-1500 hz and with a frequency time derivative in therange of $[-1.18, +1.00]\times 10^{-8}$ hz/s. such a signal could be producedby a nearby spinning and slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in ourgalaxy. this search uses the data from the initial ligo sixth science run andcovers a larger parameter space with respect to any past search.  a loosely coherent detection pipeline was applied to follow up weak outliersin both gaussian (95% recovery rate) and non-gaussian (75% recovery rate)bands. no gravitational wave signals were observed, and upper limits wereplaced on their strength. our smallest upper limit on worst-case (linearlypolarized) strain amplitude $h_0$ is ${9.7}\times 10^{-25}$ near 169 hz, whileat the high end of our frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of${5.5}\times 10^{-24}$. both cases refer to all sky locations and entire rangeof frequency derivative values.
