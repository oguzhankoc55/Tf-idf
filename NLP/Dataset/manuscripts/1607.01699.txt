future singularities if the universe underwent starobinsky inflation in  the past the effects which quantum fields and an $r^2$ term in the gravitationallagrangian have on future singularities are investigated in the case that theuniverse underwent starobinsky inflation in the past. the dark energy ismodeled as a perfect fluid, and the focus is on type i-iv singularities andlittle rips which result when the classical einstein equations are solved withvarious types of dark energy as a source. first, evidence is provided that theenergy densities of massive conformally coupled scalar fields approach that ofthe conformally invariant scalar field as a type iii singularity is approached.then, solutions to the semiclassical backreaction equations are investigatedwhen conformally invariant fields and an $r^2$ term in the gravitationallagrangian are present. general proofs regarding the behaviors of the solutionsin cases where the dark energy results in classical singularities of the abovetypes are given. these indicate that backreaction effects always make littlerips, where the scale factor and its derivatives diverge in the infinite propertime limit, worse by turning them into big rip (or type i) singularities, wherethe scale factor and its derivatives diverge at a finite proper time. big ripsingularities always remain as big rip singularities. type iii singularities,for which the scale factor is finite but its time derivatives diverge,sometimes stay the same and are sometimes softened to type ii singularities,where the second and higher time derivatives of the scale factor diverge, ortype iv singularities, where the third and higher derivatives of the scalefactor diverge. type ii and iv singularities are always effectively removed byquantum effects. for completeness, the backreaction is studied in cases inwhich the coefficient of the $r^2$ term has the opposite sign as it has forstarobinsky inflation. general proofs are provided.
