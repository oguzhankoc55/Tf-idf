a unified field theory i: the quantization of gravity in a former paper we proposed a model for the quantization of gravity byworking in a bundle $e$ where we realized the hamilton constraint as thewheeler-dewitt equation. however, the corresponding operator only acts in thefibers and not in the base space. therefore, we now discard the wheeler-dewittequation and express the hamilton constraint differently, either with the helpof the hamilton equations or by employing a geometric evolution equation. thereare two possible modifications possible which both are equivalent to thehamilton constraint and which lead to two new models. in the first model weobtain a hyperbolic operator that acts in the fibers as well as in the basespace and we can construct a symplectic vector space and a weyl system.  \nd in the second model the resulting equation is a wave equation in$\cal{s}_o \times (0,\infty)$ valid in points $(x,t,\xi)$ in $e$ and we lookfor solutions for each fixed $\xi$. this set of equations contains as a specialcase the equation of a quantized cosmological friedman universe without matterbut with a cosmological constant, when we look for solutions which only dependon $t$. moreover, in case $\cal{s}_o$ is compact we prove a spectral resolutionof the equation.
