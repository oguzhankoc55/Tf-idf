first law of black hole mechanics in variable background fields it is well known that in general theories of gravity with the diffeomorphismsymmetry, the black hole entropy is a noether charge. but what will happen ifthe symmetry is explicitly broken? by investigating the covariant first law ofblack hole mechanics with background fields, we show that the noether entropyis still applicable due to the local nature of the black hole entropy.moreover, motivated by the proposal that the cosmological constant behaves as athermodynamic variable, we allow the non-dynamical background fields to bevaried. as an illustration of this general formalism, we study a generic staticblack brane in massive gravity. by deriving two smarr formulas using differentways, we find that either the cosmological constant or the reference metricmust be a thermodynamic variable. this work provides a rare case that thegeneral coordinate invariance would induce nontrivial physics although thediffeomorphism symmetry may be broken. it also suggests a potential relationbetween the cosmological constant and the background fields.
