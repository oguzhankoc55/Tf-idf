p-v criticality in conformal gravity holography in four dimensions in this work we study the $p-v$ criticality of conformal gravity(cg)holography in four dimensions by considering the cosmological constant asthermodynamic pressure. the main potential point of interest in cg is thatthere exists a \emph{rindler parameter $a$} in the metric. in the limit $a=0$,one obtains the schwarzschild-ads black hole (bh). we investigate thethermodynamic behavior in the extended phase space and to examine what effectsmanifested in the \emph{equation of state and critical constants} for this bh\emph{due to the presence of rindler term $a$}. we speculate that due to thepresence of the said parameter there has been a deformation of the shape of the$p-v$ diagram in comparison with rn-ads bh and chargeless-ads bh.interestingly, we find the \emph{critical ratio} \footnote{the ratio ${\calk}_{c}=\frac{t_{c}}{p_{c} v_{c}}$ is sometimes called kamerlingh onnes ratio\cite{moe}. this ratio for cg bh is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}\left(3\sqrt{2}-2\sqrt{3}\right)}$, for rn-ads bh is $\frac{8}{3}$ andschwarzschild-ads bh is $2$. thus ${\cal k}_{c}^{cg}:{\calk}_{c}^{sch-ads}:{\cal k}_{c}^{rn-ads}=1.49:2:2.66$ that is ${\calk}_{c}^{cg}&lt;{\cal k}_{c}^{sch-ads}&lt;{\cal k}_{c}^{rn-ads}$.} for this bh is$\rho_{c} = \frac{p_{c} v_{c}}{t_{c}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(3\sqrt{2}-2\sqrt{3}\right)$, which is greater than thecharged ads bh and schwarzschild-ads bh that implies$\rho_{c}^{cg}:\rho_{c}^{sch-ads}:\rho_{c}^{rn-ads} = 0.67:0.50:0.37$. thesymbols are defined in the main work. moreover, we observe that \emph{criticalconstant is independent of the rindler parameter}. finally, we derive the\emph{reduced equation of state} in terms of \emph{reduced temperature},\emph{reduced volume} and \emph{reduced pressure} respectively.
