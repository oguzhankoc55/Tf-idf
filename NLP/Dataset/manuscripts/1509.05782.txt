gravitational waveforms for neutron star binaries from binary black hole  simulations gravitational waves from binary neutron star (bns) and black hole/neutronstar (bhns) inspirals are primary sources for detection by the advanced laserinterferometer gravitational-wave observatory. the tidal forces acting on theneutron stars induce changes in the phase evolution of the gravitationalwaveform, and these changes can be used to constrain the nuclear equation ofstate. current methods of generating bns and bhns waveforms rely on eithercomputationally challenging full 3d hydrodynamical simulations or approximateanalytic solutions. we introduce a new method for computing inspiral waveformsfor bns/bhns systems by adding the post-newtonian (pn) tidal effects to fullnumerical simulations of binary black holes (bbhs), effectively replacing thenontidal terms in the pn expansion with bbh results. comparing a waveformgenerated with this method against a full hydrodynamical simulation of a bnsinspiral yields a phase difference of $&lt;1$ radian over $\sim 15$ orbits. thenumerical phase accuracy required of bns simulations to measure the accuracy ofthe method we present here is estimated as a function of the tidaldeformability parameter ${\lambda}$.
