influence of relativistic effects on satellite-based clock  synchronization clock synchronization between the ground and satellites is a fundamentalissue in future quantum telecommunication, navigation, and global positioningsystems. here, we propose a scheme of near-earth orbit satellite-based quantumclock synchronization with atmospheric dispersion cancellation by taking intoaccount the spacetime background of the earth. two frequency entangled pulsesare employed to synchronize two clocks, one at a ground station and the otherat a satellite. the time discrepancy of the two clocks is introduced into thepulses by moving mirrors and is extracted by measuring the coincidence rate ofthe pulses in the interferometer. we find that the pulses are distorted due toeffects of gravity when they propagate between the earth and the satellite,resulting in remarkably affected coincidence rates. we also find that theprecision of the clock synchronization is sensitive to the source parametersand the altitude of the satellite. the scheme provides a solution forsatellite-based quantum clock synchronization with high precision, which can berealized, in principle, with current technology.
