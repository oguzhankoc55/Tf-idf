proof that casimir force does not originate from vacuum energy we present a simple general proof that casimir force cannot originate fromthe vacuum energy of electromagnetic (em) field. the full qed hamiltonianconsists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term $h_{\rm em}$, the purematter term $h_{\rm matt}$ and the interaction term $h_{\rm int}$. the $h_{\rmem}$-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicitdependence on matter fields. as a consequence, $h_{\rm em}$ cannot generate anyforces on matter. since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuumenergy of em field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate theforces. the misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energygenerates casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that $h_{\rm em}$attains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations ofmotion and the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it wasexplicit. the true origin of the casimir force is van der waals force generatedby $h_{\rm int}$.
