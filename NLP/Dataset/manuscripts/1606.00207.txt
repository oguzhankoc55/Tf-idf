iresum: a new paradigm for resumming gravitational wave amplitudes we introduce a new method to improve the resummation of the post-newtonian(pn), circularized, multipolar waveform that enters the effective-one-body(eob) theory of coalescing, nonprecessing, spinning black hole binaries (bbhs).we focus on the residual (post-factorized) waveform amplitude corrections$f_{\ell m}$ introduced by damour and nagar~[phys. rev. d~76, 064028 (2007)].in the (nonspinning) test-particle limit, using 20pn-accurate analyticalgravitational wave fluxes, we compute the usual functions $\rho_{\ell m}\equiv(f_{\ell m})^{1/\ell}=\rho^{\rm orb}_{\ell m}+\rho^{\rm s}_{\ell m}$ (where$\rho^{\rm s}_{\ell m}$ and $\rho_{\ell m}^{\rm orb}$ are the spin and orbitalcontributions) at 20pn following pan et al. [phys. rev. d 83, 064003 (2011)].when $m$ is even and the angular momentum of the supermassive black hole islarge (and explicitly discussing $\ell=m=2$) the usual $\rho_{\ell m}$, even athigh pn order, are inaccurate with respect to the "exact" functions $\rho_{\ellm}^{\rm num}$ through the last-stable-orbit (lso) and up to the light-ring,this can be improved (notably already at 3pn) by factoring out $\rho_{\ellm}^{\rm orb}$, and then by suitably resumming the remaining factors. we foundthat using $\rho_{22}^{\rm orb}$ at 5pn and $\rho_{22}^{\rm s}$ at 3.5pn, whichis what the eob-theory for comparable-mass binaries currently holds, resummingonly the spin factor after taking its inverse ("iresum") is a simple way toobtain an excellent numerical/analytical agreement at the lso and a generallybetter behavior up to the light-ring. similar results hold for the $m$-oddcase. the method is then generalized to the comparable-mass case, where we findnonnegligible differences with respect to standard implementations. we suggestthis new resummed waveform to be a better choice for eobnr models.
