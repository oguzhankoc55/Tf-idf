creation, chaos, time : from myth to modern cosmology every society has a story rooted in its most ancient traditions, of how theearth and sky originated. most of these stories attribute the origin of allthings to a creator - whether god, element or idea. we first recall that in thewestern world all discussions of the origin of the world were dominated untilthe 18th century by the story of genesis, which describes the creation as anordered process that took seven days. then we show how the development ofmechanistic theories in the 18th century meant that the idea of an organizedcreation gave way to the concept of evolution, helped by the fact that in the19th century astrophysicists discovered that stars had their origin in cloudsof gas. we conclude with big bang theory, conceived at the beginning of the20th century, that was subsequently developed into a more or less completeaccount of the history of the cosmos, from the supposed birth of space, timeand matter out of the quantum vacuum until the emergence of life (at least onour planet earth, and much probably elsewhere) and beyond.
