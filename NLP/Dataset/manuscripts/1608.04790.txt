coherent observations of gravitational radiation with lisa and glisa the geosynchronous laser interferometer space antenna (glisa) is aspace-based gravitational wave (gw) mission that, for the past five years, hasbeen under joint study at the jet propulsion laboratory, stanford university,the national institute for space research (i.n.p.e., brazil), and space systemsloral. if flown at the same time as the lisa mission, the two arrays willdeliver a joint sensitivity that accounts for the best performance of bothmissions in their respective parts of the mhz band. this simultaneous operationwill result in an optimally combined sensitivity curve that is "white" from afew mhz to 1 hz, making the two antennas capable of detecting, with highsignal-to-noise ratios (snrs), coalescing black-hole binaries (bhbs) withmasses in the range (10 - 100 million) solar masses. their ability of jointlytracking, with enhanced snr, signals similar to that observed by the advancedlaser interferometer gravitational wave observatory (aligo) on september 14,2015 (the gw150914 event) will result in a larger number of observablesmall-mass binary black-holes and an improved precision of the parameterscharacterizing these sources. together, lisa, glisa and aligo will cover, withgood sensitivity, a frequency band from a tenth of a mhz to a khz frequencyband.
