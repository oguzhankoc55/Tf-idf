robust semicoherent searches for continuous gravitational waves with  noise and signal models including hours to days long transients the vulnerability to single-detector instrumental artifacts in standarddetection methods for long-duration quasimonochromatic gravitational waves fromnonaxisymmetric rotating neutron stars [continuous waves (cws)] was addressedin past work [d. keitel et al., phys. rev. d 89, 064023 (2014).] by a bayesianapproach. an explicit model of persistent single-detector disturbances led to ageneralized detection statistic with improved robustness against suchartifacts. since many strong outliers in semicoherent searches of ligo data arecaused by transient disturbances that last only a few hours, we extend thenoise model to cover such limited-duration disturbances, and demonstrateincreased robustness in realistic simulated data. besides long-duration cws,neutron stars could also emit transient signals which, for a limited time, alsofollow the cw signal model (tcws). as a pragmatic alternative to specializedtransient searches, we demonstrate how to make standard semicoherent cwsearches more sensitive to transient signals. considering tcws in a singlesegment of a semicoherent search, bayesian model selection yields a newdetection statistic that does not add significant computational cost. onsimulated data, we find that it increases sensitivity towards tcws, even ofvarying durations, while not sacrificing sensitivity to classical cw signals,and still being robust to transient or persistent single-detector instrumentalartifacts.
