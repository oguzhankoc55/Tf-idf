covariant and infrared-free graviton two-point function in de sitter  spacetime in this paper, the two-point function of linearized gravitons on de sitter(ds) space is presented. technically, respecting the ds ambient space notation,the field equation is given by the coordinate-independent casimir operators ofthe de sitter group. analogous to the quantization of the electromagnetic fieldin minkowski space, the field equation admits gauge solutions. the notationallows us to exhibit the formalism of gupta-bleuler triplets for the presentfield in exactly the same manner as it occurs for the electromagnetic field. inthis regard, centering on the spin-two part (the traceless part,${\cal{k}}^t$), the field solution is written as a product of a generalizedpolarization tensor and a minimally coupled massless scalar field. then,admitting a de sitter-invariant vacuum through the so-called "krein spacequantization", the de sitter fully covariant two-point function is calculated.this function is interestingly free of pathological large distance behavior(infrared divergence). moreover, the spin-zero part (the pure-trace part;${\cal{k}}^{pt}$) of the field is discussed in this paper. it is shown that theimplications of the ds group unitary irreducible representations restrict thegauge-fixing parameter to the optimal value, which remarkably results in thepure-trace part be written in terms of a conformally coupled massless scalarfield.
