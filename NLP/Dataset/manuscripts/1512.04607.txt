branestrahlung: radiation in the particle-brane collision we calculate the radiation accompanying gravitational collision of the domainwall and the point particle in five-dimensional spacetime. this process, whichcan be regarded as brane-particle bremsstrahlung, here called {\itbranestrahlung}, has unusual features. since the brane has intrinsic dynamics,it gets excited in the course of collision, and, in particular, at the momentof perforation the shock branon wave is generated, which then expands with thevelocity of light. therefore, apart from the time-like source, whose radiationcan be computed in a standard way, the total radiation source contains alight-like part whose retarded field is quite non-trivial, exhibitinginteresting retardation and memory effects. we analyze this field in detail,showing that, contrary to the claims that the light-like sources should notradiate at all, the radiation is non-zero and has classically divergentspectrum. we estimate the total radiation power introducing appropriatecutoffs. in passing, we explain how the sum of the non-local (with the supportinside the light cone) and the local (supported on the cone) singular parts ofthe green's function of the five-dimensional d'alembert equation togetherdefine a regular functional.
