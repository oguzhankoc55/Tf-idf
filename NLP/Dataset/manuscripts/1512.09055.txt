holography as a highly efficient rg flow ii: an explicit construction we complete the reformulation of the holographic correspondence as a\emph{highly efficient rg flow} that can also determine the uv data in thefield theory in the strong coupling and large $n$ limit. we introduce a specialway to define operators at any given scale in terms of appropriatecoarse-grained collective variables, without requiring the use of theelementary fields. the wilsonian construction is generalised by promoting thecut-off to a functional of these collective variables. we impose three criteriato determine the coarse-graining. the first criterion is that the effectiveward identities for local conservation of energy, momentum, etc. shouldpreserve their standard forms, but in new scale-dependent background metric andsources which are functionals of the effective single trace operators. thesecond criterion is that the scale-evolution equations of the operators in theactual background metric should be state-independent, implying that thecollective variables should not explicitly appear in them. the final criterionis that the endpoint of the scale-evolution of the rg flow can be transformedto a fixed point corresponding to familiar non-relativistic equations with afinite number of parameters, such as incompressible non-relativisticnavier-stokes, under a certain universal rescaling of the scale and of the timecoordinate. using previous work, we explicitly show that in the hydrodynamiclimit each such highly efficient rg flow reproduces a unique classical gravitytheory with precise uv data that satisfy our ir criterion. we obtain theexplicit coarse-graining which reproduces einstein's equations. in a simpleexample, we are also able to compute the beta function. finally, we show howour construction can be interpolated with the traditional wilsonian rg flow ata suitable scale, and can be used to develop new non-perturbative frameworksfor qcd-like theories.
