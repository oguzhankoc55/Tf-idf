electrodynamics and spacetime geometry i: foundations we explore the intimate connection between spacetime geometry andelectrodynamics. this link is already implicit in the constitutive relationsbetween the field strengths and excitations, which are an essential part of theaxiomatic structure of electromagnetism, clearly formulated via integrationtheory and differential forms. we briefly review the foundations ofelectromagnetism based on charge and magnetic flux conservation, the lorentzforce and the constitutive relations which introduce the spacetime metric. wethen proceed with the tensor formulation by assuming local, linear, homogeneousand isotropic constitutive relations, and explore the physical, observableconsequences of maxwell's equations in curved spacetime. the field equations,charge conservation and the lorentz force are explicitly expressed in general(pseudo) riemanian manifolds. the generalized gauss and maxwell-amp\`{e}relaws, as well as the wave equations, reveal potentially interestingastrophysical applications. in all cases new electromagnetic couplings andrelated phenomena are induced by spacetime curvature. the implications andpossible applications for gravity waves detection are briefly addressed. at thefoundational level, we discuss the possibility of generalizing the vacuumconstitutive relations, by relaxing the fixed conditions of homogeneity andisotropy, and by assuming that the symmetry properties of the electro-vacuumfollow the spacetime isometries. the implications of this extension are brieflydiscussed in the context of the intimate connection between electromagnetismand the geometry (and causal structure) of spacetime.
