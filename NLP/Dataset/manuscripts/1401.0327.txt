quantum volume and length fluctuations in a midi-superspace model of  minkowski space in a (1+1)-dimensional midi-superspace model for gravitational plane waves, aflat space-time condition is imposed with constraints derived from null killingvectors. solutions to a straightforward regularization of these constraintshave diverging length and volume expectation values. physically acceptablesolutions in the kinematic hilbert space are obtained from the originalconstraint by multiplying with a power of the volume operator and by a similarmodification of the hamiltonian constraint, which is used in a regularizationof the constraints. the solutions of the modified killing constraint havefinite expectation values of geometric quantities. further, the expectationvalue of the original killing constraint vanishes, but its moment isnon-vanishing. as the power of the volume grows the moment of the originalconstraint grows, while the moments of volume and length both decrease. thus,these states provide possible kinematic states for flat space, withfluctuations. as a consequence of the regularization of operators the quantumuncertainty relations between geometric quantities such as length and itsconjugate momentum do not reflect naive expectations from the classical poissonbracket relations.
