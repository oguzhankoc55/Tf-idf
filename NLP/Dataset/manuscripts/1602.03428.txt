a 4d gravity theory and g2-holonomy manifolds bryant and salamon gave a construction of metrics of g2 holonomy on the totalspace of the bundle of anti-self-dual (asd) 2-forms over a 4-dimensionalself-dual einstein manifold. we generalise it by considering the total space ofan so(3) bundle (with fibers r^3) over a 4-dimensional base, with a connectionon this bundle. we make essentially the same ansatz for the calibrating 3-form,but use the curvature 2-forms instead of the asd ones. we show that theresulting 3-form defines a metric of g2 holonomy if the connection satisfies acertain second-order pde. this is exactly the same pde that arises as the fieldequation of a certain 4-dimensional gravity theory formulated as adiffeomorphism-invariant theory of so(3) connections. thus, every solution ofthis 4-dimensional gravity theory can be lifted to a g2-holonomy metric. unlikeall previously known constructions, the theory that we lift to 7 dimensions isnot topological. thus, our construction should give rise to many new metrics ofg2 holonomy. we describe several examples that are of cohomogeneity one on thebase.
