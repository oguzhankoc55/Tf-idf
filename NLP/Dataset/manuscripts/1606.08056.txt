the redshift factor and the first law of binary black hole mechanics in  numerical simulations the redshift factor $z$ is an invariant quantity of fundamental interest inpost-newtonian and self-force descriptions of compact binaries. it connectsdifferent approximation schemes, and plays a central role in the first law ofbinary black hole mechanics, which links local quantities to asymptoticmeasures of energy and angular momentum in these systems. through this law, theredshift factor is conjectured to have a close relation to the surface gravityof the event horizons of black holes in circular orbits. we propose andimplement a novel method for extracting the redshift factor on apparenthorizons in numerical simulations of quasi-circular binary inspirals. ourresults confirm the conjectured relationship between $z$ and the surfacegravity of the holes and that the first law holds to a remarkable degree forbinary inspirals. the redshift factor allows us to test analytic predictionsfor $z$ in spacetimes where the binary is only approximately circular, giving anew connection between analytic approximations and numerical simulations.
