rotating killing horizons in generic $f(r)$ gravity theories we discuss various properties of rotating killing horizons in generic $f(r)$theories of gravity in dimension four for spacetimes endowed with two commutingkilling vector fields. assuming there is no curvature singularity anywhere onor outside the horizon, we construct a suitable $(3+1)$-foliation. we show thatsimilar to einstein's gravity, we must have $t_{ab}k^ak^b=0$ on the killinghorizon, where $k^a$ is a null geodesic tangent to the horizon. foraxisymmetric spacetimes, the effective gravitational coupling$\sim\,f'^{-1}(r)$ should usually depend upon the polar coordinate and henceneed not necessarily be a constant on the killing horizon. we prove that thesurface gravity of such a killing horizon must be a constant, irrespective ofwhether $f'(r)$ is a constant there or not. we next apply these results toinvestigate some further basic features. in particular, we show that any hairysolution for the real massive vector field in such theories is clearly ruledout, as long as the potential of the scalar field generated in thecorresponding einstein's frame is a positive definite quantity.
