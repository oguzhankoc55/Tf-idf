improving gravitational-wave parameter estimation using gaussian process  regression folding uncertainty in theoretical models into bayesian parameter estimationis necessary in order to make reliable inferences. a general means of achievingthis is by marginalizing over model uncertainty using a prior distributionconstructed using gaussian process regression (gpr). as an example, we applythis technique to the measurement of chirp mass using (simulated)gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes that could be observed usingadvanced-era gravitational-wave detectors. unless properly accounted for,uncertainty in the gravitational-wave templates could be the dominant source oferror in studies of these systems. we explain our approach in detail andprovide proofs of various features of the method, including the limitingbehavior for high signal-to-noise, where systematic model uncertaintiesdominate over noise errors. we find that the marginalized likelihoodconstructed via gpr offers a significant improvement in parameter estimationover the standard, uncorrected likelihood both in our simple one-dimensionalstudy, and theoretically in general. we also examine the dependence of themethod on the size of training set used in the gpr; on the form of covariancefunction adopted for the gpr, and on changes to the detector noise powerspectral density.
