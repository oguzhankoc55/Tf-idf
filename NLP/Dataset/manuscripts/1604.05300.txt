thermodynamics of charged rotating dilaton black branes coupled to  logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics we construct a new class of charged rotating black brane solutions in thepresence of logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics with complete set of therotation parameters in arbitrary dimensions. the topology of the horizon ofthese rotating black branes are flat, while, due to the presence of the dilatonfield the asymptotic behaviour of them are neither flat nor (anti)-de sitter[(a)ds]. we investigate the physical properties of the solutions. the mass andangular momentum of the spacetime are obtained by using the counterterm methodinspired by ads/cft correspondence. we derive temperature, electric potentialand entropy associated with the horizon and check the validity of the first lawof thermodynamics on the black brane horizon. we study thermal stability of thesolutions in both canonical and grand canonical ensemble and disclose theeffects of the rotation parameter, nonlinearity of electrodynamics and dilatonfield on the thermal stability conditions. we find the solutions are thermallystable for $\alpha&lt;1$, while for $\alpha&gt;1$ the solutions may encounter anunstable phase where $\alpha$ is dilaton-electromagnetic coupling constant.
