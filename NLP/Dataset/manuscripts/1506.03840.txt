generating functionals for quantum field theories with random potentials we consider generating functionals for computing correlators in quantum fieldtheories with random potentials. examples of such theories include condensedmatter systems with quenched disorder (e.g. spin glass) or cosmological systemsin context of the string theory landscape (e.g. cosmic inflation). we use theso-called replica trick to define two different generating functionals forcalculating correlators of the quantum fields averaged over a givendistribution of random potentials. the first generating functional isappropriate for calculating averaged (in-out) amplitudes and involves a singlereplica of fields, but the replica limit is taken to an (unphysical) negativeone number of fields outside of the path integral. when the number of replicasis doubled the generating functional can also be used for calculating averagedprobabilities (squared amplitudes) using the in-in construction. the secondgenerating functional involves an infinite number of replicas, but can be usedfor calculating both in-out and in-in correlators and the replica limits aretaken to only a zero number of fields. we discuss the formalism in details fora single real scalar field, but the generalization to more fields or todifferent types of fields is straightforward. we work out three examples: onewhere the mass of scalar field is treated as a random variable and two wherethe functional form of interactions is random, one described by a gaussianrandom field and the other by a euclidean action in the field configurationspace.
