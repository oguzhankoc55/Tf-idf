eisenhart lifts and symmetries of time-dependent systems certain dissipative systems, such as caldirola and kannai's damped simpleharmonic oscillator, may be modelled by time-dependent lagrangian and hencetime dependent hamiltonian systems with $n$ degrees of freedom. in this paperwe treat these systems, their projective and conformal symmetries as well astheir quantisation from the point of view of the eisenhart lift to a bargmannspacetime in $n+2$ dimensions, equipped with its covariantly constant nullkilling vector field. reparametrization of the time variable corresponds toconformal rescalings of the bargmann metric. we show how the arnold map liftsto bargmann spacetime. we contrast the greater generality of thecaldirola-kannai approach with that of arnold and bateman. at the level ofquantum mechanics, we are able to show how the relevant schr\"odinger equationemerges naturally using the techniques of quantum field theory in curvedspacetimes, since a covariantly constant null killing vector field gives riseto well defined one particle hilbert space. time-dependent lagrangians arisenaturally also in cosmology and give rise to the phenomenon of hubble friction.we provide an account of this for friedmann-lemaitre and bianchi cosmologiesand how it fits in with our previous discussion in the non-relativistic limit.
