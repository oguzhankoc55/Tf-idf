evidence for a lattice weak gravity conjecture the weak gravity conjecture postulates the existence of superextremal chargedparticles, i.e. those with mass smaller than or equal to their charge in planckunits. we present further evidence for our recent observation that in knownexamples a much stronger statement is true: an infinite tower of superextremalparticles of different charges exists. we show that effective kaluza-kleinfield theories and perturbative string vacua respect the sublattice weakgravity conjecture, namely that a finite index sublattice of the full chargelattice exists with a superextremal particle at each site. in perturbativestring theory we show that this follows from modular invariance. however, wepresent counterexamples to the stronger possibility that a superextremal stateexists at every lattice site, including an example in which the lightestcharged state is subextremal. the sublattice weak gravity conjecture has manyimplications both for abstract theories of quantum gravity and for real-worldphysics. for instance, it implies that if a gauge group with very smallcoupling $e$ exists, then scattering at energies above $\sim e^{1/3} m_{\rmpl}$ generically produces black holes.
