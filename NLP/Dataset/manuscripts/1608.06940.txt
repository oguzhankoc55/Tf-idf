operational general relativity: possibilistic, probabilistic, and  quantum in this paper we develop an operational formulation of general relativitysimilar in spirit to existing operational formulations of quantum theory. to dothis we introduce an operational space (or op-space) built out of scalarfields. a point in op-space corresponds to some nominated set of scalar fieldstaking some given values in coincidence. we assert that op-space is the spacein which we observe the world. we introduce also a notion of agency (thiscorresponds to the ability to set knob settings just like in operationalquantum theory). the effects of agents' actions should only be felt to thefuture so we introduce also a time direction field. agency and time directioncan be understood as effective notions. we show how to formulate generalrelativity as a possibilistic theory and as a probabilistic theory. in thepossibilistic case we provide a compositional framework for calculating whethersome operationally described situation is possible or not. in the probabilisticversion we introduce probabilities and provide a compositional framework forcalculating the probability of some operationally described situation. finallywe look at the quantum case. we review the operator tensor formulation ofquantum theory and use it to set up an approach to quantum field theory that isboth operational and compositional. then we consider strategies for solving theproblem of quantum gravity. by referring only to operational quantities we areable to provide formulations for the possibilistic, probabilistic, and (thenascent) quantum cases that are manifestly invariant under diffeomorphisms.
