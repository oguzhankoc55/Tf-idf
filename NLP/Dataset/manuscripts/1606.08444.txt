space from hilbert space: recovering geometry from bulk entanglement we examine how to construct a spatial manifold and its geometry from theentanglement structure of an abstract quantum state in hilbert space. given adecomposition of hilbert space $\mathcal{h}$ into a tensor product of factors,we consider a class of "redundancy-constrained states" in $\mathcal{h}$ thatgeneralize the area-law behavior for entanglement entropy usually found incondensed-matter systems with gapped local hamiltonians. using mutualinformation to define a distance measure on the graph, we employ classicalmultidimensional scaling to extract the best-fit spatial dimensionality of theemergent geometry. we then show that entanglement perturbations on suchemergent geometries naturally give rise to local modifications of spatialcurvature which obey a (spatial) analog of einstein's equation. the hilbertspace corresponding to a region of flat space is finite-dimensional and scalesas the volume, though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) scales likethe area of the boundary. a version of the er=epr conjecture is recovered, inthat perturbations that entangle distant parts of the emergent geometrygenerate a configuration that may be considered as a highly quantum wormhole.
