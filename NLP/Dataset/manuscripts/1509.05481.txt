lower-dimensional black hole chemistry the connection between black hole thermodynamics and chemistry is extended tothe lower-dimensional regime by considering the rotating and charged btz metricin the $(2+1)$-d and a $(1+1)$-d limits of einstein gravity. the smarr relationis naturally upheld in both btz cases, where those with $q \ne 0$ violate thereverse isoperimetric inequality and are thus superentropic. the inequality canbe maintained, however, with the addition of a new thermodynamic work termassociated with the mass renormalization scale. the $d\rightarrow 0$ limit of ageneric $d+2$-dimensional einstein gravity theory is also considered to derivethe smarr and komar relations, although the opposite sign definitions of thecosmological constant and thermodynamic pressure from the $d&gt;2$ cases must beadopted in order to satisfy the relation. the requirement of positive entropyimplies a lower bound on the mass of a $(1+1)$-d black hole. promoting anassociated constant of integration to a thermodynamic variable allows one todefine a "rotation" in one spatial dimension. neither the $d=3$ nor the $d\rightarrow 2$ black holes exhibit any interesting phase behaviour.
