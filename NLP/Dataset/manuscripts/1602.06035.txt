hawking radiation as a probe for the interior structure of regular black  holes the notion of the black hole singularity and the proof of the singularitytheorem were considered great successes in classical general relativity.singularities had presented deep puzzles to physicists. conceptual challengeswere set up by the intractability of the singularity. the existence of blackhole horizons which cover up the interior, including the singularity of theblack hole from outside observers, builds an information curtain, furtherhindering physicists from understanding the nature of the singularity and theinterior structure of black holes. the regular black hole is a concept producedout of multiple attempts of establishing a tractable and understandableinterior structure for black hole as well as avoiding the singularity behindthe black hole horizon. a method is needed to check the correctness of the newconstructions of black holes. after studying the hawking radiation by fermiontunnelling from one type of regular black hole, structure dependent resultswere obtained. the result being structure dependent points out the prospects ofemploying the hawking radiation as a method to probe into the structure ofblack holes.
