primordial tensor modes of the early universe we study cosmological tensor perturbations on a quantized background withinthe hybrid quantization approach. in particular, we consider a flat,homogeneous and isotropic spacetime and small tensor inhomogeneities on it. wetruncate the action to second order in the perturbations. the dynamics is ruledby a homogeneous scalar constraint. we carry out a canonical transformation inthe system where the hamiltonian for the tensor perturbations takes a canonicalform. the new tensor modes now admit a standard fock quantization with aunitary dynamics. we then combine this representation with a generic quantumscheme for the homogeneous sector. we adopt a born-oppenheimer ansatz for thesolutions to the constraint operator, previously employed to study the dynamicsof scalar inhomogeneities. we analyze the approximations that allow us torecover, on the one hand, a schr\"odinger equation similar to the one emergingin the dressed metric approach and, on the other hand, the ones necessary forthe effective evolution equations of these primordial tensor modes within thehybrid approach to be valid. finally, we consider loop quantum cosmology as anexample where these quantization techniques can be applied and compare withother approaches.
