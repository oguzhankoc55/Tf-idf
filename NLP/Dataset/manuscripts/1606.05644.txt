near-horizon geometry and the entropy of a minimally coupled scalar  field in the kerr black hole in this article we will discuss a lorentzian sector calculation of theentropy of a minimally coupled scalar field in the kerr black hole background.we will use the brick wall model of t' hooft. in the kerr black hole,complications arise due to the absence of a global timelike killing field andthe presence of the ergosphere. nevertheless, it is possible to calculate theentropy of a thin shell of matter field in the near-horizon region using thebrick wall model. the corresponding leading order entropy of thenonsuperradiant modes is found to be proportional to the area of the horizonand is logarithmically divergent. thus, the entropy of a three dimensionalsystem in the near-horizon region is proportional to the boundary surface. thisis similar to that of the black hole entropy itself. the corresponding internalenergy remains finite if the entropy is chosen to be of the order of the blackhole entropy itself. for a fixed value of the brick wall cut-off, the leadingorder entropy in the kerr black hole is found to be half of the correspondingterm in the schwarzschild black hole. this is consistent with the preferentialemission of particles in the kerr black hole with azimuthal angular momentum inthe same direction as that of the black hole itself. however, we can obtain theschwarzschild case expression by including a subleading term and taking theappropriate limit.
