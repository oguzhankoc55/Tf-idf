entanglement entropy and algebraic holography in 2006, ryu and takayanagi (rt) pointed out that (with a suitable cutoff)the entanglement entropy between two complementary regions of an equal-timesurface of a d+1-dimensional conformal field theory on the conformal boundaryof ads_{d+2} is, when the ads radius is appropriately related to the parametersof the cft, equal to 1/4g times the area of the d-dimensional minimal surfacein the ads bulk which has the junction of those complementary regions as itsboundary, where g is the bulk newton constant. we point out here that thert-equality implies that, in the quantum theory on the bulk ads backgroundwhich is related to the boundary cft according to rehren's 1999 algebraicholography theorem, the entanglement entropy between two complementary bulkrehren wedges is equal to 1/4g times the (suitably cut off) area of theirshared ridge. (this follows because of the geometrical fact that, forcomplementary ball-shaped regions, the rt minimal surface is precisely theshared ridge of the complementary bulk rehren wedges which correspond, underrehren's bulk-wedge to boundary double-cone bijection, to the complementaryboundary double-cones whose bases are the rt complementary balls.) this isconsistent with the bianchi-meyers conjecture -- that, in a theory of quantumgravity, the entanglement entropy, s, between the degrees of freedom of a givenregion with those of its complement is s = a/4g (+ lower order terms) -- butonly if the phrase 'degrees of freedom' is replaced by 'matter degrees offreedom'. it also supports related previous arguments of the author --consistent with the author's 'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis' -- thatthe ads/cft correspondence is actually only a bijection between just the matter(i.e. non-gravity) sector operators of the bulk and the boundary cft operators.
