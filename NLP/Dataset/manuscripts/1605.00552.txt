emergent cosmos in einstein-cartan theory based on the padmanabhan's proposal, the accelerated expansion of theuniverse can be driven by the difference between the surface and bulk degreesof freedom in a region of space, described by the relation $ dv/dt =n_{sur}-n_{bulk}$ where $n_{sur}$ and $n_{bulk}$ are the degrees of freedomassigned to the surface area and the matter-energy content inside the bulk,respectively. in the present work, the dynamical effect of the weyssenhoffperfect fluid with intrinsic spin and its corresponding spin degrees of freedomin the framework of einstein-cartan (ec) theory are investigated. based on themodification of friedmann equations due to the spin-spin interactions, acorrection term for the padmanabhan's relation including the number of degreesof freedom related to this spin interactions as $\delta v /\deltat=n_{sur}-n_{bulk}-n_{spin}$ is obtained where $n_{spin}$ is the correspondingdegree of freedom related to the intrinsics spin of the matter content of theuniverse. moreover, the validity of the unified first law and the generalizedsecond law of thermodynamics for the einstein-cartan cosmos are investigated.
