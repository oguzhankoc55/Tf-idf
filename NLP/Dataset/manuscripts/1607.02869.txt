some features of scattering problem in a $\kappa$-deformed minkowski  spacetime the doubly special relativity (dsr) theories are suggested in order toincorporate an observer-independent length scale in special theory ofrelativity. the magueijo-smolin proposal of dsr is realizable through aparticular form of the noncommutative (nc) spacetime (known as$\kappa$-minkowski spacetime) in which the lorentz symmetry is preserved. inthis framework, the nc parameter $\kappa$ provides the origin of natural cutoffenergy scale. using a nonlinear deformed relativistic dispersion relation alongwith the lorentz transformations, we investigate some phenomenological facetsof two-body collision problem (without creation of new particles) in a$\kappa$-minkowski spacetime. by treating an elastic scattering problem, westudy effects of the planck scale energy cutoff on some relativistickinematical properties of this scattering problem. the results are challengingin the sense that as soon as one turns on the $\kappa$-spacetime extension, thenature of the two-body collision alters from elastic to inelastic one. it isshown also that a significant kinematical variable involving in heavy ioncollisions, the rapidity, is not essentially an additive quantity under asequence of the nonlinear representation of the lorentz transformations.
