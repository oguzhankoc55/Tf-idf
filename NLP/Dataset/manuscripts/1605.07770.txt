recursion operators and tri-hamiltonian structure of the first heavenly  equation of pleba\'nski we present first heavenly equation of pleba\'nski in a two-componentevolutionary form and obtain lagrangian and hamiltonian representations of thissystem. we study all point symmetries of the two-component system and, usingthe inverse noether theorem in the hamiltonian form, obtain all the integralsof motion corresponding to each variational (noether) symmetry. we derive twolinearly independent recursion operators for symmetries of this system relatedby a discrete symmetry of both the two-component system and its symmetrycondition. acting by these operators on the first hamiltonian operator $j_0$ weobtain second and third hamiltonian operators. however, we were not able tofind hamiltonian densities corresponding to the latter two operators.therefore, we construct two recursion operators, which are either even or odd,respectively, under the above-mentioned discrete symmetry. acting with them on$j_0$, we generate another two hamiltonian operators $j_+$ and $j_-$ and findthe corresponding hamiltonian densities, thus obtaining second and thirdhamiltonian representations for the first heavenly equation in a two-componentform. using p.~olver's theory of the functional multi-vectors, we check thatthe linear combination of $j_0$, $j_+$ and $j_-$ with arbitrary constantcoefficients satisfies jacobi identities. since their skew symmetry is obvious,these three operators are compatible hamiltonian operators and hence we obtaina tri-hamiltonian representation of the first heavenly equation. ourwell-founded conjecture applied here is that p. olver's method works fine fornonlocal operators.
