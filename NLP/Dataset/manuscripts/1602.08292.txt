alignment of quasar polarizations on large scales explained by warped  cosmic strings the recently discovered alignment of quasar polarizations on very largescales could possibly explained by considering cosmic strings on a warped fivedimensional spacetime. compact objects, such as cosmic strings, could havetremendous mass in the bulk, while their warped manifestations in the brane canbe consistent with general relativity in 4d. the self-gravitating cosmic stringinduces gravitational wavelike disturbances which could have effects felt onthe brane, i.e., the massive effective 4d modes (kaluza-klein modes) of theperturbative 5d graviton. this effect is amplified by the time dependent partof the warp factor. due to this warp factor, disturbances don't fade awayduring the expansion of the universe. from a non-linear perturbation analysisit is found that the effective einstein 4d equations on an axially symmetricspacetime, contain a "back-reaction" term on the righthand side caused by theprojected 5d weyl tensor and can act as a dark energy term. the propagationequations to first order for the metric components and scalar-gauge fieldscontain $\varphi$-dependent terms, so the approximate wave solutions are nolonger axially symmetric. the disturbances, amplified by the warp factor, canpossess extremal values for fixed polar angles. this could explain the twopreferred polarization vectors mod $(\varphi, 90^o)$.
