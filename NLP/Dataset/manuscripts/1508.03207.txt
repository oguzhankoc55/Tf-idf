weyl rescaled newton-cartan geometry and non-relativistic conformal  hydrodynamics motivated by the role of scale invariance in condensed matter physics andrecent applications of non-relativistic field theories on curved backgrounds,we derive the general curved background minimally coupled to the fieldsinvariant under both galilean and scale transformations. through theidentification of fields introduced while localizing the space-time symmetriesof a non-relativistic field theoretic model, we derive the scale invariantextension of the newton-cartan geometry, which we have called the weyl-rescalednewton-cartan background. inspired by the application of weyl invariantbackgrounds in the description of relativistic conformal fluids, we firstformulate the framework for describing non-relativistic conformal fluids on theweyl-rescaled newton-cartan background. the specific case of an incompressibleideal fluid in its rest frame on this background is considered, and keydifferences with known relativistic results are commented on. we then considerthe implications of our results in the low energy description of quantum hallfluids. specifically, we find that the gauge fields for scale transformationslead to corrections in the wen-zee and berry phase terms of the low energyeffective action of hall fluids.
