soft heisenberg hair on black holes in three dimensions three-dimensional einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant admitsstationary black holes that are not necessarily spherically symmetric. wepropose boundary conditions for the near horizon region of these black holesthat lead to a surprisingly simple near horizon symmetry algebra consisting oftwo affine u(1) current algebras. the symmetry algebra is essentiallyequivalent to the heisenberg algebra. the associated charges give a specificexample of "soft hair" on the horizon, as defined by hawking, perry andstrominger. we show that soft hair does not contribute to thebekenstein-hawking entropy of banados-teitelboim-zanelli black holes and "blackflower" generalizations. from the near horizon perspective the conformalgenerators at asymptotic infinity appear as composite operators, which weinterpret in the spirit of black hole complementarity. another remarkablefeature of our boundary conditions is that they are singled out by requiringthat the whole spectrum is compatible with regularity at the horizon,regardless the value of the global charges like mass or angular momentum.finally, we address black hole microstates and generalizations to cosmologicalhorizons.
