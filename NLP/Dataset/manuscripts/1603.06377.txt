non-abelian clouds around reissner-nordstr\"om black holes: the  existence line a known feature of electrically charged reissner-nordstr\"om-anti-de sitterplanar black holes is that they can become unstable when considered assolutions of einstein--yang-mills theory. the mechanism for this is that thelinearized yang-mills equations in the background of the reissner-nordstr\"om(rn) black holes possess a normalizable zero mode, resulting in non-abelian(na) magnetic clouds near the horizon. in this work we show that the samepattern may occur also for asymptotically flat rn black holes. different fromthe anti-de sitter case, in the minkowskian background the prerequisite for theexistence of the na clouds is $i)$ a large enough gauge group and $ii)$ thepresence of some extra interaction terms in the matter lagrangian. toillustrate this mechanism we present two specific examples, one in four and theother in five dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. in the first case, weaugment the usual $su(3)$ yang-mills lagrangian with higher order (quartic)curvature term, while for the second one we add the chern-simons density to the$so(6)$ yang-mills system. in both cases, an abelian gauge symmetry isspontaneously broken near a rn black hole horizon with the appearance of acondensate of na gauge fields. in addition to these two examples, we review thecorresponding picture for anti-de sitter black holes. all these solutions arestudied both analytically and numerically, existence proofs being provided forna clouds in the background of rn black holes. the proofs use shootingtechniques which are suggested by and in turn offer insights for our numericalmethods. they indicate that, for a black hole of given mass, appropriateelectric charge values are required to ensure the existence of solutionsinterpolating desired boundary behavior at the horizons and spatial infinity.
