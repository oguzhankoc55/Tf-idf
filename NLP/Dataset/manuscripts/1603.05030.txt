bianchi identities for the riemann and weyl tensors the purpose of this paper is to revisit the bianchi identities existing forthe riemann and weyl tensors in the combined framework of the formal theory ofsystems of partial differential equations (spencer cohomology, differentialsystems, formal integrability) and algebraic analysis (homological algebra,differential modules, duality). in particular, we prove that the n 2 (n 2 --1)(n -- 2)/24 generating bianchi identities for the riemann tensor are firstorder and can be easily described by means of the spencer cohomology of thefirst order killing symbol in arbitrary dimension n $\ge$ 2. similarly, the n(n2 -- 1)(n + 2)(n -- 4)/24 generating bianchi identities for the weyl tensor arefirst order and can be easily described by means of the spencer cohomology ofthe first order conformal killing symbol in arbitrary dimension n $\ge$ 5. as amost surprising result, the 9 generating bianchi identities for the weyl tensorare of second order in dimension n = 4 while the analogue of the weyl tensorhas 5 components of third order in the metric with 3 first order generatingbianchi identities in dimension n = 3. the above results, which could not beobtained otherwise, are valid for any non-degenerate metric of constantriemannian curvature and do not depend on any conformal factor. they arechecked in an appendix produced by alban quadrat (inria, lille) by means ofcomputer algebra. we finally explain why the work of lanczos and followers isnot coherent with these results and must therefore be also revisited.
