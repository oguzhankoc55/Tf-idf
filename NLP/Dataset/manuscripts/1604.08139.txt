the integration of angular velocity a common problem in physics and engineering is determination of theorientation of an object given its angular velocity. when the direction of theangular velocity changes in time, this is a nontrivial problem involvingcoupled differential equations. several possible approaches are examined, alongwith various improvements over previous efforts. these are then evaluatednumerically by comparison to a complicated but analytically known rotation thatis motivated by the important astrophysical problem of precessing black-holebinaries. it is shown that a straightforward solution directly usingquaternions is most efficient and accurate, and that the norm of the quaternionis irrelevant. integration of the generator of the rotation can also be maderoughly as efficient as integration of the rotation. both methods willtypically be twice as efficient naive vector- or matrix-based methods.implementation by means of standard general-purpose numerical integrators isstable and efficient, so that such problems can be readily solved as part of alarger system of differential equations. possible generalization to integrationin other lie groups is also discussed.
