holographic space-time models of anti-desitter space-times we study the constraints on hst models of ads space-time. the causal diamondsof hst along time-like geodesics of ads space-time, fit nicely into the frwpatch of ads space. the coordinate singularity of the frw patch is identifiedwith the proper time at which the hilbert space of the causal diamond becomesinfinite dimensional. for diamonds much smaller than the ads radius, rads, thetime dependent hamiltonians of hst are the same as those used to describesimilar diamonds in minkowski space. in particular, they are invariant underthe fuzzy analog of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the holographicscreen, which leads to fast scrambling of perturbations on the horizon of ablack hole of size smaller than rads. we argue that, in order to take a limitof this system which converges to a cft, one must choose hamiltonians, in arange of proper times of order rads, which break this invariance, and becomelocal in a particular choice of basis for the variables. we show that,beginning with flat, sub-rads, patches of dimension d, the resulting cft,constructed from the variables of hst, is inconsistent with the entropy oflarge black holes, unless one has at least two compact dimensions, whose sizeis of order rads. the argument is connected to a new observation about thescrambling rate of information localized on the compact dimensions. ourconstruction explains why large ads black holes do not have the fast scramblingproperty. our present approach cannot deal with models where string theory isweakly coupled and rads is of order the string scale, because the relationshipbetween area and entropy is non-universal in such models. on spatial lengthscales longer than rads, our mapping of hst variables into cft shares much withthe tensor network renormalization group (tnrg)[1] and is a sort of evolvingerror correcting code[2].
