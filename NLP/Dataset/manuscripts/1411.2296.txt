a novel quantum-mechanical interpretation of the dirac equation a novel interpretation is given of dirac's "wave equation for therelativistic electron" as a quantum-mechanical one-particle equation. in thisinterpretation the electron and the positron are merely the two different"topological spin" states of a single more fundamental particle, not distinctparticles in their own right. the new interpretation is backed up by theexistence of such bi-particle structures in general relativity, in particularthe ring singularity present in any spacelike section of the maximalanalytically extended, topologically non-trivial, electromagnetic kerr-newmanspacetime in the zero-gravity limit (here, "zero-gravity" means the limit $g\to0$, where $g$ is newton's constant of universal gravitation). this novelinterpretation resolves the dilemma that dirac's wave equation seems to becapable of describing both the electron and the positron in "external" fieldsin many relevant situations, while the bi-spinorial wave function has only asingle position variable in its argument, not two - as it should if it were atwo-particle equation! a dirac equation is formulated for a ring-likebi-particle which interacts with a static point charges located elsewhere inthe topologically non-trivial physical space associated with the moving ringbi-particle, the motion being governed by a de-broglie-bohm type law extractedfrom the dirac equation. as an application, the pertinent general-relativisticzero-gravity hydrogen problem is studied in the usual born-oppenheimerapproximation. its spectral results suggest that the zero-$g$ kerr-newmanmagnetic moment be identified with the so-called "anomalous magnetic moment ofthe physical electron," not with the bohr magneton, so that the ring radius isonly a tiny fraction of the electron's compton wave length.
