quantization of spacetime based on spacetime interval operator motivated by both concepts of r.j. adler's recent work on utilizing cliffordalgebra as the linear line element $ds = \left\langle \gamma_\mu \right\rangledx^\mu $, and the fermionization of the cylindrical worldsheet polyakov action,we introduce a new type of spacetime quantization that is fully covariant. thetheory is based on the reinterpretation of adler's linear line element as $ds =\gamma_\mu \left\langle \lambda \gamma ^\mu \right\rangle$, where $\lambda$ isthe characteristic length of the theory. we name this new operator as"spacetime interval operator", and argue that it can be regarded as a naturalextension to the one-forms in the $u(\mathfrak{s}u(2))$ non-commutativegeometry. by treating fourier momentum as the particle momentum, thegeneralized uncertainty principle of the $u(\mathfrak{s}u(2))$ non-commutativegeometry, as an approximation to the generalized uncertainty principle of ourtheory, is derived, and is shown to have a lowest order correction term of theorder $p^2$ similar to that of snyder's. the holography nature of the theory isdemonstrated, and the predicted fuzziness of the geodesic is shown to be muchsmaller than conceivable astrophysical bounds.
