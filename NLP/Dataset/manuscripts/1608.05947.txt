hybrid models in loop quantum cosmology in the framework of loop quantum cosmology, inhomogeneous models are usuallyquantized by means of a hybrid approach that combines loop quantizationtechniques with standard quantum field theory methods. this approach is basedon a splitting of the phase space in a homogeneous sector, formed by global,zero-modes, and an inhomogeneous sector, formed by the remaining, infinitenumber of modes, that describe the local degrees of freedom. then, the hybridquantization is attained by adopting a loop representation for the homogeneousgravitational sector, while a fock representation is used for theinhomogeneities. the zero-mode of the hamiltonian constraint operator couplesthe homogeneous and inhomogeneous sectors. the hybrid approach, therefore, isexpected to provide a suitable quantum theory in regimes where the main quantumeffects of the geometry are those affecting the zero-modes, while theinhomogeneities, still being quantum, can be treated in a more conventionalway. this hybrid strategy was first proposed for the simplest cosmologicalmidisuperspaces: the gowdy models, and it has been later applied to the case ofcosmological perturbations. this paper reviews the construction and mainapplications of hybrid loop quantum cosmology
