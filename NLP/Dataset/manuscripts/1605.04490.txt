boundary conditions for general relativity on ads$_{3}$ and the kdv  hierarchy it is shown that general relativity with negative cosmological constant inthree spacetime dimensions admits a new family of boundary conditions beinglabeled by a nonnegative integer $k$. gravitational excitations are thendescribed by "boundary gravitons" that fulfill the equations of the $k$-thelement of the kdv hierarchy. in particular, $k=0$ corresponds to thebrown-henneaux boundary conditions so that excitations are described by chiralmovers. in the case of $k=1$, the boundary gravitons fulfill the kdv equationand the asymptotic symmetry algebra turns out to be infinite-dimensional,abelian and devoid of central extensions. the latter feature also holds for theremaining cases that describe the hierarchy ($k&gt;1$). our boundary conditionsthen provide a gravitational dual of two noninteracting left and right kdvmovers, and hence, boundary gravitons possess anisotropic lifshitz scaling withdynamical exponent $z=2k+1$. remarkably, despite spacetimes solving the fieldequations are locally ads, they possess anisotropic scaling being induced bythe choice of boundary conditions. as an application, the entropy of a rotatingbtz black hole is precisely recovered from a suitable generalization of thecardy formula that is compatible with the anisotropic scaling of the chiral kdvmovers at the boundary, in which the energy of ads spacetime with our boundaryconditions depends on $z$ and plays the role of the central charge. theextension of our boundary conditions to the case of higher spin gravity and itslink with different classes of integrable systems is also briefly addressed.
