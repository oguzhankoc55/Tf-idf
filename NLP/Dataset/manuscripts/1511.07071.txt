unified dark energy and dust dark matter dual to quadratic purely  kinetic k-essence we consider a modified gravity plus single-scalar-field model, where thescalar lagrangian couples symmetrically both to the standard riemannianvolume-form (spacetime integration measure density) given by the square-root ofthe determinant of the riemannian metric, as well as to another non-riemannianvolume-form in terms of an auxiliary maximal-rank antisymmetric tensor gaugefield. as shown in a previous paper, the pertinent scalar field dynamicsprovides an exact unified description of both dark energy via dynamicalgeneration of a cosmological constant, and dark matter as a "dust" fluid withgeodesic flow as a result of a hidden noether symmetry. here we extend thediscussion by considering a non-trivial modification of the purelygravitational action in the form of f(r) = r - \alpha r^2 generalized gravity.upon deriving the corresponding "einstein-frame" effective action of the lattermodified gravity-scalar-field theory we find explicit duality (in the sense ofweak versus strong coupling) between the original model of unified dynamicaldark energy and dust fluid dark matter, on one hand, and a specific quadraticpurely kinetic "k-essence" gravity-matter model with special dependence of itscoupling constants on only two independent parameters, on the other hand. thecanonical hamiltonian treatment and wheeler-dewitt quantization of the dualpurely kinetic "k-essence" gravity-matter model is also briefly discussed.
