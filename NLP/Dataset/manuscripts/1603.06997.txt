gravity, as a classical regularizator for the higgs field, and the  genesis of rest masses and charge the classical einstein--standard model system with conformally invariantcoupling of the higgs field to gravity is investigated. we show that, while the\emph{structure} of the field equations for the matter fields is not changed bythe conformal coupling, the energy-momentum tensor changes significantly: itwill \emph{not} be polynomial in the higgs field, yielding in the observableuniverse \emph{a finite, universal upper bound} for the pointwise norm of thehiggs field in terms of newton's gravitational constant. this provides anatural cut-off in the field theoretic calculations. the energy-momentum hastwo singularities: in cosmological spacetimes the usual big bang typesingularity with diverging matter field variables, and a second, less violentone (`small bang'), in which it is only the geometry that is singular but thematter field variables remain finite.  in the presence of friedman--robertson--walker symmetries the energy densitycan have finite local minimum only for higgs fields whose norm is less than theupper bound above, and \emph{if the mean curvature of the hypersurface is lessthan a finite critical value}. the corresponding hubble time is about tenplanck times. thus, in the very early era of an expanding universe, \emph{thehiggs sector does not have any symmetry breaking vacuum state, and hence thegauge and spinor fields do not have rest mass and electric charge}. for smallermean curvature symmetry breaking vacuum states of the higgs sector emerge,yielding rest mass and electric charge for some of the gauge and spinor fields.these rest masses are decreasing as the universe is expanding, but the chargeremains constant. similar phenomenon is expected when matter falls into a blackhole: near the singularity deeply behind the event horizon the massiveparticles are expected to lose their rest mass. the model does not contain anyextra field or parameter.
