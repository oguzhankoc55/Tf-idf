weak cosmic censorship, dyonic kerr-newman black holes and dirac fields it was investigated recently, with the aim of testing the weak cosmiccensorship conjecture, whether an extremal kerr black hole can be convertedinto a naked singularity by interaction with a massless classical dirac testfield, and it was found that this is possible. we generalize this result toelectrically and magnetically charged rotating extremal black holes (i.e.extremal dyonic kerr-newman black holes) and massive dirac test fields,allowing magnetically or electrically uncharged or nonrotating black holes andthe massless dirac field as special cases. we show that the possibility of theconversion is a direct consequence of the fact that the einstein-hilbertenergy-momentum tensor of the classical dirac field does not satisfy the nullenergy condition, and is therefore not in contradiction with the weak cosmiccensorship conjecture. we give a derivation of the absence of superradiance ofthe dirac field without making use of the complete separability of the diracequation in dyonic kerr-newman background, and we determine the range ofsuperradiant frequencies of the scalar field. the range of frequencies of thedirac field that can be used to convert a black hole into a naked singularitypartially coincides with the superradiant range of the scalar field. we applyhorizon-penetrating coordinates, as our arguments involve calculatingquantities at the event horizon. we describe the separation of variables forthe dirac equation in these coordinates, although we mostly avoid using it.
