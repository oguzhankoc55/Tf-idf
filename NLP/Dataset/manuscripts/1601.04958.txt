vacua of the gravitational field the poincar\'e invariant vacuum is not unique in quantum gravity. the bmssupertranslation symmetry originally defined at null infinity is spontaneouslybroken and results in inequivalent poincar\'e vacua. in this paper we constructthe unique vacua which interpolate between past and future null infinity in bmsgauge and which are entirely characterized by an arbitary goldstone bosondefined on the sphere which breaks bms invariance. we show that these vacuacontain a defect which carries no poincar\'e charges but which genericallycarries superrotation charges. we argue that there is a huge degeneracy ofvacua with multiple defects. we also present the single defect vacua with itscanonically conjugated source which can be constructed from a liouville bosonon the stereographic plane. we show that positivity of the energy forces thestress-tensor of the boson to vanish as a boundary condition. finitesuperrotations, which turn on the sources, are therefore physically ruled outas canonical transformations around the vacua. yet, infinitesimalsuperrotations are external symplectic symmetries which are associated withconserved charges which characterize the goldstone boson.
