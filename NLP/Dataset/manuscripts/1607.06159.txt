on kottler's path: origin and evolution of the premetric program in  gravity and in electrodynamics in 1922, kottler put forward the program to remove the gravitationalpotential, the metric of spacetime, from the fundamental equations in physicsas far as possible. he successfully applied this idea to newton'sgravitostatics and to maxwell's electrodynamics, where kottler recast the fieldequations in premetric form and specified a metric-dependent constitutive law.we will discuss the basics of the premetric approach and some of its beautifulconsequences, like the division of universal constants into two classes. weshow that classical electrodynamics can be developed without a metric quitestraightforwardly: the maxwell equations, together with a local and linearresponse law for electromagnetic media, admit a consistent premetricformulation. kottler's program succeeds here without provisos. in kottler'sapproach to gravity, making the theory relativistic, two premetricquasi-maxwellian field equations arise, but their field variables, ifinterpreted in terms of general relativity, do depend on the metric. however,one can hope to bring the kottler idea to work by using the teleparallelismequivalent of general relativity, where the gravitational potential, thecoframe, can be chosen in a premetric way.
