the effect of cosmological evolution on solar system constraints and on  the scalarization of neutron stars in massless scalar-tensor theories certain scalar-tensor theories of gravity that generalizejordan-fierz-brans-dicke theory are known to predict non-trivial phenomenologyfor neutron stars. in these theories, first proposed by damour andesposito-far\`ese, the scalar field has a standard kinetic term, and couplesconformally to the matter fields. the weak equivalence principle is thereforesatisfied, but scalar effects may arise in strong-field regimes, e.g. allowingfor violations of the strong equivalence principle in neutron stars("spontaneous scalarization") or in sufficiently tight binary neutron-starsystems ("dynamical/induced scalarization"). the original scalar-tensor theoryproposed by damour and esposito-far\`ese is in tension with solar-systemconstraints (for couplings that lead to scalarization), if one accounts forcosmological evolution of the scalar field and no mass term is included in theaction. we here extend the conformal coupling of that theory, in order toascertain if, in this way, solar-system tests can be passed, while retaining anon-trivial phenomenology for neutron stars. we find that even with thisgeneralized conformal coupling, it is impossible to construct a theory thatpasses both big-bang nucleosynthesis and solar-system constraints, whilesimultaneously allowing for scalarization in isolated/binary neutron stars.
