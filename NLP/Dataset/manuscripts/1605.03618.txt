viscous extended holographic ricci dark energy in the framework of  standard eckart theory in the present work we report a study on the viscous extended holographicricci dark energy (ehrde) model under the assumption of existence of bulkviscosity in the linear barotropic fluid and the ehrde in the framework ofstandard eckart theory of relativistic irreversible thermodynamics and it hasbeen observed that the non-equilibrium bulk viscous pressure is significantlysmaller than the local equilibrium pressure. we have studied the equation ofstate (eos) parameter and observed that the eos behaves like "quintom" and isconsistent with the constraints set by observational data sets from snls3, baoand planck + wmap9 + wigglez measurements in the reference s. kumar and l. xu,\emph{phys. lett. b},\textbf{737}, 244 (2014). analysis of statefinderparameters has shown the possibility of attainment of $\lambda$cdm phase undercurrent model and at the same time it has been pointed out that the for $z=0$i.e. current universe, the statefinder pair is different from that of$\lambda$cdm and the $\lambda$cdm can be attained in a later stage of theuniverse. an analysis of stability has shown that although the viscous ehrdealong with viscous barotropic is classically unstable in the present epoch, itcan lead to a stable universe in very late stage. considering an universeenveloped by event horizon we have observed validity of generalized second lawof thermodynamics.
