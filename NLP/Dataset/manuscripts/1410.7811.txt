bending branes for dcft in two dimensions we consider a holographic dual model for defect conformal field theories(dcft) in which we include the backreaction of the defect on the dual geometry.in particular, we consider a dual gravity system in which a two-dimensionalhypersurface with matter fields, the brane, is embedded into athree-dimensional asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetime. motivated by recentproposals for holographic duals of boundary conformal field theories (bcft), weassume the geometry of the brane to be determined by israel junctionconditions. we show that these conditions are intimately related to the energyconditions for the brane matter fields, and explain how these energy conditionsconstrain the possible geometries. this has implications for the holographicentanglement entropy in particular. moreover, we give exact analyticalsolutions for the case where the matter content of the brane is a perfectfluid, which in a particular case corresponds to a free massless scalar field.finally, we describe how our results may be particularly useful for extending arecent proposal for a holographic kondo model.
