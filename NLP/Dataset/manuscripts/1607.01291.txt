thermodynamics of relativistic quantum fields: extracting energy from  gravitational waves we investigate the quantum thermodynamical properties of localisedrelativistic quantum fields that can be used as quantum thermal machines. westudy the efficiency and power of energy transfer between the classical degreesof freedom, such as the energy input due to motion or to an impinginggravitational wave, and the excitations of the confined quantum field. we findthat the efficiency of energy transfer depends dramatically on the inputinitial state of the system. furthermore, we investigate the ability to extractthe energy and to store it in a battery. this process is inefficient in opticalcavities but is significantly enhanced when employing trapped bose einsteincondensates. finally, we apply our techniques to a setup where an impinginggravitational wave excites the phononic modes of a bose einstein condensate. wefind that, in this case, the amount of energy transfer to the phonons increaseswith time and approaches unity for low temperatures. these results suggestthat, in the future, it might be possible to explore ways to exploitrelativistic phenomena to harvest energy.
