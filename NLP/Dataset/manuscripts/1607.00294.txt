testing lorentz symmetry with lunar laser ranging lorentz symmetry violations can be parametrized by an effective field theoryframework that contains both general relativity (gr) and the standard model ofparticle physics called the standard-model extension (sme). we present newconstraints on pure gravity sme coefficients obtained by analyzing lunar laserranging (llr) observations. we use a new numerical lunar ephemeris computed inthe sme framework and we perform a llr data analysis using a set of 20721normal points covering the period august 1969 to december 2013. we emphasizethat linear combination of sme coefficients to which llr data are sensitive arenot the same as those fitted in previous post-fit residuals analysis using llrobservations and based on theoretical grounds. we found no evidence for lorentzviolation at the level of $10^{-8}$ for $\bar{s}^{tx}$, $10^{-12}$ for$\bar{s}^{xy}$ and $\bar{s}^{xz}$, $10^{-11}$ for $\bar{s}^{xx}-\bar{s}^{yy}$and $\bar{s}^{xx}+\bar{s}^{yy}-2\bar{s}^{zz}-0.045\bar{s}^{yz}$ and $10^{-9}$for $\bar{s}^{ty}+0.43\bar{s}^{tz}$. we improve previous constraints on smecoefficient by a factor up to 5 and 800 compared to post-fit residuals analysisof respectively binary pulsars and llr observations.
