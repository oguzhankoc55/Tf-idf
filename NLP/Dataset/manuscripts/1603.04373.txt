critical collapse of rotating radiation fluids we present results from the first fully relativistic simulations of thecritical collapse of rotating radiation fluids. we observe critical scalingboth in subcritical evolutions, in which case the fluid disperses to infinityand leaves behind flat space, and in supercritical evolutions that lead to theformation of black holes. we measure the mass and angular momentum of theseblack holes, and find that both show critical scaling with critical exponentsthat are consistent with perturbative results. the critical exponents areuniversal; they are not affected by angular momentum, and are independent ofthe direction in which the critical curve, which separates subcritical fromsupercritical evolutions in our two-dimensional parameter space, is crossed. inparticular, these findings suggest that the angular momentum decreases morerapidly than the square of the mass, so that, as criticality is approached, thecollapse leads to the formation of a non-spinning black hole. we alsodemonstrate excellent agreement of our numerical data with new closed-formextensions of power-law scalings that describe the mass and angular momentum ofrotating black holes formed close to criticality.
