massive charged btz black holes in asymptotically (a)ds spacetimes motivated by recent developments of btz black holes and interesting resultsof massive gravity, we investigate massive btz black holes in the presence ofmaxwell and born-infeld (bi) electrodynamics. we study geometrical propertiessuch as type of singularity and asymptotical behavior as well as thermodynamicstructure of the solutions through canonical ensemble. we show that despite theexistence of massive term, obtained solutions are asymptotically (a)ds and havea curvature singularity at the origin. then, we regard varying cosmologicalconstant and examine the van der waals like behavior of the solutions inextended phase space. in addition, we employ geometrical thermodynamicapproaches and show that using weinhold, ruppeiner and quevedo metrics leads toexistence of ensemble dependency while hpem metric yields consistent picture.for neutral solutions, it will be shown that generalization to massive gravityleads to the presence of non-zero temperature and heat capacity for vanishinghorizon radius. such behavior is not observed for linearly charged solutionswhile generalization to nonlinearly one recovers this property.
