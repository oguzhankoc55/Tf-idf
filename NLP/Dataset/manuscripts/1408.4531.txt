examining a covariant and renormalizable quantum field theory in de  sitter space by studying "black hole radiation" respecting that any consistent quantum field theory in curved space-time mustinclude black hole radiation, in this paper, we examine the krein-gupta-bleuler(kgb) formalism as an inevitable quantization scheme in order to follow theguideline of the covariance of minimally coupled massless scalar field andlinear gravity on de sitter (ds) background in the sense ofwightman-g\"{a}rding approach, by investigating thermodynamical aspects ofblack holes. the formalism is interestingly free of pathological large distancebehavior. in this construction, also, no infinite term appears in thecalculation of expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor (we have anautomatic and covariant renormalization) which results in the vacuum energy ofthe free field vanishes. however, the existence of an effective potentialbarrier, intrinsically created by black holes gravitational field, gives acasimir-type contribution to the vacuum expectation value of theenergy-momentum tensor. on this basis, by evaluating the casimirenergy-momentum tensor for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in thevicinity of a non-rotating black hole event horizon through the kgbquantization, in this work, we explicitly prove that the hole producesblack-body radiation which its temperature exactly coincides with the resultobtained by hawking for black hole radiation.
