a consistent and unified picture for critical phenomena of $f(r)$ ads  black holes a consistent and unified picture for critical phenomena of charged ads blackholes in $f(r)$ gravity is drawn in this paper. firstly, we investigate thephase transition in canonical ensemble. we derive the explicit solutionscorresponding to the divergence of $c_q$. the two solutions merge into one whenthe condition $q_c=\sqrt{\frac{-1}{3r_0}}$ is satisfied. the curve of specificheat for $q&lt;q_c$ has two divergent points and can be divided into threeregions. both the large radius region and the small radius region arethermodynamically stable with positive specific heat while the medium radiusregion is unstable with negative specific heat. however, when $q&gt;q_c$, thespecific heat is always positive, implying the black holes are locally stableand no phase transition will take place. secondly, both the $t-r_+$ curve and$t-s$ curve $f(r)$ ads black holes are investigated and they exhibit van dervaals like behavior as the $p-v$ curve in the former research. criticalphysical quantities are obtained and they are consistent with those derivedfrom the specific heat analysis. we carry out numerical check of maxwell equalarea law for the cases $q=0.2q_c, 0.4q_c, 0.6q_c, 0.8q_c$. the relative errorsare amazingly small and can be negligible. so the maxwell equal area law holdsfor $t-s$ curve of $f(r)$ black holes. thirdly, we establishgeometrothermodynamics for $f(r)$ ads black hole to examine the phasestructure. it is shown that the legendre invariant scalar curvature$\mathfrak{r}$ would diverge exactly where the specific heat diverges. tosummarize, the above three perspectives are consistent with each other, thusproviding a unified picture which deepens the understanding of criticalphenomena of $f(r)$ ads black holes.
