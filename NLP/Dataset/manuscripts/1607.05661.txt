validating the effective-one-body model of spinning, precessing binary  black holes against numerical relativity in ref. [1], the properties of the first gravitational wave detected by ligo,gw150914, were measured by employing an effective-one-body (eob) model ofprecessing binary black holes whose underlying dynamics and waveforms werecalibrated to numerical-relativity (nr) simulations. here, we perform the firstextensive comparison of such eobnr model to 70 precessing nr waveforms thatspan mass ratios from 1 to 5, dimensionless spin magnitudes up to 0.5, genericspin orientations, and length of about 20 orbits. we work in the observer'sinertial frame and include all $\ell=2$ modes in the gravitational-wavepolarizations. we introduce new prescriptions for the eob ringdown signalconcerning its spectrum and time of onset. for total masses between 10msun and200msun, we find that precessing eobnr waveforms have unfaithfulness withinabout 3% to nr waveforms when considering the advanced-ligo design noise curve.this result is obtained without recalibration of the inspiral-plunge of theunderlying nonprecessing eobnr model. the unfaithfulness is computed withmaximization over time and phase of arrival, sky location and polarization ofthe eobnr waveform and it is averaged over sky location and polarization of thenr signal. we also present comparisons between nr and eobnr waveforms in aframe that tracks the orbital precession.
