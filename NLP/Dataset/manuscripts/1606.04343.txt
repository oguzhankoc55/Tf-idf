static solutions in general relativity with infinite central density this paper presents full general relativistic simulations of uniformlyrotating polytropes. a logarithm is taken of the radial coordinate, whichenables the study of more static solutions than previously possible. inparticular, static solutions out to the limit of infinite central energydensity are found for a range of adiabatic exponents. the analytic behavior forlarge central energy density near the origin is determined by solvingeinstein's equations in spherical symmetry assuming the pressure isproportional to the energy; this agrees well with the numerical results. theallowed space of static solutions, which extends from zero central energydensity to infinity, is bounded at low adiabatic exponents as gravity loses itsability to bind the matter (the radius and mass go to infinity). the stabilityof the solution space is studied in the case of spherical symmetry. in additionto the usual region of stability bounded by low central energy densities, wefind two other separate possible regions of stability with small adiabaticexponents and larger central energy densities.
