gravitational wave detection with optical lattice atomic clocks we propose a space-based gravitational wave detector consisting of twospatially separated, drag-free satellites sharing ultra-stable optical laserlight over a single baseline. each satellite contains an optical lattice atomicclock, which serves as a sensitive, narrowband detector of the local frequencyof the shared laser light. a synchronized two-clock comparison between thesatellites will be sensitive to the effective doppler shifts induced byincident gravitational waves (gws) at a level competitive with other proposedspace-based gw detectors, while providing complementary features. the detectedsignal is a differential frequency shift of the shared laser light due to therelative velocity of the satellites, rather than a phase shift arising from therelative satellite positions, and the detection window can be tuned through thecontrol sequence applied to the atoms' internal states. this scheme enables thedetection of gws from continuous, spectrally narrow sources, such as compactbinary inspirals, with frequencies ranging from ~3 mhz - 10 hz without loss ofsensitivity, thereby bridging the detection gap between space-based andterrestrial gw detectors. our proposed gw detector employs just two satellites,is compatible with integration with an optical interferometric detector, andrequires only realistic improvements to existing ground-based clock and lasertechnologies.
