a dark energy model with higher derivatives of h in the framework of  chameleon brans-dicke cosmology in this paper, we study some relevant cosmological features of a dark energy(de) model which is function of the hubble parameter $h$ and its first andsecond time derivatives in the framework of chameleon brans-dicke (bd)cosmology. choosing a particular ansatz for some of the quantities involved, wederive the expressions of some important cosmological quantities, like theequation of state (eos) parameter of de $w_d$, the effective eos parameter$w_{eff}$, the pressure of de $p_d$ and the deceleration parameter $q$.moreover, we study the behavior of statefinder parameters $r$ and $s$, of thecosmographic parameters $j$, $s_{cosmo}$, $l$ and $m$ and of the squared speedof the sound $v_s^2$ for both case corresponding to non interacting andinteracting dark sectors. we also plot the quantities we have derived and wecalculate their values for $t\rightarrow 0$ (i.e. for the beginning of theuniverse history), for $t\rightarrow \infty$ (i.e. for far future) and for thepresent time, indicated with $t_0$.
