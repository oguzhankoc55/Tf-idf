group cohomology of the poincare group and invariant quantum states recently there has been an increasing emphasis on completing dirac's agendafor quantum field theory through the development of completely finite theories,removing the need for renormalisation processes. a key reason for this is thedifficulty of applying such processes to gravity which is inherently self-interacting and non-renormalisable. additional problems include the currentneed for high-levels of fine tuning to avoid quadratic divergences in higgsmass corrections. if supersymmetry applies, the mass-energies of thesuperpartners (if they exist) are possibly much larger than initially thoughtand limit their ability to control loop divergence. this leaves open thepossibility of other approaches such as noncommutative geometry, incorporatingfibre bundle theory. the aim of this paper is to consider these existing `lowenergy' theories incorporating gravity beyond the standard model and to developa coherent mathematical framework based on modern quantum field theory. anumber of new ideas have emerged from this, including the role of `quantumoperator algebras' and states of the algebra of observables which are poincareinvariant.
