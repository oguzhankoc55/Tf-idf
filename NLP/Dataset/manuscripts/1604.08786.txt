impact of topology in causal dynamical triangulations quantum gravity we investigate the impact of spatial topology in 3+1 dimensional causaldynamical triangulations (cdt) by performing numerical simulations withtoroidal spatial topology instead of the previously used spherical topology. inthe case of spherical spatial topology we observed in the so-called phase c anaverage spatial volume distribution n(t) which after a suitable timeredefinition could be identified as the spatial volume distribution of thefour-sphere. imposing toroidal spatial topology we find that the averagespatial volume distribution n(t) is constant. by measuring the covariancematrix of spatial volume fluctuations we determine the form of the effectiveaction. the difference compared to the spherical case is that the effectivepotential has changed such that it allows a constant average n(t). this is whatwe observe and this is what one would expect from a minisuperspace gr actionwhere only the scale factor is kept as dynamical variable. although nobackground geometry is put in by hand, the full quantum theory of cdt is alsowith toroidal spatial toplogy able to identify a classical background geometryaround which there are well defined quantum fluctuations.
