"regularity singularities" and the scattering of gravity waves in  approximate locally inertial frames it is an open question whether solutions of the einstein-euler equations aresmooth enough to admit locally inertial coordinates at points of shock waveinteraction, or whether "regularity singularities" can exist at such points.the term {\it regularity singularity} was proposed by the authors as a point inspacetime where the gravitational metric tensor is lipschitz continuous($c^{0,1}$), but no smoother, in any coordinate system of the $c^{1,1}$ atlas.an existence theory for shock wave solutions in $c^{0,1}$ admitting arbitraryinteractions has been proven for the einstein-euler equations in sphericallysymmetric spacetimes, but $c^{1,1}$ is the requisite smoothness required forspace-time to be locally flat. thus the open problem of regularitysingularities is the problem as to whether locally inertial coordinate systemsexist at shock waves within the larger $c^{1,1}$ atlas. to clarify this openproblem, we identify new "coriolis type" effects in the geometry of $c^{0,1}$shock wave metrics and prove they are essential in the sense that they cannever be made to vanish within the atlas of {\it smooth} coordinatetransformations, the atlas usually assumed in classical differential geometry.thus the problem of existence of regularity singularities is equivalent to thequestion as to whether or not these coriolis type effects are essentiallynon-removable and `real', or merely coordinate effects that can be removed, (inanalogy to classical coriolis forces), by going to the less regular atlas of$c^{1,1}$ transformations. if essentially non-removable, it would arguestrongly for a `real' new physical effect for general relativity, providing aphysical context to the open problem of regularity singularities.
