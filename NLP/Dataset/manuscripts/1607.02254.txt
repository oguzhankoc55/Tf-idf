exact solutions to einstein's equations in the (2+2) hamiltonian  reduction this paper illustrates a new method of finding exact solutions to theeinstein's equations obtained by the hamiltonian reduction based in the (2+2)formalism. in this hamiltonian reduction, the einstein's equations are writtenin the privileged spacetime coordinates, where the area element of the2-dimensional cross-section of an out-going null hypersurface is used as aphysical time, and spatial coordinates are chosen as suitable functions on thephase space of gravitational fields. the hamiltonian constraint is solved todefine a non-vanishing gravitational hamiltonian in terms of conformal twometric and its conjugate momentum, which dictates the evolutions of theconformal two metric and its conjugate in the physical time. the momentumconstraints are also solved to express local momentum densities ofgravitational fields in the canonical form. explicitly, we find two exactsolutions to the einstein's equations in the privileged coordinates usingansatz, and show that they are just the einstein-rosen wave and theschwarzschild solution by making suitable coordinate transformations to thestandard coordinates.
