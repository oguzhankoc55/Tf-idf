exploring extra dimensions with scalar waves this paper provides a pedagogical introduction to the physics of extradimensions focussing on the add, randall-sundrum and dgp models. in each ofthese models, the familiar particles and fields of the standard model areassumed to be confined to a four dimensional space-time called the brane; thebrane is a slice through a higher dimensional space-time called the bulk. thegeometry of the add, randall-sundrum and dgp space-times is described and therelation between randall-sundrum and anti-de-sitter space-time is explained.the necessary differential geometry background is introduced in an appendixthat presumes no greater mathematical preparation than multivariable calculus.the ordinary wave equation and the klein-gordon equation are briefly reviewedfollowed by an analysis of the propagation of scalar waves in the bulk in allthree extra-dimensional models. we also calculate the scalar field produced bya static point source located on the brane for all three models. for the addand randall-sundrum models at large distances the field looks like that of apoint source in four space-time dimensions but at short distances it crossesover to a form appropriate to the higher dimensional space-time. for the dgpmodel the field has the higher dimensional form at long distances rather thanshort. the scalar field results provide qualitative insights into thecorresponding behavior of gravitational fields. in particular the explanationwithin the add and randall-sundrum model of the weakness of gravity compared toother forces is discussed as are the implications of the two models forcolliders and other experiments.
