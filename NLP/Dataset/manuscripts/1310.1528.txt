gravitational radiation from post-newtonian sources and inspiralling  compact binaries to be observed and analyzed by the network of gravitational wave detectors onground (ligo, virgo, etc.) and by the future detectors in space (lisa, etc.),inspiralling compact binaries --- binary star systems composed of neutron starsand/or black holes in their late stage of evolution --- require high-accuracytemplates predicted by general relativity theory. the gravitational wavesemitted by these very relativistic systems can be accurately modelled using ahigh-order post-newtonian gravitational wave generation formalism. in thisarticle, we present the current state of the art on post-newtonian methods asapplied to the dynamics and gravitational radiation of general matter sources(including the radiation reaction back onto the source) and inspirallingcompact binaries. we describe the post-newtonian equations of motion, inlagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms, pay attention to the self-fieldregularizations at work, discuss several notions of innermost circular orbitsand make comparisons with numerical gravitational self-force computations. thegravitational waveform and energy flux are obtained with high post-newtonianprecision. some landmark results are discussed in the case of eccentric compactbinaries moving on quasi-elliptical orbits, and on spin-orbit coupling effectsin black hole binaries.
