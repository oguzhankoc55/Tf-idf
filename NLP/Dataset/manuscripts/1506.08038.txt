the massive dirac equation in kerr geometry: separability in  eddington-finkelstein-type coordinates and asymptotics the separability of the massive dirac equation in a rotating kerr black holebackground in horizon-penetrating advanced eddington-finkelstein-typecoordinates is shown. to this end, the kerr spacetime is described in theframework of the newman-penrose formalism by a local carter tetrad, and thedirac wave functions are given on a spin bundle in a chiral newman-penrose dyadrepresentation. applying mode analysis techniques, the dirac equation isseparated into coupled systems of radial and angular ordinary differentialequations. asymptotic radial solutions at infinity and the event and cauchyhorizons are explicitly derived and, by means of error estimates, the decayproperties are analyzed. solutions of the angular ordinary differentialequations matching the chandrasekhar-page equation are discussed. thesesolutions are used in order to study the scattering of dirac waves by thegravitational field of a kerr black hole. this work provides the basis for ahamiltonian formulation of the massive dirac equation in a kerr background inhorizon-penetrating coordinates, for the spectral theory of the correspondingdirac hamiltonian, and for the construction of an integral representation ofthe dirac propagator.
