phase transition and thermodynamic geometry of $f(r)$ ads black holes in  the grand canonical ensemble the phase transition of four-dimensional charged ads black hole solution inthe $r+f(r)$ gravity with constant curvature is investigated in the grandcanonical ensemble, where we find novel characteristics quite different fromthat in canonical ensemble. there exists no critical point for $t-s$ curvewhile in former research critical point was found for both the $t-s$ curve and$t-r_+$ curve when the electric charge of $f(r)$ black holes is kept fixed.moreover, we derive the explicit expression for the specific heat, the analogof volume expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility coefficient whenthe electric potential of $f(r)$ ads black hole is fixed. the specific heat$c_\phi$ encounters a divergence when $0&lt;\phi&lt;b$ while there is no divergencefor the case $\phi&gt;b$. this finding also differs from the result in thecanonical ensemble, where there may be two, one or no divergence points for thespecific heat $c_q$. to examine the phase structure newly found in the grandcanonical ensemble, we appeal to the well-known thermodynamic geometry toolsand derive the analytic expressions for both the weinhold scalar curvature andruppeiner scalar curvature. it is shown that they diverge exactly where thespecific heat $c_\phi$ diverges.
