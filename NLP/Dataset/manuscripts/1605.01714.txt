exploring the propagation of relativistic quantum wavepackets in the  trajectory-based formulation in the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, gaussian wavepacketsolutions of the time-dependent schr\"odinger equation provide useful physicalinsight. this is not the case for relativistic quantum mechanics, however, forwhich both the klein-gordon and dirac wave equations result in strange andcounterintuitive wavepacket behaviors, even for free-particle gaussians. thesebehaviors include zitterbewegung and other interference effects. as a potentialremedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantummechanics, in which the wavefunction plays no role [phys. rev. x, 4, 040002(2014)]. quantum states are represented as ensembles of trajectories, whosemutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed innature---suggesting a "many interacting worlds" interpretation. it is shownthat the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulationresults in well-behaved free-particle gaussian wavepacket solutions. inparticular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, andits spatial integral is conserved over time---in any inertial frame. finally,the ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path throughspacetime. in this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativisticquantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.
