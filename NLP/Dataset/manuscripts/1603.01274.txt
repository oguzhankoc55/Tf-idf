scale invariant alternatives to general relativity. ii. dilaton  properties in the present paper, we revisit gravitational theories which are invariantunder tdiffs -- transverse (volume preserving) diffeomorphisms and global scaletransformations. it is known that these theories can be rewritten in anequivalent diffeomorphism-invariant form with an action including anintegration constant (cosmological constant for the particular case ofnon-scale-invariant unimodular gravity). the presence of this integrationconstant, in general, breaks explicitly scale invariance and induces a runawaypotential for the (otherwise massless) dilaton, associated with the determinantof the metric tensor. we show, however, that if the metric carries massdimension $\left[\text{gev}\right]^{-2}$, the scale invariance of the system ispreserved, unlike the situation in theories in which the metric has massdimension different from $-2$. the dilaton remains massless and couples toother fields only through derivatives, without any conflict with observations.we observe that one can define a specific limit for fields and theirderivatives (in particular, the dilaton goes to zero, potentially related tothe small distance domain of the theory) in which the only singular terms inthe action correspond to the higgs mass and the cosmological constant. wespeculate that the self-consistency of the theory may require the regularity ofthe action, leading to the absence of the bare higgs mass and cosmologicalconstant, whereas their small finite values may be generated by nonperturbativeeffects.
