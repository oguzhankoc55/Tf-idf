canonical quantum gravity on noncommutative spacetime in this paper canonical quantum gravity on noncommutative space-time isconsidered. the corresponding generalized classical theory is formulated byusing the moyal star product, which enables the representation of the fieldquantities depending on noncommuting coordinates by generalized quantitiesdepending on usual coordinates. but not only the classical theory has to begeneralized in analogy to other field theories. besides, the necessity arisesto replace the commutator between the gravitational field operator and itscanonical conjugated quantity by a corresponding generalized expression onnoncommutative space-time. accordingly the transition to the quantum theory hasalso to be performed in a generalized way and leads to extended representationsof the quantum theoretical operators. if the generalized representations of theoperators are inserted to the generalized constraints, one obtains thecorresponding generalized quantum constraints including the hamiltonianconstraint as dynamical constraint. after considering quantum geometrodynamicsunder incorporation of a coupling to matter fields, the theory is transferredto the ashtekar formalism. the holonomy representation of the gravitationalfield as it is used in loop quantum gravity opens the possibility to calculatethe corresponding generalized area operator.
