emergence and oscillation of cosmic space by joining m1-branes recently, it has been proposed by padmanabhan that the difference between thenumber of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and the number of degreesof freedom in a bulk region leads to the expansion of the universe. now, anatural question arises, how this model could explain the oscillation ofuniverse between contraction and expansion branches? we try to address thisissue in the framework of bionic system. in this model, $m0$-branes join toeach other and give rise to a pair of $m1$-anti-$m1$-branes. the fields whichlive on these branes play the roles of massive gravitons that cause theemergence of a wormhole between them and formation of a bion system. thiswormhole dissolves into m1-branes and causes a divergence between the number ofdegrees of freedom on the boundary surface of $m1$ and the bulk leading to anexpansion of $m1$-branes. when $m1$-branes become close to each other, thesquare energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic statesemerge. to removes these states, $m1$-branes compact, the sign of compactedgravity changes, causing the arising of anti-gravity: in this case, branes getaway from each other. by articulating $m1$-bions, an m3-brane and ananti-$m3$-brane are created and connected by three wormholes forming an$m3$-bion. this new system behaves like the initial system and by closingbranes to each other, they compact and, by getting away from each other, theyopen. our universe is located on one of these m3-branes and, by compacting$m3$-brane, it contracts and, by opening it, it expands.
