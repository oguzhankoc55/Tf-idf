holographic bound in covariant loop quantum gravity we investigate puncture statistics based on the covariant area spectrum inloop quantum gravity. first, we consider maxwell-boltzmann statistics with agibbs factor for punctures. we establish formulae which relate physicalquantities such as horizon area to the parameter characterizing holographicdegrees of freedom. we also perform numerical calculations and obtainconsistency with these formulae. these results tell us that the holographicbound is satisfied in the large area limit and correction term of theentropy-area law can be proportional to the logarithm of the horizon area.second, we also consider bose-einstein statistics and show that the aboveformulae are also useful in this case. by applying the formulae, we canunderstand intrinsic features of bose-einstein condensate which corresponds tothe case when the horizon area almost consists of punctures in the groundstate. when this phenomena occurs, the area is approximately constant againstthe parameter characterizing the temperature. when this phenomena is broken,the area shows rapid increase which suggests the phase transition from quantumto classical area.
