waveforms in massive gravity and neutralization of giant black hole  ringings a distorted black hole radiates gravitational waves in order to settle downin a smoother geometry. during that relaxation phase, a characteristic dampedringing is generated. it can be theoretically constructed from both the blackhole quasinormal frequencies (which govern its oscillating behavior and itsdecay) and the associated excitation factors (which determine intrinsically itsamplitude) by carefully taking into account the source of the distortion. inthe framework of massive gravity, the excitation factors of the schwarzschildblack hole have an unexpected strong resonant behavior which, theoretically,could lead to giant and slowly decaying ringings. if massive gravity isrelevant to physics, one can hope to observe these extraordinary ringings byusing the next generations of gravitational wave detectors. indeed, they couldbe generated by supermassive black holes if the graviton mass is not too small.in fact, by focusing on the odd-parity $\ell=1$ mode of the fierz-pauli field,we shall show here that such ringings are neutralized in waveforms due to (i)the excitation of the quasibound states of the black hole and (ii) theevanescent nature of the particular partial modes which could excite theconcerned quasinormal modes. despite this, with observational consequences inmind, it is interesting to note that the waveform amplitude is neverthelessrather pronounced and slowly decaying (this effect is now due to the long-livedquasibound states). it is worth noting also that, for very low values of thegraviton mass (corresponding to the weak instability regime for the blackhole), the waveform is now very clean and dominated by an ordinary ringingwhich could be used as a signature of massive gravity.
