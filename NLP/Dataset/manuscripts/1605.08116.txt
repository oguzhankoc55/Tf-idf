elastic instability of black rings at large d using the inverse dimensional expansion method we study the elasticinstability of black rings found recently in numerical analysis of fullynonlinear dynamical evolutions. in our analysis we should perform 1/d^1/2expansions, not usual 1/d expansions, of the einstein equations to capture thiselastic instability of d dimensional black rings. by solving the einsteinequations at large d we obtain the effective equations for black rings, and theperturbation analysis of the large d effective equations with 1/d^1/2expansions yields the formula for quasinormal mode frequencies. from thisformula, we find that black rings actually suffer from both elastic andgregory-laflamme like instabilities. these instabilities are coupled and appearat the same time as observed in numerical analysis. the elastic instabilitydoes disappear at the infinite limit of a ring radius, which implies that the(boosted) black string is stable to elastic perturbations. furthermore weobserve that the gregory-laflamme like instability becomes more efficient thanthe elastic instability even for certain thin black rings in enough higherdimensions.
