quantum theory from questions we reconstruct the explicit formalism of qubit quantum theory from elementaryrules on an observer's information acquisition. our approach is purelyoperational: we consider an observer o interrogating a system s with binaryquestions and define s's state as o's `catalogue of knowledge' about s. fromthe rules we derive the state spaces for n elementary systems and show that (a)they coincide with the set of density matrices over an n-qubit hilbert space;(b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\rm{psu}(2^n)$ according to thevon neumann evolution equation; and (c) o's binary questions correspond toprojective pauli operator measurements with outcome probabilities given by theborn rule. as a by-product, this results in a novel formulation of quantumtheory. besides offering an informational explanation for the theory'sarchitecture, the reconstruction also unravels new structural insights. we showthat, in a derived quadratic information measure, (d) qubits satisfyinequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutuallycomplementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutuallycomplementary questions for one and two qubits must carry 1 bit of informationin pure states. the latter relations constitute conserved informational chargeswhich define the unitary groups and, together with their conservationconditions, the sets of pure states. these results highlight information as a`charge of quantum theory' and the benefits of this informational approach.they emphasize the sufficiency of restricting to an observer's information toreconstruct the theory. this article completes the work started inarxiv:1412.8323.
