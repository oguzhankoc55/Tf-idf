profiled spectral lines generated by keplerian discs orbiting in the  bardeen and ayon-beato-garcia spacetimes shape and frequency-shift map of direct and indirect images of kepleriandiscs orbiting in bardeen and ayon-beato-garcia (abg) black hole and no-horizonspacetimes are determined. then profiles of spectral lines generated in theinnermost parts of the keplerian discs in the bardeen and abg spacetimes areconstructed. the frequency-shift maps and profiled spectral lines are comparedto those generated in the field of schwarzschild black holes and possibleobservationally relevant signatures of the regular black hole and no-horizonspacetimes are discussed. we demonstrate that differences relative to theschwarzschild spacetimes are for the no-horizon spacetimes much more profoundin comparison to the regular black hole spacetimes and increase with increasingcharge parameter of the spacetime. the differences are stronger for small andlarge inclination angles than for mediate ones. for the no-horizon spacetimes,the differences enable to distinguish the bardeen and abg spacetime, ifinclination angle to the distant observer is known. we also show thatcontribution of the so called ghost images to the profiled lines increases withincreasing charge parameter of the spacetimes.
