reconstruction, thermodynamics and stability of $\lambda$cdm model in  $f(t,\mathcal{t})$ gravity we reconstruct the $\lambda$cdm model for $f(t,\mathcal{t})$ theory, where$t$ is the torsion scalar and $\mathcal{t}$ the trace of the energy-momentumtensor. the result shows that the action of $\lambda$cdm is a combination of alinear term, a constant ($-2\lambda$) and a non-linear term given by theproduct $\sqrt{-t}f_g\left[(t^{1/3}/16\pi g)\left(16\pig\mathcal{t}+t+8\lambda\right)\right]$, with $f_g$ being a generic function. weshow that to maintain conservation of energy-momentum tensor should impose that$f_g[y]$ must be linear on the trace $\mathcal{t}$. this reconstruction decaysin the $f(t)$ theory for $f_g\equiv q$, with $q$ a constant. our reconstructiondescribes the cosmological eras to the present time. the model presentstability within the geometric and matter perturbations for the choice $f_g=y$,where $y=(t^{1/3}/16\pi g)\left(16\pi g\mathcal{t}+t+8\lambda\right)$, exceptfor geometric part to de sitter model. we impose the first and second laws ofthermodynamics to the $\lambda$cdm and find the condition where they aresatisfied, that is, $t_a,g_{eff}&gt;0$, however where this is not possible forcases where we choose, leading to a breakdown of positive entropy andmisner-sharp energy.
