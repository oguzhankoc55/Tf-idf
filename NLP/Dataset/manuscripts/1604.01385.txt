the consistent histories approach to loop quantum cosmology we review the application of the consistent (or decoherent) historiesformulation of quantum theory to canonical loop quantum cosmology. conventionalquantum theory relies crucially on "measurements" to convert unrealized quantumpotentialities into physical outcomes that can be assigned probabilities. inthe early universe and other physical contexts in which there are no observersor measuring apparatus (or indeed, in any closed quantum system), what criteriadetermine which alternative outcomes may be realized and what theirprobabilities are? in the consistent histories formulation it is the vanishingof interference between the branch wave functions describing alternativehistories -- as determined by the system's decoherence functional -- thatdetermines which alternatives may be assigned probabilities. we describe theconsistent histories formulation and how it may be applied to canonical loopquantum cosmology, describing in detail the application to homogeneous andisotropic cosmological models with scalar matter. we show how the theory may beused to make definite physical predictions in the absence of "observers". as anapplication, we demonstrate how the theory predicts that loop quantum models"bounce" from large volume to large volume, while conventional"wheeler-dewitt"-quantized universes are invariably singular. we also brieflyindicate the relation to other work.
