asymptotic gravitational wave fluxes from a spinning particle in  circular equatorial orbits around a rotating black hole we present a new computation of the asymptotic gravitational wave energyfluxes emitted by a {\it spinning} particle in circular equatorial orbits abouta kerr black hole. the particle dynamics is computed in the pole-dipoleapproximation, solving the mathisson-papapetrou equations with the tulczyjewspin-supplementary-condition. the fluxes are computed, for the first time, bysolving the 2+1 teukolsky equation in the time-domain using hyperboloidal andhorizon-penetrating coordinates. denoting by $m$ the black hole mass and by$\mu$ the particle mass, we cover dimensionless background spins$a/m=(0,\pm0.9)$ and dimensionless particle spins $-0.9\leq s/\mu^2 \leq +0.9$.our results span orbits of boyer-lindquist coordinate radii $4\leq r/m \leq30$; notably, we investigate the strong-field regime, in some cases even beyondthe last-stable-orbit. we confirm, numerically, the tanaka {\it et al.} [phys.\rev.\ d 54, 3762] 2.5th order accurate post-newtonian (pn) predictions for thegravitational wave fluxes of a spinning particle in circular equatorial orbit:we find an unambiguos trend of the pn-prediction towards the numerical resultswhen $r$ is large. at $r/m=30$ the fractional agreement between the fullnumerical flux, approximated as the sum over the modes $m=1,2,3$, and the pnprediction is $\lesssim0.5\%$ in all cases tested. this is close to ourfractional numerical accuracy ($\sim 0.2\%$). for smaller radii, the agreementbetween the 2.5pn prediction and the numerical result progressivelydeteriorates. our numerical data will be essential to develop suitably resummedexpressions of the 2.5pn analytical fluxes in order to improve their accuracyin the strong-field regime.
