bimetric qed we study, as a model of lorentz symmetry breaking, the quantisation andrenormalisation of an extension of qed in a flat spacetime where the photonsand electrons propagate differently and do not share the same lightcone. wewill refer to this model as bimetric qed (bimqed). as a preliminary we discussthe formulation of electrodynamics in a pre-metric formalism showingnevertheless that there is, on the basis of a simple criteron, a preferredmetric. arising from this choice of metric is a weyl-like tensor (wlt). thepetrov classification of the wlt gives rise to a corresponding classificationof lorentz symmetry breaking. we do not impose any constraint on the strengthof the symmetry breaking and are able to obtain explicit dispersion relationsfor photon propagation in each of the petrov classes. the associatedbirefringence appears in some cases as two distinct polarisation dependentlightcones and in other cases as a a more complicated structure that cannot bedisentangled in a simple way.  we show how in bimqed the renormalisation procedure can, in addition to itseffect on standard parameters such as charge and mass, force therenormalisation of the metrics and the wlt. two particularly tractable casesare studied in detail for which we can obtain renormalisation group flows forthe parameters of the model together with an analysis of fixed point structure.of course these results are consistent with previous studies but we are notconstrained to treat lorentz symmetry breaking as necessarily weak. as we foundin a previous study of a scalar field theory model an acceptable causalstructure for the model imposes constraints on relationship between the variouslightcones in bimqed.
