entanglement of vacuum states with the de sitter horizon: consequences  on holographic dark energy the aim of this article is to study the effect of an event horizon on theentanglement of the quantum vacuum and how entanglement, together with theholographic principle, may explain the current value of the cosmologicalconstant, in light of recent theories. entanglement is tested for vacuum statesvery near and very far from the horizon of a de sitter universe, using theperes-horodecki (ppt) criterion. a scalar vacuum field ($\hat{\phi}$) isaveraged inside two boxes of volume $v$ in different spatial positions suchthat it acquires the structure of a bipartite quantum harmonic oscillator, forwhich the ppt criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition ofseparability. entanglement is found between states obtained from boxes shapedas spherical shells with thickness of the order of one planck distance ($l_p$),when one of the states is near the horizon, and the other state is anywhere inthe universe. entanglement disappears when the distance of the state near thehorizon and the horizon increases to around $5l_p$. if we consider the horizonnot as a surface but as a spherical shell of thickness $l_p$, then this meansthat there is entanglement between the states in the horizon and the rest ofthe universe. when both states are at distances larger than $\sim 5 l_p$ fromthe horizon, no entanglement is found.
