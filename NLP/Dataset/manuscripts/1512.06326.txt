stueckelberg massive electromagnetism in curved spacetime: hadamard  renormalization of the stress-energy tensor and the casimir effect we discuss stueckelberg massive electromagnetism on an arbitraryfour-dimensional curved spacetime (gauge invariance of the classical theory andcovariant quantization, wave equations for the massive spin-1 field $a_\mu$,for the auxiliary stueckelberg scalar field $\phi$ and for the ghost fields $c$and $c^\ast$, ward identities, hadamard representation of the various feynmanpropagators and covariant taylor series expansions of the correspondingcoefficients). this permits us to construct, for a hadamard quantum state, theexpectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor associated with thestueckelberg theory. we provide two alternative but equivalent expressions forthis result. the first one is obtained by removing the contribution of the"stueckelberg ghost" $\phi$ and only involves state-dependent and geometricalquantities associated with the massive vector field $a_\mu$. the other oneinvolves contributions coming from both the massive vector field and theauxiliary stueckelberg scalar field, and it has been constructed in such a waythat, in the zero-mass limit, the massive vector field contribution reducessmoothly to the result obtained from maxwell's theory. as an application of ourresults, we consider the casimir effect outside a perfectly conducting mediumwith a plane boundary. we discuss the results obtained using stueckelberg butalso de broglie-proca electromagnetism and we consider the zero-mass limit ofthe vacuum energy in both theories. we finally compare the de broglie-proca andstueckelberg formalisms and highlight the advantages of the stueckelberg pointof view, even if, in our opinion, the de broglie-proca and stueckelbergapproaches of massive electromagnetism are two faces of the same field theory.
