the ryu-takayanagi formula from quantum error correction i argue that a version of the quantum-corrected ryu-takayanagi formula holdsin any quantum error-correcting code. i present this result as a series oftheorems of increasing generality, with the final statement expressed in thelanguage of operator-algebra quantum error correction. in ads/cft this gives a"purely boundary" interpretation of the formula. i also extend a recenttheorem, which established entanglement-wedge reconstruction in ads/cft, wheninterpreted as a subsystem code, to the more general, and i argue morephysical, case of subalgebra codes. for completeness, i include aself-contained presentation of the theory of von neumann algebras onfinite-dimensional hilbert spaces, as well as the algebraic definition ofentropy. the results confirm a close relationship between bulk gaugetransformations, edge-modes/soft-hair on black holes, and the ryu-takayanagiformula. they also suggest a new perspective on the homology constraint, whichbasically is to get rid of it in a way that preserves the validity of theformula, but which removes any tension with the linearity of quantum mechanics.moreover they suggest a boundary interpretation of the "bit threads" recentlyintroduced by freedman and headrick.
