axion and dilaton + metric emerge from local and linear electrodynamics we take a quick look at the different possible universally coupled scalarfields in nature. then, we discuss how the gauging of the group of scaletransformations (dilations), together with the poincare group, leads to aweyl-cartan spacetime structure. there the dilaton field finds a naturalsurrounding. moreover, we describe shortly the phenomenology of thehypothetical axion field. --- in the second part of our essay, we consider aspacetime, the structure of which is exclusively specified by the premetricmaxwell equations and a fourth rank electromagnetic response tensor density$\chi^{ijkl}= -\chi^{jikl}= -\chi^{ijlk}$ with 36 independent components. thistensor density incorporates the permittivities, permeabilities, and themagneto-electric moduli of spacetime. no metric, no connection, no furtherproperty is prescribed. if we forbid birefringence (double-refraction) in thismodel of spacetime, we eventually end up with the fields of an axion, adilaton, and the 10 components of a metric tensor with lorentz signature. ifthe dilaton becomes a constant (the vacuum admittance) and the axion fieldvanishes, we recover the riemannian spacetime of general relativity theory.thus, the metric is encapsulated in $\chi^{ijkl}$, it can be derived from it.[file carlbrans80_07.tex]
