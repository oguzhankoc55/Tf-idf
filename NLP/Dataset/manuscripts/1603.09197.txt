quantum sine-gordon dynamics on analogue curved spacetime in a weakly  imperfect scalar bose gas using the coherent state functional integral expression of the partitionfunction, we show that the sine-gordon model on an analogue curved spacetimearises as the effective quantum field theory for phase fluctuations of a weaklyimperfect bose gas on an incompressible background superfluid flow when thesefluctuations are restricted to a subspace of the single-particle hilbert space.we consider bipartitions of the single-particle hilbert space relevant toexperiments on ultracold bosonic atomic or molecular gases, including, e.g.,restriction to high- or low-energy sectors of the dynamics and spatialbipartition corresponding to tunnel-coupled planar bose gases. by assuming fullunitary quantum control in the low-energy subspace of a trapped gas, we showthat (1) appropriately tuning the particle number statistics of thelowest-energy mode partially decouples the low- and high-energy sectors,allowing any low-energy single-particle wave function to define a backgroundfor sine-gordon dynamics on curved spacetime and (2) macroscopic occupation ofa quantum superposition of two states of the lowest two modes produces ananalogue curved spacetime depending on two background flows, with respectiveweights continuously dependent on the corresponding weights of the superposedquantum states.
