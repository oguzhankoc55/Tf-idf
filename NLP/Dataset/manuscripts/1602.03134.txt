minimum energy and the end of the inspiral in the post-newtonian  approximation the early inspiral phase of a compact binary coalescence is well modelled bythe post-newtonian (pn) approximation to the orbital energy and gravitationalwave flux. the transition from the inspiral phase to the plunge can be definedby the minimum energy circular orbit (meco). in the extreme mass-ratio limit,up to the highest pn order known, the pn energy equals the energy of the exactkerr solution. however, for comparable-mass systems the meco of the pn energydoes not exist when bodies have large spins. by including the exact kerr limitand recently published post-newtonian terms we extract a well-defined minimumof the orbital energy beyond which the plunge or merger occurs. we study thehybrid condition for a number of cases of both black hole and neutron stars andcompare to other commonly employed definitions. our method can be used for anyknown order of the post-newtonian series and enables the meco condition to beused to define the end of the inspiral phase for highly spinning, comparablemass systems.
