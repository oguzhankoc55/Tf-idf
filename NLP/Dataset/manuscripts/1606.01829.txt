quantum spaces are modular at present, our notion of space is a classical concept. taking the point ofview that quantum theory is more fundamental than classical physics, and thatspace should be given a purely quantum definition, we revisit the notion ofeuclidean space from the point of view of quantum mechanics. since spaceappears in physics in the form of labels on relativistic fields or schrodingerwave functionals, we propose to define euclidean quantum space as a choice ofpolarization for the heisenberg algebra of quantum theory. we show, followingmackey, that generically, such polarizations contain a fundamental length scaleand that contrary to what is implied by the schrodinger polarization, theypossess topologically distinct spectra. these are the modular spaces. we showthat they naturally come equipped with additional geometrical structuresusually encountered in the context of string theory or generalized geometry.moreover, we show how modular space reconciles the presence of a fundamentalscale with translation and rotation invariance. we also discuss how the usualclassical notion of space comes out as a form of thermodynamical limit ofmodular space while the schrodinger space is a singular limit.
