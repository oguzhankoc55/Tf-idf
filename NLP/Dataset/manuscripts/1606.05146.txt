quasistationary solutions of scalar fields around accreting black holes massive scalar fields can form long-lived configurations around black holes.these configurations, dubbed quasi-bound states, have been studied both in thelinear and nonlinear regimes. in this paper we show that quasi-bound states canform in a dynamical scenario in which the mass of the black hole growssignificantly due to the capture of infalling matter. we solve the klein-gordonequation numerically in spherical symmetry, mimicking the evolution of thespacetime through a sequence of analytic schwarzschild black hole solutions ofincreasing mass. it is found that the frequency of oscillation of thequasi-bound states decreases as the mass of the black hole increases. inaddition, accretion leads to a significative increase of the exponential decayof the scalar field energy due to the presence of terms of order higher thanlinear in the exponent. we compare the black hole mass growth rates used in ourstudy with estimates from observational surveys and extrapolate our results tovalues of the scalar field masses consistent with models that propose scalarfields as dark matter in the universe. we show that even for unrealisticallylarge mass accretion rates, quasi-bound states around accreting black holes cansurvive for cosmological timescales. our results provide further support to theintriguing possibility of the existence of dark matter halos based on(ultra-light) scalar fields surrounding supermassive black holes in galacticcenters.
