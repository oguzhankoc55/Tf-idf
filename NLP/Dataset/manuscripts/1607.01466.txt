an intrinsic hyperboloid approach for einstein klein-gordon equations in [7] klainerman introduced the hyperboloidal method to prove the globalexistence results for nonlinear klein-gordon equations by using commutingvector fields. in this paper, we extend the hyperboloidal method from minkowskispace to lorentzian spacetimes. this approach is developed in [14] for proving,under the maximal foliation gauge, the global nonlinear stability of minkowskispace for einstein equations with massive scalar fields, which states that, thesufficiently small data in a compact domain, surrounded by a schwarzschildmetric, leads to a unique, globally hyperbolic, smooth and geodesicallycomplete solution to the einstein klein-gordon system.  in this paper, we set up the geometric framework of the intrinsic hyperboloidapproach in the curved spacetime. by performing a thorough geometric comparisonbetween the radial normal vector field induced by the intrinsic hyperboloidsand the canonical $\p_r$, we manage to control the hyperboloids when they areclose to their asymptote, which is a light cone in the schwarzschild zone. byusing such geometric information, we not only obtain the crucial boundaryinformation for running the energy method in [14], but also prove that theintrinsic geometric quantities including the hawking mass all converge to theirschwarzschild values when approaching the asymptote.
