wind finslerian structures: from zermelo's navigation to the causality  of spacetimes the notion of wind finslerian structure is developed; this is ageneralization of finsler metrics where the indicatrices at the tangent spacesmay not contain the zero vector. in the particular case that these indicatricesare ellipsoids, called here wind riemannian structures, they admit a doubleinterpretation which provides: (a) a model for classical zermelo's navigationproblem even when the trajectories of the moving objects (planes, ships) areinfluenced by strong winds or streams, and (b) a natural description of thecausal structure of relativistic spacetimes endowed with a non-vanishingkilling vector field (sstk splittings), in terms of finslerian elements. theseelements can be regarded as conformally invariant killing initial data on apartial cauchy hypersurface. the wind finslerian structure is described interms of two (conic, pseudo) finsler metrics, one with a convex indicatrix andthe other with a concave one. however, the spacetime viewpoint for the windriemannian case gives a useful unified viewpoint. a thorough study of thecausal properties of such a spacetime is carried out in finslerian terms.randers-kropina metrics appear as the finslerian counterpart to the case of ansstk when the killing vector field is either timelike or lightlike. among theapplications, we obtain the solution of zermelo's navigation with arbitrarystationary wind, metric-type properties (distance-type arrival function,completeness, existence of minimizing, maximizing or closed geodesics), as wellas description of spacetime elements (cauchy developments, black hole horizons)in terms of finslerian elements in killing initial data. a general fermat'sprinciple of independent interest for arbitrary spacetimes, as well as itsapplications to sstk spacetimes and zermelo's navigation, are also provided.
