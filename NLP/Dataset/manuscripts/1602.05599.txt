a holographic model for quantum critical responses we analyze the dynamical response functions of strongly interacting quantumcritical states described by conformal field theories (cfts). we construct aself-consistent holographic model that incorporates the relevant scalaroperator driving the quantum critical phase transition. focusing on the finitetemperature dynamical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,t)$, we study its dependenceon our model parameters, notably the scaling dimension of the relevantoperator. it is found that the conductivity is well-approximated by a simpleansatz proposed by katz et al [1] for a wide range of parameters. we furtherdissect the conductivity at large frequencies $\omega &gt;&gt; t$ using the operatorproduct expansion, and show how it reveals the spectrum of our model cft. ourresults provide a physically-constrained framework to study the analyticcontinuation of quantum monte carlo data, as we illustrate using the o(2)wilson-fisher cft. finally, we comment on the variation of the conductivity aswe tune away from the quantum critical point, setting the stage for acomprehensive analysis of the phase diagram near the transition.
