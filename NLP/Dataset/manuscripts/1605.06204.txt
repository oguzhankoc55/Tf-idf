post-newtonian circular restricted 3-body problem: schwarzschild  primaries we study the dynamics of the planar circular restricted three body problem inthe context of post-newtonian approximations. first of all, we review theresults obtained from the post-newtonian equations of motion calculated in theframework of the einstein-infeld-hoffmann formalism (eih), where we show that,for arbitrary parameters, the jacobian integral is not a conserved quantity.therefore, using the fodor-hoenselers-perjes formalism (fhp), we perform anexpansion of the gravitational potential for two schwarzschild black holes,deriving a new system of equations of motion, which preserve the jacobianconstant. the dynamics of this system is studied in terms of the poincar\'esection method and the lyapunov exponents, where the introduction of a newparameter $\epsilon$ allows us to observe the transition from the newtonian tothe post-newtonian regime. here we show that, when the initial conditionsremain fixed, a newtonian bounded orbit becomes unbounded in the post-newtonianregime. moreover, when the jacobian constant is fixed a chaotic orbit in thenewtonian regime can be, in the post-newtonian one, either chaotic or regular.additionally, we have obtained approximate expressions for the lagrange pointsin terms of a mass parameter $\mu$, where it is found that, in general, thedeviations from the classical regime are larger for the fhp than for the eihequations.
