geodesic completeness and the lack of strong singularities in loop  quantum kantowski-sachs spacetime resolution of singularities in the kantowski-sachs model due tonon-perturbative quantum gravity effects is investigated. using the effectivespacetime description for the improved dynamics version of loop quantumkantowski-sachs spacetimes, we show that even though expansion and shearscalars are universally bounded, there can exist events where curvatureinvariants can diverge. however, such events occur can only for very exoticequations of states when pressure or derivatives of energy density with respectto triads become infinite at a finite energy density. in all other casescurvature invariants are proved to remain finite for any evolution in finiteproper time. we find the novel result that all strong singularities areresolved for arbitrary matter. weak singularities pertaining to above potentialcurvature divergence events can exist. the effective spacetime is found to begeodesically complete for particle and null geodesics in finite time evolution.our results add to a growing evidence for generic resolution of strongsingularities in loop quantum cosmology by generalizing earlier results onisotropic and bianchi-i spacetimes.
