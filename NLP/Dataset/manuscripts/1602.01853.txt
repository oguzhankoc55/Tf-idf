covariant hyperbolization of force-free electrodynamics force-free flectrodynamics (ffe) is a non-linear system of equations modelingthe evolution of the electromagnetic field, in the presence of a magneticallydominated relativistic plasma. this configuration arises on severalastrophysical scenarios, which represent exciting laboratories to understandphysics in extreme regimes. we show that this system, when restricted to thecorrect constraint submanifold, is symmetric hyperbolic. in numericalapplications is not feasible to keep the system in that submanifold, and so, itis necessary to analyze its structure first in the tangent space of thatsubmanifold and then in a whole neighborhood of it. as already shown bypfeiffer, a direct (or naive) formulation of this system (in the whole tangentspace) results in a weakly hyperbolic system of evolution equations for whichwell-possednes for the initial value formulation does not follows.  using the generalized symmetric hyperbolic formalism due to geroch, weintroduce here a covariant hyperbolization for the ffe system. in fact, inanalogy to the usual maxwell case, a complete family of hyperbolizers is found,both for the restricted system on the constraint submanifold as well as for asuitably extended system defined in a whole neighborhood of it. a particularsymmetrizer among the family is then used to write down the pertainingevolution equations, in a generic ($3+1$)-decomposition on a backgroundspacetime. interestingly, it turns out that for a particular choice of thelapse and shift functions of the foliation, our symmetrized system reduces tothe one found by pfeiffer. finally we analyze the characteristic structure ofthe resulting evolution system.
