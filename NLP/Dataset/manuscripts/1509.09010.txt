discrete quantum spectrum of black holes the quantum genesis of hawking radiation is a long-standing puzzle in blackhole physics. semi-classically one can argue that the spectrum of radiationemitted by a black hole look very much sparse unlike what is expected from athermal object. it was demonstrated through a simple quantum model that aquantum black hole will retain a discrete profile, at least in the weak energyregime. however, it was suggested that this discreteness might be an artifactof the simplicity of eigen-spectrum of the model considered. different quantumtheories can, in principle, give rise to different complicated spectra and makethe radiation from black hole dense enough in transition lines, to make themlook continuous in profile. we show that such a hope from a geometry-quantizedblack hole is not realized as long as large enough black holes are dubbed witha classical mass area relation in any gravity theory ranging from gr,lanczos-lovelock to f(r) gravity. we show that the smallest frequency ofemission from black hole in any quantum description, is bounded from below, tobe of the order of its inverse mass. that leaves the emission with only twopossibilities. it can either be non-thermal, or it can be thermal only with thetemperature being much larger than 1/m.
