constraining the nordtvedt parameter with the bepicolombo radioscience  experiment bepicolombo is a joint esa/jaxa mission to mercury with challengingobjectives regarding geophysics, geodesy and fundamental physics. the mercuryorbiter radioscience experiment (more) is one of the on-board experiments,including three different but linked experiments: gravimetry, rotation andrelativity. the aim of the relativity experiment is the measurement of thepost-newtonian parameters. thanks to accurate tracking between earth andspacecraft, the results are expected to be very precise. however, the outcomesof the experiment strictly depends on our "knowledge" about solar system:ephemerides, number of bodies (planets, satellites and asteroids) and theirmasses. in this paper we describe a semi-analytic model used to perform acovariance analysis to quantify the effects, on the relativity experiment, dueto the uncertainties of solar system bodies parameters. in particular, ourattention is focused on the nordtvedt parameter $\eta$ used to parametrize thestrong equivalence principle violation. after our analysis we estimated$\sigma[\eta]\lessapprox 4.5\times 10^{-5}$ which is about 1~order of magnitudelarger than the "ideal" case where masses of planets and asteroids have noerrors. the current value, obtained from ground based experiments and lunarlaser ranging measurements, is $\sigma[\eta]\approx 4.4\times 10^{-4}$.therefore, we conclude that, even in presence of uncertainties on solar systemparameters, the measurement of $\eta$ by more can improve the current precisionof about 1~order of magnitude.
