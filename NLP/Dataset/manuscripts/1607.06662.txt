impact of nonlinear effective interactions on gft quantum gravity  condensates we present the numerical analysis of effectively interacting group fieldtheory (gft) models in the context of the gft quantum gravity condensateanalogue of the gross-pitaevskii equation for real bose-einstein condensatesincluding combinatorially local interaction terms. thus we go beyond theusually considered construction for free models.  more precisely, considering such interactions in a weak regime, we findsolutions for which the expectation value of the number operator n is finite,as in the free case. when tuning the interaction to the strongly nonlinearregime, however, we obtain solutions for which n grows and eventually blows up,which is reminiscent of what one observes for real bose-einstein condensates,where a strong interaction regime can only be realized at high density. thisbehaviour suggests the breakdown of the bogoliubov ansatz for quantum gravitycondensates and the need for non-fock representations to describe the systemwhen the condensate constituents are strongly correlated.  furthermore, we study the expectation values of certain geometric operatorsimported from loop quantum gravity in the free and interacting cases. inparticular, computing solutions around the nontrivial minima of the interactionpotentials, one finds, already in the weakly interacting case, a nonvanishingcondensate population for which the spectra are dominated by the lowestnontrivial configuration of the quantum geometry. this result indicates thatthe condensate may indeed consist of many smallest building blocks giving riseto an effectively continuous geometry, thus suggesting the interpretation ofthe condensate phase to correspond to a geometric phase.
