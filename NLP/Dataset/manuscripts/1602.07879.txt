temperature and thermodynamic structure of einstein's equations for a  cosmological black hole it is expected that the cosmological black holes are the closest realisticsolutions of gravitational theories and they evolve with time. moreover, thenatural way of defining thermodynamic entities for the stationary ones is notapplicable in the case of a time dependent spacetime. here we confine ourdiscussion within the sultana-dyer metric which is a cosmological black holesolution of einstein's gravity. in literature, there exists two expressions ofhorizon temperature -- one is time dependent and the other does not depend ontime. to single out the correct one we find the temperature by studying thehawking effect in the tunnelling formalism. this leads to time dependentstructure. after identifying the correct one, the einstein's equations arewritten on the horizon and we show that this leads to the first law ofthermodynamics. in this process the expressions for horizon entropy and energy,obtained earlier by explicit calculations, are being used. this provides theevidence that einstein's equations have thermodynamic structure even for acosmological black hole spacetime. moreover, this study further clarifies thecorrectness of the expressions for the thermodynamic quantities; liketemperature, entropy and internal energy.
