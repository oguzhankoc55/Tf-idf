super-renormalizable or finite lee-wick quantum gravity we propose a class of multidimensional higher derivative theories of gravitywithout extra real degrees of freedom besides the graviton field. thepropagator shows up the usual real graviton pole and extra complex conjugatespoles that do not contribute to the absorptive part of the physical scatteringamplitudes. indeed, they may consistently be excluded from the asymptoticobservable states of the theory making use of the lee-wick and cutkoski,landshoff, olive and polkinghorne prescription for the construction of aunitary s-matrix. therefore, the spectrum consists on the graviton and shortlived elementary unstable particles that we named "anti-gravitons" because oftheir repulsive contribution to the gravitational potential at short distance.however, another interpretation of the complex conjugate pairs is proposedbased on the calmet's suggestion, i.e. they could be understood as black holeprecursors long established in the classical theory. since the theory is cptinvariant, the complex conjugate of the micro black hole precursor has receivedas a white hole precursor consistently with the t'hooft complementaryprinciple. it is proved that the quantum theory is super-renormalizable in evendimension, i.e. only a finite number of divergent diagrams survive, and finitein odd dimension. furthermore, turning on a local potential of the riemanntensor we can make the theory finite in any dimension. the singularity-freenewtonian gravitational potential is explicitly computed for a range of higherderivative theories. finally, we propose a new super-reneromalizable or finitelee-wick standard model of particle physics.
