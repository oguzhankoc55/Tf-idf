the strange (hi)story of particles and waves this is an attempt of a non-technical but conceptually consistentpresentation of modern quantum theory in historical context. while the firstpart has been written for a general readership, sect. 5 may appear a bitprovocative to some physicists. i argue that the single-particle wave functionsof quantum mechanics have to be correctly interpreted as field modes that are"occupied once" (that is, first excited states of the corresponding quantumoscillators in the case of a boson field). multiple excitations leadnon-relativistically to apparent many-particle wave functions, while thequantum state proper is defined by a wave function(al) on the "configurationspace" of certain fundamental fields or on another, as yet elusive, fundamentalbasis. -- sects. 1 and 2 are meant as a brief overview of the early history -neglecting all technical details. sects. 3 and 4 concentrate on some importantproperties of non-relativistic quantum mechanics that are often insufficientlypointed out in textbooks (including quite recent ones). sect. 5 describes howthis formalism would have to be generalized into its relativistic form (qft),although this program fails in practice for interacting fields because of thecomplicated entanglement that would arise between too many degrees of freedom.this may explain why qft is mostly used in a semi-phenomenological manner thatis often misunderstood as a fundamentally new theory. sect. 6 describes thefurther generalization of the schr\"odinger picture to quantum gravity andquantum cosmology, while sect. 7 concludes the paper.
