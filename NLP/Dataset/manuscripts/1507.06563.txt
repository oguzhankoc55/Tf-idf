charged black hole solutions in gauss-bonnet-massive gravity motivated by high interest in the close relation between string theory andblack hole solutions, in this paper, we take into account theeinstein-gauss-bonnet lagrangian in the context of massive gravity. we examinethe possibility of black hole in this regard, and discuss the types ofhorizons. next, we calculate conserved and thermodynamic quantities and checkthe validity of the first law of thermodynamics. in addition, we investigatethe stability of these black holes in context of canonical ensemble. we showthat number, type and place of phase transition points may be significantlyaffected by different parameters. next, by considering cosmological constant asthermodynamical pressure, we will extend phase space and calculate criticalvalues. then, we construct thermodynamical spacetime by considering mass asthermodynamical potential. we study geometrical thermodynamics of these blackholes in context of heat capacity and extended phase space. we show thatstudying heat capacity, geometrical thermodynamics and critical behavior inextended phase space lead to consistent results. finally, we will employ a newmethod for obtaining critical values and show that the results of this methodare consistent with those of other methods.
