conservative second-order gravitational self-force on circular orbits  and the effective one-body formalism we consider detweiler's redshift variable $z$ for a nonspinning mass $m_1$ incircular motion (with orbital frequency $\omega$) around a nonspinning mass$m_2$. we show how the combination of effective-one-body (eob) theory with thefirst law of binary dynamics allows one to derive a simple, exact expressionfor the functional dependence of $z$ on the (gauge-invariant) eob gravitationalpotential $u=(m_1+m_2)/r$. we then use the recently obtainedhigh-post-newtonian(pn)-order knowledge of the main eob radial potential $a(u ;\nu)$ [where $\nu= m_1 m_2/(m_1+m_2)^2$] to decompose thesecond-self-force-order contribution to the function $z(m_2 \omega, m_1/m_2)$into a known part (which goes beyond the 4pn level in including the 5pnlogarithmic term, and the 5.5pn contribution), and an unknown one [depending onthe yet unknown, 5pn, 6pn, $\ldots$, contributions to the $o(\nu^2)$contribution to the eob radial potential $a(u ; \nu)$]. we indicate theexpected singular behaviors, near the lightring, of the second-self-force-ordercontributions to both the redshift and the eob $a$ potential. our resultsshould help both in extracting information of direct dynamical significancefrom ongoing second-self-force-order computations, and in parametrizing theirglobal strong-field behaviors. we also advocate computingsecond-self-force-order conservative quantities by iterating the time-symmetricgreen-function in the background spacetime.
