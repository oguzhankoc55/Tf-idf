killing-yano tensor and supersymmetry of the self-dual  plebanski-demianski solution we explore various aspects of the self-dual pleba\'nski-demia\'nski family inthe euclidean einstein-maxwell-$\lambda$ system. the killing-yano tensor whichwas recently found by yasui and one of the present authors allows us to provethat the self-dual pleba\'nski-demia\'nski metric can be brought into theself-dual carter metric by an orientation-reversing coordinate transformation.we show that the self-dual pleba\'nski-demia\'nski solution admits twoindependent killing spinors in the framework of $n=2$ minimal gaugedsupergravity, whereas the non-self-dual solution admits only a single killingspinor. this can be demonstrated by casting the self-dualpleba\'nski-demia\'nski metric into two distinct przanowski-tod forms. as aby-product, a new example of the three-dimensional einstein-weyl space ispresented. we also prove that the self-dual pleba\'nski-demia\'nski metricfalls into two different calderbank-pedersen families, which are determined bya single function subjected to a linear equation on the two dimensionalhyperbolic space. furthermore, we consider the hyper-k\"ahler case for whichthe metric falls into the gibbons-hawking class. we find that the condition forthe nonexistence of dirac-misner string enforces the solution with anonvanishing acceleration parameter to the eguchi-hanson space.
