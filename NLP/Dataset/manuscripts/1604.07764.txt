actions, topological terms and boundaries in first order gravity: a  review in this review we consider first order gravity in four dimensions. inparticular, we focus our attention in formulations where the fundamentalvariables are a tetrad $e_a^i$ and a so(3,1) connection ${\omega_{ai}}^j$. westudy the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphisminvariance. this implies, in particular, considering besides the standardeinstein-hilbert-palatini term, other terms that either do not change theequations of motion, or are topological in nature. having a well defined actionprinciple sometimes involves the need for additional boundary terms, whosedetailed form may depend on the particular boundary conditions at hand. in thiswork, we consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfyingasymptotically flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfyingisolated horizons boundary conditions. we focus on the covariant hamiltonianformalism where the phase space $\gamma$ is given by solutions to the equationsof motion. for each of the possible terms contributing to the action weconsider the well posedness of the action, its finiteness, the contribution tothe symplectic structure, and the hamiltonian and noether charges. for thechosen boundary conditions, standard boundary terms warrant a well posedtheory. furthermore, the boundary and topological terms do not contribute tothe symplectic structure, nor the hamiltonian conserved charges. the noetherconserved charges, on the other hand, do depend on such additional terms. theaim of this manuscript is to present a comprehensive and self-containedtreatment of the subject, so the style is somewhat pedagogical. furthermore,along the way we point out and clarify some issues that have not been clearlyunderstood in the literature.
