qcd nature of dark energy at finite temperature: cosmological  implications the veneziano ghost field has been proposed as an alternative source of darkenergy whose energy density is consistent with the cosmological observations.in this model, the energy density of qcd ghost field is expressed in terms ofqcd degrees of freedom at zero temperature. we extend this model to finitetemperature to search the model predictions from late time to early universe.we depict the variations of qcd parameters entering the calculations, darkenergy density, equation of state, hubble and deceleration parameters ontemperature from zero to a critical temperature. we compare our results withthe observations and theoretical predictions existing at different eras. it isfound that this model safely defines the universe from quark condensation up tonow and its predictions are not in tension with those of the standardcosmology. the eos parameter of dark energy is dynamical and evolves from$-1/3$ in the presence of radiation to $-1$ at late time. the finitetemperature ghost dark energy predictions on the hubble parameter well fit tothose of $\lambda$cdm and observations at late time.
