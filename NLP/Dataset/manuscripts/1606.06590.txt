on a phenomenology of the accelerated expansion with a varying ghost  dark energy subject of our study it is the accelerated expansion of the large scaleuniverse, where a varying ghost dark energy can take the role of the darkenergy. the model of the varying ghost dark energy considered in this work itis a phenomenological modification of the ghost dark energy. recently, threeother phenomenological models of the varying ghost dark energy have beensuggested and the model considered in this work will complete the logical chainof considered modifications. the best fit of theoretical results to theluminosity distance, has been used to obtain preliminary constraints on theparameters of the models. this does help us to reduce amount of discussion. onthe other hand, detailed comparison of theoretical results with observationaldata has been left as a subject of another discussion elsewhere. moreover, alook to considered models via $om$ and statefinder hierarchy analysis ispresented and discussed for different forms of interaction between the varyingghost dark energy and cold dark matter.
