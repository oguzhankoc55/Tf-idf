an integral representation for the massive dirac propagator in kerr  geometry in eddington-finkelstein-type coordinates the massive dirac equation is considered in the non-extreme kerr geometry inhorizon-penetrating eddington-finkelstein-type coordinates. we derive anintegral representation for the dirac propagator involving the solutions of theodes which arise in chandrasekhar's separation of variables. this integralrepresentation describes the dynamics of dirac waves outside and across theevent horizon, up to the cauchy horizon. for the proof, we write the diracequation in hamiltonian form. one of the main difficulties is that the timeevolution is not unitary, because the wave may "hit" the singularity. thisproblem is resolved by imposing suitable dirichlet-type boundary conditionsinside the cauchy horizon, having no effect on the outside dynamics. anothermain difficulty is that the dirac hamiltonian fails to be elliptic at thehorizons. combining the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems with ellipticmethods near the boundary, we construct a self-adjoint extension of theresulting hamiltonian. we finally apply stone's formula to the spectral measureof the hamiltonian and express the resolvent in terms of solutions of theseparated odes.
