excitation entanglement entropy in 2d conformal field theories we analyze how excitations affect the entanglement entropy for an arbitraryentangling interval in a 2d conformal field theory (cft) using the holographicentanglement entropy techniques as well as direct cft computations. weintroduce the excitation entanglement entropy \delta_h s, the differencebetween the entanglement entropy generic excitations and their arbitrarydescendants denoted by h. the excitation entanglement entropy, unlike theentanglement entropy, is a finite quantity (independent of the cutoff), andhence a good physical observable. we show that the excitation entanglemententropy is governed by a second order differential equation sourced by the onepoint function of the energy momentum tensor computed in the excited backgroundstate. we analyze low and high temperature behavior of the excitationentanglement entropy and show that \delta_h s grows as function of temperature.we prove an "integrated positivity" for the excitation entanglement entropy,that although \delta_h s can be positive or negative, its average value isalways positive. we also discuss the mutual and multipartite information withgeneric excitations.
