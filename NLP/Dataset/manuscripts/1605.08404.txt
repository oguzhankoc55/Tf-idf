some classes of gravitational shock waves from higher order theories of  gravity we study the gravitational shock wave generated by a massless high energyparticle in the context of higher order gravities of the form $f(r,r_{\mu\nu}r^{\mu \nu},r_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}r^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta})$. in the caseof $f(r)$ gravity, we investigate the gravitational shock wave solutionscorresponding to various cosmologically viable gravities, and as we demonstratethe solutions are rescaled versions of the einstein-hilbert gravity solution.interestingly enough, other higher order gravities result to the generalrelativistic solution, except for some specific gravities of the form $f(r_{\mu\nu}r^{\mu \nu})$ and $f(r,r_{\mu \nu}r^{\mu \nu})$, which we study in detail.in addition, when realistic gauss-bonnet gravities of the form$r+f(\mathcal{g})$ are considered, the gravitational shock wave solutions areidentical to the general relativistic solution. finally, the singularitystructure of the gravitational shock waves solutions is studied, and it isshown that the effect of higher order gravities makes the singularities milderin comparison to the general relativistic solutions, and in some particularcases the singularities seem to be absent.
