thermodynamic products in extended phase space we have examined the thermodynamic properties for a variety of sphericallysymmetric charged-ads black hole (bh) solutions, including the charged ads bhsurrounded by quintessence dark energy and charged ads bh in $f(r)$ gravity in\emph{extended phase-space}. this framework involves treating the cosmologicalconstant as thermodynamic variable (for example: thermodynamic pressure andthermodynamic volume). then they should behave as an analog of van der waal(vdw) like systems. in the extended phase space we have calculated the\emph{entropy product} and \emph{thermodynamic volume product} of all horizons.the mass (or enthalpy) independent nature of the said product signals they are\emph{universal} quantities. %various type of phase diagram of the specificheat has been drawn. the divergence of the specific heat indicates that thesecond order phase transition occurs under certain condition. in theappendix-a, we have studied the thermodynamic volume products for axisymmetricspacetime and it is shown to be \emph{not universal} in nature. finally, inappendix-b, we have studied the $p-v$ criticality of cauchy horizon forcharged-ads bh and found to be an universal relation of critical values betweentwo horizons as $p_{c}^{-} = p_{c}^{+}$, $v_{c}^{-}=v_{c}^{+}$, $t_{c}^{-} =-t_{c}^{+}$, $\rho_{c}^{-} = -\rho_{c}^{+}$. the symbols are defined in themain work.
