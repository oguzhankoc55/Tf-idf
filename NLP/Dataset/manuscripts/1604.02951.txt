reconstructing $f(r)$ gravity from viscous cosmology constrained by  observations in this paper, we reconstruct the $f(r)$ theory using the viscous $\omega$cdmscenario (v-$\omega$cdm) constrained by several differently astrophysicalobservations, including type ia supernovae (sne ia), observational hubbleparameter data (ohd), wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 9-year data(wmap-9), planck observations and the single data point from the newest eventgw150914 (gw). we find that the joint constraints from sne ia+ohd+planck+gwdata-sets give out a tighter restriction for the parameters of thev-$\omega$cdm scenario than other constraints. subsequently, we find that thereexists a substantially high degeneracy among these reconstructed $f(r)$theories in the past, and that they start exhibiting differently evolutionalbehaviors around the present epoch as well as much different in the distantfuture. furthermore, we make a comparison between the reconstructed $f(r)$theory with the v-$\omega$cdm scenario and that with the $\omega$cdm scenarioconstrained by using the sne ia+ohd+planck+gw data-sets in the $f(r)-r$ plane,and find that the two scenarios share an extremely high degeneracy, whichimplies that the effect of bulk viscosity plays a negligible role in thev-$\omega$cdm model during the whole evolutionary processes of the universe. inaddition, one can also find that the reconstructed $f(r)$ theories using thetwo models just deviate from the standard einstein gravity a little.
