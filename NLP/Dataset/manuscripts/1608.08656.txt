breakdown of the equivalence between gravitational mass and energy for a  quantum body: theory and suggested experiments we review recent theoretical results, obtained for the equivalence betweengravitational mass and energy of a composite quantum body as well as for itsbreakdown at macroscopic and microscopic levels. in particular, we discuss thatthe expectation values of passive and active gravitational masses operators areequivalent to the expectation value of energy for electron stationary quantumstates in a hydrogen atom. on the other hand, for superpositions of thestationary quantum states, inequivalence between the gravitational masses andenergy appears at a macroscopic level. it reveals itself as time-dependentoscillations of the expectation values of passive and active gravitationalmasses, which can be, in principle, experimentally measured. inequivalencebetween passive gravitational mass and energy at a microscopic level can beexperimentally observed as unusual electromagnetic radiation, emitted by amacroscopic ensemble of the atoms. we propose the corresponding experiment,which can be done on the earth's orbit, using small spacecraft. if suchexperiment is done it would be the first direct observation of quantum effectsin general relativity.
