the minimum mass of a charged spherically symmetric object in $d$  dimensions, its implications for fundamental particles, and holography we obtain bounds for the minimum and maximum mass/radius ratio of a stable,charged, spherically symmetric compact object in a $d$-dimensional space-timein the framework of general relativity, and in the presence of a dark energy.the total energy, including the gravitational component, and the stability ofobjects with minimum mass/radius ratio is also investigated. the minimum energycondition leads to a representation of the mass and radius of the chargedobjects with minimum mass/radius ratio in terms of the charge and vacuum energyonly. as applied to the electron in the four-dimensional case, this procedureallows to re-obtain the classical electron radius from purely generalrelativistic considerations. by combining the lower mass bound, in fourspace-time dimensions, with minimum length uncertainty relations (mlur)motivated by quantum gravity, we obtain an alternative bound for the maximumcharge/mass ratio of a stable, gravitating, charged quantum mechanical object,expressed in terms of fundamental constants. evaluating this limit numerically,we obtain again the correct order of magnitude value for the charge/mass ratioof the electron, as required by the stability conditions. this suggests that,if the electron were either less massive (with the same charge) or if itscharge were any higher (for fixed mass), a combination of electrostatic anddark energy repulsion would destabilize the compton radius. in other words, theelectron would blow itself apart. our results suggest the existence of a deepconnection between gravity, the presence of the cosmological constant, and thestability of fundamental particles.
