the lorentzian proper vertex amplitude: classical analysis and quantum  derivation spin foam models, an approach to defining the dynamics of loop quantumgravity, make use of the plebanski formulation of gravity, in which gravity isrecovered from a topological field theory via certain constraints calledsimplicity constraints. however, the simplicity constraints in their usual formselect more than just one gravitational sector as well as a degenerate sector.this was shown, in previous work, to be the reason for the "extra" termsappearing in the semiclassical limit of the euclidean eprl amplitude. in thisprevious work, a way to eliminate the extra sectors, and hence terms, wasdeveloped, leading to the what was called the euclidean proper vertexamplitude. in the present work, these results are extended to the lorentziansignature, establishing what is called the lorentzian proper vertex amplitude.this extension is non-trivial and involves a number of new elements since, forlorentzian bivectors, the split into self-dual and anti-self-dual parts, onwhich the euclidean derivation was based, is no longer available. in fact, theclassical parts of the present derivation provide not only an extension to thelorentzian case, but also, with minor modifications, provide a new, more fourdimensionally covariant derivation for the euclidean case. the new elements inthe quantum part of the derivation are due to the different structure ofunitary representations of the lorentz group.
