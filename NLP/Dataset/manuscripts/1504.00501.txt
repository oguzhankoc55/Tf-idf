quantum entanglement and hawking temperature the thermodynamic entropy of an isolated system is given by its von neumannentropy. over the last few years, there is an intense activity to understandthermodynamic entropy from the principles of quantum mechanics. morespecifically, is there a relation between the (von neumann) entropy ofentanglement between a system and some (separate) environment is related to thethermodynamic entropy? it is difficult to obtain the relation for many bodysystems, hence, most of the work in the literature has focused on small numbersystems. in this work, we consider black-holes --- that are simple yetmacroscopic systems --- and show that a direct connection could not be madebetween the entropy of entanglement and the hawking temperature. in this work,within the adiabatic approximation, we explicitly show that the hawkingtemperature is indeed given by the rate of change of the entropy ofentanglement across a black hole's horizon with regard to the system energy.this is yet another numerical evidence to understand the key features of blackhole thermodynamics from the viewpoint of quantum information theory.
