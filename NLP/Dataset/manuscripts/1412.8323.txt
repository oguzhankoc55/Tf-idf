toolbox for reconstructing quantum theory from rules on information  acquisition we develop a novel operational approach for reconstructing quantum theory forsystems of qubits from elementary rules on information acquisition. the focuslies on an observer o interrogating a system s with binary questions and s'sstate is taken as o's `catalogue of knowledge' about s. the mathematical toolsof the framework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlyingassumptions. four principles are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amountof information available to o; (2) the mere existence of complementaryinformation; (3) o's information to be preserved in between interrogations;and, (4) o's information to change continuously and in `a maximal variety' ofpossible ways in time. this approach permits a constructive derivation ofquantum theory, elucidating how the ensuing independence, complementarity andcompatibility structure of o's questions matches that of projectivemeasurements in quantum theory, how entanglement and monogamy of entanglementand, more generally, how the correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubitsand rebits arises. the principles yield a reversible time evolution and aquadratic measure, quantifying o's information about s. finally, it is shownthat the four principles admit two solutions for the simplest case of a singleelementary system: the bloch ball and disc as state spaces for a qubit andrebit, respectively, together with their symmetries as time evolution groups.the reconstruction for arbitrarily many qubits is completed in a companionpaper (arxiv:1511.01130) where an additional postulate eliminates the rebitcase. this approach is conceptually close to the relational interpretation andyields a novel formulation of quantum theory in terms of questions.
