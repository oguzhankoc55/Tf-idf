pre-hawking radiation may allow for reconstruction of the mass  distribution of the collapsing object hawking radiation explicitly depends only on the black hole's total mass,charge and angular momentum. it is therefore generally believed that one cannotreconstruct the information about the initial mass distribution of an objectthat made the black hole. however, instead of looking at radiation from astatic black hole, we can study the whole time-dependent process of thegravitational collapse, and pre-hawking radiation which is excited because ofthe time-dependent metric. we compare radiation emitted by a single collapsingshell with that emitted by two concentric shells of the equivalent total mass.we calculate the gravitational trajectory and the momentum energy tensor. weshow that the flux of energy emitted during the collapse by a single shell issignificantly different from the flux emitted by two concentric shells of theequivalent total mass. when the static black hole is formed, the fluxes becomeindistinguishable. this implies that an observer studying the flux of particlesfrom a collapsing object could in principle reconstruct information not onlyabout the total mass of the collapsing object, but also about the massdistribution.
