$w_\infty$ algebras, hawking radiation and information retention by  stringy black holes we have argued previously, based on the analysis of two-dimensional stringyblack holes, that information in stringy versions of four-dimensionalschwarzschild black holes (whose singular regions are represented byappropriate wess-zumino-witten models) is retained by quantum $w$-symmetrieswhen the horizon area is not preserved due to hawking radiation. it is key thatthe exactly-marginal conformal world-sheet operator representing a masslessstringy particle interacting with the black hole requires a contribution from$w_\infty$ generators in its vertex function. the latter correspond todelocalised, non-propagating, string excitations that guarantee the transfer ofinformation between the string black hole and external particles. wheninfalling matter crosses the horizon, these topological states are excited viaa process: (stringy black hole) + infalling matter $\rightarrow $ (stringyblack hole)$^\star$, where the black hole is viewed as a stringy state with aspecific configuration of $w_\infty$ charges that are conserved. hawkingradiation is then the reverse process, with conservation of the $w_\infty$charges retaining information. the hawking radiation spectrum near the horizonof a schwarzschild or kerr black hole is specified by matrix elements ofhigher-order currents that form a phase-space $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra. we showthat an appropriate gauging of this algebra preserves the horizontwo-dimensional area classically, as expected because the latter is a conservednoether charge.
