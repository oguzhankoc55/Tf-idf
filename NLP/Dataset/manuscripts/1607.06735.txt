method to detect gravitational waves from an ensemble of known pulsars combining information from weak sources, such as known pulsars, forgravitational wave detection, is an attractive approach to improve detectionefficiency. we propose an optimal statistic for a general ensemble of signalsand apply it to an ensemble of known pulsars. our method combines $\mathcalf$-statistic values from individual pulsars using weights proportional to eachpulsar's expected optimal signal-to-noise ratio to improve the detectionefficiency. we also point out that to detect at least one pulsar within anensemble, different thresholds should be designed for each source based on theexpected signal strength. the performance of our proposed detection statisticis demonstrated using simulated sources, with the assumption that all pulsars'ellipticities belong to a common (yet unknown) distribution. comparing with anequal-weight strategy and with individual source approaches, we show that theweighted-combination of all known pulsars, where weights are assigned based onthe pulsars' known information, such as sky location, frequency and distance,as well as the detector sensitivity, always provides a more sensitive detectionstatistic.
