stationary bubbles and their tunneling channels toward trivial geometry in the path integral approach, one has to sum over all histories that startfrom the same initial condition in order to obtain the final condition as asuperposition of histories. applying this into black hole dynamics, we considerstable and unstable stationary bubbles as a reasonable and regular initialcondition. we find examples where the bubble can either form a black hole ortunnel toward a trivial geometry, i.e., with no singularity nor event horizon.we investigate the dynamics and tunneling channels of true vacuum bubbles forvarious tensions. in particular, in line with the idea of superposition ofgeometries, we build a classically stable stationary thin-shell solution in aminkowski background where its fate is probabilistically given bynon-perturbative effects. since there exists a tunneling channel toward atrivial geometry in the entire path integral, the entire information is encodedin the wave function. this demonstrates that the unitarity is preserved andthere is no loss of information when viewed from the entire wave function ofthe universe, whereas a semi-classical observer, who can see only a definitivegeometry, would find an effective loss of information. this may provide aresolution to the information loss dilemma.
