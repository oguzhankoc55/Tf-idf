thermal dimension of quantum spacetime recent results suggest that a crucial crossroad for quantum gravity is thecharacterization of the effective dimension of spacetime at short distances,where quantum properties of spacetime become significant. this is relevant inparticular for various scenarios of "dynamical dimensional reduction" whichhave been discussed in the literature. we are here concerned with the fact thatthe related research effort has been based exclusively on analyses of the"spectral dimension", which involves an unphysical euclideanization ofspacetime and is highly sensitive to the off-shell properties of a theory. ashere shown, different formulations of the same physical theory can have wildlydifferent spectral dimension. we propose that dynamical dimensional reductionshould be described in terms of the "thermal dimension" which we hereintroduce, a notion that only depends on the physical content of the theory. weanalyze a few models with dynamical reduction both of the spectral dimensionand of our thermal dimension, finding in particular some cases where thermaland spectral dimension agree, but also some cases where the spectral dimensionhas puzzling properties while the thermal dimension gives a different andmeaningful picture.
