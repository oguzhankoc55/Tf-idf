the conformal universe iii: basic mechanisms of matter generation this is the last of three papers on conformal general relativity (cgr), whichascribes inflation to a spontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry, followedby a sudden energy transfer from geometry to matter identified as big bang.this process is driven by a conformal-invariant, unitarity-preservinginteraction of two nambu-goldstone fields: a ghost scalar field $\sigma$,invested with geometric meaning, and a physical scalar field $\varphi$ behavinglike a higgs field of varying mass. the big bang generates a bulk of higgsbosons at temperature $t_b\simeq 141$ gev, after which the universe evolvesadiabatically while the higgs bosons decay into standard-model particles andthe magnitude of the gravitational coupling constant decreases. the processends when the $\sigma$-$\varphi$ interaction potential vanishes, the amplitudesof these fields converge to their expectation values in a final stable vacuumand the higgs-boson mass converges to about 126 gev. the main aspects of thisphenomenology are qualitatively described and accurately exemplified bynumerical simulations. the combination of cgr gravitational equation at timezero with entropy conservation equation results in striking predictions. thebest fit to astronomic data is obtained from only standard higgs bosonparameters and a universe age of 19.5 gyr. the cosmological constant$\lambda\simeq 1.35\times 10^{-35}$s$^{-2}$, the scale factor across inflation$z\simeq 4.54\times 10^{27}$, and the lower bound of the power spectrum ofcosmic background anisotropies $w_{min}\!\simeq 37.5\,\mu$k$^2$ are thuspredicted.
