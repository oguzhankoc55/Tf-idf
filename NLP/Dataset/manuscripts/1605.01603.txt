a neumann boundary term for gravity the gibbons-hawking-york (ghy) boundary term makes the dirichlet problem forgravity well defined, but no such general term seems to be known for neumannboundary conditions. in this paper, we view neumann {\em not} as fixing thenormal derivative of the metric ("velocity") at the boundary, but as fixing thefunctional derivative of the action with respect to the boundary metric("momentum"). this leads directly to a new boundary term for gravity: the traceof the extrinsic curvature with a specific dimension-dependent coefficient. inthree dimensions this boundary term reduces to a "one-half" ghy term noted inthe literature previously, and we observe that our action translates preciselyto the chern-simons action with no extra boundary terms. in four dimensions theboundary term vanishes, giving a natural neumann interpretation to the standardeinstein-hilbert action without boundary terms. we argue that in light ofads/cft, ours is a natural approach for defining a "microcanonical" pathintegral for gravity in the spirit of the (pre-ads/cft) work of brown and york.
