spread of entanglement for small subsystems in holographic cfts we develop an analytic perturbative expansion to study the propagation ofentanglement entropy for small subsystems after a global quench, in the contextof the ads/cft correspondence. opposite to the large interval limit, in thiscase the evolution of the system takes place at timescales that are shorter incomparison to the local equilibration scale and thus, different physicalmechanisms govern the dynamics and subsequent thermalization. in particular, weshow that the heuristic picture in terms of a "entanglement tsunami" does notapply in this regime. we find two crucial differences. first, that theinstantaneous rate of growth of the entanglement is not constrained bycausality, but rather its time average. and second, that the approach tosaturation is always continuous, regardless the shape of the entanglingsurface. our analytic expansion also enables us to verify some previousnumerical results, namely, that the saturation time is non-monotonic withrespect to the chemical potential. all of our results are pertinent to cftswith a classical gravity dual formulation.
