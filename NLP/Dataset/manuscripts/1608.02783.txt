hybrid metric-palatini stars we consider the internal structure and the physical properties of specificclasses of neutron, quark and bose-einstein condensate stars in the hybridmetric-palatini gravity theory, which is a combination of the metric andpalatini $f(r)$ formalisms. the theory is very successful in accounting for theobserved phenomenology, since it unifies local constraints at the solar systemlevel and the late-time cosmic acceleration, even if the scalar field is verylight. we derive the equilibrium equations for a spherically symmetricconfiguration (mass continuity and tolman-oppenheimer-volkoff) in the frameworkof hybrid metric-palatini theory, and we investigate their solutionsnumerically for different equations of state of neutron and quark matter, byadopting for the scalar field potential a higgs-type form. stellar models,described by the stiff fluid, radiation-like, the bag model and thebose-einstein condensate equations of state are explicitly constructed in bothgeneral relativity and hybrid metric-palatini gravity, thus allowing an indepth comparison between the predictions of these two gravitational theories.as a general result it turns out that for all the considered equations ofstate, hybrid metric-palatini gravity stars are more massive than their generalrelativistic counterparts. furthermore, two classes of stellar modelscorresponding to fixed forms of the scalar field are also investigated.interestingly enough, in the case of a constant scalar field the equation ofstate of the matter takes the form of the bag model equation of statedescribing quark matter. as a possible astrophysical application of theobtained results we suggest that stellar mass black holes, with masses in therange of $3.8m_{\odot}$ and $6m_{\odot}$, respectively, could be in fact hybridmetric-palatini gravity neutron or quark stars.
