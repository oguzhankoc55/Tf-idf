causal space-times on a null lattice i investigate a discrete model of quantum gravity on a causal null-latticewith \slc structure group. the description is geometric and foliates in acausal and physically transparent manner. the general observables of this modelare constructed from local lorentz symmetry considerations only. for smoothconfigurations, the local lattice actions reduce to the hilbert-palatiniaction, a cosmological term and the three topological terms of dimension fourof pontyagin, euler and nieh-yan. consistency conditions for a topologicallyhypercubic complex with null 4-simplexes are derived and a topological latticetheory that enforces these non-local constraints is constructed. the latticeintegration measure is derived from an \slc-invariant integration measure bylocalization of the non-local structure group. this measure is unique up to adensity that depends on the local 4-volume. it can be expressed in terms ofmanifestly coordinate invariant geometrical quantities. the density provides aninvariant regularization of the lattice integration measure that suppressesconfigurations with small local 4-volumes. amplitudes conditioned on geodesicdistances between local observables have a physical interpretation and may havea smooth ultraviolet limit. numerical studies on small lattices in theunphysical strong coupling regime of large imaginary cosmological constantsuggest that this model of triangulated causal manifolds is finite. twotopologically different triangulations of space-time are discussed: a single,causally connected universe and a duoverse with two causally disjoint connectedcomponents. in the duoverse, two hypercubic sublattices are causally disjointbut the local curvature depends on fields of both sublattices. this maysimulate effects of dark matter in the continuum limit.
