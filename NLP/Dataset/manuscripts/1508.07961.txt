investigation of the spinfoam path integral with quantum cuboid  intertwiners in this work, we investigate the 4d path integral for euclidean quantumgravity on a hypercubic lattice, as given by the spin foam model by engle,pereira, rovelli, livine, freidel and krasnov (eprl-fk). to tackle the problem,we restrict to a set of quantum geometries that reflects the large amount oflattice symmetries. in particular, the sum over intertwiners is restricted toquantum cuboids, i.e. coherent intertwiners which describe a cuboidal geometryin the large-$j$ limit.  using asymptotic expressions for the vertex amplitude, we find severalinteresting properties of the state sum. first of all, the value of couplingconstants in the amplitude functions determines whether geometric ornon-geometric configurations dominate the path integral. secondly, there is acritical value of the coupling constant $\alpha$, which separates two phases.in both phases, the diffeomorphism symmetry appears to be broken. in one, thedominant contribution comes from highly irregular, in the other from highlyregular configurations, both describing flat euclidean space with small quantumfluctuations around them, viewed in different coordinate systems. on thecritical point diffeomorphism symmetry is nearly restored, however.  thirdly, we use the state sum to compute the physical norm of kinematicalstates, i.e. their norm in the physical hilbert space. we find that stateswhich describe boundary geometry with high torsion have exponentiallysuppressed physical norm. we argue that this allows one to exclude them fromthe state sum in calculations.
