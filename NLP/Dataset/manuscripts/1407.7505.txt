nonlinear gravitational waves as dark energy in warped spacetimes on a warped five-dimensional friedmann-lema\^{\i}tre-robertson-walker(flrw)spacetime, dark energy can be induced by a u(1) scalar-gauge field on thebrane. we consider a zero effective cosmological constant, i.e., therandall-sundrum(rs) fine-tuning and no bulk matter fields. the standard modelfields interact via the bulk weyl tensor and cause brane fluctuations. due tothe warp factor, disturbances don't fade away during the expansion of theuniverse. the late-time behavior could be significant deviate from the standardevolution of the universe. the effect is triggered by the time-dependent partof the warp factor. the self-gravitating cosmic string builds up a huge massper unit length in the bulk and can induce massive kk-modes felt on the brane.from a nonlinear perturbation analysis it is found that the effective einsteinequations contain a "back-reaction" term on the righthand side caused by theprojected 5d weyl tensor and can act as a dark energy term. the propagationequations to first order for the metric components and scalar-gauge fields showexplicit $\varphi$-dependency.
