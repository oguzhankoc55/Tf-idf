does horizon entropy satisfy a quantum null energy conjecture? a modern version of the idea that the area of event horizons gives $4g$ timesan entropy is the hubeny-rangamani causal holographic information (chi)proposal for holographic field theories. given a region $r$ of a holographicqfts, chi computes $a/4g$ on a certain cut of an event horizon in thegravitational dual. the result is naturally interpreted as a coarse-grainedentropy. chi is known to be finitely greater than the fine-grainedhubeny-rangamani-takayanagi (hrt) entropy when $\partial r$ lies on a killinghorizon of the qft spacetime, and in this context satisfies other non-trivialproperties expected of an entropy. here we present evidence that it alsosatisfies the quantum null energy condition (qnec), which bounds the secondderivative of the entropy of a quantum field theory on one side of anon-expanding null surface by the flux of stress-energy across the surface. inparticular, we show chi to satisfy the qnec in 1+1 holographic cfts whenevaluated in states dual to conical defects in ads$_3$. this surprising resultfurther supports the idea that chi defines a useful notion of coarse-grainedholographic entropy, and suggests unprecedented bounds on the rate at whichbulk horizon generators emerge from a caustic. to supplement our motivation, weinclude an appendix deriving a corresponding coarse-grained generalized secondlaw for 1+1 holographic cfts perturbatively coupled to dilaton gravity.
