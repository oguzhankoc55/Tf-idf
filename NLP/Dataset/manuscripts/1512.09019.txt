general relativistic observables for the aces experiment we develop a high-precision model for relativistic observables of the atomicclock ensemble in space (aces) experiment on the international space station(iss). we develop all relativistic coordinate transformations that are neededto describe the motion of aces in earth orbit and to compute observablequantities. we analyze the accuracy of the required model as it applies to theproper-to-coordinate time transformations, light time equation, and spacecraftequations of motion. we consider various sources of nongravitational noise andtheir effects on aces. we estimate the accuracy of orbit reconstruction that isneeded to satisfy the aces science objectives. based on our analysis, we derivemodels for the relativistic observables of aces, which also account for thecontribution of atmospheric drag on the clock rate. we include the earth'soblateness coefficient $j_2$ and the effects of major nongravitational forceson the orbit of the iss. we demonstrate that the aces reference frame ispseudo-inertial at the level of accuracy required by the experiment. weconstruct a doppler-canceled science observable representing the gravitationalredshift. we derive accuracy requirements for iss navigation. the improvedmodel is accurate up to $&lt;1$ ps and $\sim 4\times 10^{-17}$ for time andfrequency transfers, correspondingly. these limits are determined by the higherorder harmonics in earth's gravitational potential.
