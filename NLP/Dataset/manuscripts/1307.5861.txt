icezones instead of firewalls: extended entanglement beyond the event  horizon and unitary evaporation of a black hole we examine the basic assumptions in the original setup of the firewallparadox. the main claim is that a single mode of the lathe radiation ismaximally entangled with the mode inside the horizon and simultaneously withthe modes of early hawking radiation. we argue that this situation neverhappens during the evolution of a black hole. quantum mechanics tells us thatwhile the black hole exists, unitary evolution maximally entangles a late modelocated just outside the horizon with a combination of early radiation andblack hole states, instead of either of them separately. one of the reasons forthis is that the black hole radiation is not random and strongly depends on thegeometry and charge of the black hole, as detailed numerical calculations ofhawking evaporation clearly show. as a consequence, one can't factor out thestate of the black hole. however, this extended entanglement between the blackhole and modes of early and late radiation indicates that, as the black holeages, the local rindler horizon is modified out to macroscopic distances fromthe black hole. fundamentally non-local physics nor firewalls are not necessaryto explain this result. we propose an infrared mechanism called {\it icezone}that is mediated by low energy interacting modes and acts near any eventhorizon to entangle states separated by long distances. these interactions atfirst provide small corrections to the thermal hawking radiation. at the end ofevaporation however the effect of interactions is as large as the hawkingradiation and information is recovered for an outside observer. we verify thisin an explicit construction and calculation of the density matrix of a spinmodel.
