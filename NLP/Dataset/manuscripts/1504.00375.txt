freely falling finite frames near a black hole it is well-known that the riemann curvature tensor has no discontinuity atthe black hole horizon. it is also well-known that a freely falling observertakes finite time to reach the horizon from an outside point. however, theusual assumption is that such an observer resides in a frame of reference(spaceship) of infinitesimal size. this assumption is justified as long as thecoordinates are continuous enough to assume that the observer's frame is smallcompared to the variations of the metric from a local flat metric. such anassumption may be invalid when the coordinate system has not only adiscontinuity but a singularity like the one at the horizon. hence, here, thecharacteristics of a finite frame (a spaceship) near a black hole horizon isdiscussed. it is shown that clocks placed at the front and rear ends havedifferent time scales even in the limit when they reach the horizon at the sametime. this renders such a frame physically meaningless. it is also argued thatthe forces that are expected to keep a realistic frame (like a spaceship) inone piece tend to zero near the horizon. so, a physical spaceship is expectedto fall apart near the horizon.
