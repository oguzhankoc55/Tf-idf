black hole unitarity and antipodal entanglement hawking particles emitted by a black hole are usually found to have thermalspectra, if not exactly, then by a very good approximation. here, we arguedifferently. it was discovered that spherical partial waves of in-going andout-going matter can be described by unitary evolution operators independently,which allows for studies of space-time properties that were not possiblebefore. unitarity dictates space-time, as seen by a distant observer, to betopologically non-trivial. consequently, hawking particles are only locallythermal, but globally not: we explain why hawking particles emerging from onehemisphere of a black hole must be 100 % entangled with the hawking particlesemerging from the other hemisphere. this produces exclusively pure quantumstates evolving in a unitary manner, and removes the interior region for theoutside observer, while it still completely agrees locally with the laws ofgeneral relativity. unitarity is a starting point; no other assumptions aremade. region i and the diametrically opposite region ii of the penrose diagramrepresent antipodal points in a pt or cpt relation, as was suggested before. onthe horizon itself, antipodal points are identified. a candidate instanton isproposed to describe the formation and evaporation of virtual black holes ofthe type described here. some important explanations and discussion points areadded. in the latest of the paper, again some minor inaccuracies are corrected.
