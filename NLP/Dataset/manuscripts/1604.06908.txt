dark energy and dark matter from an additional adiabatic fluid the dark sector is described by an additional barotropic fluid which evolvesadiabatically during the universe's history and whose adiabatic exponent$\gamma$ is derived from the standard definitions of specific heats. althoughin general $\gamma$ is a function of the redshift, the hubble parameter and itsderivatives, we find that our assumptions lead necessarily to solutions with$\gamma = $ constant in a flrw universe. the adiabatic fluid acts effectivelyas the sum of two distinct components, one evolving like non-relativisticmatter and the other depending on the value of the adiabatic index. this makesthe model particularly interesting as a way of simultaneously explaining thenature of both dark energy and dark matter, at least at the level of thebackground cosmology. the $\lambda$cdm model is included in this family oftheories when $\gamma = 0$. we fit our model to snia, $h(z)$ and bao data,discussing the model selection criteria. the implications for theearly-universe and the growth of small perturbations in this model are alsodiscussed.
