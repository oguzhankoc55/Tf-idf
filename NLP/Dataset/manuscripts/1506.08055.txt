scalar field and time varying cosmological constant in $f(r,t)$ gravity  for bianchi type-i universe in this article, we have analysed the behaviour of scalar field andcosmological constant in $f(r,t)$ theory of gravity. here, we have consideredthe simplest form of $f(r,t)$ i.e. $f(r,t)=r+2f(t)$, where $r$ is the ricciscalar and $t$ is the trace of the energy momentum tensor and explored thespatially homogeneous and anisotropic locally rotationally symmetric (lrs)bianchi type-i cosmological model. it is assumed that the universe is filledwith two non-interacting matter sources namely scalar field (normal or phantom)with scalar potential and matter contribution due to $f(r,t)$ action. we havediscussed two cosmological models according to power law and exponential law ofthe volume expansion along with constant and exponential scalar potential assub models. power law models are compatible with normal (quintessence) andphantom scalar field whereas exponential volume expansion models are compatiblewith only normal (quintessence) scalar field. the values of cosmologicalconstant in our models are in agreement with the observational results.finally, we have discussed some physical and kinematical properties of both themodels.
