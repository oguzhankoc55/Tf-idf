violations of the kerr and reissner-nordstrom bounds: horizon versus  asymptotic quantities a central feature of the most elementary rotating black hole (bh) solution ingeneral relativity is the kerr bound, which, for vacuum kerr bhs, can beexpressed either in terms of the adm or the horizon "charges". this bound,however, is not a fundamental properties of general relativity and stationary,asymptotically flat, regular (on and outside an event horizon) bhs are known toviolate the kerr bound, both in terms of their adm and horizon quantities.examples include the recently discovered kerr bhs with scalar or proca hair.here, we point the fact that the kerr bound in terms of horizon quantities isalso violated by well-known rotating and charged solutions, known in closedform, such as the kerr-newman and kerr-sen bhs. for the former, moreover, weobserve that the reissner-nordstrom (rn) bound is also violated in terms ofhorizon quantities, even in the static (i.e rn) limit. for the latter, bycontrast, the existence of charged matter outside the horizon, allows a curiousinvariance of the charge to mass ratio, between adm and horizon quantities.regardless of the kerr bound violation, we show that in all case, the eventhorizon linear velocity never exceeds the speed of light. finally, we suggest anew type of informative parameterization for bh spacetimes where part of theasymptotic charges is supported outside the horizon.
