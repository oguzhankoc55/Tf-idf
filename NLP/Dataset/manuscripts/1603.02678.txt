holographic superconductors with logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics  in an external magnetic field based on the matching method, we explore the effects of adding an externalmagnetic field on the $s$-wave holographic superconductor when the gauge fieldis in the form of the logarithmic nonlinear source. first, we obtain thecritical temperature as well as the condensation operator in the presence oflogarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics and understand that they depend on thenonlinear parameter $b$. we show that the critical temperature decreases withincreasing $b$, which implies that the nonlinear gauge field makes thecondensation harder. then, we turn on the magnetic field in the bulk and findthe critical magnetic field, $b_c$, in terms of the temperature, which alsodepends on the nonlinear parameter $b$. we observe that for temperature smallerthan the critical temperature, $t&lt;t_c$, the critical magnetic field increaseswith increasing $b$ and goes to zero as $t\rightarrow t_c$, independent of thenonlinear parameter $b$. in the limiting case where $ b\rightarrow0 $, allresults restore those of the holographic superconductor with magnetic field inmaxwell theory.
