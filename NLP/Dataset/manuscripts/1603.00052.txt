self-forces on static bodies in arbitrary dimensions we derive exact expressions for the scalar and electromagnetic self-forcesand self-torques acting on arbitrary static extended bodies in arbitrary staticspacetimes with any number of dimensions. non-perturbatively, our results areidentical in all dimensions. meaningful point particle limits are quitedifferent in different dimensions, however. these limits are defined andevaluated, resulting in simple "regularization algorithms" which can be used inconcrete calculations. in these limits, self-interaction is shown to beprogressively less important in higher numbers of dimensions; it genericallycompetes in magnitude with increasingly high-order extended-body effects.conversely, we show that self-interaction effects can be relatively large in$1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions. our motivations for this work are twofold: first,no previous derivation of the self-force has been provided in arbitrarydimensions, and heuristic arguments presented by different authors haveresulted in conflicting conclusions. second, the static self-force problem inarbitrary dimensions provides a valuable testbed with which to continue thedevelopment of general, non-perturbative methods in the theory of motion.several new insights are obtained in this direction, including a significantlyimproved understanding of the renormalization process. we also show that thereis considerable freedom to use different "effective fields" in the laws ofmotion---a freedom which can be exploited to optimally simplify specificproblems. different choices give rise to different inertias, gravitationalforces, and electromagnetic or scalar self-forces, but there is a sense inwhich none of these quantities are individually accessible to experiment.certain combinations are observable, however, and these remain invariant underall possible field redefinitions.
