experimental observation of melting of the effective minkowski spacetime  in cobalt-based ferrofluids hyperbolic metamaterials were originally introduced to overcome thediffraction limit of optical imaging. soon thereafter it was realized that theydemonstrate a number of novel phenomena resulting from the broadband singularbehavior of their density of photonic states. these novel phenomena andapplications include microscopy, stealth technologies, enhancedquantum-electrodynamic effects, thermal hyperconductivity, superconductivity,and interesting gravitation theory analogues. here we describe the behaviour ofcobalt nanoparticle-based ferrofluid in the presence of an external magneticfield, and demonstrate that it forms a self-assembled hyperbolic metamaterial,which may be described as an effective 3d minkowski spacetime for extraordinaryphotons. moreover, such photons perceive thermal gradients in the ferrofluid asanalogue of gravitational field, which obeys the newton law. if the magneticfield is not strong enough, the effective minkowski spacetime gradually meltsunder the influence of thermal fluctuations. on the other hand, it may restoreitself if the magnetic field is increased back to its original value. directmicroscopic visualization of such a minkowski spacetime melting/crystallizationis presented, which is somewhat similar to hypothesized formation of theminkowski spacetime in loop quantum cosmology and may mimic variouscosmological big bang scenarios.
