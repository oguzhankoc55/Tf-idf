holographic reconstruction of 3d flat space-time we study asymptotically flat space-times in 3 dimensions for einstein gravitynear future null infinity and show that the boundary is described by carrolliangeometry. this is used to add sources to the bms gauge corresponding to anon-trivial boundary metric in the sense of carrollian geometry. we then solvethe einstein equations in a derivative expansion and derive a general set ofequations that take the form of ward identities. next, it is shown that thereis a well-posed variational problem at future null infinity without the need toadd any boundary term. by varying the on-shell action with respect to themetric data of the boundary carrollian geometry we are able to define aboundary energy-momentum tensor at future null infinity. we show that itsdiffeomorphism ward identity is compatible with einstein's equations. there isanother ward identity that states that the energy flux vanishes. it is thisfact that is responsible for the enhancement of global symmetries to the fullbms$_3$ algebra when we are dealing with constant boundary sources. using anotion of generalized conformal boundary killing vector we can construct allconserved bms$_3$ currents from the boundary energy-momentum tensor.
