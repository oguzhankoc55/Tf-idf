canonical invariance of spatially covariant scalar-tensor theory we investigate invariant canonical transformations of a spatially covariantscalar-tensor theory of gravity, called the xg theory, by which the action orthe hamiltonian and the primary constraints keep their forms invariant. wederive the hamiltonian in a non perturbative manner and complete thehamiltonian analysis for all regions of the theory. we confirm that the theoryhas at most 3 degrees of freedom in all regions of the theory as long as thetheory has the symmetry under the spatial diffeormorphism. then, we derive theinvariant canonical transformation by using the infinitesimal transformation.the invariant metric transformation of the xg theory contains a vector productas well as the disformal transformation. the vector product and the disformalfactor can depend on the higher order derivative terms of the scalar field andthe metric. in addition, we discover the invariant canonical transformationwhich transforms the momentum of the metric. using the invarianttransformation, we study the relation between the horndeski theory and the glpvtheory, and find that we can not obtain the arbitrary glpv theory from thehorndeski theory through the invariant canonical transformation we have found.
