fokker action of non-spinning compact binaries at the fourth  post-newtonian approximation the fokker action governing the motion of compact binary systems withoutspins is derived in harmonic coordinates at the fourth post-newtonianapproximation (4pn) of general relativity. dimensional regularization is usedfor treating the local ultraviolet (uv) divergences associated with pointparticles, followed by a renormalization of the poles into a redefinition ofthe trajectories of the point masses. effects at the 4pn order associated withwave tails propagating at infinity are included consistently at the level ofthe action. a finite part procedure based on analytic continuation deals withthe infrared (ir) divergencies at spatial infinity, which are shown to be fullyconsistent with the presence of near-zone tails. our end result at 4pn order islorentz invariant and has the correct self-force limit for the energy ofcircular orbits. however, we find that it differs from the recently publishedresult derived within the adm hamiltonian formulation of general relativity [t.damour, p. jaranowski, and g. sch\"afer, phys. rev. d 89, 064058 (2014)]. morework is needed to understand this discrepancy.
