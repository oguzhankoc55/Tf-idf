generalized non-minimal couplings in randall-sundrum scenarios the geometrical localization mechanism in randall-sundrum (rs) scenarios isextended by considering the coupling between a quadratic mass term andgeometrical tensors. since the quadratic term is symmetric, tensors with twosymmetric indices have to be taken into account. these are the ricci and theeinstein tensors. for the ricci tensor it is shown that a localized zero modeexists while that is not possible for the einstein tensor. it is already knownthat the ricci scalar generates a localized solution but the metrics do not.therefore, it can be conclude that divergenceless tensors do not localize thezero mode of gauge fields. the result is valid for any warp factor recoveringthe rs metrics at the boundaries, and therefore is valid for rs i and iimodels. we also compute resonances for all couplings. these are calculatedusing the transfer matrix method. the cases studied consider the standard rswith delta-like branes, and branes generated by kinks and domain-wall as well.the parameters are changed to control the thickness of the smooth brane. wefind that, for all cases considered, geometrical coupling does not generateresonances. this enforces similar results for the coupling with the ricciscalar and points to the existence of some unidentified fundamental structureof these couplings.
