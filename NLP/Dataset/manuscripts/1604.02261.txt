spectral decomposition of black-hole perturbations on hyperboloidal  slices in this paper we present a spectral decomposition of solutions torelativistic wave equations described on horizon penetrating hyperboloidalslices within a given schwarzschild-black-hole background. the wave equa- tionin question is laplace-transformed which leads to a spatial differentialequation with a complex parameter. for initial data which are analytic withrespect to a compactified spatial coordinate, this equation is treated with thehelp of the mathematica-package in terms of a sophisticated taylor seriesanalysis. thereby, all ingredients of the desired spectral decomposition ariseexplicitly to arbitrarily prescribed accuracy, including quasi normal modes,quasi normal mode amplitudes as well as the jump of the laplace-transform alongthe branch cut. finally, all contributions are put together to obtain via theinverse laplace transformation the spectral de- composition in question. thepaper explains extensively this procedure and includes detailed discussions ofrelevant aspects, such as the definition of quasi normal modes and the questionregarding the contribution of infinity frequencies modes to the early timeresponse of the black hole.
