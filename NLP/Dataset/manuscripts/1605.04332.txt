spectral cauchy characteristic extraction of strain, news and  gravitational radiation flux we present a new approach for the cauchy-characteristic extraction ofgravitational radiation strain, news function, and the flux of theenergy-momentum, supermomentum and angular momentum associated with thebondi-metzner-sachs asymptotic symmetries. in cauchy-characteristic extraction,a characteristic evolution code propagates numerical data on an inner worldtubesupplied by a cauchy evolution code to obtain the space-time metric in aneighborhood of null infinity. the metric is first determined in a scrambledform in terms of coordinates determined by the cauchy formalism. in priortreatments, the waveform is first extracted from this metric and thentransformed into an asymptotic inertial coordinate system. this procedureprovides the physically proper description of the waveform and the radiatedenergy but it does not generalize to determine the flux of angular momentum orsupermomentum. here we formulate and implement a new approach which transformsthe full metric into an asymptotic inertial frame and provides a uniformtreatment of all the radiation fluxes associated with the asymptoticsymmetries. computations are performed and calibrated using the spectraleinstein code (spec).
