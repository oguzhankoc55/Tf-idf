inflationary spectra from near $\omega$-deformed space-time transition  point in loop quantum cosmology anomaly-free perturbations of loop quantum cosmology with holonomycorrections reveal a $\omega$ -deformed space-time structure,$\omega:=1-2\rho/\rho_c$, where $\omega&lt;0$ means an euclidean-like space and$\omega&gt;0$ means a lorentz-like space. it would be reasonable to give theinitial value at the space-time transition point, $\rho=\rho_c/2$, but we findit is impossible to define a minkowski-like vacuum even for large $k$-modes atthat time. however if we loose the condition and give the initial value nearafter $\omega=0$, e.g. $\omega\simeq 0.2$, the vacuum state can be well definedand furthermore the slow roll approximation also works well in that region.both scalar and tensor spectra are considered in the framework of loop quantumcosmology with holonomy corrections. we find that if the energy density is nottoo small compared with $\rho_c/2$ when the considered $k$-mode crossing thehorizon, effective theory can give a much smaller scalar power spectrum thanclassical theory and the spectrum of tensor perturbations could blue shift. butwhen compared with the observations, since the energy densities when the modescrossed the horizon were quite smaller than $\rho_c$, the results we get arethe same with previous work in the literature and the classical inflationtheory.
