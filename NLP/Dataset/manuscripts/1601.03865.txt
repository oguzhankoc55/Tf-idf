topological non-fermi liquid in this paper we investigate the $(2+1)$-dimensional topological non-fermiliquid in strongly correlated electron system, which has a holographic dualdescription by einstein gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensional anti-de sitter (ads)space-time. in a dyonic reissner-nordstrom black hole background, we consider adirac fermion coupled to the background $u(1)$ gauge theory and an intrinsicchiral gauge field $b_m$ induced by chiral anomaly. uv retarded green'sfunction of the charged fermion in the uv boundary from ads$_4$ gravity iscalculated, by imposing in-falling wave condition at the horizon. we alsoobtain ir correlation function of the charged fermion at the ir boundaryarising from the near horizon geometry of the topological black hole with index$k=0,\pm 1$. by using the uv retarded green's function and ir correlationfunction, we analyze the low frequency behavior of the topological non-fermiliquid at zero and finite temperatures, especially the relevant non-fermiliquid behavior near the quantum critical region. in addition, we find thatwhen $k=\pm 1$, the effective mass of bulk dirac fermion at ir fixed point istopologically quantized, consequently the fermi momentum presents a discretesparse distributed pattern, in contrary to the ricci flat case with $k=0$. asdemonstrated examples, we calculate the spectral functions of topologicalnon-fermi liquid due to anomalous hall effect (ahe) ($|\vec{b}|\ne 0, b_0=0$)and chiral magnetic effect (cme) ($|\vec{b}| = 0, b_0\ne 0$), which can betested in topological materials such as topological insulator and topologicalmetal with strong couplings.
