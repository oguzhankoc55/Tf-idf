complementarity in genuine nonlocality: a device independent outlook the notion of complementarity or mutually exclusiveness of physicalphenomenon has always been of keen interest to the physicists. in this work weshow that there exists a complementary relationship in terms of the genuinenon-locality of a multipartite system vs. that of reduced subsystems. wefurther assert that the same is enforced due to no-signaling condition. to thisend we consider svetlichny games in a multiparty binary input and outputscenario with a threshold value of the winning probability as a signature ofgenuine multiparty non locality. we analytically show that, in the svetlichnygames setup, there exists complementary relations between svetlichnycorrelations of $n$ party and svetlichny correlations of any subset of $k \leqn$ parties within the no-signaling framework. in other words, in general nonlocal theories, the genuine multiparty non locality for multiparty systemscomes at the cost of upper bounding the genuine multiparty non locality of thereduced subsystem. in addition to svetlichny games we consider many other nonlocal games like mermin games, bancal \emph{et al's} ip, guess your neighborsinput game and provide numerical findings ( in case of no-signaling and quantumcorrelations ) in support of our main result.
