horizon fluffs: near horizon soft hairs as microstates of generic ads_3  black holes in [1] the "horizon fluffs" proposal is put forward to identify themicrostates of three-dimensional banados-teitelboim-zanelli (btz) black holes.the proposal is that black hole microstates, the horizon fluffs, are stateslabelled by the conserved charges associated with non-trivial diffeomorphismson the near horizon geometry which are not distinguishable by the(brown-henneaux) conserved charges associated with the asymptotic symmetryalgebra. it is also known that ads3 einstein gravity has more general blackhole solutions than the btz family. these black holes are generically describedby two periodic, but otherwise arbitrary, holomorphic and anti-holomorphicfunctions. we show that these general ads3 black holes appear as coherentstates in the {extended} asymptotic symmetry algebra, which is thebrown-henneaux virasoro algebra plus a u(1) current. these black holes aretypically conformal descendants of the btz black holes, characterised byspecific virasoro coadjoint orbits. we identify horizon fluffs for thesegeneric ads3 black holes and perform the microstate counting. as it isexpected, the entropy appears to be an orbit invariant quantity, providing animportant check for the horizon fluffs proposal.
