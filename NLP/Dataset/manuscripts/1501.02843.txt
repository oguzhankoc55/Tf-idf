a new fate of a warped 5d frw model with a u(1) scalar gauge field if we live on the weak brane with zero effective cosmological constant in awarped 5d bulk spacetime, gravitational waves and brane fluctuations can begenerated by a part of the 5d weyl tensor and carries information of thegravitational field outside the brane. we consider on a cylindrical symmetricwarped frw background the u(1) self-gravitating scalar-gauge field without bulkmatter. it turns out that "branons" can be formed dynamically, due to themodified energy-momentum tensor components of the cosmic string. as a result,we find that the late-time behavior could be significant deviate from thestandard evolution of the universe. the effect is triggered by thetime-dependent warp factor, of the form $\sqrt{ae^{\tau t}+be^{-\tau t}}$ andthe modified brane equations, comparable with a dark energy effect. this is abrane-world mechanism, not present is standard 4d frw, where the largedisturbances are rapidly damped as the expansion proceed. because gravity canpropagate in the bulk, the cosmic string can build up a huge angle deficit (ormass per unit length) by the warp factor. disturbances in the spatialcomponents of the stress-energy tensor cause cylindrical symmetric waves,amplified due to the presence of the bulk space and warpfactor. this long rangeeffect could also explain the recently found spooky alignment of quasars invast structures in the cosmic web.
