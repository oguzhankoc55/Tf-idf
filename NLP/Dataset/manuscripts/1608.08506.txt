on the nature of discrete space-time: the atomic theory of space-time  and its effects on pythagoras's theorem, time versus duration, inertial  anomalies of astronomical bodies, and special relativity at the planck scale in this work, resolutions will be given for commonly stated problemsassociated with a model that assumes that space and time are discretized (i.e.,atomized). this model is in contrast to the continuous space-time model that isused in all common physical theories and equations -- a model that assumes thatspatial coordinates and time are continuous variables. the resolutions to theproblems are arrived at, not by proposing any new theories or postulates, butby strictly adhering to: ernst mach's principle of non-absolute space, thetenets of logical positivism, quantum mechanics and general relativity. theproblems associated with discrete space-time addressed in this paper include:lorentz contraction (time dilation) of the ostensibly smallest spatial(temporal) interval, maintaining isotropy, violations of causality, andconservation of energy and momentum. importantly, this work yieldsmodifications to the standard formulae for time dilation and lengthcontraction, with these modifications preserving the quantums of space and timeand allowing for temporary travel at the speed of light. also given are: aresolution to weyl's tile argument, a modification of the 2500 year oldpythagoras's theorem, a reassessment of henri bergson's theory advocating adistinction between the time durations measured by scientists and an immutable"time", and a discussion of whether einstein's light-clocks are as ideal asmost scientist believe. also included is a demonstration of how discrete spaceimposes order upon john wheeler's quantum foam such that the foam becomes agravity crystal permeating all space and producing measurable inertialanomalies of astronomical bodies.
