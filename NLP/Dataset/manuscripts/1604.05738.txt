dark energy as a manifestation of nontrivial arithmetic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), aswell as the calculus they imply, are non-unique. the examples offour-dimensional spaces, $\mathbb{r}_+^4$ and $(-l/2,l/2)^4$, are consideredwhere different types of arithmetic and calculus coexist simultaneously. in allthe examples there exists a non-diophantine arithmetic that makes the spaceglobally minkowskian, and thus the laws of physics are formulated in terms ofthe corresponding calculus. however, when one switches to the `natural'diophantine arithmetic and calculus, the minkowskian character of the space islost and what one effectively obtains is a lorentzian manifold. i discuss inmore detail the problem of electromagnetic fields produced by a pointlikecharge. the solution has the standard form when expressed in terms of thenon-diophantine formalism. when the `natural' formalsm is used, the samesolution looks as if the fields were created by a charge located in anexpanding universe, with nontrivially accelerating expansion. the effect isclearly visible also in solutions of the friedman equation with vanishingcosmological constant. all of this suggests that phenomena attributed to darkenergy may be a manifestation of a miss-match between the arithmetic employedin mathematical modeling, and the one occurring at the level of natural laws.arithmetic is as physical as geometry.
