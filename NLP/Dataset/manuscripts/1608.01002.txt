unruh-dewitt detector's response to fermions in flat spacetimes we examine an unruh-dewitt particle detector that is coupled linearly to thescalar density of a massless dirac field in minkowski spacetimes of dimension$d\ge2$ and on the static minkowski cylinder in spacetime dimension two,allowing the detector's motion to remain arbitrary and working to leading orderin perturbation theory. in $d$-dimensional minkowski, with the field in theusual fock vacuum, we show that the detector's response is identical to that ofa detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in $2d$-dimensionalminkowski. in the special case of uniform linear acceleration, the detector'sresponse hence exhibits the unruh effect with a planckian factor in both evenand odd dimensions, in contrast to the rindler power spectrum of the diracfield, which has a planckian factor for odd $d$ but a fermi-dirac factor foreven~$d$. on the two-dimensional cylinder, we set the oscillator modes in theusual fock vacuum but allow an arbitrary state for the zero mode of theperiodic spinor. we show that the detector's response distinguishes theperiodic and antiperiodic spin structures, and the zero mode of the periodicspinor contributes to the response by a state-dependent but well definedamount. explicit analytic and numerical results on the cylinder are obtainedfor inertial and uniformly accelerated trajectories, recovering the $d=2$minkowski results in the limit of large circumference. the detector's responsehas no infrared ambiguity for $d=2$, neither in minkowski nor on the cylinder.
