mode-sum construction of the covariant graviton two-point function in  the poincar\'e patch of de sitter space we construct the graviton two-point function for a two-parameter family oflinear covariant gauges in n-dimensional de sitter space. the construction isperformed via the mode-sum method in the bunch-davies vacuum in the poincar\'epatch, and a fierz-pauli mass term is introduced to regularize the infrared(ir) divergences. the resulting two-point function is de sitter-invariant, andfree of ir divergences in the massless limit (for a certain range ofparameters) though analytic continuation with respect to the mass for thepure-gauge sector of the two-point function is necessary for this result. thisgeneral result agrees with the propagator obtained by analytic continuationfrom the sphere [phys. rev. d 34, 3670 (1986); class. quant. grav. 18, 4317(2001)]. however, if one starts with strictly zero mass theory, the irdivergences are absent only for a specific value of one of the two parameters,with the other parameter left generic. these findings agree with recentcalculations in the landau (exact) gauge [j. math. phys. 53, 122502 (2012)],where ir divergences do appear in the spin-two (tensor) part of the two-pointfunction. however, we find the strength (including the sign) of the irdivergence to be different from the one found in this reference.
