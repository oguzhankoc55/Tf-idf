massless and massive higher spins from anti-de sitter space waveguide higgs mechanism to massive higher-spin gauge fields is an outstanding openproblem. we investigate this issue in the context of kaluza-kleincompactification. starting from a free massless higher-spin field in$(d+2)$-dimensional anti-de sitter space and compactifying over a finiteangular wedge, we obtain an infinite tower of heavy, light and masslesshigher-spin fields in $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de sitter space. all massivehigher-spin fields are described gauge invariantly in terms of st\"ueckelbergfields. the spectrum depends on the boundary conditions imposed at both ends ofthe wedges. we obseved that higher-derivative boundary condition is inevitablefor spin greater than three. for some higher-derivative boundary conditions,equivalently, spectrum-dependent boundary conditions, we get a non-unitaryrepresentation of partially-massless higher-spin fields of varying depth. wepresent intuitive picture which higher-derivative boundary conditions yieldnon-unitary system in terms of boundary action. we argue that isotropiclifshitz interfaces in $o(n)$ heisenberg magnet or $o(n)$ gross-neveu modelprovides the holographic dual conformal field theory and propose experimentaltest of (inverse) higgs mechanism for massive and partially masslesshigher-spin fields.
