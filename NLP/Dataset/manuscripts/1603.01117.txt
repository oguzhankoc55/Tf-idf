the fock space of loopy spin networks for quantum gravity in the context of the coarse-graining of loop quantum gravity, we introduceloopy and tagged spin networks, which generalize the standard spin networkstates to account explicitly for non-trivial curvature and torsion. bothstructures relax the closure constraints imposed at the spin network vertices.while tagged spin networks merely carry an extra spin at every vertex encodingthe overall closure defect, loopy spin networks allow for an arbitrary numberof loops attached to each vertex. these little loops can be interpreted aslocal excitations of the quantum gravitational field and we discuss thestatistics to endow them with. the resulting fock space of loopy spin networksrealizes new truncation of loop quantum gravity, allowing to formulate itsgraph-changing dynamics on a fixed background graph plus local degrees offreedom attached to the graph nodes. this provides a framework forre-introducing a non-trivial background quantum geometry around which we wouldstudy the effective dynamics of perturbations. we study how to implement thedynamics of topological bf theory in this framework. we realize the projectionon flat connections through holonomy constraints and we pay special attentionto their often overlooked non-trivial flat solutions defined by higherderivatives of the $\delta$-distribution.
