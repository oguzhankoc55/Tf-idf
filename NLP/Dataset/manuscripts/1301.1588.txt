derivation of einstein-cartan theory from general relativity this article presents a derivation of einstein cartan theory (ec) fromgeneral relativity. part one derives translational holonomy around one kerrmass and an integral version of torsion as holonomy/area with no additionalassumptions or parameters. part two computes the classical continuum limit ofdistributions of kerr masses that converge to a continuum with constantdensities of mass, angular momentum (a.m.), and charge. the limit generatestorsion and the spin-torsion relationship of ec. this construction of curvatureand torsion is equivalent to definition of curvature with cartan forms on fiberbundles. the continuum limit assumes inequalities relating mass, a.m., loopradius, and charge. the inequality a^2 &lt;&lt; r^2 restricts the derivation toscales larger than that of atoms. advantages of ec include accommodatingexchange of classical intrinsic and orbital a.m. (as in turbulence), and verylikely providing a better classical limit for quantum gravity, where treatmentof spin is more important than in classical physics. according to otherresearch, ec generates inflation-like expansion in high density friedmanncosmologies and eliminates singularities in schwarzschild kerr models.
