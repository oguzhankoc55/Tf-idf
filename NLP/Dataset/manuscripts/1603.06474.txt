robert dicke and the naissance of experimental gravity physics,  1957-1967 the experimental study of gravity became much more active in the late 1950s,a change pronounced enough be termed the birth, or naissance, of experimentalgravity physics. i present a review of developments in this subject since 1915,through the broad range of new approaches that commenced in the late 1950s, andup to the transition of experimental gravity physics to what might be termed anormal and accepted part of physical science in the late 1960s. this reviewshows the importance of advances in technology, here as in all branches ofnatural science. the role of contingency is illustrated by robert dicke'sdecision in the mid-1950s to change directions in mid-career, to lead aresearch group dedicated to the experimental study of gravity. the review alsoshows the power of nonempirical evidence. some in the 1950s felt that generalrelativity theory is so logically sound as to be scarcely worth the testing.but dicke and others argued that a poorly tested theory is only that, and thatother nonempirical arguments, based on mach's principle and dirac's largenumbers hypothesis, suggested it would be worth looking for a better theory ofgravity. i conclude by offering lessons from this history, some peculiar to thestudy of gravity physics during the naissance, some of more general relevance.the central lesson, which is familiar but not always well advertised, is thatphysical theories can be empirically established, sometimes with surprisingresults.
