cft driven cosmology and conformal higher spin fields conformal higher spin (chs) field theory, which is a solid part of recentadvanced checks of ads/cft correspondence, finds applications in cosmology.hidden sector of weakly interacting chs fields suggests a resolution of thehierarchy problem in the model of initial conditions for inflationary cosmologydriven by a conformal field theory. these initial conditions are set by thermalgarland type cosmological instantons in the sub-planckian energy range for themodel of chs fields with a large positive coefficient $\beta$ of thegauss-bonnet term in their total conformal anomaly and a large number of theirpolarizations $\mathbb{n}$. the upper bound of this range $m_p/\sqrt\beta$ isshown to be much lower than the gravitational cutoff $m_p/\sqrt\mathbb{n}$which is defined by the requirement of smallness of the perturbativelynonrenormalizable graviton loop contributions. in this way we justify theapproximation scheme in which the nonrenormalizable graviton sector is subjectto effective field theory under this cutoff, whereas the renormalizable sectorof multiple chs fields is treated beyond perturbation theory and dynamicallygenerates the bound on the inflation scale of the cft cosmology$m_p/\sqrt\beta\ll m_p/\sqrt\mathbb{n}$. this confirms recent predictions forthe origin of the starobinsky $r^2$ and higgs inflation models from the chscosmology, which occurs at the energy scale three or four orders of magnitudebelow the gravitational cutoff, $\sqrt{\mathbb{n}/\beta}\sim 10^{-3}\div10^{-4}$. we also consider cosmological models dominated by fermionic chsfields with a negative $\beta$ and anomaly free models of infinite towers ofchs fields with $\beta=0$ and briefly discuss the status of unitarity in chsmodels.
