results of the deepest all-sky survey for continuous gravitational waves  on ligo s6 data running on the einstein@home volunteer distributed computing  project we report results of a deep all-sky search for periodic gravitational wavesfrom isolated neutron stars in data from the s6 ligo science run. the searchwas possible thanks to the computing power provided by the volunteers of theeinstein@home distributed computing project. we find no significant signalcandidate and set the most stringent upper limits to date on the amplitude ofgravitational wave signals from the target population. at the frequency of beststrain sensitivity, between $170.5$ and $171$ hz we set a 90% confidence upperlimit of ${5.5}^{-25}$, while at the high end of our frequency range, around505 hz, we achieve upper limits $\simeq {10}^{-24}$. at $230$ hz we can excludesources with ellipticities greater than $10^{-6}$ within 100 pc of earth withfiducial value of the principal moment of inertia of $10^{38} \textrm{kg m}^2$.if we assume a higher (lower) gravitational wave spindown we constrain farther(closer) objects to higher (lower) ellipticities.
