interior volumes of extremal and ($1+d$) dimensional schwarzschild black  holes it has already been shown for the reissner-nordstr{\"o}m and kerr black holesthat the maximum interior volume enclosed by the event horizon ceases to zeroin the extremal limit. we show here that if we start with an extremal blackhole at the beginning, corresponding volume is non-zero. interestingly, bothfor the extremal reissner-nordstr{\"o}m and kerr, this value comes out to beequal to one quarter of the horizon area, which is the entropy of the blackhole. next the same quantity is calculated for the ($1+d$)-dimensionalschwarzschild case. taking into account the mass change due to hawkingradiation, we show that the volume increases towards the end of theevaporation. this fact is not new as it has been observed earlier for fourdimensional case. the interesting point we observe is that this increase ratedecreases towards the higher value of space dimensions $d$; i.e. it is adecelerated expansion of volume with the increase of spacial dimensions. thisimplies that for a sufficiently large $d$, the maximum interior volume does notchange. the possible implications of these results are also discussed.
