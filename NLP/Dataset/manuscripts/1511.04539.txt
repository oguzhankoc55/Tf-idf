network geometry with flavor: from complexity to quantum geometry here we introduce the network geometry with flavor $s=-1,0,1$ (ngf)describing simplicial complexes defined in arbitrary dimension $d$ and evolvingby a non-equilibrium dynamics. the ngf can generate discrete geometries ofdifferent nature, ranging from chains and higher dimensional manifolds toscale-free networks with small-world properties, scale-free degree distributionand non-trivial community structure. the ngf admits as limiting cases both thebianconi-barab\'asi model for complex networks the stochastic apolloniannetwork, and the recently introduced model for complex quantum networkmanifolds. the thermodynamic properties of ngf reveal that ngf obeys ageneralized area law opening a new scenario for formulating its coarse-grainedlimit. the structure of ngf is strongly dependent on the dimensionality $d$. wealso show that ngf admits a quantum mechanical description in terms ofassociated quantum network states. quantum network states are evolving by amarkovian dynamics and a quantum network state at time $t$ encodes all possiblengf evolutions up to time $t$. interestingly the ngf remains fully classicalbut its statistical properties reveal the relation to its quantum mechanicaldescription. in fact the $\delta$-dimensional faces of the ngf have generalizeddegrees that follow either the fermi-dirac, boltzmann or bose-einsteinstatistics depending on the flavor $s$ and the dimensions $d$ and $\delta$.
