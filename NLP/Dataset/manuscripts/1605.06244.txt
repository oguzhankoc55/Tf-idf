circular orbits in the taub-nut and mass-less taub-nut space-time in this work we study the equatorial causal geodesics of the taub-nut(tn)space-time in comparison with \emph{mass-less} tn space-time. we emphasizedboth on the null circular geodesics and time-like circular geodesics. from theeffective potential diagram of null and time-like geodesics, we differentiatethe geodesics structure between tn spacetime and mass-less tn space-time. ithas been shown that there is a key role of the nut parameter to changes theshape of pattern of the potential well in the nut spacetime in comparison withmass-less nut space-time. we compared the isco (innermost stable circularorbit), mbco (marginally bound circular orbit) and cpo (circular photon orbit)of the said space-time with graphically in comparison with mass-less cases.moreover, we compute the radius of isco, mbco and cpo for \emph{extreme} tnblack hole. interestingly, we show that these \emph{three radii} coincides withthe killing horizon i.e. the null geodesic generators of the horizon. finallyin appendix, we compute the center-of-mass energy for tn bh and mass-less tnbh. we find in both cases the center-of-mass energy is finite. for\emph{extreme} nut bh, we find the infinite amount of center-of-mass energy.this is \emph{first} we observe that a non-asymptotic extreme sphericallysymmetric, stationary spacetime showing such feature.
