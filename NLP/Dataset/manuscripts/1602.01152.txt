was there a negative vacuum energy in your past? a model for gravitational collapse where the event horizon is a quantumcritical phase transition is extended to provide an explanation for the originof the observable universe, where the expanding universe that we observe todaywas proceeded by a flat universe with a negative cosmological constant. inprincipal this allows one derive all the features of our universe from a singleparameter: the magnitude of the pre-big bang negative vacuum energy density. inthis paper a simple model for the big bang is introduced which allows us torelate the present day energy density and temperature fluctuations of the cmb,to the present day density of dark matter. this model for the big bang alsomakes a dramatic prediction: dark matter mostly consists of compact objectswith a masses on the order of 10^4 solar masses. remarkably this is consistentwith numerical simulations for how primordial fluctuations in the density ofdark give rise to the observed inhomogeneous distribution of matter in ouruniverse. our model for the big bang also allows for the production of somecompact objects with masses greater than 10^4 solar masses, which is consistentwith numerical simulations of structure formation which require massiveprimordial comapact objects as the seeds for galaxies in order to explaingalactic morphologies.
