cosmological study of some s-brane solutions in m-theory a cosmological analysis considering the inclusion of dark energy and darkmatter cosmic components in the context of some particular cases forintersecting s-brane solutions is presented and discussed. direct solution of$d$-dim field equations and dimensional reduction processes, are implementedfor the pure dark energy and dark energy with dark matter cosmologicalscenarios, respectively. in the first case, explicit expressions and evolutionfor $d$-dim scale factors are founded and studied. secondly, a low energyeffective $4$-dim model is obtained analytically and their resulting fieldequations are solved numerically. the role of internal space geometry is alwaysa central element of our analysis. in some intersecting cases and under certainconsiderations, a suitable late-time cosmic acceleration description is foundedand an adequate behavior for scale factor $a(t)$ and realistic values for darkenergy $\omega_{de}$ and dark matter $\omega_{dm}$ relative energy densitiesare obtained as well. as a result, we do specifically obtain late-time cosmicacceleration in one scenario where our universe makes part either of ansm2$\bot$sm2 or an sm2$\bot$sm5 intersection. this could give rise to furtherpossible configurations where late-time cosmic acceleration is present.
