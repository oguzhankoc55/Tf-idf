black hole chemistry: thermodynamics with lambda we review recent developments on the thermodynamics of black holes inextended phase space, where the cosmological constant is interpreted asthermodynamic pressure and treated as a thermodynamic variable in its ownright. in this approach, the mass of the black hole is no longer regarded asinternal energy, rather it is identified with the chemical enthalpy. this leadsto an extended dictionary for black hole thermodynamic quantities, inparticular a notion of thermodynamic volume emerges for a given black holespacetime. this volume is conjectured to satisfy the reverse isoperimetricinequality - an inequality imposing a bound on the amount of entropy black holecan carry for a fixed thermodynamic volume. new thermodynamic phase transitionsnaturally emerge from these identifications. namely, we show that black holescan be understood from the viewpoint of chemistry, in terms of concepts such asvan der waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points. we alsoreview the recent attempts at extending the ads/cft dictionary in this setting,discuss the connections with horizon thermodynamics, applications to lifshitzspacetimes, and outline possible future directions in this field.
