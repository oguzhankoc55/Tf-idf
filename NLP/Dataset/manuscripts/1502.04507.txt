searching for a cosmological preferred axis in complicated class of  cosmological models:case study $f(r,t)$ model recent astronomical observations show that the universe may be anisotropic onlarge scales. the union2 snia data hint that the universe has a preferreddirection. if such a cosmological privileged axis indeed exists, one has toconsider an anisotropic expanding universe instead of the isotropiccosmological model. in this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the darkenergy dipole in $f(r,t)=f_{1}(r)+f_{2}(t)$ cosmological model using threetypes of dipole fit (df) method which are (i)dipole + monopole fitting fordistance modulus(dmfdm), (ii)dipole + monopole fitting for luminositydistance(dmfld) and (iii) general dipole fitting for luminositydistance(gdfld). we have found the maximum anisotropic deviation direction for(dmfdm) method as $(l, b)=(315^{+25}_{-25},-23^{+14}_{-15})$, for (dmfld) as$(l, b)=(l, b)=(315^{+35}_{-37},-23^{+18}_{-18})$, and for (gdfld) method as$(l, b)=(317^{+32}_{-32},-23^{+18}_{-18})$ which are located very close to eachother. we compare our model with the $cpl$, $\lambda cdm$ and $\omega cdm$models. constraints on $(l, b)$ in $f(r, t)$ model are not much different fromthe cases of the $cpl$, $\lambda cdm$ and $\omega cdm$ models. moreover, theresults are consistent with other studies.
