cosmology emerging as the gauge structure of a nonlinear quantum system berry phases and gauge structures in parameter spaces of quantum systems arethe foundation of a broad range of quantum effects such as quantum hall effectsand topological insulators. the gauge structures of interacting many-bodysystems, which often present exotic features, are particularly interesting.while quantum systems are intrinsically linear due to the superpositionprinciple, nonlinear quantum mechanics can arise as an effective theory forinteracting systems (such as condensates of interacting bosons). here we showthat gauge structures similar to curved spacetime can arise in nonlinearquantum systems where the superposition principle breaks down. in the canonicalformalism of the nonlinear quantum mechanics, the geometric phases of quantumevolutions can be formulated as the classical geometric phases of a harmonicoscillator that represents the bogoliubov excitations. we find that theclassical geometric phase can be described by a de sitter universe. thefundamental frequency of the harmonic oscillator plays the role of the cosmicscale factor and the classical geometric phase is an integral of a differentialangle 2-form, which is half of the curvature 2-form of the associated de sitteruniverse. while the gauge structure of a linear quantum system presentsmonopole singularity at energy level degeneracy points, nonlinear quantumsystems, corresponding to their quantum critical surfaces in the parameterspaces, exhibits a conic singularity in their gauge structure, which mimics thecasual singularity at the big bang of the de sitter universe. this findingopens up a new approach to studying the gauge and topological structures ofinteracting quantum systems and sets up a new stage for quantum simulation offundamental physics.
