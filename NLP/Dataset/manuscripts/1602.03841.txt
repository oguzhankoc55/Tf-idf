tests of general relativity with gw150914 the ligo detection of gw150914 provides an unprecedented opportunity to studythe two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the large velocity, highlynonlinear regime, and to witness the final merger of the binary and theexcitation of uniquely relativistic modes of the gravitational field. we carryout several investigations to determine whether gw150914 is consistent with abinary black-hole merger in general relativity. we find that the finalremnant's mass and spin, as determined from the low-frequency (inspiral) andhigh-frequency (post-inspiral) phases of the signal, are mutually consistentwith the binary black-hole solution in general relativity. furthermore, thedata following the peak of gw150914 are consistent with the least-dampedquasi-normal mode inferred from the mass and spin of the remnant black hole. byusing waveform models that allow for parameterized general-relativityviolations during the inspiral and merger phases, we perform quantitative testson the gravitational-wave phase in the dynamical regime and we determine thefirst empirical bounds on several high-order post-newtonian coefficients. weconstrain the graviton compton wavelength, assuming that gravitons aredispersed in vacuum in the same way as particles with mass, obtaining a$90\%$-confidence lower bound of $10^{13}$ km. in conclusion, within ourstatistical uncertainties, we find no evidence for violations of generalrelativity in the genuinely strong-field regime of gravity.
