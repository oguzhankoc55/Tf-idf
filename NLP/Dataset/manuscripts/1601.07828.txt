exact cosmological solutions in modified brans-dicke theory in this paper, we obtain exact cosmological vacuum solutions for an extendedflrw homogenous and isotropic brans-dicke (bd) universe in five dimensions forall values of the curvature index. then, by employing the equations associatedto a modified brans-dicke theory (mbdt) [1], we construct the physics on afour-dimensional hypersurface. we show that the induced matter obeys theequation of state of a fluid of a barotropic type. we discuss the properties ofsuch an induced matter for some values of the equation of state parameter andanalyze in detail their corresponding solutions. to illustrate the cosmologicalbehaviors of the solutions, we contrast our solutions with those present thestandard brans-dicke theory. we retrieve that, in mbdt scenario, it isimpossible to find a physically acceptable solution associated to the negativecurvature for both the dust-dominated and radiation-dominated universes.however, for a spatially flat and closed universes, we argue that our obtainedsolutions are more general than those associated to the standard bd theory and,moreover, they contain a few classes of solutions which have no analog in thebd cosmology. for those particular cases, we further compare the results withthose extracted in the context of the induced matter theory (imt) and generalrelativity (gr). furthermore, we discuss in detail the time behaviors of thecosmological quantities and compare them with recent observational data. wefind a favorable range for the deceleration parameter associated to amatter-dominated spatially flat universe (for the late times) which iscompatible with recent corresponding observational results.
