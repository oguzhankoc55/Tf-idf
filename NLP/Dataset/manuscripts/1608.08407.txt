erdmessung mit quanten und relativit\"at recent developments in fundamental physics (in theory as well as intechnology) provide novel capabilities for geodetic applications such asrefined observations of the earth`s gravity field. we will focus on two newconcepts: one applies atomic interferometry for (satellite) gravimetry, theother uses clock measurements for observing potential values. in the firstcase, gravity anomalies are determined by observing free-falling atoms (quantumgravimetry), such technique can also be applied for future gradiometricmeasurements in space. in the second case according to einstein`s theory ofgeneral relativity, frequency comparisons of highly precise optical clocks giveaccess to differences of the gravity potential, even over long distances(relativistic geodesy). also laser interferometry between test masses in spacewith nanometer accuracy belongs to these novel concepts. for the latter,technology developed for gravitational wave detection and successfully testedin the lisa/pathfinder mission is being prepared for geodetic measurements.those concepts are recently elaborated in close cooperation between physicistsand geodesists at the university of hannover under the umbrella of thecollaborative research center sfb 1128 relativistic geodesy and gravimetry withquantum sensors (geo-q). we will give a few examples where geodesy willpotentially benefit from these novel developments and show future perspectives.
