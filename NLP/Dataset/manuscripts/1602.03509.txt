implementing a search for gravitational waves from non-precessing,  spinning binary black holes searching for gravitational waves (gws) from binary black holes (bbhs) withligo and virgo involves matched-filtering data against a set of representativesignal waveforms --- a template bank --- chosen to cover the full signal spaceof interest with as few template waveforms as possible. although the componentblack holes may have significant angular momenta (spin), previous searches forbbhs have filtered ligo and virgo data using only waveforms where bothcomponent spins are zero. this leads to a loss of signal-to-noise ratio forsignals where this is not the case. combining the best available templateplacement techniques and waveform models, we construct a template bank of gwsignals from bbhs with component spins $\chi_{1,2}\in [-0.99, 0.99]$ alignedwith the orbital angular momentum, component masses $m_{1,2}\in [2,48]\,\mathrm{m}_\odot$, and total mass $m_\mathrm{total} \leq50\,\mathrm{m}_\odot$. using effective-one-body waveforms with spin effects, weshow that less than $3\%$ of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (snr) of thesesignals is lost due to the discreetness of the bank, using the early advancedligo noise curve. we use simulated advanced ligo noise to compare thesensitivity of this bank to a non-spinning bank covering the same parameterspace. in doing so, we consider the competing effects between improved snr andsignal-based vetoes, and the increase in the rate of false alarms of thealigned-spin bank due to covering a larger parameter space. we find that thealigned-spin bank can be a factor of $1.3$ -- $5$ more sensitive than anon-spinning bank to bbhs with dimensionless spins $&gt; +0.6$ and componentmasses $\gtrsim 20\,\mathrm{m}_\odot$. even larger gains are obtained forsystems with equally high spins but smaller component masses.
