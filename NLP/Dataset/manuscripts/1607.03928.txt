interacting dark matter and q-deformed dark energy with particle  creation and annihilation we propose a new model for studying the dark constituents of the universe byregarding the dark energy as a q-deformed scalar field interacting with thedark matter, in the framework of standard general relativity. here we assumethe number of particles in each mode of the q-deformed scalar field varies intime by the particle creation and annihilation. we first describe theq-deformed scalar field dark energy quantum field theoretically, then constructthe action and the dynamical structure of these interacting dark sector, inorder to study the dynamics of the model. in the following section, we performthe phase space analysis of the model to confirm and interpret our proposal bysearching the stable attractor solutions implying the late-time acceleratingphase of the universe. we then obtain the result that when interaction andequation of state parameter of the dark matter evolves from the present dayvalues into a particular value, the dark energy turns out to be a q-deformedscalar field.
