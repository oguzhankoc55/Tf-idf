global embeddings and hydrodynamic properties of kerr black hole in the presence of a rotating kerr black hole, we investigate hydrodynamicsof the massive particles and massless photons, to construct relations amongnumber density, pressure and internal energy density of the massive particlesand photons around the rotating kerr black hole and to study an accretion ontothe black hole. on equatorial plane of the kerr black hole, we investigate thebound orbits of the massive particles and photons around the black hole toproduce their radial, azimuthal and precession frequencies. with thesefrequencies we study the black holes gro~j1655-40 and 4u~1543-47, to explicitlyobtain the radial, azimuthal and precession frequencies of the massiveparticles in the flow of perfect fluid. we next consider the massive particlesin the stable circular orbit of radius of $1.0~ly$ around the supernovas sn1979c, sn 1987a and sn 2213-1745 in the kerr curved spacetime, and around thepotential supermassive schwarzschild black holes m87, ngc 3115, ngc 4594, ngc3377, ngc 4258, m31, m32 and galatic center, to estimate their radial andazimuthal frequencies, which are shown to be the same results as those in noprecession motion. the photon unstable orbit is also discussed in terms of theimpact parameter of the photon trajectory. finally, on the equatorial plane ofthe kerr black hole, we construct the global flat embedding structurespossessing (9+3) dimensionalities outside and inside the event horizon of therotating kerr black hole. moreover, on the plane we investigate the warpproducts of the kerr spacetime.
