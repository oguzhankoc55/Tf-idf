boundary dynamics of three-dimensional asymptotically anti-de sitter  space-times this thesis is organized as follows. in chapter 2, some preliminaries aregiven on isometries and conformal symmetries, and we become familiar with thevirasoro algebra. two examples of classical central charges are discussed.chapter 3 contains an introduction to the hamiltonian formulation of gaugetheories in the context of maxwell theory. the knowledge gained in chapter 3 isapplied to general relativity in chapter 4. the hamiltonian is shown to acquirea surface term due to the presence of the boundary. the geometrical propertiesof anti-de sitter space and the btz black hole are the subject of chapter 5.the main part of the discussion follows in chapter 6, which contains thecalculation of the central charge in the asymptotic symmetry algebra ofasymptotically ads3 space-times. after some preliminaries on the ads/cftcorrespondence and chern-simons theory, the derivation of the boundaryconformal field theory is summarized in chapter 7. finally, strominger'sentropy calculation is presented in chapter 8, along with some comments on thisapproach.
