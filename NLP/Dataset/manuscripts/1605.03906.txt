classical and quantum nonlocal supergravity we derive the n=1 supersymmetric extension for a class of weakly nonlocalfour dimensional gravitational theories.the construction is explicitly done inthe superspace and the tree-level perturbative unitarity is explicitly provedboth in the superfield formalism and in field components. for the minimalnonlocal supergravity the spectrum is the same as in the local theory and inparticular it is ghost-free. the supersymmetric extension of thesuper-renormalizable starobinsky theory and of two alternative massive nonlocalsupergravities are found as straightforward applications of the formalism.power-counting arguments ensure super-renormalizability with milder requirementfor the asymptotic behavior of form factors than in ordinary nonlocal gravity.the most noteworthy result, common to ordinary supergravity, is the absence ofquantum corrections to the cosmological constant in any regularizationprocedure. we cannot exclude the usual one-loop quadratic divergences. however,local vertices in the superfields, not undergoing renormalization, can beintroduced to cancel out such divergences. therefore, quantum finiteness iscertainly achieved in dimensional regularization and most likely also in thecut-off regularization scheme. we also discuss the n-point scatteringamplitudes making use of a general field redefinition theorem implemented inthe superspace. finally, we show that all the exact solutions of the localsupergravity in vacuum are solutions of the nonlocal one too. in particular, wehave the usual schwarzschild singularity. we infer that the weak nonlocality,even in the presence of minimal supersymmetry, is not sufficient to solve thespacetime singularities issue, although the theory is finite at quantum level.
