quantum theory of the generalised uncertainty principle and the  existence of a minimal length we extend significantly previous works on the hilbert space representationsof the generalized uncertainty principle (gup) in 3+1 dimensions of the form$[x_i,p_j] = i f_{ij}$ where $ f_{ij} = f(p^2) \delta_{ij} + g(p^2) p_i p_j $for any functions $f$. however, we restrict our study to the case of commuting$x$'s. we focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimallength that emerge in some cases. we first show that, at the algebraic level,there exists an unambiguous mapping between the gup with a deformed quantumalgebra and a quadratic hamiltonian into a standard, heisenberg algebra ofoperators and an aquadratic hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of thesymmetries is modified accordingly. the theory can also be mapped to acompletely standard quantum mechanics with standard symmetries, but withmomentum dependent position operators. next, we investigate the hilbert spacerepresentations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus,specifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. we carry the functionalanalysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of aminimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators oftranslations and the physical momenta. in particular, because this relationshipis preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimallength is present in the standard gup, it is also present in the correspondingaquadratic hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra ofthis model. in general, a minimal length requires bounded generators oftranslations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this dependson the precise shape of the function $f$ defined previously. this resultprovides an elegant and unambiguous classification of which universal quantumgravity corrections lead to the emergence of a minimal length.
