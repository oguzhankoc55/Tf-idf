hamiltonian dynamics of cosmological quintessence models the time-evolution dynamics of two nonlinear cosmological real gas models hasbeen reexamined in detail with methods from the theory of hamiltonian dynamicalsystems. these examples are frwl cosmologies, one based on a gas, satisfyingthe van der waals equation and another one based on the virial expansion gasequation. the cosmological variables used are the expansion rate, given by thehubble parameter, and the energy density. the analysis is aided by theexistence of global first integral as well as several special (second)integrals in each case. in addition, the global first integral can serve as ahamiltonian for a canonical hamiltonian formulation of the evolution equations.the conserved quantities lead to the existence of stable periodic solutions(closed orbits) which are models of a cyclic universe. the second integralsallow for explicit solutions as functions of time on some special trajectoriesand thus for a deeper understanding of the underlying physics. in particular,it is shown that any possible static equilibrium is reachable only for infinitetime.
