dynamical gravitational coupling as a modified theory of general  relativity a modified theory of general relativity is proposed, where the gravitationalconstant is replaced by a dynamical variable in space-time. the dynamics of thegravitational coupling is described by a family of parametrized null geodesics,implying that the gravitational coupling at a space-time point is determined bysolving transport equations along all null geodesics through this point.  general relativity with dynamical gravitational coupling (dgc) is introduced.we motivate dgc from general considerations and explain how it arises in thecontext of causal fermion systems. the underlying physical idea is that thegravitational coupling is determined by microscopic structures on the planckscale which propagate with the speed of light.  in order to clarify the mathematical structure, we analyze the conformalbehavior and prove local existence and uniqueness of the time evolution. thedifferences to einstein's theory are worked out in the examples of thefriedmann-robertson-walker model and the spherically symmetric collapse of ashell of matter. potential implications for the problem of dark matter and forinflation are discussed. it is shown that the effects in the solar system aretoo small for being observable in present-day experiments.
