global properties of physically interesting lorentzian spacetimes under normal circumstances most members of the general relativity communityfocus almost exclusively on the local properties of spacetime, such as thelocally euclidean structure of the manifold and the lorentzian signature of themetric tensor. when combined with the classical einstein field equations thisgives an extremely successful empirical model of classical gravity andclassical matter --- at least as long as one does not ask too many awkwardquestions about global issues, (such as global topology and global causalstructure). we feel however that this is a tactical error --- even withoutinvoking full-fledged "quantum gravity" we know that the standard model ofparticle physics is also an extremely good representation of some parts ofempirical reality; and we had better be able to carry over all the goodfeatures of the standard model of particle physics --- at least into the realmof semi-classical quantum gravity. doing so gives us some interesting globalfeatures that spacetime should possess: on physical grounds spacetime should bespace-orientable, time-orientable, and spacetime-orientable, and it shouldpossess a globally defined tetrad (vierbein, or in general a globally definedvielbein/n-bein). so on physical grounds spacetime should be parallelizable.this strongly suggests that the metric is not the fundamental physicalquantity; a very good case can be made for the tetrad being more fundamentalthan the metric. furthermore, a globally-defined "almost complex structure" isalmost unavoidable. ideas along these lines have previously been mooted, butmuch is buried in the pre-arxiv literature and is either forgotten orinaccessible. we shall revisit these ideas taking a perspective very much basedon empirical physical observation.
