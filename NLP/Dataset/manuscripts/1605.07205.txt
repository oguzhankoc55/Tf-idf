initial-data contribution to the error budget of gravitational waves  from neutron-star binaries as numerical calculations of inspiralling neutron-star binaries reach valuesof accuracy that are comparable with those of binary black holes, a finebudgeting of the various sources of error becomes increasingly important. amongsuch sources, the initial data is normally not accounted for, the rationalebeing that the error on the initial spacelike hypersurface is always farsmaller than the one gained during the evolution. we here consider criticallythis assumption and perform a comparative analysis of the gravitationalwaveforms relative to essentially the same physical binary configuration whencomputed with two different initial-data codes, and then evolved with the sameevolution code. more specifically, we consider the evolution of irrotationalneutron-star binaries computed either with the pseudo-spectral code \lorene{},or with the newly developed finite-difference code \cocal{}; both sets ofinitial data are subsequently evolved with the high-order evolution code\whiskythc{}. in this way we find that despite the initial data shows global(local) differences that are $\lesssim 0.02\%\ (1\%)$, the gravitational-wavephase at the merger time differs by $\sim 0.5$ radians after $\sim 3$ orbits, asurprisingly large value. our results highlight the highly nonlinear impactthat errors in the initial data can have on the subsequent evolution and theimportance of using exactly the same initial data when comparative studies aredone.
