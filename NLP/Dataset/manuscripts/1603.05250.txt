a holographic entanglement entropy conjecture for general spacetimes we present a natural generalization of holographic entanglement entropyproposals beyond the scope of ads/cft by anchoring extremal surfaces toholographic screens. holographic screens are a natural extension of the adsboundary to arbitrary spacetimes and are preferred codimension 1 surfaces fromthe viewpoint of the covariant entropy bound. screens have a unique preferredfoliation into codimension 2 surfaces called leaves. our proposal is to findthe areas of extremal surfaces achored to the boundaries of regions in leaves.we show that the properties of holographic screens are sufficient to prove,under generic conditions, that extremal surfaces anchored in this way alwayslie within a causal region associated with a given leaf. within this causalregion, a maximin construction similar to that of wall proves that our proposedquantity satisfies standard properties of entanglement entropy like strongsubadditivity. we conjecture that our prescription computes entanglemententropies in quantum states that holographically define arbitrary spacetimes,including those in a cosmological setting with no obvious boundary on which toanchor extremal surfaces.
