solutions on a brane in a bulk spacetime with kalb-ramond field effective gravitational field equations on a brane have been derived, whenthe bulk spacetime is endowed with the second rank antisymmetric kalb-ramondfield. since both the graviton and the kalb-ramond field are closed stringexcitations, they can propagate in the bulk. after deriving the effectivegravitational field equations on the brane, we solve them for a staticspherically symmetric solution. it turns out that the solution so obtainedrepresents a black hole or naked singularity depending on the parameter spaceof the model. the stability of this model is also discussed. cosmologicalsolutions to the gravitational field equations have been obtained, where thekalb-ramond field is found to behave as normal pressure free matter. forcertain specific choices of the parameters in the cosmological solution, thesolution exhibits a transition in the behaviour of the scale factor and hence atransition in the expansion history of the universe. the possibility ofaccelerated expansion of the universe in this scenario is also discussed.
