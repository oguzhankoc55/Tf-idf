can gravity account for the emergence of classicality? a recent debate has ensued over the claim by pikovski et al. [nat. phys. 11,668 (2015)] that systems with internal degrees of freedom undergo a universal,gravity-induced, type of decoherence that explains their quantum-to-classicaltransition. this decoherence is supposed to arise from the differentgravitational redshifts experienced by such systems when placed in asuperposition of two wave packets at different heights in a gravitationalfield. here we investigate some aspects of the discussion with the aid ofsimple examples. in particular, we first resolve an apparent conflict betweenthe reported results and the equivalence principle by noting that the staticand free-fall descriptions focus on states associated with differenthypersurfaces. next, we emphasize that predictions regarding the observabilityof interference become relevant only in the context of concrete experimentalsettings. as a result, we caution against hasty claims of universal validity.finally, we dispute the claim that, at least in the scenarios discussed bypikovski et al., gravitation is responsible for the reported results, and wequestion the alleged ability of decoherence to explain the quantum-to-classicaltransition. in consequence, we argue against the extraordinary assertion bypikovski et al. that gravity can account for the emergence of classicality.
