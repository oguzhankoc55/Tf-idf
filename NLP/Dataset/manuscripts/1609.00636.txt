phase-transition theory of kerr black holes in electromagnetic field for a kerr black hole (kbh) with spin $j$ and mass $m$ in a steadyelectromagnetic field, a special wald vacuum solution (wvs) has been found inthe case of no-source uniform field. for wvs, the meissner effect (me) occursonly in the the extreme kbh where $m^2/j=1$, in this case, the magnetic fieldis totally excluded from the event horizon (eh) of kbh. however, wvs does notconsider the hawking radiation (hr) but treats kbh as an absolutely black body.if hr is added , researchers believe that the condition is not so restrictedand it is possible for me to occur in less extreme case. how less is the "lessextreme case"? this paper tries to answer this question. since the hawkingtemperature $t_h$ of kbh defined by hr is proportional to the surface gravity$\kappa$ at the eh, this question is actually about the so-calledexistence/non-existence of me (me/nme) or superconducting phase transition. inthis paper, we study the connection between the superconductivity of kbh-eh andthe existence of weyl fermion (wf). using thermodynamic formulas and the kbhstate equation, we prove that the inherent-parameter condition for me to occuris $m^2/j\leq \epsilon_c=1.5$ in force-free fields whether it be in the simpleaxisymmetric vacuum zero source case or in the non-zero source case which canbe described by the nonlinear grad-shafranov (g-s) equation. we suggest thatthis is a second-order phase transition and we calculate the critical exponents$\delta=1$ and $\eta=1/2$ for the specific heat diverging at constant $j$, andthe critical point $(m_c, \omega_c)$, which equals $(1.22\sqrt{ j}, 0.16/\sqrt{j})$ where $\omega$ is the angular velocity of kbh. furthermore we draw thephase diagrams in both $(m, j)$ and $(m,\omega)$ coordinates.
