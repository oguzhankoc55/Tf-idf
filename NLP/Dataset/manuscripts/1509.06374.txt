sharpening the weak gravity conjecture with dimensional reduction we investigate the behavior of the weak gravity conjecture (wgc) undertoroidal compactification and rg flows, finding evidence that wgc bounds forsingle photons become weaker in the infrared. by contrast, we find that aphoton satisfying the wgc will not necessarily satisfy it after toroidalcompactification when black holes charged under the kaluza-klein photons areconsidered. doing so either requires an infinite number of states of differentcharges to satisfy the wgc in the original theory or a restriction on allowedcompactification radii. these subtleties suggest that if the weak gravityconjecture is true, we must seek a stronger form of the conjecture that isrobust under compactification. we propose a "lattice weak gravity conjecture"that meets this requirement: a superextremal particle should exist for everycharge in the charge lattice. the perturbative heterotic string satisfies thisconjecture. we also use compactification to explore the extent to which the wgcapplies to axions. we argue that gravitational instanton solutions in theoriesof axions coupled to dilaton-like fields are analogous to extremal black holes,motivating a wgc for axions. this is further supported by a match between theinstanton action and that of wrapped black branes in a higher-dimensional uvcompletion.
