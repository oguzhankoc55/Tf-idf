emergent space-time via a geometric renormalization method we present a purely geometric renormalization scheme for metric spaces(including uncolored graphs), which consists of a coarse graining and arescaling operation on such spaces. the coarse graining is based on the conceptof quasi-isometry, which yields a sequence of discrete coarse grained spaceseach having a continuum limit under the rescaling operation. we providecriteria under which such sequences do converge within a superspace of metricspaces, or may constitute the basin of attraction of a common continuum limit,which hopefully, may represent our space-time continuum.  we discuss some of the properties of these coarse grained spaces as well astheir continuum limits, such as scale invariance and metric similarity, andshow that different layers of spacetime can carry different distance functionswhile being homeomorphic.  important tools in this analysis are the gromov-hausdorff distance functionalfor general metric spaces and the growth degree of graphs or networks. thewhole construction is in the spirit of the wilsonian renormalization group.  furthermore we introduce a physically relevant notion of dimension on thespaces of interest in our analysis, which e.g. for regular lattices reduces tothe ordinary lattice dimension. we show that this dimension is stable under theproposed coarse graining procedure as long as the latter is sufficiently local,i.e. quasi-isometric, and discuss the conditions under which this dimension isan integer. we comment on the possibility that the limit space may turn out tobe fractal in case the dimension is non-integer. at the end of the paper webriefly mention the possibility that our network carries a translocal far-orderwhich leads to the concept of wormhole spaces and a scale dependent dimensionif the coarse graining procedure is no longer local.
