late time accelerated scaling attractors in dgp  (dvali-gabadadze-porrati) braneworld in the evolution of late universe, the main source of matter are dark energyand dark matter. they are indirectly detected only through their gravitationalmanifestations. so the possibility of interaction with each other withoutviolating observational restrictions is not ruled out. with this motivation, weinvestigate the dynamics of dgp braneworld where source of dark energy is ascalar field and it interacts with matter source. since observation favoursphantom case more, we have also studied the dynamics of interacting phantomscalar field. in non interacting dgp braneworld there are no late timeaccelerated scaling attractors and hence cannot alleviate coincidence problem.in this paper, we shall show that it is possible to get late time acceleratedscaling solutions. the phase space is studied by taking two categories ofpotentials (exponential and non exponential functions). the stability ofcritical points are examined by taking two specific interactions. the firstinteraction gives late time accelerated scaling solution for phantom field onlyunder exponential potential, while for second interaction we do not get anyscaling solution. furthermore, we have shown that this scaling solution is alsoclassically stable.
