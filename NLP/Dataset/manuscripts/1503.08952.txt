analytical expression for a class of spherically symmetric solutions in  lorentz breaking massive gravity we present a detailed study of the spherically symmetric solutions in lorentzbreaking massive gravity. there is an undetermined function $\mathcal{f}(x,w_1, w_2, w_3)$ in the action of st\"{u}ckelberg fields$s_{\phi}=\lambda^4\int{d^4x\sqrt{-g}\mathcal{f}}$, which should be resolvedthrough physical means. in the general relativity, the spherically symmetricsolution to the einstein equation is a benchmark and its massive deformationalso play a crucial role in lorentz breaking massive gravity. $\mathcal{f}$will satisfy the constraint equation $t_0^1=0$ from the spherically symmetriceinstein tensor $g_0^1=0$, if we maintain that any reasonable physical theoryshould possess the spherically symmetric solutions. the st\"{u}ckelberg field$\phi^i$ is taken as a 'hedgehog' configuration $\phi^i=\phi(r)x^i/r$, whosestability is guaranteed by the topological one. under this ans\"{a}tz,$t_0^1=0$ is reduced to $d\mathcal{f}=0$. the functions $\mathcal{f}$ for$d\mathcal{f}=0$ form a commutative ring $r^{\mathcal{f}}$. we obtain a generalexpression of solution to the functional differential equation with sphericallysymmetry if $\mathcal{f}\in r^{\mathcal{f}}$. if $\mathcal{f}\inr^{\mathcal{f}}$ and $\partial\mathcal{f}/\partial x=0$, the functions$\mathcal{f}$ form a subring $s^{\mathcal{f}}\subset r^{\mathcal{f}}$. we showthat the metric is schwarzschild, ads or ds if $\mathcal{f}\ins^{\mathcal{f}}$. when $\mathcal{f}\in r^{\mathcal{f}}$ but $\mathcal{f}\notins^{\mathcal{f}}$, we will obtain some new metric solutions. using the generalformula and the basic property of function ring $r^{\mathcal{f}}$, we give someanalytical examples and their phenomenological applications. furthermore, wealso discuss the stability of gravitational field by the analysis of komarintegral and the results of qnms.
