the quantum black hole as a hydrogen atom: microstates without strings  attached applying an expansion in spherical harmonics, turns the black hole with itsmicrostates into something about as transparent as the hydrogen atom was in theearly days of quantum mechanics. it enables us to present a concise descriptionof the evolution laws of these microstates, linking them to perturbativequantum field theory, in the background of the schwarzschild metric. threepieces of insight are obtained: one, we learn how the gravitational backreaction, whose dominant component can be calculated exactly, turns particlesentering the hole, into particles leaving it, by exchanging the momentum- andposition operators; two, we find out how this effect removes firewalls, both onthe future and the past event horizon, and three, we discover that the presenceof region ii in the penrose diagram forces a topological twist in thebackground metric, culminating in antipodal identification. although a cut-offis required that effectively replaces the transverse coordinates by a lattice,the effect of such a cut-off minimizes when the spherical wave expansion isapplied. this expansion then reveals exactly how antipodal identificationrestores unitarity - for each partial wave separately. we expect that theseideas will provide new insights in some highly non-trivial topologicalspace-time features at the planck scale.
