spectroscopic analysis of stellar mass black-hole mergers in our local  universe with ground-based gravitational wave detectors motivated by the recent discoveries of binary black-hole mergers by theadvanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (advanced ligo),we investigate the prospects of ground-based detectors to perform aspectroscopic analysis of signals emitted during the ringdown of the final kerrblack-hole formed by a stellar mass binary black-hole merger. although it isunlikely that advanced ligo can measure multiple modes of the ringdown,assuming an optimistic rate of 240 gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, upgrades to theexisting ligo detectors could measure multiple ringdown modes in $\sim$6detections per year. new ground-based facilities such as einstein telescope orcosmic explorer could measure multiple ringdown modes in over 300 events peryear. we perform monte-carlo injections of $10^{6}$ binary black-hole mergersin a search volume defined by a sphere of radius 1500 mpc centered at thedetector, for various proposed ground-based detector models. we assume auniform random distribution in component masses of the progenitor binaries, skypositions and orientations to investigate the fraction of the population thatsatisfy our criteria for detectability and resolvability of multiple ringdownmodes. we investigate the detectability and resolvability of the sub-dominantmodes $l=m=3$, $l=m=4$ and $l=2, m=1$. our results indicate that the modes with$l=m=3$ and $l=2, m=1$ are the most promising candidates for sub-dominant modemeasurability. we find that for stellar mass black-hole mergers, resolvabilityis not a limiting criteria for these modes. we emphasize that the measurabilityof the $l=2, m=1$ mode is not impeded by the resolvability criterion. tooptimize the senstivity of a detector for ringdown signals, sensitivity shouldbe tuned to the 300 to 500 hz region.
