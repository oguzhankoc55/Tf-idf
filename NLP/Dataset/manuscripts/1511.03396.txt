von neumann's quantization of general relativity von neumann's procedure is applied for quantization of general relativity. wequantize the initial data of dynamical variables at the planck epoch, where thehubble parameter coincides with the planck mass. these initial data are definedvia the fock simplex in the tangent minkowskian space-time and the diracconformal interval. the einstein cosmological principle is applied for theaverage of the spatial metric determinant logarithm over the spatial volume ofthe visible universe. we derive the splitting of the general coordinatetransformations into the diffeomorphisms (as the object of the second n\"othertheorem) and the initial data transformations (as objects of the first n\"othertheorem). following von neumann, we suppose that the vacuum state is a quantumensemble. the vacuum state is degenerated with respect to quantum numbers ofnon-vacuum states with the distribution function that yields the casimir effectin gravidynamics in analogy to the one in electrodynamics. the generationfunctional of the perturbation theory in gravidynamics is given as a solutionof the quantum energy constraint. we discuss the region of applicability ofgravidynamics and its possible predictions for explanation of the modernobservational and experimental data.
