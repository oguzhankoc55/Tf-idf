the einstein flow with positive cosmological constant on product  manifolds we consider the vacuum einstein flow with a positive cosmological constant onspatial manifolds of product form. in spatial dimension at least four we showthe existence of continuous families of recollapsing models whenever at leastone of the factors or admits a riemannian einstein metric with positiveeinstein constant. we moreover show that these families belong to largercontinuous families with models that have two complete time directions, i.e. donot recollapse. complementarily, we show that whenever no factor has positivecurvature, then any model in the product class expands in one time directionand collapses in the other. in particular, positive curvature of one factor isa necessary criterion for recollapse within this class. finally, we relate ourresults to the instability of the nariai solution in three spatial dimensionsand point out why a similar construction of recollapsing models in thatdimension fails. the present results imply that there exist different classesof initial data which exhibit fundamentally different types of long-timebehavior under the einstein flow whenever the spatial dimension is strictlylarger than three. moreover, this behavior is related to the spatial topologythrough the existence of riemannian einstein metrics of positive curvature.
