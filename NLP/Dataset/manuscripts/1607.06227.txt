state refinements and coarse graining in a full theory embedding of loop  quantum cosmology bridging between descriptions involving few large and many small quantumnumbers is the main open problem in loop quantum gravity. in other words, onewould like to be able to represent the same physical system in terms of a few"coarse" quantum numbers, while the effective dynamics at the coarse levelshould agree with the one induced by a description involving many small quantumnumbers. efforts to understand this relationship face the problem of theenormous computational complexity involved in evolving a generic statecontaining many quanta. in a cosmological context however, certain symmetryassumptions on the quantum states allow to simplify the problem. in this paper,we will show how quantum states describing a spatially flat homogeneous andisotropic universe can be refined while the dynamics of the coarse observablesis unchanged. the involved states are solutions to the hamiltonian constraintwhen terms coming from spatial derivatives are neglected, i.e. one works in theapproximation of non-interacting frw patches. the technical means to arrive atthis result are a version of loop quantum gravity based on variables inspiredby loop quantum cosmology, as well as an exact solution to the quantum dynamicsof loop quantum cosmology which extends to the full theory in the chosenapproximation.
