israel-stewart approach to viscous dissipative extended holographic  ricci dark energy dominated universe this paper reports a study on the truncated israel-stewart formalism for bulkviscosity using the extended holographic ricci dark energy (ehrde), where thedensity of dark energy is given as a combination of the hubble parameter andits derivative. the equations of motion are integrated and the resulting modelis analysed under many aspects, including the state finder parameters and thegeneralised thermodynamics second law. under the consideration that theuniverse is dominated by ehrde the evolution equation for the bulk viscouspressure $\pi$ in the framework of the truncated israel-stewart theory has beentaken as $\tau \dot{\pi}+\pi=-3\xi h$, where $\tau$ is the relaxation time and$\xi$ is the bulk viscosity coefficient. considering effective pressure as asum of thermodynamic pressure of ehrde and bulk viscous pressure it has beenobserved that under the influence of bulk viscosity the eos parameter $w_{de}$is behaving like phantom i.e. $w_{de}\leq -1$. it has been observed that themagnitude of the effective pressure $p_{eff}=p+\pi$ is decaying with time. wealso investigated the case for a specific choice of scale factor namely$a(t)=(t-t_0)^{\frac{\beta}{1-\alpha}}$. for this choice we have observed thata transition from quintessence to phantom is possible for the equation of stateparameter. however, the $\lambda$cdm phase is not attainable by the statefindertrajectories for this choice. finally it has been observed that in both of thecases the generalized second law of thermodynamics is valid for the viscousehrde dominated universe enveloped by the apparent horizon.
