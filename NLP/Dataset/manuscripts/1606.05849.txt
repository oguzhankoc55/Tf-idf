einstein-katz action, variational principle, noether charges and the  thermodynamics of ads-black holes in this paper we describe 4-dimensional gravity coupled to scalar and maxwellfields by the einstein-katz action, that is, the covariant version of the"gamma-gamma $-$ gamma-gamma" part of the hilbert action supplemented by thedivergence of a generalized "katz vector". we consider static solutions ofeinstein's equations, parametrized by some integration constants, whichdescribe an ensemble of asymptotically ads black holes. instead of the usualdirichlet boundary conditions, which aim at singling out a specific solutionwithin the ensemble, we impose that the variation of the action vanishes onshell for the broadest possible class of solutions. we will see that, when along-range scalar "hair" is present, only sub-families of the solutions canobey that criterion. the katz-bicak-lynden-bell ("kbl") superpotential built onthis (generalized) vector will then give straightforwardly the noether chargesassociated with the spacetime symmetries (that is, in the static case, themass). computing the action on shell, we will see next that the solutions whichobey the imposed variational principle, and with noether charges given by thekbl superpotential, satisfy the gibbs relation, the katz vectors playing therole of "counterterms". finally, we show on the specific example of dyonicblack holes that the sub-class selected by our variational principle satisfiesthe first law of thermodynamics when their mass is defined by the kblsuperpotential.
