spacetimes foliated by non-expanding and killing horizons: higher  dimension the theory of non-expanding horizons (neh) geometry and the theory of nearhorizon geometries (nhg) are two mathematical relativity frameworksgeneralizing the black hole theory. from the point of view of the nehs theory,a nhg is just a very special case of a spacetime containing an neh of manyextra symmetries. it can be obtained as the horowitz limit of a neighborhood ofan arbitrary extremal killing horizon. an unexpected relation between the twoof them, was discovered in the study of spacetimes foliated by a family ofnehs. the class of 4-dimensional nhg solutions (either vacuum or coupled to amaxwell field) was found as a family of examples of spacetimes admitting a nehfoliation. in the current paper we systematically investigate geometries of thenehs foliating a spacetime for arbitrary matter content and in arbitraryspacetime dimension. we find that each horizon belonging to the foliationsatisfies a condition that may be interpreted as an invitation for atransversal extremal killing horizon to exist. assuming the existence of atransversal extremal killing horizon, we derive all the spacetime metricssatisfying the vacuum einstein's equations.
