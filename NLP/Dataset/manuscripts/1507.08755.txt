the cosmological constant problem and quantum spacetime reference frame this paper is a generalization of earlier papers [ nucl. phys. b 884, 344(2014) (arxiv:1312.2759) and jhep 6, 63 (2015) (arxiv:1401.2488) ]. wegeneralize the idea of quantum clock time to a quantum spacetime referenceframe via a physical realization of a reference system by quantum rulers andclocks. omitting the internal degrees of freedom (such as spins) of thephysical rulers and clocks, only considering their metric properties, thespacetime reference frame is described by a bosonic non-linear sigma model. westudy the quantum behavior of the system under approximations, and obtain (1) acosmological constant valued $(2/\pi)\rho_{c0}$ ($\rho_{c0}$ is the criticaldensity measured at near current epoch) which is very close to currentobservations; (2) an einstein-hilbert term in the quantum effective action; (3)the ratio of variance to mean-squared of spacetime interval tends to auniversal constant $2/\pi$ in the infrared region. this effect is testable byobserving a linear dependence between the inherent quantum variance andmean-squared of the redshifts from cosmic distant spectral lines. theproportionality is expected to be the observed percentage of the dark energy.we also generalize the equivalence principle to be valid for all quantumphenomenon.
