the mechanics of spacetime - a solid mechanics perspective on the theory  of general relativity we present an elastic constitutive model for gravity where we identify thevacuum of three-dimensional space with a cosmic fabric embedded infour-dimensional spacetime and having a small thickness along the timedimension. we show a correspondence between the gravitational phenomenadescribed by general relativity and the kinematic and kinetic properties of thecosmic fabric. we propose, in agreement with modern cosmological observations(collier, 2012; perlmutter et al., 1999; riess et al., 1998) and withtheoretical results from quantum field theory (rugh and zinkernagel, 2002),that the space vacuum is really not a vacuum in the purest sense but is acosmic fabric that has energy density and as such mass density. we furtherpropose that the cosmic fabric deforms due to matter in space, which acts asinclusions, in a manner analogous to the deformation of a conventional thinplate (efrati et al., 2008). by introducing a constitutive model for generalrelativity, we lay the groundwork for subsequently applying solid mechanicsconcepts to cosmology. in particular, we show that strain along the timedimension manifests as a gravitational potential and contraction along the timedimension as gravitational time dilation. by identifying the action integralbased on the elastic energy density of the cosmic fabric with thehilbert-einstein action integral, we derive an expression for the cosmicfabric's elastic modulus in terms of its thickness. assuming a thickness abouta planck's length, we calculate the elastic modulus and density to be about$10^{113}\mathrm{n\,m}^{-2}$, and $10^{96}\mathrm{kg\,m}^{-3}$, respectively.
