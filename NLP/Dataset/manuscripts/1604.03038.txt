einstein's physical strategy, energy conservation, symmetries, and  stability: "but grossmann &amp; i believed that the conservation laws were not  satisfied" recent work on the history of general relativity by renn, sauer, janssen etal. shows that einstein found his field equations partly by a physical strategyincluding the newtonian limit, the electromagnetic analogy, and energyconservation. such themes are similar to those later used by particlephysicists. how do einstein's physical strategy and the particle physicsderivations compare? what energy-momentum complex(es) did he use and why? dideinstein tie conservation to symmetries, and if so, to which? einstein used anidentity from his assumed linear coordinate covariance x'= mx to relate it tothe canonical tensor. usually he avoided using matter euler-lagrange equationsand so was not well positioned to use or reinvent the herglotz-mie-bornunderstanding that the canonical tensor was conserved due to translationsymmetries, a result with roots in lagrange, hamilton and jacobi. whereas mieand born were concerned about the canonical tensor's asymmetry, einstein didnot need to worry because his entwurf lagrangian is modeled not so much onmaxwell's theory as on a scalar theory. as a result, it also has 3 ghosts,failing a 1920s-30s a priori particle physics stability test with antecedentsin lagrange's and dirichlet's stability work.  this critique of the entwurf theory can be compared with einstein's 1915critique of his entwurf theory for not admitting rotating coordinates and notgetting mercury's perihelion right.  particle physics also can be useful in the historiography of gravity andspace-time. this topic can be a useful case study in the history of science onrecently reconsidered questions of presentism, whiggism and the like.
