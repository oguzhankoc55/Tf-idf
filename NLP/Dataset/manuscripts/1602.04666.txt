gravitational wave detection in the introductory lab great physics breakthroughs are rarely included in the introductory physicsor astronomy course. general relativity and binary black hole coalescence areno different, and can be included in the introductory course only in a verylimited sense. however, we can design activities that directly involve thedetection of gw150914, the designation of the gravitation wave signal detectedon september 14, 2015, thereby engage the students in this exciting discoverydirectly. the activities naturally do not include the construction of adetector or the detection of gravitational waves. instead, we design it toinclude analysis of the data from gw150914, which includes some interestinganalysis activities for students of the introductory course. the sameactivities can be assigned either as a laboratory exercise or as acomputational project for the same population of students. the analysis toolsused here are simple and available to the intended student population. it doesnot include the sophisticated analysis tools, which was used by ligo tocarefully analyze the detected signal. however, these simple tools aresufficient to allow the student to get important results.
