inspiral waveforms for spinning compact binaries in a new precessing  convention it is customary to use a precessing convention, based on newtonian orbitalangular momentum ${\bf l}_{\rm n}$, to model inspiral gravitational waves fromgeneric spinning compact binaries. a key feature of such a precessingconvention is its ability to remove all spin precession induced modulationsfrom the orbital phase evolution. however, this convention usually employs apost-newtonian (pn) accurate precessional equation, appropriate for the pnaccurate orbital angular momentum ${\bf l}$, to evolve the ${\bf l}_{\rmn}$-based precessing source frame. this motivated us to develop inspiralwaveforms for spinning compact binaries in a precessing convention thatexplicitly use ${\bf l}$ to describe the binary orbits. our approach introducescertain additional 3pn order terms in the orbital phase and frequency evolutionequations with respect to the usual ${\bf l}_{\rm n}$-based implementation ofthe precessing convention. the implications of these additional terms areexplored by computing the match between inspiral waveforms that employ ${\bfl}$ and ${\bf l}_{\rm n}$-based precessing conventions. we found that the matchestimates are smaller than the optimal value, namely 0.97, for a non-negligiblefraction of unequal mass spinning compact binaries.
