gravitational lensing of massive particles in schwarzschild gravity both massless light ray and objects with nonzero mass experience trajectorybending in a gravitational field. in this work the bending of trajectories ofmassive objects in a schwarzschild spacetime and the correspondinggravitational lensing (gl) effects are studied. a particle sphere forschwarzschild black hole (bh) is found with its radius a simple function of theparticle velocity and proportional to the bh mass. a single master formula forboth the massless and massive particle bending angle is found, in the form ofan elliptic function depending only on the velocity and impact parameter. thisbending angle is expanded in both large and small velocity limits and large andsmall impact parameter limits. the corresponding deflection angle for weak andstrong gl of massive particles are analyzed, and their corrections to the lightray deflection angles are obtained. the dependence of the deflection angles onthe source angle and the particle speed is investigated. finally we discuss thepotential applications of the results in hypervelocity star observations and indetermining mass/mass hierarchy of slow particles/objects.
