spherically symmetric conformal gravity and "gravitational bubbles" the general structure of the spherically symmetric solutions in the weylconformal gravity is described. the corresponding bach equations are derivedfor the special type of metrics, which can be considered as the representativeof the general class. the complete set of the pure vacuum solutions is found.it consists of two classes. the first one contains the solutions with constanttwo-dimensional curvature scalar of our specific metrics, and therepresentatives are the famous robertson--walker metrics. one of them we calledthe "gravitational bubbles", which is compact and with zero weyl tensor. thus,we obtained the pure vacuum curved space-times (without any material sources,including the cosmological constant) what is absolutely impossible in generalrelativity. such a phenomenon makes it easier to create the universe from"nothing". the second class consists of the solutions with varying curvaturescalar. we found its representative as the one-parameter family. it appearsthat it can be conformally covered by the thee-parameter mannheim--kazanassolution. we also investigated the general structure of the energy-momentumtensor in the spherical conformal gravity and constructed the vectorialequation that reveals clearly some features of non-vacuum solutions. two ofthem are explicitly written, namely, the metrics \`a la vaidya, and theelectrovacuum space-time metrics.
