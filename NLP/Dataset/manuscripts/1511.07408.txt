dual representation for the generating functional of the feynman  path-integral the generating functional for scalar theories admits a representation whichis dual with respect to the one introduced by schwinger, interchanging the roleof the free and interacting terms. it maps $\int v(\delta_j)$ and $j\delta j$to $\delta_{\phi_c}\delta\delta_{\phi_c}$ and $\int v(\phi_c)$, respectively,with $\phi_c=\int j\delta$ and $\delta$ the feynman propagator. comparing theschwinger representation with its dual version one gets a little known relationthat we prove to be a particular case of a more general operatorial relation.we then derive a new representation of the generating functional$t[\phi_c]=w[j]$ expressed in terms of covariant derivatives acting on 1 $$t[\phi_c] = {n\over n_0} \exp(-u_0[\phi_c])\exp\big(-\int v({\cald}_{\phi_c}^-)\big) \cdot 1 $$ where ${\cald}_{\phi}^{\pm}(x)=\mp\delta{\delta\over\delta\phi}(x)+\phi(x)$. the dualrepresentation, which is deeply related to the hermite polynomials, is the keyto express the generating functional associated to a sum of potentials in termsof factorized generating functionals. this is applied to renormalization,leading to a factorization of the counterterms of the interaction. weinvestigate the structure of the functional generator for normal orderedpotentials and derive an infinite set of relations in the case of the potential${\lambda\over n!}:\phi^n:$. such relations are explicitly derived by using thefa\`a di bruno formula. this also yields the explicit expression of thegenerating functional of connected green's functions.
