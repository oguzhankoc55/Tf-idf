towards the quantization of eddington-inspired-born-infeld theory the quantum effects close to the classical big rip singularity within theeddington-inspired-born-infeld theory (eibi) are investigated through quantumgeometrodynamics. it is the first time that this approach is applied to amodified theory constructed upon palatini formalism. the wheeler-dewitt (wdw)equation is obtained and solved based on an alternative action proposed inref.[1], under two different factor ordering choices. this action isdynamically equivalent to the original eibi action while it is free of squareroot of the spacetime curvature. we consider a homogeneous, isotropic andspatially flat universe, which is assumed to be dominated by a phantom perfectfluid whose equation of state is a constant. we obtain exact solutions of thewdw equation based on some specific conditions. in more general cases, wepropose a qualitative argument with the help of a wentzel-kramers-brillouin(wkb) approximation to get further solutions. besides, we also construct aneffective wdw equation by simply promoting the classical friedmann equations.we find that for all the approaches considered, the dewitt condition hintingsingularity avoidance is satisfied. therefore the big rip singularity can beavoided through the quantum approach within the eibi theory.
