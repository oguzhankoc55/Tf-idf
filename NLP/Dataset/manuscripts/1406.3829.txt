operational quantum theory without predefined time the standard formulation of quantum theory assumes a predefined notion oftime. this is a major obstacle in the search for a quantum theory of gravity,where the causal structure of space-time is expected to be dynamical andfundamentally probabilistic in character. here, we propose a generalizedformulation of quantum theory without predefined time or causal structure,building upon a recently introduced operationally time-symmetric approach toquantum theory. the key idea is a novel isomorphism between transformations andstates which depends on the symmetry transformation of time reversal. thisallows us to express the time-symmetric formulation in a time-neutral form witha clear physical interpretation, and ultimately drop the assumption of time. inthe resultant generalized formulation, operations are associated with regionsthat can be connected in networks with no directionality assumed for theconnections, generalizing the standard circuit framework and the process matrixframework for operations without global causal order. the possible events in agiven region are described by positive semidefinite operators on a hilbertspace at the boundary, while the connections between regions are described byentangled states that encode a nontrivial symmetry and could be tested inprinciple. we discuss how the causal structure of space-time could beunderstood as emergent from properties of the operators on the boundaries ofcompact space-time regions. the framework is compatible with indefinite causalorder, timelike loops, and other acausal structures.
