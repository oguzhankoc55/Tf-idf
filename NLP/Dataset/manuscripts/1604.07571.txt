boundary effects in entanglement entropy we present a number of explicit calculations of renyi and entanglemententropies in situations where the entangling surface intersects the boundary in$d$-dimensional minkowski spacetime. when the boundary is a single plane wecompute the contribution to the entropy due to this intersection, first in thecase of the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions, and then in the case ofa generic robin type boundary condition. the flow in the boundary couplingbetween the neumann and dirichlet phases is analyzed in arbitrary dimension $d$and is shown to be monotonic, the peculiarity of $d=3$ case is noted. we arguethat the translational symmetry along the entangling surface is broken due thepresence of the boundary which reveals that the entanglement is nothomogeneous. in order to characterize this quantitatively, we introduce adensity of entanglement entropy and compute it explicitly. this quantityclearly indicates that the entanglement is maximal near the boundary. we thenconsider the situation where the boundary is composed of two parallel planes ata finite separation and compute the entanglement entropy as well as its densityin this case. the complete contribution to entanglement entropy due to theboundaries is shown not to depend on the distance between the planes and issimply twice the entropy in the case of single plane boundary. additionally, wefind how the area law, the part in the entropy proportional to the area ofentire entangling surface, depends on the size of the separation between thetwo boundaries. the latter is shown to appear in the uv finite part of theentropy.
