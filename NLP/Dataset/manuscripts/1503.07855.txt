loop quantum cosmology with self-dual variables using the complex-valued self-dual connection variables, the loop quantumcosmology of a closed friedmann universe coupled to a massless scalar field isstudied. it is shown how the reality conditions can be imposed in the quantumtheory by choosing a particular inner product for the kinematical hilbertspace. while holonomies of the self-dual ashtekar connection are notwell-defined in the kinematical hilbert space, it is possible to introduce afamily of generalized holonomy-like operators of which some are well-defined;these operators in turn are used in the definition of the hamiltonianconstraint operator where the scalar field can be used as a relational clock.the resulting quantum theory is closely related, although not identical, tostandard loop quantum cosmology constructed from the ashtekar-barbero variableswith a real immirzi parameter. effective friedmann equations are derived, whichprovide a good approximation to the full quantum dynamics for sharply-peakedstates whose volume remains much larger than the planck volume, and they showthat for these states quantum gravity effects resolve the big-bang andbig-crunch singularities and replace them by a non-singular bounce. finally,the loop quantization in self-dual variables of a flat friedmann space-time isrecovered in the limit of zero spatial curvature and is identical to thestandard loop quantization in terms of the real-valued ashtekar-barberovariables.
