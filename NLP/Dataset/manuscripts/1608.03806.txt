versatile method for renormalized stress-energy computation in  black-hole spacetimes we report here on a new method for calculating the renormalized stress-energytensor (rset) in black-hole (bh) spacetimes, which should also be applicable todynamical bhs and to spinning bhs. this new method only requires the spacetimeto admit a single symmetry. so far we developed three variants of the method,aimed for stationary, spherically symmetric, or axially symmetric bhs. we usedthis method to calculate the rset of a minimally-coupled massless scalar fieldin schwarzschild and reissner-nordstrom backgrounds, for several quantumstates. we present here the results for the rset in the schwarzschild case inunruh state (the state describing bh evaporation). the rset is type i at weakfield, and becomes type iv at $r\lesssim2.78m$. then we use the rset results toexplore violation of the weak and null energy conditions. we find that bothconditions are violated all the way from $r\simeq4.9m$ to the horizon. we alsofind that the averaged weak energy condition is violated by a class of(unstable) circular timelike geodesics. most remarkably, the circular nullgeodesic at $r=3m$ violates the averaged null energy condition.
