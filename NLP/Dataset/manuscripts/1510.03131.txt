post-newtonian reference-ellipsoid for relativistic geodesy we apply general relativity to construct the post-newtonian backgroundmanifold that serves as a reference spacetime in relativistic geodesy forconducting relativistic calculation of the geoid's undulation and thedeflection of the plumb line from the vertical. we chose an axisymmetricellipsoidal body made up of perfect homogeneous fluid uniformly rotating arounda fixed axis, as a source generating the reference geometry. we, then,reformulate and extend hydrodynamic calculations of rotating fluids done byprevious researchers to the realm of relativistic geodesy to set up algebraicequations defining the shape of the post-newtonian reference ellipsoid. tocomplete this task, we explicitly perform all integrals characterizinggravitational field inside the fluid body and represent them in terms of theelementary functions depending on its eccentricity. we fully explore thecoordinate freedom of the equations describing the post-newtonian ellipsoid anddemonstrate that the fractional deviation of the post-newtonian level surfacefrom the maclaurin ellipsoid can be made much smaller than the previouslyanticipated estimate based on the coordinate gauge advocated by bardeen andchandrasekhar. we also derive the gauge-invariant relations of thepost-newtonian mass and the angular velocity of the rotating fluid with theparameters characterizing the shape of the post-newtonian ellipsoid. weformulate the post-newtonian theorems of pizzetti and clairaut that are used ingeodesy to connect the geometric parameters of the reference ellipsoid to thephysically measurable force of gravity at the pole and equator. finally, weexpand the post-newtonian geodetic equations to the taylor series with respectto the eccentricity of the ellipsoid and discuss their practical applications.
