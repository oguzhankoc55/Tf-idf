the closure constraint for the hyperbolic tetrahedron as a bianchi  identity the closure constraint is a central piece of the mathematics of loop quantumgravity. it encodes the gauge invariance of the spin network states of quantumgeometry and provides them with a geometrical interpretation: each decoratedvertex of a spin network is dual to a quantized polyhedron in $\mathbb{r}^{3}$.for instance, a 4-valent vertex is interpreted as a tetrahedron determined bythe four normal vectors of its faces. we develop a framework where the closureconstraint is re-interpreted as a bianchi identity, with the normals defined asholonomies around the polyhedron faces of a connection (constructed from thespinning geometry interpretation of twisted geometries). this allows us todefine closure constraints for hyperbolic tetrahedra (living in the3-hyperboloid of unit future-oriented spacelike vectors in $\mathbb{r}^{3,1}$)in terms of normals living all in $su(2)$ or in $sb(2,\mathbb{c})$. the latterfits perfectly with the classical phase space developed for $q$-deformed loopquantum gravity supposed to account for a non-vanishing cosmological constant$\lambda&gt;0$. this is the first step towards interpreting $q$-deformed twistedgeometries as actual discrete hyperbolic triangulations.
