invariant set theory invariant set theory (ist) is a realistic, locally causal theory offundamental physics which assumes a much stronger synergy between cosmology andquantum physics than exists in contemporary theory. in ist the (quasi-cyclic)universe $u$ is treated as a deterministic dynamical system evolving preciselyon a measure-zero fractal invariant subset $i_u$ of its state space. in thisapproach, the geometry of $i_u$, and not a set of differential evolutionequations in space-time $\mathcal m_u$, provides the most primitive descriptionof the laws of physics. as such, ist is non-classical. the geometry of $i_u$ isbased on cantor sets of space-time trajectories in state space, homeomorphic tothe algebraic set of $p$-adic integers, for large but finite $p$. in ist, thenon-commutativity of position and momentum observables arises from numbertheory - in particular the non-commensurateness of $\phi$ and $\cos \phi$. thecomplex hilbert space and the relativistic dirac equation respectively areshown to describe $i_u$, and evolution on $i_u$, in the singular limit of istat $p=\infty$; particle properties such as de broglie relationships arise fromthe helical geometry of trajectories on $i_u$ in the neighbourhood of $\mathcalm_u$. with the p-adic metric as a fundamental measure of distance on $i_u$,certain key perturbations which seem conspiratorially small relative to themore traditional euclidean metric, take points away from $i_u$ and aretherefore unphysically large. this allows (the $\psi$-epistemic) ist to evadethe bell and pusey et al theorems without fine tuning or other objections. inist, the problem of quantum gravity becomes one of combining thepseudo-riemannian metric of $\mathcal m_u$ with the p-adic metric of $i_u$. ageneralisation of the field equations of general relativity which can achievethis is proposed.
