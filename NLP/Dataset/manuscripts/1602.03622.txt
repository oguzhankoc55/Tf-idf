gravitational wave tests of quantum modifications to black hole  structure -- with post-gw150914 update a preliminary discussion is given of the prospects that gravitational-waveobservations of binary inspiral of black holes could reveal or constrainquantum modifications to black hole dynamics, such as are required to preservepostulates of quantum mechanics. different proposals for such modifications arecharacterized by different scales, and the size of these scales relative tothose probed by observation of inspiral signals is important in determining thefeasibility of finding experimental signatures. certain scenarios with strongquantum modifications in a region extending well outside the horizon areexpected to modify classical evolution, and distort the near-peak gravitationalwave signal, suggesting a search for departures from waveforms predicted bygeneral relativity. the near agreement of the gw150914 signal with suchwaveforms is discussed, and indicates constraints on some such scenarios.important strategies for more precise future tests are 1) to develop moreprecise predictions from scenarios proposing quantum modifications, and 2)searching for observed deviations from numerical relativity predictions viaanalysis of gravity wave data, particularly focussing on the signal regioncorresponding to plunge and merger.
