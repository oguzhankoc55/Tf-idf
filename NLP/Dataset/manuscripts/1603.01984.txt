on universal decoherence under gravity: a perspective through the  equivalence principle in nature phys. 11, 668 (2015) (ref. [1]), a composite particle prepared in apure initial quantum state and propagated in a uniform gravitational field isshown to undergo a decoherence process at a rate determined by thegravitational acceleration. by assuming einstein's equivalence principle to bevalid, we demonstrate, first in a lorentz frame with accelerating detectors,and then directly in the lab frame with uniform gravity, that the dephasingbetween the different internal states arise not from gravity but rather fromdifferences in their rest mass, and the mass dependence of the de brogliewave's dispersion relation. we provide an alternative view to the situationconsidered by ref. [1], where we propose that gravity plays a kinematic role inthe loss of fringe visibility by giving the detector a transverse velocityrelative to the particle beam; visibility can be easily recovered by giving thescreen an appropriate uniform velocity. we finally propose that dephasing dueto gravity may in fact take place for certain modifications to thegravitational potential where the equivalence principle is violated.
