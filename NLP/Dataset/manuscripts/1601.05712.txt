approaches to relativistic positioning around earth and error  estimations in the context of relativistic positioning, the coordinates of a given usermay be calculated by using suitable information broadcast by a 4-tuple ofsatellites. our 4-tuples belong to the galileo constellation. recently, weestimated the positioning errors due to uncertainties in the satellite worldlines (u-errors). a distribution of u-errors was obtained, at various times, ina set of points covering a large region surrounding earth. here, thepositioning errors associated to the simplifying assumption that photons movein minkowski space-time (s-errors) are estimated and compared with theu-errors. both errors have been calculated for the same points and times tomake comparisons possible. for a certain realistic modeling of the world lineuncertainties, the estimated s-errors have proved to be smaller than theu-errors, which shows that the approach based on the assumption that theearth's gravitational field produces negligible effects on photons may be usedin a large region surrounding earth. the applicability of this approach -whichsimplifies numerical calculations- to positioning problems, and the usefulnessof our s-error maps, are pointed out. a better approach, based on theassumption that photons move in the schwarzschild space-time governed by anidealized earth, is also analyzed. more accurate descriptions of photonpropagation involving non symmetric space-time structures are not necessary forordinary positioning and spacecraft navigation around earth.
