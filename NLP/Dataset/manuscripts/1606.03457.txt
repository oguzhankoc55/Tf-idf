nonlinear conductivity and the ringdown of currents in metallic  holography we study the electric and heat current response resulting from an electricfield quench in a holographic model of momentum relaxation at nonzero chargedensity. after turning the electric field off, currents return to equilibriumas governed by the vector quasi-normal modes of the dual black brane, whosespectrum depends qualitatively on a parameter controlling the strength ofinhomogeneity. we explore the dynamical phase diagram as a function of thisparameter, showing that signatures of incoherent transport become identifiableas an oscillatory ringdown of the heat current. we also study nonlinearconductivity by holding the electric field constant. for small electric fieldsa balance is reached between the driving electric field and the momentum sink-- a steady state described by dc linear response. for large electric fieldsjoule heating becomes important and the black branes exhibit significant timedependence. in a regime where the rate of temperature increase is small, thenonlinear electrical conductivity is well approximated by the dc linearresponse calculation at an appropriate effective temperature.
