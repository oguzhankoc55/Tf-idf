page curves for tripartite systems we investigate information flow and page curves for tripartite systems. weprepare a tripartite system (say, a, b, and c) of a given number of states andcalculate information and entropy contents by assuming random states.initially, every particle was in a (this means a black hole), and as time goeson, particles move to either b (means hawking radiation) or c (means a broadlydefined remnant, including a non-local transport of information, the lastburst, an interior large volume, or a bubble universe, etc.). if the finalnumber of states of the remnant is smaller than that of hawking radiation, theninformation will be stored by both of the radiation and the mutual informationbetween the radiation and the remnant, while the remnant itself does notcontain information. on the other hand, if the final number of states of theremnant is greater than that of hawking radiation, then the radiation containsnegligible information, while the remnant and the mutual information betweenthe radiation and the remnant contain information. unless the number of statesof the remnant is large enough compared to the entropy of the black hole,hawking radiation must contain information; and we meet the menace of blackhole complementarity again. therefore, this contrasts the tension betweenvarious assumptions and candidates of the resolution of the information lossproblem.
