wimp detection and slow ion dynamics in carbon nanotube arrays large arrays of aligned carbon nanotubes (cnts), open at one end, could beused as target material for the directional detection of weakly interactingdark matter particles (wimps). as a result of a wimp elastic scattering on acnt, a carbon ion might be injected in the body of the array and propagatethrough multiple collisions within the lattice. the ion may eventually emergefrom the surface with open end cnts, provided that its longitudinal momentum islarge enough to compensate energy losses and its transverse momentum approachesthe channeling conditions in a single cnt. therefore, the angle formed betweenthe wimp wind apparent orientation and the direction of parallel carbonnanotube axes must be properly chosen. we focus on very low ion recoil kineticenergies, related to low mass wimps (~ 10 gev) where most of the existingexperiments have low sensitivity. relying on some exact results ontwo-dimensional lattices of circular obstacles, we study the low energy ionmotion in the transverse plane with respect to cnt directions. new constraintsare obtained on how to devise the cnt arrays to maximize the detectionefficiency.
