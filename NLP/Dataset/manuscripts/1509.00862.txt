transformations of asymptotic gravitational-wave data gravitational-wave data is gauge dependent. while we can restrict the classof gauges in which such data may be expressed, there will still be aninfinite-dimensional group of transformations allowed while remaining in thisclass, and almost as many different---though physically equivalent---waveformsas there are transformations. this paper presents a method for calculating theeffects of the most important transformation group, the bondi-metzner-sachs(bms) group, consisting of rotations, boosts, and supertranslations (whichinclude time and space translations as special cases). to a reasonableapproximation, these transformations result in simple coupling between themodes in a spin-weighted spherical-harmonic decomposition of the waveform. itis shown that waveforms from simulated compact binaries in the publiclyavailable sxs waveform catalog contain unmodeled effects due to displacementand drift of the center of mass, accounting for mode-mixing at typical levelsof 1%. however, these effects can be mitigated by measuring the average motionof the system's center of mass for a portion of the inspiral, and applying theopposite transformation to the waveform data. more generally, controlling thebms transformations will be necessary to eliminate the gauge ambiguity inherentin gravitational-wave data for both numerical and analytical waveforms.open-source code implementing bms transformations of waveforms is includedalong with this paper in the supplemental materials.
