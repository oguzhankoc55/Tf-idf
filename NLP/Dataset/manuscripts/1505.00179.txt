non-minimally coupled pseudoscalars in ads_4 for instantons in cft_3 for the 11-dimensional supergravity over ads_4 x s^7/z_k, beginning with ageneral 4-from ansatz and the main geometry unchanged, we get a tower ofmassive and tachyonic pseudoscalars. indeed, the resultant equations can beassigned to the so-called $\phi^4$ actions of the non-minimally coupledscalar-tensor theories with a cosmological constant. we focus on a well-knowntachyonic and a new massive bulk mode, which are singlet under the internalgroup and break all supersymmetries, associated with skew-whiffing andwick-rotating of the background 4-from flux, respectively. the first one is theconformally coupled m^2=-2 pseudoscalar in the bulk of euclidean ads_4, wherean exact instanton solution is found and a marginally triple-trace deformationwith a proper dimension-1 operator produces an agreeing boundary solution withfinite action. from the action evaluated on the solution, we estimate the decayrate of the vacuum tunneling mediated by the instanton. another massive m^2=+4mode, with the so-called non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi = - 1/3$, alsobreaks the conformal invariance and so, there is no exact solution. then, basedon the ads_4/cft_3 correspondence rules, we propose the dimension-4 ($\delta_+= +4$) boundary operator in the skew-whiffed (anti-m2-branes) theory to deformthe boundary action- consisting of a singlet fermion, an original scalar andu(1) gauges fields- with and find some solutions to be matched with the bulksolutions.
