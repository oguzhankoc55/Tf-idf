the causal topology of neutral 4-manifolds with null boundary this paper considers aspects of 4-manifold topology from the point of view ofa neutral metric, a point of view we call neutral causal topology. inparticular, we construct and investigate neutral 4-manifolds with null boundarythat arise from canonical 3- and 4-dimensional settings.  a null hypersurface is foliated by its normal and, in the neutral case,inherits a pair of totally null planes at each point. this paper focuses onthis structure in a number of classical settings  the first construction is the conformal compactification of flat neutral4-space into the 4-ball. the null foliation on the boundary in this case is thehopf fibration on the 3-sphere and the totally null planes in the boundary areintegrable. the metric on the 4-ball is a conformally flat, scalar-flat,positive ricci curvature neutral metric.  the second constructions are subsets of the 4-dimensional space of orientedgeodesics in a 3-dimensional space-form, equipped with its canonical neutralmetric. we consider all oriented geodesics tangent to a given embedded strictlyconvex 2-sphere. both totally null planes on this null hypersurface arecontact, and we characterize the curves in the null boundary that arelegendrian with respect to a totally null plane.  the third is a neutral geometric model for the intersection of two surfacesin a 4-manifold. the surfaces are the sets of oriented normal lines to tworound spheres in euclidean 3-space, which form lagrangian surfaces in the4-dimensional space of all oriented lines. the intersection of the boundariesof their normal neighbourhoods form tori that are totally real and lorentz ifthe spheres do not intersect.  we conclude with possible topological applications of the threeconstructions, including neutral kirby calculus, neutral knot invariants andneutral casson handles, respectively.
