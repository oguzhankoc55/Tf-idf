a proof of friedman's ergosphere instability for scalar waves let $(\mathcal{m}^{3+1},g)$ be a real analytic, stationary and asymptoticallyflat spacetime with a non-empty ergoregion $\mathscr{e}$ and no future eventhorizon $\mathcal{h}^{+}$. on such spacetimes, friedman provided a heuristicargument that the energy of certain solutions $\phi$ of $\square_{g}\phi=0$grows to $+\infty$ as time increases. in this paper, we provide a rigorousproof of friedman's instability. our setting is, in fact, more general. weconsider smooth spacetimes $(\mathcal{m}^{d+1},g)$, for any $d\ge2$, notnecessarily globally real analytic. we impose only a unique continuationcondition for the wave equation across the boundary $\partial\mathscr{e}$ of$\mathscr{e}$ on a small neighborhood of a point $p\in\partial\mathscr{e}$.this condition always holds if $(\mathcal{m},g)$ is analytic in thatneighborhood of $p$, but it can also be inferred in the case when$(\mathcal{m},g)$ possesses a second killing field $\phi$ such that the span of$\phi$ and the stationary killing field $t$ is timelike on$\partial\mathscr{e}$. we also allow the spacetimes $(\mathcal{m},g)$ underconsideration to possess a (possibly empty) future event horizon$\mathcal{h}^{+}$, such that, however,$\mathcal{h}^{+}\cap\mathscr{e}=\emptyset$ (excluding, thus, the kerr exteriorfamily). as an application of our theorem, we infer an instability result forthe acoustical wave equation on the hydrodynamic vortex, a phenomenon firstinvestigated numerically by oliveira, cardoso and crispino. furthermore, as aside benefit of our proof, we provide a derivation, based entirely on thevector field method, of a carleman-type estimate on the exterior of theergoregion for a general class of stationary and asymptotically flatspacetimes.
