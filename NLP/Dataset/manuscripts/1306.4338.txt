wilson lines and entanglement entropy in higher spin gravity holographic entanglement entropy provides a direct connection betweenclassical geometry and quantum entanglement; however the usual prescriptiondoes not apply to theories of higher spin gravity, where standard notions ofgeometry are no longer gauge invariant. we present a proposal for theholographic computation of entanglement entropy in field theories dual tohigher spin theories of gravity in ads3. these theories have a chern-simonsdescription, and our proposal involves a wilson line in an infinite-dimensionalrepresentation of the bulk gauge group. in the case of spin-2 gravity suchwilson lines are the natural coupling of a heavy point particle to gravity andso are equivalent to the usual prescription of ryu and takayanagi. for higherspin gravity they provide a natural generalization of these ideas. we work outspin-3 gravity in detail, showing that our proposal recovers many expectedresults and computes thermal entropies of black holes with higher spin charge,finding agreement with previous expressions in the literature. we encountersome peculiarities in the case of non-unitary rg flow backgrounds and outlinefuture generalizations.
