dynamic realization of the unruh effect for a geodesic observer we study a dynamic version of the unruh effect in a two dimensional collapsemodel forming a black hole. in this two-dimensional collapse model a scalarfield coupled to the dilaton gravity, moving leftwards, collapses to form ablack hole. there are two sets of asymptotic ($t\to\infty$) observers, around$x\to\infty$ and $x\to-\infty$. the observers at the right null infinitywitness a thermal flux of radiation associated with time dependent geometryleading to a black hole formation and its subsequent hawking evaporation, in anexpected manner. we show that even the observers at left null infinity witnessa thermal radiation, without experiencing any change of spacetime geometry allalong their trajectories. they remain geodesic observers in a flat region ofspacetime. thus these observers measure a late time thermal radiation, withexactly the same temperature as measured by the observers at right nullinfinity, despite moving geodesically in flat spacetime throughout theirtrajectories. however such radiation, as usual in the case of unruh effect, haszero flux, unlike the hawking radiation seen by the observers at right nullinfinity. we highlight the conceptual similarity of this phenomenon with thestandard unruh effect in flat spacetime.
