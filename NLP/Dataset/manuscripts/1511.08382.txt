conditional symmetries in axisymmetric quantum cosmologies with scalar  fields and the fate of the classical singularities in this paper, the classical and quantum solutions of some axisymmetriccosmologies coupled to a massless scalar field are studied in the context ofminisuperspace approximation. in these models, the singular nature of thelagrangians entails a search for possible conditional symmetries. these havebeen proven to be the simultaneous conformal symmetries of the supermetric andthe superpotential. the quantization is performed by adopting the diracproposal for constrained systems, i.e. promoting the first-class constraints tooperators annihilating the wave function. to further enrich the approach, wefollow \cite{christodoulakis:2012eg} and impose the operators related to theclassical conditional symmetries on the wave function. these additionalequations select particular solutions of the wheeler-dewitt equation. in orderto gain some physical insight from the quantization of these cosmologicalsystems, we perform a semiclassical analysis following the bohmian approach toquantum theory. the generic result is that, in all but one model, one can findappropriate ranges of the parameters, so that the emerging semiclassicalgeometries are non-singular. an attempt for physical interpretation involvesthe study of the effective energy-momentum tensor which corresponds to animperfect fluid.
