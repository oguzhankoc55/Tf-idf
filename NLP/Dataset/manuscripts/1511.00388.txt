the first law of black hole mechanics for fields with internal gauge  freedom we derive the first law of black hole mechanics for physical theories basedon a local, covariant and gauge-invariant lagrangian where the dynamical fieldstransform non-trivially under the action of internal gauge transformations. thetheories of interest include general relativity formulated in terms of tetrads,einstein-yang-mills theory and einstein-dirac theory. since the dynamicalfields of these theories have gauge freedom, we argue that there is no groupaction of diffeomorphisms of spacetime on such dynamical fields. in general,such fields cannot even be represented as smooth, globally well-defined tensorfields on spacetime. consequently the derivation of the first law by iyer-waldcannot be used directly. we show how such theories can be formulated on aprincipal bundle and that there is a natural action of automorphisms of thebundle on the fields. these bundle automorphisms encode both spacetimediffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. using this reformulation we definethe noether charge associated to an infinitesimal automorphism and thecorresponding notion of stationarity and axisymmetry of the dynamical fields.we define certain potentials and charges at the horizon of a black hole so thatthe potentials are constant on the bifurcate killing horizon, giving ageneralised zeroth law for bifurcate killing horizons. we identify thegravitational potential and perturbed charge as the temperature and perturbedentropy of the black hole which gives an explicit formula for the perturbedentropy analogous to the wald entropy formula. we obtain a general first law ofblack hole mechanics for such theories. the first law relates the perturbedhamiltonians at spatial infinity and the horizon, and the horizon contributionstake the form of a potential times perturbed charge term. we also comment onthe ambiguities in defining a prescription for the total entropy for blackholes.
