universality of p-v criticality in horizon thermodynamics we study p-v criticality of black holes in lovelock gravities in the contextof horizon thermodynamics. the corresponding first law of horizonthermodynamics emerges as one of the einstein-lovelock equations and assumesthe universal (independent of matter content) form de=tds-pdv, where p isidentified with the total pressure of all matter in the spacetime (including acosmological constant lambda if present). we compare this approach to recentadvances in extended phase space thermodynamics of asymptotically ads blackholes where the "standard" first law of black hole thermodynamics is extendedto include a pressure-volume term, where the pressure is entirely due to the(variable) cosmological constant. we show that both approaches are quitedifferent in interpretation. provided there is sufficient non-linearity in thegravitational sector, we find that horizon thermodynamics admits the sameinteresting black hole phase behaviour seen in the extended case, such as ahawking-page transition, van der waals like behaviour, and the presence of atriple point. we also formulate the smarr formula in horizon thermodynamics anddiscuss the interpretation of the quantity e appearing in the horizon firstlaw.
