the mass formula for an exotic btz black hole an exotic banados-teitelboim-zanelli (btz) black hole has an angular momentumlarger than its mass in three dimension (3d), which suggests the possibilitythat cosmic censorship could be violated if angular momentum is extracted bythe penrose process. in this paper, we propose a mass formula for the exoticbtz black hole and show no violation of weak cosmic censorship in the gedankenprocess above by understanding properly its mass formula. unlike the otherblack holes, the total energy of the exotic btz black hole is represented bythe angular momentum instead of the mass, which supports a basic point of viewthat the same geometry should be determined by the same energy in 3d generalrelativity whose equation of motion can be given either by normal 3d einsteingravity or by exotic 3d einstein gravity. however, only the mass of the exoticblack hole is related to the thermodynamics and other forms of energy are"dumb", which is consistent with the earlier thermodynamic analysis aboutexotic black holes.
