measurement-based perturbation theory and differential equation  parameter estimation for high-precision high-resolution reconstruction of the  earth's gravitational field from satellite tracking measurements the numerical integration method has been routinely used to produce globalstandard gravitational models from satellite tracking measurements ofchamp/grace types. it is implemented by solving the differential equations ofthe partial derivatives of a satellite orbit with respect to the unknownharmonic coefficients under the conditions of zero initial values. from themathematical point of view, satellite gravimetry from satellite tracking is theproblem of estimating unknown parameters in the newton's nonlinear differentialequations from satellite tracking measurements. we prove that zero initialvalues for the partial derivatives are incorrect mathematically and notpermitted physically. the numerical integration method, as currentlyimplemented and used in satellite gravimetry and statistics, is groundless. weuse three different methods to derive new local solutions to the newton'snonlinear governing differential equations of motion with a nominal referenceorbit. bearing in mind that satellite orbits can now be tracked almostcontinuously at unprecedented high accuracy, we propose the measurement-basedperturbation theory and derive global uniformly convergent solutions to thenewton's nonlinear governing differential equations of motion. since thesolutions are global uniformly convergent, they are able to extract smallestpossible gravitational signals from modern and future satellite trackingmeasurements for global high-precision, high-resolution gravitational models.by directly turning the nonlinear differential equations of satellite motioninto the nonlinear integral equations, we reformulate the links betweensatellite tracking measurements and the global uniformly convergent solutionsto the newton's governing differential equations as a condition adjustmentmodel with equality constraints.
