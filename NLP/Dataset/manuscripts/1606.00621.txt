exploring the tensor networks/ads correspondence in this paper we study the recently proposed tensor networks/adscorrespondence. we found that the coxeter group is a useful tool to describetensor networks in a negatively curved space. studying generic tensor networkpopulated by perfect tensors, we find that the physical wave functiongenerically do not admit any connected correlation functions of localoperators. to remedy the problem, we assume that wavefunctions admitting suchsemi-classical gravitational interpretation are composed of tensors close to,but not exactly perfect tensors. computing corrections to the connected twopoint correlation functions, we find that the leading contribution is given bystructures related to geodesics connecting the operators inserted at theboundary physical dofs. such considerations admit generalizations at least tothree point functions. this is highly suggestive of the emergence of theanalogues of witten diagrams in the tensor network. the perturbations alonehowever do not give the right entanglement spectrum. using the coxeterconstruction, we also constructed the tensor network counterpart of the btzblack hole, by orbifolding the discrete lattice on which the network resides.we found that the construction naturally reproduces some of the salientfeatures of the btz black hole, such as the appearance of rt surfaces thatcould wrap the horizon, depending on the size of the entanglement region a.
