the rigid horowitz-myers conjecture the "new positive energy conjecture" horowitz and myers (1999) probes apossible nonsupersymmetric ads/cft correspondence. we consider a versionformulated for complete, asymptotically poincar\'e-einstein riemannian metrics$(m,g)$ with bounded scalar curvature $r\ge -n(n-1)$. this version then assertsthat any such $(m,g)$ must have mass not less than the mass $m_0$ of a metric$g_0$ induced on a time-symmetric slice of a certain ads soliton spacetime. theconjecture remains unproved, having so far resisted standard techniques. littleis known other than that the conjecture is true for metrics which aresufficiently small perturbations of $g_0$. we pose another test for theconjecture. we assume its validity and attempt to prove as a corollary thecorresponding scalar curvature rigidity statement, that $g_0$ is the uniqueasymptotically poincar\'e-einstein metric with mass $m=m_0$ obeying $r\ge-n(n-1)$. were a second such metric $g_1$ not isometric to $g_0$ to exist, itthen may well admit perturbations of lower mass, contradicting the assumedvalidity of the conjecture. we find that the minimum mass metric must be staticeinstein, so the problem is reduced to that of static uniqueness. when $n=3$the manifold is isometric to a time-symmetric slice of an ads solitonspacetime, unless it has a non-compact horizon. en route we study the massaspect, obtaining and generalizing known results. the mass aspect is (i)related to the holographic energy density, (ii) a weighted invariant underboundary conformal transformations when the bulk dimension is odd, and (iii)zero for negative einstein manifolds with einstein conformal boundary.
