note on stability and holographic renyi entropy in new hyperbolic ads  black holes we construct a series of new hyperbolic black hole solutions ineinstein-dilaton system and we apply holographic approach to investigate thespherical renyi entropy in various deformations. especially, we introducevarious powers in the scalar potential for massive and massless scalar cases.these scalar potentials correspond to deformation of dual cfts. we make use ofa systematic way to generate numerical hyperbolic ads black hole solutions.based on these solutions, we study the temperature dependent condensation ofdual operator of massive and massless scalar respectively. these condensationsshow that there might be phase transitions in deformed cfts. we also comparefree energy between hyperbolic black hole solutions and hyperbolic ads-sw blackhole to judge phase transitions. in order to confirm the existence of phasetransitions, we turn on linear in-homogenous perturbation to test stability ofthese hyperbolic ads black holes. in this paper, we show how potentialparameters affect the stability of hyperbolic black holes in several specificexamples. for generic value of potential parameters, it needs further study tosee how the transition happens. finally, we comment on these instabilitiesassociated with spherical renyi entropy in dual deformed cfts.
