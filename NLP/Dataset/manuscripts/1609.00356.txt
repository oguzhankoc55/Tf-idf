spinning test-body orbiting around schwarzschild black hole: circular  dynamics and gravitational-wave fluxes we consider a spinning test-body in circular motion around a nonrotatingblack hole and analyze different prescriptions for the body's dynamics. wecompare, for the first time, the mathisson-papapetrou formalism under thetulczyjew spin-supplementary-condition (ssc), the pirani ssc and theohashi-kyrian-semerak ssc, and the spinning particle limit of theeffective-one-body hamiltonian of [phys.~rev.~d.90,~044018(2014)]. we analyzethe four different dynamics in terms of the isco shifts and in terms of thecoordinate invariant binding energies, separating higher-order spincontributions from spin-orbit contributions. the asymptotic gravitational wavefluxes produced by the spinning body are computed by solving the inhomogeneous$(2+1)d$ teukolsky equation and contrasted for the different cases. for smallorbital frequencies $\omega$, all the prescriptions reduce to the same dynamicsand the same radiation fluxes. for large frequencies, ${x \equiv (m\omega)^{2/3} &gt;0.1 }$, where $m$ is the black hole mass, and especially forpositive spins (aligned with orbital angular momentum) a significantdisagreement between the different dynamics is observed. the isco shifts candiffer up to a factor two for large positive spins; for theohashi-kyrian-semerak and the pirani ssc the isco diverges around dimensionlessspins $\sim0.52$ and $\sim0.94$ respectively. in the spin-orbit part of theenergetics the deviation from the hamiltonian dynamics is largest for theohashi-kyrian-semerak ssc; it exceeds $10\%$ for $x&gt;0.17$. the tulczyjew andthe pirani sscs behave compatible across almost the whole spin and frequencyrange. our results will have direct application in including spin effects toeffective-one-body waveform models for circularized binaries in theextreme-mass-ratio limit.
