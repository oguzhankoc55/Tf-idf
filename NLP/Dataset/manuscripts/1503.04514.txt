thermodynamic products for sen black hole we investigate the properties of inner and outer horizon thermodynamics ofsen black hole(bh) both in \emph{einstein frame(ef)} and \emph{stringframe(sf)}. we also compute area(or entropy) product, area(or entropy) sum ofthe said bh in ef as well as sf. in the ef, we observe that the area(orentropy) product is \emph{ universal}, whereas area (or entropy) sum is\emph{not} universal. on the other hand, in the sf, area(or entropy) productand area(or entropy) sum don't have any universal behavior because they all aredepends on adm(arnowitt-deser-misner) mass parameter. we also verify that the\emph{first law} is satisfied at the cauchy horizon(ch) as well as eventhorizon(eh). in addition, we also compute other thermodynamic products and sumsin the ef as well as in the sf. we further compute the \emph{smarr massformula} and \emph{christodoulou's irreducible mass formula} for sen bh.moreover, we compute the area bound and entropy bound for both the horizons.the upper area bound for eh is actually the penrose like inequality, which isthe first geometric inequality in bhs. furthermore, we compute the centralcharges of the left and right moving sectors of the dual cft in sen/cftcorrespondence using thermodynamic relations. these thermodynamic relations onthe multi-horizons give us further understanding the microscopic nature of bhentropy(both interior and exterior).
