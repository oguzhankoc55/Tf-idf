matter fields in triangle-hinge models the worldvolume theory of membrane is mathematically equivalent tothree-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter fields corresponding to thetarget space coordinates of embedded membrane. in a recent paper[arxiv:1503.08812] a new class of models are introduced that generatethree-dimensional random volumes, where the boltzmann weight of eachconfiguration is given by the product of values assigned to the triangles andthe hinges. these triangle-hinge models describe three-dimensional pure gravityand are characterized by semisimple associative algebras. in this paper, weintroduce matter degrees of freedom to the models by coloring simplices in away that they have local interactions. this is achieved simply by extending theassociative algebras of the original triangle-hinge models, and the profile ofmatter field is specified by the set of colors and the form of interactions.the dynamics of a membrane in $d$-dimensional spacetime can then be describedby taking the set of colors to be $\mathbb{r}^d$. by taking another set ofcolors, we can also realize three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to theising model, the $q$-state potts models or the rsos models. one can actuallyassign colors to simplices of any dimensions (tetrahedra, triangles, edges andvertices), and three-dimensional colored tensor models can be realized astriangle-hinge models by coloring tetrahedra, triangles and edges at a time.
