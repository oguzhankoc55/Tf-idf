quantum collapse of a charged $n$-dimensional btz-like domain wall we investigate both the classical and quantum gravitational collapse of acharged, non-rotating $n$-dimensional btz black hole in ads space. this is doneby first deriving the conserved mass of a "spherically" symmetric domain wall,which is then taken as the classical hamiltonian of the domain wall.  in the classical picture, we show that, as far as the asymptotic observer isconcerned, the details of the collapse depend on the amount of charge presentin the domain wall. in the both the extremal and non-extremal cases, thecollapse takes an infinite amount of observer time to complete. however, in theover-charged case, the collapse never actually occurs, instead one finds anoscillatory solution which prevents the formation of a naked singularity. asfar as the infalling observer is concerned, the collapse is completed within afinite amount of proper time. thus, the gravitational collapse follows that ofthe typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse.  quantum mechanically, in the absence of induced quasi-particle production andfluctuations of the metric geometry, we take primary interest in the behaviorof the collapse near the horizon and near the classical singularity from thepoint of view of both asymptotic and infalling observers. for the asymptoticobserver, we find that quantum effects near the horizon do not change theclassical conclusions. for the infalling observer, the most interesting quantummechanical effect are when the collapsing shell approaches the classicalsingularity. here, we find, that the quantum effects in this region displaynon-local effects, which depend on the energy density of the domain wall.
