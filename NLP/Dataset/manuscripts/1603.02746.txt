the imprint of the hawking effect in subcritical flows we study the propagation of low frequency shallow water waves on a onedimensional flow of varying depth. when taking into account dispersive effects,the linear propagation of long wavelength modes on uneven bottoms excites newsolutions of the dispersion relation which possess a much shorter wavelength.the peculiarity is that one of these new solutions has a negative energy. whenthe flow becomes supercritical, this mode has been shown to be responsible forthe (classical) analog of the hawking effect. for subcritical flows, theproduction of this mode has been observed numerically and experimentally, butthe precise physics governing the scattering remained unclear. in this work, weprovide an analytic treatment of this effect in subcritical flows. we analyzethe scattering of low frequency waves using a new perturbative series, derivedfrom a generalization of the bremmer series. we show that the production ofshort wavelength modes is governed by a complex value of the position: acomplex turning point. using this method, we investigate various flow profiles,and derive the main characteristics of the induced spectrum.
