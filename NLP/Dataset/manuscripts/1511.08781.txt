absorption by dirty black holes: null geodesics and scalar waves black holes are a paradigm in nowadays physics, and are expected to be hostedat the center of galaxies. supermassive galactic black holes are not isolated,and their surroundings play crucial roles in many observational features. theabsorption and scattering of fields by isolated black holes have been vastlystudied, allowing the understanding of many phenomenological features. however,as far as we are aware, a study of the influence of the presence of mattersurrounding black holes in its planar wave scattering and absorption spectrumis still lacking in the literature. this may be important in the analysis of,for instance, the accretion of dark matter by black holes. we consider planarmassless scalar waves incident upon a schwarzschild black hole surrounded by athin spherical shell. we use the partial wave method to determine theabsorption cross section, and present a selection of numerical results. in thelow-frequency regime, we show that the absorption cross section is equal to thehorizon area. at the high-frequency regime, we show that the absorption crosssection approaches the geodesic capture cross section.
