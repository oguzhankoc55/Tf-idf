quantum asymmetry between time and space an asymmetry exists between time and space in the sense that physical systemsinevitably evolve over time whereas there is no corresponding ubiquitoustranslation over space. the asymmetry, which is presumed to be elemental, isrepresented by equations of motion and conservation laws that operatedifferently over time and space. if, however, the asymmetry was found to be dueto deeper causes, this conventional view of time evolution would needreworking. here we show, using a sum-over-paths formalism, that a violation oftime reversal (t) symmetry might be such a cause. if t symmetry is obeyed, theformalism treats time and space symmetrically such that states of matter arelocalised both in space and in time. in this case, equations of motion andconservation laws are undefined or inapplicable. however if t symmetry isviolated, the same sum over paths formalism yields states that are localised inspace and distributed without bound over time, creating an asymmetry betweentime and space. moreover, the states satisfy an equation of motion (theschr\"{o}dinger equation) and conservation laws apply. this suggests that thetime-space asymmetry is not elemental as currently presumed, and that tviolation may have a deep connection with time evolution.
