quantum jump from singularity to outside of black hole considering the role of black hole singularity in quantum evolution, aresolution to the firewall paradox is presented. it is emphasized that if anobserver has the singularity as a part of his spacetime, then thesemi-classical evolution would be non-unitary as viewed by him. specifically, afree-falling observer inside the black hole would have a hilbert space withnon-unitary evolution; a quantum jump for particles encountering thesingularity to outside of the horizon as late hawking radiations. thenon-unitariness in the jump resembles the one in collapse of wave function, butpreserves entanglements. accordingly, we elaborate the first postulate of blackhole complementarity: freely falling observers who pass through the eventhorizon would have non-unitary evolution, while it does not have physicallymeasurable effects for them. besides, no information would be lost in thesingularity. taking the modified picture into account, the firewall paradox canbe resolved, respecting no drama. a by-product of our modification is thatroughly half of the entropy of the black hole is released close to the end ofevaporation in the shape of very hot hawking radiation.
