$p-v$ criticality in the extended phase space of charged accelerating  ads black holes in this paper, we investigate the $p-v$ criticality and phase transition ofcharged accelerating ads black holes in the extended thermodynamic phase spacein analogy between black hole system and van der waals liquid-gas system, wherethe cosmological constant $\lambda$ is treated as a thermodynamical variableinterpreted as dynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity is the thermodynamicvolume of the black holes. when the electric charge vanishes, we find that no$p-v$ criticality will appear but the hawking-page like phase transition willbe present, just as what schwarzschild-ads black holes behave like. for thecharged case, the $p-v$ criticality appears and the accelerating black holeswill undergo a small black hole/large phase transition under the condition thatthe acceleration parameter $a$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ meet a certainsimple relation $a r_h=a$, where $a$ is a constant in our discussion. to make$p-v$ criticality appear, there exists an upper bounds for constant $a$. when$p-v$ criticality appears, we calculate the critical pressure $p_{c}$, criticaltemperature $t_{c}$ and critical specific volume $r_{c}$, and we find that$\frac{p_{c}r_{c}}{t_{c}}$ is an universal number.
