modular hamiltonians for deformed half-spaces and the averaged null  energy condition we study modular hamiltonians corresponding to the vacuum state for deformedhalf-spaces in relativistic quantum field theories on $\mathbb{r}^{1,d-1}$. weshow that in addition to the usual boost generator, there is a contribution tothe modular hamiltonian at first order in the shape deformation, proportionalto the integral of the null components of the stress tensor along the rindlerhorizon. we use this fact along with monotonicity of relative entropy to provethe averaged null energy condition in minkowski space-time. this subsequentlygives a new proof of the hofman-maldacena bounds on the parameters appearing incft three-point functions. our main technical advance involves adapting newlydeveloped perturbative methods for calculating entanglement entropy to theproblem at hand. these methods were recently used to prove certain results onthe shape dependence of entanglement in cfts and here we generalize theseresults to excited states and real time dynamics. we also discuss the ads/cftcounterpart of this result, making connection with the recently proposedgravitational dual for modular hamiltonians in holographic theories.
