combing gravitational hair in 2+1 dimensions the gravitational gauss law requires any addition of energy to be accompaniedby the addition of gravitational flux. the possible configurations of this fluxfor a given source may be called gravitational hair, and several recent worksdiscuss gravitational observables (`gravitational wilson lines') which createthis hair in highly-collimated `combed' configurations. we construct andanalyze time-symmetric classical solutions of 2+1 einstein-hilbert gravity suchas might be created by smeared versions of such operators. we focus on theads$_3$ case, where this hair is characterized by the profile of the boundarystress tensor; the desired solutions are those where the boundary stress tensorat initial time $t=0$ agrees precisely with its vacuum value outside an angularinterval $[-\alpha,\alpha]$. at linear order in source strength the energy isindependent of the combing parameter $\alpha$, but non-linearities cause thefull energy to diverge as $\alpha \to 0$. in general, solutions with combedgravitational flux also suffer from what we call displacement from their naivelocation. for weak sources and large $\alpha$ one may set the displacement tozero by further increasing the energy, though for strong sources and small$\alpha$ we find no preferred notion of a zero-displacement solution. in thelatter case we conclude that naively-expected gravitational wilson lines do notexist. in the zero-displacement case, taking the ads scale $\ell$ to infinitygives finite-energy flux-directed solutions that may be called asymptoticallyflat.
