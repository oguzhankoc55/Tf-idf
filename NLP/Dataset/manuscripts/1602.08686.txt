free-fall frame rainbow black hole doubly special relativity (dsr) is an effective model for encoding quantumgravity in flat spacetime. to incorporate dsr into general relativity, onecould use "gravity's rainbow", where the spacetime background felt by a testparticle would depend on its energy. in this scenario, one could rewrite therainbow metric $g_{\mu\nu}\left( e\right) $ in terms of some orthonormal framefields and use the modified equivalence principle to determine the energydependence of $g_{\mu\nu}\left( e\right) $. obviously, the form of$g_{\mu\nu}\left( e\right) $ depends on the choice of the orthonormal frame.for a static black hole, there are two natural orthonormal frames, the staticone hovering above it and freely falling one along geodesics. the cases withthe static orthonormal frame have been extensively studied by many authors. theaim of this paper is to investigate properties of rainbow black holes in thescenario with the free-fall orthonormal frame. we first derive the metric ofrainbow black holes and their hawking temperatures in this free-fall scenario.then, the thermodynamics of a rainbow schwarzschild black hole is studied.finally, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy of amassless scalar field near the horizon of a schwarzschild rainbow black hole inthis free-fall scenario.
