quadrupolar metrics we review the problem of describing the gravitational field of compact starsin general relativity. we focus on the deviations from spherical symmetry whichare expected to be due to rotation and to the natural deformations of massdistributions. we assume that the relativistic quadrupole moment takes intoaccount these deviations, and consider the class of axisymmetric static andstationary quadrupolar metrics which satisfy einstein's equations in emptyspace and in the presence of matter represented by a perfect fluid. weformulate the physical conditions that must be satisfied for a particularspacetime metric to describe the gravitational field of compact stars. wepresent a brief review of the main static and axisymmetric exact solutions ofeinstein's vacuum equations, satisfying all the physical conditions. we discusshow to derive particular stationary and axisymmetric solutions with quadrupolarproperties by using the solution generating techniques which correspond eitherto lie symmetries and b\"ackund transformations of the ernst equations or tothe inverse scattering method applied to einstein's equations. as for interiorsolutions, we argue that it is necessary to apply alternative methods to obtainphysically meaningful solutions, and review a method which allows us togenerate interior perfect-fluid solutions.
