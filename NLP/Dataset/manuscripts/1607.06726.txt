simple inflationary quintessential model ii: power law potentials the present work is a sequel of our previous work phys.rev.d { 93}, 084018(2016) [arxiv:1601.08175 [gr-qc]] cite{hap} which depicted a simple version ofan inflationary quintessential model whose inflationary stage was described bya higgs type potential and the quintessential phase was responsible due to anexponential potential. additionally, the model predicted a nonsingular universein past which was geodesically past incomplete. further, it was also found thatthe model is in agreement with the planck 2013 data when running is allowed.but, this model was found to be unsuccessful with planck 2015 data with orwithout running. however, in this sequel we propose a family of models runs bya single parameter $alpha in [0, 1]$ which proposes another "inflationaryquintessential model" where the inflation and the quintessence regimes arerespectively described by a power law potential and a cosmological constant.the model is also nonsingular although geodesically past incomplete as in thecited model. however, the present one is found to be more simple in compared tothe previous model and it is in excellent agreement with the observationaldata. we note that unlike the previous model which matched only with planck2013 data in presence of running, a large number of the models of this familywith $alpha in [0,1/2)$ matches with both planck 2013 and planck 2015 datawhether the running is allowed or not. thus, the properties in the currentfamily of models in compared to its past companion justify its need for abetter cosmological model with the successive improvement of the observationaldata.1
