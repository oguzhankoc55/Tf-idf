on the residual symmetries of the gravitational field we develop a geometric criterion that unambiguously characterizes and alsoprovides a systematic and effective computational procedure for finding all theresidual symmetries of any gravitational ansatz . we apply the criterion toseveral examples starting with the collinson ansatz for circular stationaryaxisymmetric spacetimes. we reproduce the residual symmetries already known forthis ansatz including their conformal symmetry, for which we identify thecorresponding infinite generators spanning the two related copies of the wittalgebra. we also consider the noncircular generalization of this ansatz andshow how the noncircular contributions on the one hand break the conformalinvariance and on the other hand enhance the standard translations symmetriesof the circular killing vectors to supertranslations depending on the directionalong which the circularity is lost. as another application of the method, thewell-known relation defining conjugate gravitational potentials introduced bychandrasekhar, that makes possible the derivation of the kerr black hole from atrivial solution of the ernst equations, is deduced as a special point of thegeneral residual symmetry of the papapetrou ansatz. we emphasize how theelection of weyl coordinates, which determines the papapetrou ansatz, breaksalso the conformal freedom of the stationary axisymmetric spacetimes.additionally, we study ads waves for any dimension generalizing the residualsymmetries already known for lower dimensions and exhibiting a very complexinfinite-dimensional lie algebra containing three families: two of them spanthe semidirect sum of the witt algebra and scalar supertranslations and thethird generates vector supertranslations. we manage to comprehend that theinfinite connected group is the precise diffeomorphisms subgroup allowing tolocally deform the ads background into ads waves.
