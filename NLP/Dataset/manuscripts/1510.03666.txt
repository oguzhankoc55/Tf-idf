recursion operators and bi-hamiltonian structure of the general heavenly  equation we discover two additional lax pairs and three nonlocal recursion operatorsfor symmetries of the general heavenly equation introduced by doubrov andferapontov. converting the equation to a two-component form, we obtainlagrangian and hamiltonian structures of the two-component general heavenlysystem. we study all point symmetries of the two-component system and, usingthe inverse noether theorem in the hamiltonian form, obtain all the integralsof motion corresponding to each variational (noether) symmetry. we discoverthat in the two-component form we have only a single nonlocal recursionoperator. composing the recursion operator with the first hamiltonian operatorwe obtain second hamiltonian operator. we check the jacobi identities for thesecond hamiltonian operator and compatibility of the two hamiltonian structuresusing p. olver's theory of functional multi-vectors. our well-foundedconjecture is that p. olver's method works fine for nonlocal operators. we showthat the general heavenly equation in the two-component form is abi-hamiltonian system integrable in the sense of magri. we demonstrate how toobtain nonlocal hamiltonian flows generated by local hamiltonians by usingformal adjoint recursion operator.
