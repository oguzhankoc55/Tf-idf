looking for lorentz violation with gravitational waves the current letter has been inspired by the recent direct detection ofgravitational waves reported by advanced ligo. in this context, a particularlorentz-violating framework for classical, massive particles is on the focus.the latter is characterized by a preferred direction in spacetime comprised ofcpt-odd components with mass dimension 1. curvature effects in spacetime, whichare caused by a propagating gravitational wave, are assumed to deform theotherwise constant background field. in accordance with spontaneous lorentzviolation, a particular choice for the vector field is taken, which wasproposed elsewhere. the geodesic equations for a particle that is subject tothis type of lorentz violation are obtained. subsequently, their numericalsolutions are computed and discussed. the particular model considered leads tochanges in the particle trajectory, which interferometric gravitational-waveexperiments could be sensitive for. since such effects have not been observedin the gravitational-wave event measured by ligo we obtain a new constraint onlorentz violation in the fermion sector. finally, we will make a couple ofstatements with regards to explicit lorentz violation and finsler geometry inthe context of gravitational-wave physics.
