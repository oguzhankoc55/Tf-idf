non-equilibrium condensation process in holographic superconductor with  nonlinear electrodynamics we study the non-equilibrium condensation process in a holographicsuperconductor with nonlinear corrections to the u(1) gauge field. we startwith an asymptotic anti-de-sitter(ads) black hole against a complex scalarperturbation at the initial time, and solve the dynamics of the gravitationalsystems in the bulk. when the black hole temperature t is smaller than acritical value tc, the scalar perturbation grows exponentially till saturation,the final state of spacetime approaches to a hairy black hole. in the bulktheory, we find the clue of the influence of nonlinear corrections in the gaugefield on the process of the scalar field condensation. we show that the bulkdynamics in the non-equilibrium process is completely consistent with theobservations on the boundary order parameter. furthermore we examine the timeevolution of horizons in the bulk non-equilibrium transformation process fromthe bald ads black hole to the ads hairy hole. both the evolution of apparentand event horizons show that the original ads black hole configuration requiresmore time to finish the transformation to become a hairy black hole if there isnonlinear correction to the electromagnetic field. we generalize ournon-equilibrium discussions to the holographic entanglement entropy and findthat the holographic entanglement entropy can give us further understanding ofthe influence of the nonlinearity in the gauge field on the scalarcondensation. in our analysis, we also compare the effect of different modelson the corrections to the gauge field on the formation of holographicsuperconductor.
