inflation as de sitter instability we consider cosmological inflation generated by a scalar field slowly rollingoff from a de sitter maximum of its potential. the models belong to the classof hilltop models and represent the most general model of this kind in whichthe scalar potential can be written as the sum of two exponentials. theminimally coupled einstein-scalar gravity theory obtained in this way is thecosmological version of a two-scale generalization of known holographic models,allowing for solitonic solutions interpolating between an ads spacetime in theinfrared and scaling solutions in the ultraviolet. we then investigatecosmological inflation in the slow-roll approximation. our model reproducescorrectly, for a wide range of its parameters, the most recent experimentaldata for the power spectrum of primordial perturbations. moreover, it predictsinflation at energy scales of four to five orders of magnitude below the planckscale. at the onset of inflation, the mass of the tachyonic excitation, i.e. ofthe inflaton, turns out to be seven to eight orders of magnitude smaller thanthe planck mass.
