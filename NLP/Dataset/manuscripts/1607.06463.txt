einsteinian cubic gravity we drastically simplify the problem of linearizing a general higher-ordertheory of gravity. we reduce it to the evaluation of its lagrangian on aparticular riemann tensor depending on two parameters, and the computation oftwo derivatives with respect to one of those parameters. we use our method toconstruct a d-dimensional cubic theory of gravity which satisfies the followingproperties: 1) it shares the spectrum of einstein gravity, i.e., it onlypropagates a transverse and massless graviton on a maximally symmetricbackground; 2) the relative coefficients of the different curvature invariantsinvolved are the same in all dimensions; 3) it is neither trivial nortopological in four dimensions. up to cubic order in curvature, the onlypreviously known theories satisfying the first two requirements are thelovelock ones: einstein gravity, gauss-bonnet and cubic-lovelock. of course,the last two theories fail to satisfy requirement 3 as they are, respectively,topological and trivial in four dimensions. we show that, up to cubic order,there exists only one additional theory satisfying requirements 1 and 2.interestingly, this theory is, along with einstein gravity, the only theorywhich also satisfies 3.
