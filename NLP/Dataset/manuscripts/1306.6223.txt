proof of the cosmic no-hair conjecture in the t^3-gowdy symmetric  einstein-vlasov setting the currently preferred models of the universe undergo accelerated expansioninduced by dark energy. one model for dark energy is a positive cosmologicalconstant. it is consequently of interest to study einstein's equations with apositive cosmological constant coupled to matter satisfying the ordinary energyconditions; the dominant energy condition etc. due to the difficulty ofanalysing the behaviour of solutions to einstein's equations in general, it iscommon to either study situations with symmetry, or to prove stability results.in the present paper, we do both. in fact, we analyse, in detail, the futureasymptotic behaviour of t^3-gowdy symmetric solutions to the einstein-vlasovequations with a positive cosmological constant. in particular, we prove thecosmic no-hair conjecture in this setting. however, we also prove that thesolutions are future stable (in the class of all solutions). some of theresults hold in a more general setting. in fact, we obtain conclusionsconcerning the causal structure of t^2-symmetric solutions, assuming only thepresence of a positive cosmological constant, matter satisfying various energyconditions and future global existence. adding the assumption of t^3-gowdysymmetry to this list of requirements, we obtain c^0-estimates for all but oneof the metric components. there is consequently reason to expect that many ofthe results presented in this paper can be generalised to other types ofmatter.
