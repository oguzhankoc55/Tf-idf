observable currents in lattice field theories observable currents are spacetime local objects that induce physicalobservables when integrated on an auxiliary codimension one surface. since theresulting observables are independent of local deformations of the integrationsurface, the currents themselves carry most of the information about theinduced physical observables. i introduce observable currents in amultisymplectic framework for lagrangian field theory over discrete spacetime.one family of examples is composed by noether currents. a much larger family ofexamples is composed by currents, spacetime local objects, that encode thesymplectic product between two arbitrary vectors tangent to the space ofsolutions. a weak version of observable currents, which in general arenonlocal, is also introduced. weak observable currents can be used to separatepoints in the space of physically distinct solutions. it is shown that a largeclass of weak observable currents can be "improved" to become local. a poissonbracket gives the space of observable currents the structure of a lie algebra.peierls bracket for bulk observables gives an algebra homomorphism mappingequivalence classes of bulk observables to weak observable currents. the studycovers scalar fields, nonlinear sigma models and gauge theories (includinggauge theory formulations of general relativity) on the lattice. even when thispaper is entirely classical, this study is relevant for quantum field theorybecause a quantization of the framework leads to a spin foam model formulationof lattice field theory.
