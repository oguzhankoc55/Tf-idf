quantum cosmology in $(1+1)$-dimensional ho\v{r}ava-lifshitz theory of  gravity in a recent paper [phys. rev. d 92:084012, 2015], the author studied theclassical $(1+1)$-dimensional friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) universe filledwith a perfect fluid in ho\v{r}ava-lifshitz (hl) theory of gravity. this theoryis dynamical due to the anisotropic scaling of space and time. it alsoresembles the jackiw-teitelboim model, in which a dilatonic degree of freedomis necessary for dynamics. in this paper, i will give one step further in theunderstanding of (1+1)-dimensional hl cosmology by means of the quantization ofthe frw universe filled with a perfect fluid with equation of state (eos)$p=w\rho$. the fluid will be introduced in the model via schutz formalism anddirac's algorithm will be used for quantization. it will be shown that theschr\"odinger equation for the wave function of the universe has the followingproperties: for $w=1$ (radiation fluid), the characteristic potential will beexponential, resembling liouville quantum mechanics; for $w\neq 1$, acharacteristic inverse square potential appears in addition to a regularpolynomial which depends on the eos. explict solutions for a few cases ofinteresting will be found and the expectation value of the scale factor will becalculated. as in usual quantum cosmology, it will be shown that the quantumtheory smooth out the big-bang singularity, but the classical behavior of theuniverse is recovered in the low-energy limit.
