multi-band gravitational-wave astronomy: parameter estimation and tests  of general relativity with space and ground-based detectors with the discovery of the black hole binary (bbh) coalescence gw150914 theera of gravitational-wave (gw) astronomy has started. it has recently beenshown that bbh with masses comparable to or higher than gw150914 would bevisible in the elisa band a few years before they finally merge in the band ofground-based detectors. this would allow for pre-merger electromagnetic alerts,dramatically increasing the chances of a joint detection, if bbh are indeedluminous in the electromagnetic band. in this paper we explore a quitedifferent aspect of multi-band gw astronomy, and verify if, and to what extent,measurement of masses and sky position with elisa could improve parameterestimation and tests of general relativity with ground-based detectors. wegenerate a catalog of 200 bbh and find that having prior information from elisacan reduce the uncertainty in the measurement of source distance and primaryblack hole spin by up to factor of 2 in ground-based gw detectors. thecomponent masses estimate from elisa will not be refined by the ground baseddetectors, whereas joint analysis will yield precise characterization of thenewly formed black hole and improve consistency tests of general relativity.
