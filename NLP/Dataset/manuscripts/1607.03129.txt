quantum gravitational corrections for spinning particles we calculate the quantum corrections to the gauge-invariant gravitationalpotentials of spinning particles in flat space, induced by loops of bothmassive and massless matter fields of various types. while the corrections tothe newtonian potential induced by massless conformal matter for spinlessparticles are well-known, and the same corrections due to massless minimallycoupled scalars [s. park and r. p. woodard, class. quant. grav. 27 (2010)245008], massless non-conformal scalars [a. marunovic and t. prokopec, phys.rev. d 87 (2013) 104027] and massive scalars, fermions and vector bosons [d.burns and a. pilaftsis, phys. rev. d 91 (2015) 064047] have been recentlyderived, spinning particles receive additional corrections which are thesubject of the present work. we give both fully analytic results valid for alldistances from the particle, and present numerical results as well asasymptotic expansions. at large distances from the particle, the correctionsdue to massive fields are exponentially suppressed in comparison to thecorrections from massless fields, as one would expect. however, a surprisingresult of our analysis is that close to the particle itself, on distancescomparable to the compton wavelength of the massive fields running in theloops, these corrections can be enhanced with respect to the massless case.
