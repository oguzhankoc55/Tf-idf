historical hamiltonian dynamics: symplectic and covariant this paper presents a "historical" formalism for dynamical systems, in itshamiltonian version (lagrangian version was presented in a previous paper). itis universal, in the sense that it applies equally well to time dynamics and tofield theories on space-time. it is based on the notion of (hamiltonian)histories, which are sections of the (extended) phase space bundle. it isdeveloped in the space of sections, in contradistinction with the usualformalism which works in the bundle manifold. in field theories, the formalismremains covariant and does not require a spitting of space-time. it considersspace-time exactly in the same manner than time in usual dynamics, both beingparticular cases of the evolution domain. it applies without modification whenthe histories (the fields) are forms rather than scalar functions, like inelectromagnetism or in tetrad general relativity. we develop a differentialcalculus in the infinite dimensional space of histories. it admits a(generalized) symplectic form which does not break the covariance. we develop acovariant symplectic formalism, with generalizations of usual notions likecurrent conservation, hamiltonian vector-fields, evolution vector-field,brackets, ... the usual multisymplectic approach derives form it, as well asthe symplectic form introduced by crnkovic and witten in the space ofsolutions.
