local subsystems in gauge theory and gravity we consider the problem of defining localized subsystems in gauge theory andgravity. such systems are associated to spacelike hypersurfaces with boundariesand provide the natural setting for studying entanglement entropy of regions ofspace. we present a general formalism to associate a gauge-invariant classicalphase space to a spatial slice with boundary by introducing new degrees offreedom on the boundary. in yang-mills theory the new degrees of freedom are achoice of gauge on the boundary, transformations of which are generated by thenormal component of the nonabelian electric field. in general relativity thenew degrees of freedom are the location of a codimension-2 surface and a choiceof conformal normal frame. these degrees of freedom transform under a group ofsurface symmetries, consisting of diffeomorphisms of the codimension-2boundary, and position-dependent linear deformations of its normal plane. wefind the observables which generate these symmetries, consisting of theconformal normal metric and curvature of the normal connection. we discuss theimplications for the problem of defining entanglement entropy in quantumgravity. our work suggests that the bekenstein-hawking entropy may arise fromthe different ways of gluing together two partial cauchy surfaces at across-section of the horizon.
