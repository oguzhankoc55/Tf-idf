the global nonlinear stability of minkowski space for self-gravitating  massive fields we establish that minkowski spacetime is nonlinearly stable in presence of amassive scalar field, provided the latter has sufficiently small mass (forotherwise black holes might form). we formulate the initial value problem forthe einstein-massive scalar field equations, when the initial slice is a smallperturbation of an asymptotically flat, spacelike hypersurface in minkowskispace, and we prove that this perturbation disperses in future timelikedirections so that the associated cauchy development is future geodesicallycomplete. hence, our theory excludes the existence of dynamically unstable,self-gravitating massive fields and, therefore, solves a long-standing openproblem in general relativity. our method of proof which we refer to as thehyperboloidal foliation method substantially extends the so-called `vectorfield method', which only applies to massless scalar fields. our approach doesnot use the scaling vector field of minkowski spacetime. we rely on a foliationof the interior of a light cone by spacelike hyperboloidal hypersurfaces and ona decomposition of the einstein equations expressed in wave gauge and in asemi-hyperboloidal frame, in a sense defined in this paper. we treat here theproblem of the evolution of a spatially compact matter field, i.e. we considerinitial data coinciding, in a neighborhood of spacelike infinity, with aspacelike slice of schwarzschild spacetime. we express the einstein equationsas a system of coupled nonlinear wave-klein-gordon equations (with differentialconstraints) posed on a curved space (whose metric is the main unknown). ourmain challenge is to establish a global existence theory for this system insuitably weighted sobolev spaces.
