horizon of quantum black holes in various dimensions we adapt the horizon wave-function formalism to describe massive staticspherically symmetric sources in a general $(1+d)$-dimensional space-time, for$d&gt;3$ and including the $d=1$ case. we find that the probability $p_{\rm bh}$that such objects are (quantum) black holes behaves similarly to theprobability in the $(3+1)$ framework for $d&gt; 3$. in fact, for $d\ge 3$, theprobability increases towards unity as the mass grows above the relevant$d$-dimensional planck scale $m_d$. at fixed mass, however, $p_{\rm bh}$decreases with increasing $d$, so that a particle with mass $m\simeq m_d$ hasjust about $10\%$ probability to be a black hole in $d=5$, and smaller forlarger $d$. this result has a potentially strong impact on estimates of blackhole production in colliders. in contrast, for $d=1$, we find the probabilityis comparably larger for smaller masses, but $p_{\rm bh} &lt; 0.5$, suggestingthat such lower dimensional black holes are purely quantum and not classicalobjects. this result is consistent with recent observations that sub-planckianblack holes are governed by an effective two-dimensional gravitation theory.lastly, we derive generalised uncertainty principle relations for the blackholes under consideration, and find a minimum length corresponding to acharacteristic energy scale of the order of the fundamental gravitational mass$m_d$ in $d&gt;3$. for $d=1$ we instead find the uncertainty due to the horizonfluctuations has the same form as the usual heisenberg contribution, andtherefore no fundamental scale exists.
