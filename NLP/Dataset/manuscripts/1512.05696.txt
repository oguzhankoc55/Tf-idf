black hole formation from point-like particles in three-dimensional  anti-de sitter space we study collisions of many point-like particles in three-dimensional anti-desitter space, generalizing the known result with two particles. we show how toconstruct exact solutions corresponding to the formation of either a black holeor a conical singularity from the collision of an arbitrary number of masslessparticles falling in radially from the boundary. we find that when going awayfrom the case of equal energies and discrete rotational symmetry, this is not atrivial generalization of the two-particle case, but requires that the excisedwedges corresponding to the particles must be chosen in a very precise way fora consistent solution. we also explicitly take the limit when the number ofparticles goes to infinity and obtain thin shell solutions that in generalbreak rotational invariance, corresponding to an instantaneous andinhomogeneous perturbation at the boundary. we also compute the stress-energytensor of the shell using the junction formalism for null shells and obtainagreement with the point particle picture.
