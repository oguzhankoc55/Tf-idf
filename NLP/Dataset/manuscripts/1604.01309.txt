generalized analysis of quantum noise and dynamic back-action in  signal-recycled michelson-type laser interferometers we analyze the radiation pressure induced interaction of mirror motion andlight fields in michelson-type interferometers used for the detection ofgravitational waves and for fundamental research in table-top quantumoptomechanical experiments, focusing on the asymmetric regime with a (slightly)unbalanced beamsplitter and a (small) offset from the dark port. this regime,as it was shown recently, provides new interesting features, in particular astable optical spring and optical cooling on cavity resonance.  we show that generally the nature of optomechanical coupling inmichelson-type interferometers does not fit into the standarddispersive/dissipative dichotomy. in particular, a symmetric michelsoninterferometer with signal-recycling but without power-recycling cavity ischaracterized by a purely dissipative optomechanical coupling; only in thepresence of asymmetry, additional dispersive coupling arises. in gravitationalwaves detectors possessing signal- and power-recycling cavities, yet another,"coherent" type of optomechanical coupling takes place.  we develop here a generalized framework for the analysis of asymmetricmichelson-type interferometers which also covers the possibility of theinjection of carrier light into both ports of the interferometer. using thisframework, we analyze in depth the "anomalous" features of the michelson-sagnacinterferometer which where discussed and observed experimentally in previousworks [1-3].
