smooth causal patches for ads black holes we review the paradox of low energy excitations about an ads black hole. anappropriately chosen unitary operator in the boundary theory can create alocally strong excitation near the black hole horizon, whose global energy issmall as a result of the gravitational redshift. the paradox is that this seemsto violate a general rule of statistical mechanics, which states that anoperator with energy parametrically smaller than $k t$ cannot create asignificant excitation in a thermal system. when we carefully examine theposition dependence of the boundary unitary operator that produces theexcitation and the bulk observable necessary to detect the anomalously largeeffect, we find that they do not both fit in a single causal patch. thisfollows from a remarkable property of position space ads correlators that weestablish explicitly, and resolves the paradox in a generic state of thesystem, since no combination of observers can both create the excitation andobserve its effect. as a special case of our analysis, we show how thisresolves the "born rule" paradox of arxiv:1506.01337 and we verify our solutionusing an independent calculation. we then consider boundary states that arefinely tuned to display a spontaneous excitation outside the causal patch ofthe infalling observer, and we propose a version of causal patchcomplementarity in ads/cft that resolves the paradox for such states as well.
