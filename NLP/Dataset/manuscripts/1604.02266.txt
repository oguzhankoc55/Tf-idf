null aether theory: $pp$-wave and ads wave solutions general quantum gravity arguments predict that lorentz symmetry might nothold exactly in nature. this has motivated much interest in lorentz breakinggravity theories recently. among such models are vector-tensor theories withpreferred direction established at every point of spacetime by a fixed-normvector field. the dynamical vector field defined in this way is referred to asthe aether. in this work, we study plane wave metrics in such a theory. forthis purpose, we assume that the aether field is a null vector field satisfyingcertain conditions--we refer to the theory constructed in this way as nullaether theory (nat). assuming the kerr-schild form for such metrics we showthat the theory admits exact plane wave solutions in any dimension $d\geq3$.the field equations are reduced to two, in general coupled, differentialequations when the background metric assumes the maximally symmetric form.specifically, when the background metric is flat, i.e. for the $pp$-wavespacetimes, these equations decouple and we obtain one laplace equation and onemassive klein-gordon equation in $(d-2)$-dimensional euclidean flat space.depending on the value of the parameter $c_3$ and the form of the solution ofthe laplace equation, we show that plane waves--subclass of $pp$-waves--arealso solutions to the theory. in the case of ads background, we are able tosolve explicitly the coupled differential equations in three dimensions andthereby construct exact ads-plane wave solutions in the theory. we also showthat this latter solution can be generalised to higher dimensions under theassumption that the ads wave is homogeneous along the transverse $d-3$coordinates.
