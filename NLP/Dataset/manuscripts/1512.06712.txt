scalar field as an intrinsic time measure in coupled dynamical  matter-geometry systems. i. neutral gravitational collapse there does not exist a notion of time which could be transferredstraightforwardly from classical to quantum gravity. for this reason, a methodof time quantification which would be appropriate for gravity quantization isbeing sought. one of the existing proposals is using the evolving matter as anintrinsic `clock' while investigating the dynamics of gravitational systems.the objective of our research was to check whether scalar fields can serve astime variables during a dynamical evolution of a coupled multi-componentmatter-geometry system. we concentrated on a neutral case, which means that theelaborated system was not charged electrically nor magnetically. for thispurpose, we investigated a gravitational collapse of a self-interacting complexand real scalar fields in the brans-dicke theory using the 2+2 spacetimefoliation. we focused mainly on the region of high curvature appearing nearbythe emerging singularity, which is essential from the perspective of quantumgravity. we investigated several formulations of the theory for various valuesof the brans-dicke coupling constant and the coupling between the brans-dickefield and the matter sector of the theory. the obtained results indicated thatthe evolving scalar fields can be treated as time variables in close proximityof the singularity due to the following reasons. the constancy hypersurfaces ofthe brans-dicke field are spacelike in the vicinity of the singularity apartfrom the case, in which the equation of motion of the field reduces to the waveequation due to a specific choice of free evolution parameters. thehypersurfaces of constant complex and real scalar fields are spacelike in theregions nearby the singularities formed during the examined process. the valuesof the field functions change monotonically in the areas, in which theconstancy hypersurfaces are spacelike.
