induced gravity ii: grand unification as an illustration of a renormalizable, asymptotically-free model of inducedgravity, we consider an $so(10)$ gauge theory interacting with a real scalarmultiplet in the adjoint representation. we show that dimensional transmutationcan occur, spontaneously breaking $so(10)$ to $su(5){\otimes}u(1),$ whileinducing the planck mass and a positive cosmological constant, all proportionalto the same scale $v$. all mass ratios are functions of the values of couplingconstants at that scale. below this scale (at which the big bang may occur),the model takes the usual form of einstein-hilbert gravity in de sitter spaceplus calculable corrections. we show that there exist regions of parameterspace in which the breaking results in a local minimum of the effective action,and a {\bf positive} dilaton $(\hbox{mass})^2$ from two-loop correctionsassociated with the conformal anomaly. furthermore, unlike the singlet case weconsidered previously, some minima lie within the basin of attraction of theultraviolet fixed point. moreover, the asymptotic behavior of the couplingconstants also lie within the range of convergence of the euclidean pathintegral, so there is hope that there will be candidates for sensible vacua.although open questions remain concerning unitarity of all such renormalizablemodels of gravity, it is not obvious that, in curved backgrounds such as thoseconsidered here, unitarity is violated. in any case, any violation that mayremain will be suppressed by inverse powers of the reduced planck mass.
