spacetime causal structure and dimension from horismotic relation a reflexive relation on a set can be a starting point in defining the causalstructure of a spacetime in general relativity and other relativistic theoriesof gravity. if we identify this relation as the relation between lightlikeseparated events (the horismos relation), we can construct in a natural way theentire causal structure: causal and chronological relations, causal curves, anda topology. by imposing a simple additional condition, the structure gains adefinite number of dimensions. this construction works both with continuous anddiscrete spacetimes. the dimensionality is obtained also in the discrete case,so this approach can be suited to prove the fundamental conjecture of causalsets. other simple conditions lead to a differentiable manifold with aconformal structure (the metric up to a scaling factor) as in lorentzianmanifolds. this structure provides a simple and general reconstruction of thespacetime in relativistic theories of gravity, which normally requirestopological structure, differential structure, geometric structure (whichdecomposes in the conformal structure, giving the causal relations, and thevolume element). motivations for such a reconstruction come from relativistictheories of gravity, where the conformal structure is important, from theproblem of singularities, and from quantum gravity, where variousdiscretization methods are pursued, particularly in the causal sets approach.
