entanglement entropy in a holographic kondo model we calculate entanglement and impurity entropies in a recent holographicmodel of a magnetic impurity interacting with a strongly coupled system. thereis an rg flow to an ir fixed point where the impurity is screened, leading to adecrease in impurity degrees of freedom. this information loss corresponds to avolume decrease in our dual gravity model, which consists of a codimension onehypersurface embedded in a btz black hole background in three dimensions. thereare matter fields defined on this hypersurface which are dual to kondo fieldtheory operators. in the large n limit, the formation of the kondo cloudcorresponds to the condensation of a scalar field. the entropy is calculatedaccording to the ryu-takayanagi prescription. this requires to determine thebackreaction of the hypersurface on the btz geometry, which is achieved bysolving the israel junction conditions. we find that the larger the scalarcondensate gets, the more the volume of constant time slices in the bulk isreduced, shortening the bulk geodesics and reducing the impurity entropy. thisprovides a new non-trivial example of an rg flow satisfying the g-theorem.moreover, we find explicit expressions for the impurity entropy which are inagreement with previous field theory results for free electrons. thisdemonstrates the universality of perturbing about an ir fixed point.
