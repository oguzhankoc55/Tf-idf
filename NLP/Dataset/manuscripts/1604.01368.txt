early universe dynamos from neutrino oscillations induced by torsion earlier de sabbata and gasperini have shown that neutrinos oscillation whichgives them a mass can be induced by torsion. more recently enqvist et al haveshown that it is possible to use massive neutrinos bbn magnetic fields to seedgalactic magnetic fields. thus based on these previous investigations wepresent several examples of how obtaining cosmological magnetic seed fields asgalactic magnetic fields from massive neutrino densities and also from thetorsion obtained by nitsch as $t\approx{10^{-24}s^{-1}}$ at the present daywhich yields magnetic seed field of the order of $b_{seed}\approx{10^{-12}g}$.in the case we use torsion derived from massive neutrinos given by$t_{\nu}\approx{10^{-26}s^{-1}}$ one obtains in bbn time $t\approx{1s}$ withthe primordial nucleosynthesis magnetic field given by$b_{bbn}\approx{10^{11}g}$ a relic magnetic field $b_{c}\approx{10^{39}g}$which shows that the result obtained by enqvist et al for the cosmologicalfields at the early universe. galactic dynamo seed could be obtained fromneutrinos at recombination. it is also shown that in the approximation of weakfields torsion can slow down the decay of magnetic fields which confirmsprevious results. at planck era where the time is $t\sim{10^{-43}s}$ and$b_{pl}\sim{10^{58}g}$ the use of formula with the strongest torsion$10^{-19}g$this yields $b_{seed}\sim{10^{-4}g}$ is a too strong field towarrant a galactic dynamo seed.
