conformal flow on $s^3$ and weak field integrability in ads$_4$ we consider the conformally invariant cubic wave equation on the einsteincylinder $\mathbb{r} \times \mathbb{s}^3$ for small rotationally symmetricinitial data. this simple equation captures many key challenges of nonlinearwave dynamics in confining geometries, while a conformal transformation relatesit to a self-interacting conformally coupled scalar in four-dimensional anti-desitter spacetime (ads$_4$) and connects it to various questions of adsstability. we construct an effective infinite-dimensional time-averageddynamical system accurately approximating the original equation in the weakfield regime. it turns out that this effective system, which we call theconformal flow, exhibits some remarkable features, such as low-dimensionalinvariant subspaces, a wealth of stationary states (for which energy does notflow between the modes), as well as solutions with nontrivial exactly periodicenergy flows. based on these observations and close parallels to the cubicszego equation, which was shown by gerard and grellier to be lax-integrable, itis tempting to conjecture that the conformal flow and the corresponding weakfield dynamics in ads$_4$ are integrable as well.
