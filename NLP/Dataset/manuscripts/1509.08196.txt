introducing a classical einstein-langevin equation: proposing a theory  for classical stochastic gravity we attempt to introduce an new approach towards study of certain interestingissues in classical gravity. this can be done for few confined, but interestingand meaningful physical situations, which can be modeled by a classicalstochastic einstein equation. the einstein equation can be looked upon as anequation of motion, while introducing to it a classical stochastic source orclassical fluctuations as driving source. this is analogous to the langevinequation formalism, in brownian motion studies. a justification for thevalidity of such an ansatz for classical gravity is given. the regime ofvalidity of such an approach and the consequences and possible outcomes of thisformulation are discussed. we also mention, further relevant directions andapplications of the same,that act as motivation towards the new proposal. thisfield of study can be seen to emerge out of well established ideas and resultsin brownian motion theory as well as the stochastic semiclassical gravity(which is already an active area of research at present) and related issues inthermodynamics . these two areas form the foundations for building up thetheory. the applicability of the proposed theme can have a wider expanse thanis mentioned here.
