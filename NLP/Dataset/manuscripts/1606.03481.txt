$o(n)$ model in euclidean de sitter space: beyond the leading infrared  approximation we consider an $o(n)$ scalar field model with quartic interaction in$d$-dimensional euclidean de sitter space. in order to avoid the problems ofthe standard perturbative calculations for light and massless fields, wegeneralize to the $o(n)$ theory a systematic method introduced previously for asingle field, which treats the zero modes exactly and the nonzero modesperturbatively. we compute the two-point functions taking into account not onlythe leading infrared contribution, coming from the self-interaction of the zeromodes, but also corrections due to the interaction of the ultraviolet modes.for the model defined in the corresponding lorentzian de sitter spacetime, weobtain the two-point functions by analytical continuation. we point out that apartial resummation of the leading secular terms (which necessarily involvesnonzero modes) is required to obtain a decay at large distances for masslessfields. we implement this resummation along with a systematic double expansionin an effective coupling constant $\sqrt\lambda$ and in $1/n$. we explicitlyperform the calculation up to the next-to-next-to-leading order in$\sqrt\lambda$ and up to next-to-leading to order $1/n$. the results reduce tothose known in the leading infrared approximation. we also show that theycoincide with the ones obtained directly in lorentzian de sitter spacetime inthe large $n$ limit, provided the same renormalization scheme is used.
