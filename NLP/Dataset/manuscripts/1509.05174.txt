wavy way to the kerr metric and the quantum nature of its ring  singularity from inherent non-linearity two gravitational waves, unless they areunidirectional, fail to satisfy a superposition law. they collide to develop anew spacetime carrying the imprints of the incoming waves. same behaviour isvalid also for any massless lightlike field. as a result of the violentcollision process either a naked singularity or a cauchy horizon (ch) develops.it was shown by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos (cx) that a particular class ofcolliding gravitational waves (cgw) spacetime is locally isometric to the kerrmetric for rotating black holes. this relation came to be known as the cxduality. such a duality can be exploited as an alternative derivation for thekerr metric as we do herein. not each case gives rise to a ch but those whichdo are transient to a black hole state provided stability requirements are met.these classical considerations can be borrowed to shed light on black holeformation in high energy collisions. their questionable stability and manyother sophisticated agenda, we admit that await for a full - fledged quantumgravity. yet, to add an element of novelty, a quantum probe is sent in theplane $\theta =\pi /2$ to the naked ring singularity of kerr which develops forthe overspinning case $(a&gt;m)$ to test it from a quantum picture. we show thatthe spatial operator of the reduced klein-gordon equation has a uniqueself-adjoint extension. as a result, the classical kerr`s ring singularity ishealed and becomes quantum regular. our poetic message of the paper issummarized as  let there be light  that collide with might  to disperse the night  and create holes that are white
