strong field gravitational lensing by a charged galileon black hole strong field gravitational lensings are dramatically disparate from those inthe weak field by representing relativistic images due to light winds one toinfinity loops around a lens before escaping. we study such a lensing caused bya charged galileon black hole, which is expected to have possibility to evadeno-hair theorem. we calculate the angular separations and time delays betweendifferent relativistic images of the charged galileon black hole. all theseobservables can potentially be used to discriminate a charged galileon blackhole from others. we estimate the magnitudes of these observables for theclosest supermassive black hole sgr a*. the strong field lensing observables ofthe charged galileon black hole can be close to those of a tidalreissner-nordstr\"{o}m black hole or those of a reissner-nordstr\"{o}m blackhole. it will be helpful to distinguish these black holes if we can separatethe outermost relativistic images and determine their angular separation,brightness difference and time delay, although it requires techniques beyondthe current limit.
