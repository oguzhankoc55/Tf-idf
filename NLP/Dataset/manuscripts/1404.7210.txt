propagation of test particles and scalar fields on a class of wormhole  space-times in this paper, we consider the problem of test particles and test scalarfields propagating on the background of a class of wormhole space-times. fortest particles, we solve for arbitrary causal geodesics in terms of integralswhich are solved numerically. these integrals are parametrized by the radiusand shape of the wormhole throat as well as the initial conditions of thegeodesic trajectory. in terms of these parameters, we compute the conditionsfor the geodesic to traverse the wormhole, to be reflected by the wormhole'spotential or to be captured on an unstable bound orbit at the wormhole'sthroat. these causal geodesics are visualized by embedding plots in euclideanspace in cylindrical coordinates. for massless test scalar fields, we computetransmission coefficients and quasi-normal modes for arbitrary coupling of thefield to the background geometry in the wkb approximation. we show thatsolutions of the scalar wave equation on this class of wormholes are stableonly for certain values of the coupling constant. this analysis is interestingsince recent computations of self-interactions of a static scalar field inwormhole space-times reveal some anomalous dependence on the coupling constantsuch as the existence of an infinite discrete set of poles. we show that thispathological behavior of the self-field is an artifact of computing theinteraction for values of the coupling constant that do not lie in the domainof stability.
