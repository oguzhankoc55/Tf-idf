quasilocal energy exchange and the null cone energy is at best defined quasilocally in general relativity. quasilocalenergy definitions depend on the conditions one imposes on the boundaryhamiltonian, i.e., how a finite region of spacetime is "isolated". here, wepropose a method to define and investigate systems in terms of their matterplus gravitational energy content. we adopt a generic construction, thatinvolves embedding of an arbitrary dimensional worldsheet into an arbitrarydimensional spacetime, to a 2 + 2 picture. in our case, the closed2-dimensional spacelike surface $\mathbb{s}$, that is orthogonal to the2-dimensional timelike worldsheet $\mathbb{t}$ at every point, encloses thesystem in question. the integrability conditions of $\mathbb{t}$ and$\mathbb{s}$ correspond to three null tetrad gauge conditions once we transformour notation to the one of the null cone observables. we interpret theraychaudhuri equation of $\mathbb{t}$ as a work-energy relation for systemsthat are not in equilibrium with their surroundings. we achieve this byidentifying the quasilocal charge densities corresponding to rotational andnonrotational degrees of freedom, in addition to a relative work densityassociated with tidal fields. we define the corresponding quasilocal chargesthat appear in our work-energy relation and which can potentially be exchangedwith the surroundings. these charges and our tetrad conditions are invariantunder type-iii lorentz transformations, i.e., the boosting of the observers inthe directions orthogonal to $\mathbb{s}$. we apply our construction to aradiating vaidya spacetime, a c-metric and the interior of a lanczos-vanstockum dust metric. the delicate issues related to the axially symmetricstationary spacetimes and possible extensions to the kerr geometry are alsodiscussed.
