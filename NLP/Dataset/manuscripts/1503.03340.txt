extended phase space of ads black holes in einstein-gauss-bonnet gravity  with a quadratic nonlinear electrodynamics in this paper, we consider quadratic maxwell invariant as a correction to themaxwell theory and study thermodynamic behavior of the black holes in einsteinand gauss-bonnet gravities. we consider cosmological constant as athermodynamic pressure to extend phase space. next, we obtain critical valuesin case of variation of nonlinearity and gauss-bonnet parameters. although thegeneral thermodynamical behavior of the black hole solutions is the same asusual van der waals system, we show that in special case of the nonlinearelectromagnetic field, there will be a turning point for the phase diagrams andusual van der waals is not observed. this theory of nonlinear electromagneticfield provides two critical horizon radii. we show that this unusual behaviorof phase diagrams is due to existence of second critical horizon radius. itwill be pointed out that the power of the gravity and nonlinearity of thematter field modify the critical values. we generalize the study by consideringthe effects of dimensionality on critical values and make comparisons betweenour models with their special sub classes. in addition, we examine thepossibility of the existence of the reentrant phase transitions through twodifferent methods.
