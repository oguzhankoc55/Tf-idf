exceptional quantum geometry and particle physics based on an interpretation of the quark-lepton symmetry in terms of theunimodularity of the color group $su(3)$ and on the existence of 3 generations,we develop an argumentation suggesting that the "finite quantum space"corresponding to the exceptional real jordan algebra of dimension 27 (theeuclidean albert algebra) is relevant for the description of internal spaces inthe theory of particles. in particular, the triality which corresponds to the 3off-diagonal octonionic elements of the exceptional algebra is associated tothe 3 generations of the standard model while the representation of theoctonions as a complex 4-dimensional space $\mathbb c\oplus\mathbb c^3$ isassociated to the quark-lepton symmetry, (one complex for the lepton and 3 forthe corresponding quark). more generally it is is suggested that thereplacement of the algebra of real functions on spacetime by the algebra offunctions on spacetime with values in a finite-dimensional euclidean jordanalgebra which plays the role of "the algebra of real functions" on thecorresponding almost classical quantum spacetime is relevant in particlephysics. this leads us to study the theory of jordan modules and to develop thedifferential calculus over jordan algebras, (i.e. to introduce the appropriatenotion of differential forms). we formulate the corresponding definition ofconnections on jordan modules.
