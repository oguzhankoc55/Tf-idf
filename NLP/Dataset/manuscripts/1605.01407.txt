universality of black hole quantum computing by analyzing the key properties of black holes from the point of view ofquantum information, we derive a model-independent picture of black holequantum computing. it has been noticed that this picture exhibits strikingsimilarities with quantum critical condensates, allowing the use of a commonlanguage to describe quantum computing in both systems. we analyze such quantumcomputing by allowing coupling to external modes, under the condition that theexternal influence must be soft-enough in order not to offset the basicproperties of the system. we derive model-independent bounds on some crucialtime-scales, such as the times of gate operation, decoherence, maximalentanglement and total scrambling. we show that for black hole type quantumcomputers all these time-scales are of the order of the black hole half-lifetime. furthermore, we construct explicitly a set of hamiltonians that generatesa universal set of quantum gates for the black hole type computer. we find thatthe gates work at maximal energy efficiency. furthermore, we establish afundamental bound on the complexity of quantum circuits encoded on thesesystems, and characterize the unitary operations that are implementable. itbecomes apparent that the computational power is very limited due to the factthat the black hole life-time is of the same order of the gate operation time.as a consequence, it is impossible to retrieve its information, within thelife-time of a black hole, by externally coupling to the black hole qubits.however, we show that, in principle, coupling to some of the internal degreesof freedom allows acquiring knowledge about the micro-state. still, due to thetrivial complexity of operations that can be performed, there is no timeadvantage over the collection of hawking radiation and subsequent decoding.
