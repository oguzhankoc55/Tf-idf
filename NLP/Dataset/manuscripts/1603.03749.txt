black hole nonmodal linear stability: the schwarzschild (a)ds cases the nonmodal linear stability of the schwarzschild black hole established inphys. rev. lett. 112 (2014) 191101 is generalized to the case of a nonnegativecosmological constant $\lambda$. two gauge invariant combinations $g_{\pm}$ ofperturbed scalars made out of the weyl tensor and its first covariantderivative are found such that the map $[h_{\alpha \beta}] \to \left( g_-\left([h_{\alpha \beta}] \right), g_+ \left([h_{\alpha \beta}] \right) \right)$with domain the set of equivalent classes $[h_{\alpha \beta}]$ under gaugetransformations of solutions of the linearized einstein's equation, isinvertible. the way to reconstruct a representative of $[h_{\alpha \beta}]$ interms of $(g_-,g_+)$ is given. it is proved that, for an arbitrary perturbationconsistent with the background asymptote, $g_+$ and $g_-$ are bounded in thethe outer static region. at large times, the perturbation decays leaving alinearized kerr black hole around the schwarzschild or schwarschild de sitterbackground solution. for negative cosmological constant it is shown that thereis a choice of boundary conditions at the time-like boundary under which theschwarzschild anti de sitter black hole is unstable. the root ofchandrasekhar's duality relating odd and even modes is exhibited, and sometechnicalities related to this duality and omitted in the original proof of the$\lambda=0$ case are explained in detail.
