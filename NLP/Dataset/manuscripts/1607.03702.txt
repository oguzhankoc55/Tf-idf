an alternative perspective to observe the critical phenomena of dilaton  ads black holes the critical phenomena of dilaton ads black holes are probed from a totallydifferent perspective other than the $p-v$ criticality and the $q-u$criticality discussed in the former literature. we investigate not only the twopoint correlation function but also the entanglement entropy of dilaton adsblack holes. we achieve this goal by solving the equation of motion constrainedby the boundary condition numerically and we concentrate on $\delta l$ and$\delta s$ which have been regularized by subtracting the terms in pure adswith the same boundary region. for both the two point correlation function andthe entanglement entropy, we consider $4\times2\times2=16$ cases due todifferent choices of parameters. the van der waals like behavior can be clearlywitnessed from all the $t-\delta l$ ($t-\delta s$) graphs for $q&lt;q_c$.moreover, the effects of dilaton gravity and the spacetime dimensionality onthe phase structure of dilaton ads black holes are disclosed. furthermore, wediscuss the stability of dilaton ads black holes by applying the analogousspecific heat definition and remove the unstable branch by introducing a bar$t=t_*$. it is shown that the first order phase transition temperature $t_*$ isaffected by both $\alpha$ and $n$. the analogous equal area laws for both the$t-\delta l$ graph and the $t-\delta s$ graph are examined numerically. therelative errors for all the cases are small enough that we can safely concludethat the analogous equal area laws hold for $t-\delta l$ ($t-\delta s$) graphof dilaton ads black holes.
