power-law and intermediate inflationary models in f(t)-gravity we study inflation in the framework of $f(t)$-gravity in the presence of acanonical scalar field. after reviewing the basic equations governing thebackground cosmology in $f(t)$-gravity, we turn to study the cosmologicalperturbations and obtain the evolutionary equations for the scalar and tensorperturbations. solving those equations, we find the power spectra for thescalar and tensor perturbations. then, we consider a power-law form for the$f(t)$ function in the action and examine the inflationary models with thepower-law and intermediate scale factors. we see that in contrast with thestandard inflationary scenario based on the einstein gravity, in the considered$f(t)$-gravity scenario, the power-law and intermediate inflationary models canbe compatible with the observational results of planck 2015 at 68\% cl. in our$f(t)$-gravity setting, the potentials responsible for both the power-law andintermediate inflationary models have the power-law form $v(\phi ) \propto{\phi ^m}$ but the power $m$ is different for them. therefore, we can refinesome of power-law inflationary potentials in the framework of $f(t)$-gravitywhile they are disfavored by the observational data in the standardinflationary scenario. interestingly enough, the self-interacting quarticpotential $v(\phi ) \propto {\phi ^4}$ which has special reheating properties,can be consistent with the planck 2015 data in our $f(t)$-gravity scenariowhile it is ruled out in the standard inflationary scenario.
