translational symmetry breaking in higgs &amp; gauge theory, and the  cosmological constant we argue, at a very basic effective field theory level, that higher dimensionoperators in scalar theories that break symmetries at scales close to theirultraviolet completion cutoff, include terms that favour the breaking oftranslation (lorentz) invariance, potentially resulting in striped, chequeredboard or general crystal-like phases. such descriptions can be thought of asthe effective low energy description of qcd-like gauge theories near theirstrong coupling scale where terms involving higher dimension operators aregenerated. our low energy theory consists of scalar fields describing operatorssuch as $\bar{q} q$ and $\bar{q} f^{(2n)} q$. such scalars can have kineticmixing terms that generate effective momentum dependent contributions to themass matrix. we show that these can destabilize the translationally invariantvacuum. it is possible that in some real gauge theory such operators couldbecome sufficiently dominant to realize such phases and it would be interestingto look for them in lattice simulations. we present a holographic model of thesame phenomena which includes rg running. a key phenomenological motive to lookat such states is recent work that shows that the non-linear response in $r^2$gravity to such short range fluctuations can mimic a cosmological constant.intriguingly in a cosmology with such a starobinsky inflation term, to generatethe observed value of the present day acceleration would require stripes at theelectroweak scale. unfortunately, low energy phenomenological constraints onlorentz violation in the electron-photon system appear to strongly rule out anysuch possibility outside of a disconnected dark sector.
