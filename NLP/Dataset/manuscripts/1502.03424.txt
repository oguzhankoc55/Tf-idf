effective dark energy from decoherence within the quantum darwinist framework introduced by w. h. zurek ({\em nat.phys.}, 5:181-188, 2009), observers obtain pointer-state information aboutquantum systems by interacting with a local sample of the surroundingenvironment, e.g. a local sample of the ambient photon field. because theenvironment encodes such pointer state information uniformly and henceredundantly throughout its entire volume, the information is equally availableto all observers regardless of their location. this framework is applied to theobservation of stellar center-of-mass positions, which are assumed to beencoded by the ambient photon field in a way that is uniformly accessible toall possible observers. assuming landauer's principle, constructing suchenvironmental encodings requires $(ln2) kt$ per encoded bit. for the observed10$^{24}$ stars and a uniform binary encoding of center-of-mass positions intovoxels with a linear dimension of 5 km, the free energy required at the currentcmb temperature t = 2.7 k is $\sim$ 2.5 $\cdot$ 10$^{-27}$ kg $\cdot$ m$^{-3}$,strikingly close to the observed value of $\omega_{\lambda} \rho_{c}$.decreasing the voxel size to $(l_{p})^{3}$ results in a free energy requirement10$^{117}$ times larger.
