on geometry of deformed black holes: i. majumdar-papapetrou binary although black holes are eminent manifestations of very strong gravity, thegeometry of space-time around and even inside them can be significantlyaffected by additional bodies present in their surroundings. we study such aninfluence within static and axially symmetric (electro-)vacuum space-timesdescribed by exact solutions of einstein's equations, consideringastrophysically motivated configurations (such as black holes surrounded byrings) as well as those of pure academic interest (such as specifically "tuned"systems of multiple black holes). the geometry is represented by the simplestinvariants determined by the metric (the lapse function) and its gradient(gravitational acceleration), with special emphasis given to curvature (thekretschmann and ricci-square scalars). these quantities are analyzed and theirlevel surfaces plotted both above and below the black-hole horizons, inparticular near the central singularities. estimating that the black hole couldbe most strongly affected by the other black hole, we focus, in this firstpaper, on the majumdar--papapetrou solution for a binary black hole and comparethe deformation caused by "the other" hole (and the electrostatic field) withthat induced by rotational dragging in the well-known kerr and kerr--newmansolutions.
