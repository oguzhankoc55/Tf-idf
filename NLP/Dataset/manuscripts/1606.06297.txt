gravitational self-force on eccentric equatorial orbits around a kerr  black hole this paper presents the first calculation of the gravitational self-force ona small compact object on an eccentric equatorial orbit around a kerr blackhole to first order in the mass-ratio. that is the pointwise correction to theobject's equations of motion (both conservative and dissipative) due to its owngravitational field treated as a linear perturbation to the background kerrspacetime generated by the much larger spinning black hole. the calculationbuilds on recent advances on constructing the local metric and self-force fromsolutions of the teukolsky equation, which led to the calculation of thedetweiler-barack-sago redshift invariant on eccentric equatorial orbits arounda kerr black hole in a previous paper.  after deriving the necessary expression to obtain the self-force from theweyl scalar $\psi_4$, we perform several consistency checks of the method andnumerical implementation, including a check of the balance law relating orbitalaverage of the self-force to average flux of energy and angular momentum out ofthe system. particular attention is paid to the pointwise convergenceproperties of the sum over frequency modes in our method, identifying asystematic inherent loss of precision that any frequency domain calculation ofthe self-force on eccentric orbits must overcome.
