quasinormal frequencies of self-dual black holes one simplified black hole model constructed from a semiclassical analysis ofloop quantum gravity (lqg) is called self-dual black hole. this black holesolution depends on a free dimensionless parameter p known as the polymericparameter and also on the $a_{0}$ area related to the minimum area gap of lqg.in the limit of p and $a_{0}$ going to zero, the usual schwarzschild-solutionis recovered. here we investigate the quasinormal modes (qnms) of masslessscalar perturbations in the self-dual black hole background. we compute the qnfrequencies using the sixth order wkb approximation method and compare themwith numerical solutions of the regge-wheeler equation. our results show thatas the parameter p grows, the real part of the qn frequencies suffers aninitial increase and then starts to decrease while the magnitude of theimaginary one decreases for fixed area gap $a_{0}$. this particular featuremeans that the damping of scalar perturbations in the self-dual black holespacetimes are slower, and their oscillations are faster or slower according tothe value of p.
