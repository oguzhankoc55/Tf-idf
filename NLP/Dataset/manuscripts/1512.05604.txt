cosmic acceleration from matter-curvature coupling we consider f(r; t) modified theory of gravity in which, in general, thegravitational lagrangian is given by an arbitrary function of the ricci scalarand the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. we indicate that in this type ofthe theory, the coupling energy-momentum tensor is not conserved. however, wemainly focus on a particular model wherein matter is minimally coupled to thegeometry in the metric formalism and wherein, its coupling energy-momentumtensor is also conserved. we obtain the corresponding raychaudhuri dynamicalequation that gives the evolution of the kinematic quantities. then for thechosen model, we derive the behavior of the deceleration parameter, and showthat the coupling term can lead to an acceleration phase after the matterdominated phase. on the other hand, the curvature of the universe correspondswith the deviation from parallelism in the geodesic motion. thus, we alsoscrutinize the motion of the test particles on their geodesics, and derive thegeodesic deviation equation in this modified theory to study the acceleratinguniverse within the spatially flat flrw background. actually, this equationgives the relative accelerations of adjacent particles as a measurable physicalquantity, and provides an elegant tool to investigate the timelike and the nullstructure of spacetime geometries. then, through the null deviation vector, wefind the observer area-distance as a function of the redshift for the chosenmodel, and compare the results with the corresponding results obtained in theliterature.
