the gravitational s-matrix: erice lectures these lectures discuss an s-matrix approach to quantum gravity, and itsrelation to more local spacetime approaches. prominent among the problems ofquantum gravity are those of unitarity and observables. in a unitary theorywith solutions approximating minkowski space, the s-matrix (or, in fourdimensions, related inclusive probabilities) should be sharply formulated andphysical. features of its perturbative description are reviewed. a successfulquantum gravity theory should in particular address the questions posed by theultrahigh-energy regime. some control can be gained in this regime by varyingthe impact parameter as well as the collision energy. however, with decreasingimpact parameter gravity becomes strong, first eikonalizing, and then enteringthe regime where in the classical approximation black holes form. here oneconfronts what may be the most profound problem of quantum gravity, that ofproviding unitary amplitudes, as seen through the information problem of blackhole evaporation. existing approaches to quantum gravity leave a number ofunanswered questions in this regime; there are strong indications that newprinciples and mechanisms are needed, and in particular there is a good casethat usual notions of locality are inaccurate. one approach to these questionsis investigation of the approximate local dynamics of spacetime, itsobservables, and its limitations; another is to directly explore properties ofthe gravitational s-matrix, such as analyticity, crossing, and others impliedby gravitational physics.
