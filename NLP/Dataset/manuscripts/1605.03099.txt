how logic interacts with geometry: infinitesimal curvature of  categorical spaces in category theory, logic and geometry cooperate with each other producingwhat is known under the name synthetic differential geometry (sdg). the maindifference between sdg and standard differential geometry is that theintuitionistic logic of sdg enforces the existence of infinitesimal objectswhich essentially modify the local structure of spaces considered in sdg. wefocus on an "infinitesimal version" of sdg, an infinitesimal $n$-dimensionalformal manifold, and develop differential geometry on it. in particular, weshow that the riemann curvature tensor on infinitesimal level is itselfinfinitesimal. we construct a heuristic model $s^3 \times \mathbb{r} \subset\mathbb{r}^4$ and study it from two perspectives: the perspective of thecategory set and that of the so-called topos $\mathcal{g}$ of germ-determinedideals. we show that the fact that in this model the curvature tensor isinfinitesimal (in $\mathcal{g}$-perspective) eliminates the existingsingularity. a surprising effect is that the hybrid geometry based on theexistence of the infinitesimal and the set levels generates an exotic smoothstructure on $\mathbb{r}^4$. we briefly discuss the obtained results andindicate their possible applications.
