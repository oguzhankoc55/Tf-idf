analytic dependence is an unnecessary requirement in renormalization of  locally covariant qft finite renormalization freedom in locally covariant quantum field theories oncurved spacetime is known to be tightly constrained, under certain standardhypotheses, to the same terms as in flat spacetime up to finitely manycurvature dependent terms. these hypotheses include, in particular, locality,covariance, scaling, microlocal regularity and continuous and analyticdependence on the metric and coupling parameters. the analytic dependencehypothesis is somewhat unnatural, because it requires that locally covariantobservables (which are simultaneously defined on all spacetimes) dependcontinuously on an arbitrary metric, with the dependence strengthened toanalytic on analytic metrics. moreover the fact that analytic metrics areglobally rigid makes the implementation of this requirement at the level oflocal $*$-algebras of observables rather technically cumbersome. we show thatthe conditions of locality, covariance, scaling and a naturally strengthenedmicrolocal spectral condition, are actually sufficient to constrain the allowedfinite renormalizations equally strongly, thus eliminating both the continuityand the somewhat unnatural analyticity hypotheses. the key step in the proofuses the peetre-slov\'ak theorem on the characterization of (in generalnon-linear) differential operators by their locality and regularity properties.
