emergent horizon, hawking radiation and chaos in the collapsed polymer  model of a black hole we have proposed that the interior of a macroscopic schwarzschild black hole(bh) consists of highly excited, long, closed, interacting strings and, assuch, can be modeled as a collapsed polymer. it was previously shown that thescaling relations of the collapsed-polymer model agree with those of the bh.the current paper further substantiates this proposal with an investigationinto some of its dynamical consequences. in particular, we show that the modelpredicts, without relying on gravitational effects, an emergent horizon. wefurther show that the horizon fluctuates quantum mechanically as it should andthat the strength of the fluctuations is inversely proportional to the bhentropy. it is then demonstrated that the emission of hawking radiation isrealized microscopically by the quantum-induced escape of small pieces ofstring, with the rate of escape and the energy per emitted piece bothparametrically matching the hawking temperature. we also show, using standardmethods from statistical mechanics and chaos theory, how our model accounts forsome other known properties of bhs. these include the accepted results for thescrambling time and the viscosity-to-entropy ratio, which in our model applynot only at the horizon but throughout the bh interior.
