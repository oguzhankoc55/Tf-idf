semi-classical locality for the non-relativistic path integral in  configuration space in a previous paper, we have put forward an interpretation of quantummechanics based on a non-relativistic, lagrangian 3+1 formalism of a closeduniverse $m$, existing on timeless configuration space $\mathcal{m}$. however,not much was said there about the role of locality, which was not assumed. thispaper is an attempt to fill that gap. to deal with the challenges gaugesymmetries may pose to a good definition of locality, i start by demandingsymmetries to have an action on $\mathcal{m}$ so that the quotient wrt thesymmetries respects certain factorizations of $\mathcal{m}$. thesefactorizations are algebraic splits of $\mathcal{m}$ into sub-spaces$\mathcal{m}=\bigoplus_i \mathcal{m}_{o_i}$-- each factor corresponding to aphysical sub-region $o_i$. this deals with kinematic locality, but locality infull can only emerge dynamically, and is not postulated. i describe conditionsunder which it can be said to have emerged. the dynamics of $o$ is independentof its complement, $m-o$, if the projection of extremal curves on $m$ onto thespace of extremal curves intrinsic to $o$ is a surjective map. this roughlycorresponds to $e^{i\hat{h}t}\circ \mathsf{pr}_{\mbox{o}}= \mathsf{pr}_{\mbox{o}}\circ e^{i\hat{h}t}$, where $\mathsf{pr}_{\mbox{ o}}:\mathcal{m}\rightarrow\mathcal{m}_o^{\partial o}$ is a linear projection. this criterion for localitycan be made approximate -- an impossible feat had it been already postulated --and it can be applied for theories which do not have hyperbolic equations ofmotion, and/or no fixed causal structure. when two regions are \emph{mutuallyindependent} according to the criterion proposed here, the semi-classical pathintegral kernel factorizes, showing cluster decomposition which is what onewould like to obtain from any definition of locality.
