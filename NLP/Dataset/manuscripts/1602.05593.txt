on the universality of thermodynamics and $\eta/s$ ratio for the charged  lovelock black branes we investigate general features of charged lovelock black branes by giving adetailed description of geometrical, thermodynamic and holographic propertiesof charged gauss-bonnet (gb) black branes in five dimensions. we show that whenexpressed in terms of effective physical parameters, the thermodynamicbehaviour of charged gb black branes is completely indistinguishable from thatof charged einstein black branes. moreover, the extremal, near-horizon limit ofthe two classes of branes is exactly the same as they allow for the sameads$_2\times r_3$, near-horizon, exact solution. this implies that, although inthe uv the associated dual qfts are different, they flow in the ir to the samefixed point. the calculation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$confirms these results. despite the gb dual plasma has in general anon-universal temperature-dependent $\eta/s$, it flows monotonically to theuniversal value $1/4\pi$ in the ir. for negative (positive) gb couplingconstant, $\eta/s$ is an increasing (decreasing) function of the temperatureand the flow respects (violates) the kss bound.
