thermodynamic motivations of spherically symmetric static metrics bearing the thermodynamic arguments together with the two definitions of massin mind, we try to find metrics with spherical symmetry. we consider theadiabatic condition along with the gong-wang mass, and evaluate the $g_{rr}$element which points to a null hypersurface. in addition, we generalize thethermodynamics laws to this hypersurface to find its temperature and thus thecorresponding surface gravity which enables us to get a relation for the$g_{tt}$ element. moreover, we investigate the mathematical and physicalproperties of the discovered metric in the einstein relativity framework whichshows that the primary mentioned null hypersurface is an event horizon. theobtained energy-momentum tensor equals the energy-momentum tensor of apolytropic black hole embedded into an anti-de sitter background. we also showthat if one considers the misner-sharp mass in the calculations, theschwarzschild metric will be got. the relationship between the two massdefinitions in each metric is studied. the results of considering thegeometrical surface gravity are also addressed. our investigation shows thatthe geometrical surface gravity's definition is not always compatible with thevalidity of the first law of thermodynamics on the horizons of sphericallysymmetric static metrics.
