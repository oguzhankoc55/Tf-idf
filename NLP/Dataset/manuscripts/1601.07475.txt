spontaneous scalarization with massive fields we study the effect of a mass term in the spontaneous scalarization ofneutron stars, for a wide range of scalar field parameters and neutron starequations of state. even though massless scalars have been the focus ofinterest in spontaneous scalarization so far, recent observations of binarysystems rule out most of their interesting parameter space. we point out thatadding a mass term to the scalar field potential is a natural extension to themodel that avoids these observational bounds if the compton wavelength of thescalar is small compared to the binary separation. our model is formallysimilar to the asymmetron scenario recently introduced in application tocosmology, though here we are interested in consequences for neutron stars andthus consider a mass term that does not modify the geometry on cosmologicalscales. we review the allowed values for the mass and scalarization parametersin the theory given current binary system observations and black hole spinmeasurements. we show that within the allowed ranges, spontaneous scalarizationcan have nonperturbative, strong effects that may lead to observable signaturesin binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star mergers, or even in isolatedneutron stars.
