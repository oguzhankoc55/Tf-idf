stability of charged global ads$_4$ spacetimes we study linear and nonlinear stability of asymptotically ads$_4$ solutionsin einstein-maxwell-scalar theory. after summarizing the set of staticsolutions we first examine thermodynamical stability in the grand canonicalensemble and the phase transitions that occur among them. in the second part ofthe paper we focus on nonlinear stability in the microcanonical ensemble byevolving radial perturbations numerically. we find hints of an instabilitycorner for vanishingly small perturbations of the same kind as the ones presentin the uncharged case. collapses are avoided, instead, if the charge and massof the perturbations come to close the line of solitons. finally we examine thesoliton solutions. the linear spectrum of normal modes is not resonant andinstability turns on at extrema of the mass curve. linear stability extends tononlinear stability up to some threshold for the amplitude of the perturbation.beyond that, the soliton is destroyed and collapses to a hairy black hole. therelative width of this stability band scales down with the charge q, and doesnot survive the blow up limit to a planar geometry.
