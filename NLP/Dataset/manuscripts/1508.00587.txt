universal entanglement for higher dimensional cones the entanglement entropy of a generic $d$-dimensional conformal field theoryreceives a regulator independent contribution when the entangling regioncontains a (hyper)conical singularity of opening angle $\omega$, codified in afunction $a^{(d)}(\omega)$. in arxiv:1505.04804, we proposed that forthree-dimensional conformal field theories, the coefficient $\sigma$characterizing the smooth surface limit of such contribution($\omega\rightarrow \pi$) equals the stress tensor two-point function charge$c_{ t}$, up to a universal constant. in this paper, we prove this relation forgeneral three-dimensional holographic theories, and extend the result togeneral dimensions. in particular, we show that a generalized coefficient$\sigma^{ (d)}$ can be defined for (hyper)conical entangling regions in thealmost smooth surface limit, and that this coefficient is universally relatedto $c_{ t}$ for general holographic theories, providing a general formula forthe ratio $\sigma^{ (d)}/c_{ t}$ in arbitrary dimensions. we conjecture thatthe latter ratio is universal for general cfts. further, based on our recentresults in arxiv:1507.06997, we propose an extension of this relation togeneral r\'enyi entropies, which we show passes several consistency checks in$d=4$ and $d=6$.
