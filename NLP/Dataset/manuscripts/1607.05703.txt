extended symmetries at the black hole horizon we prove that non-extremal black holes in four-dimensional general relativityexhibit an infinite-dimensional symmetry in their near horizon region. byprescribing a physically sensible set of boundary conditions at the horizon, wederive the algebra of asymptotic killing vectors, which is shown to beinfinite-dimensional and includes, in particular, two sets of supertranslationsand two mutually commuting copies of the virasoro algebra. we define thesurface charges associated to the asymptotic diffeomorphisms that preserve theboundary conditions and discuss the subtleties of this definition, such as theintegrability conditions and the correct definition of the dirac brackets. whenevaluated on the stationary solutions, the only non-vanishing charges are thezero-modes. one of them reproduces the bekenstein-hawking entropy of kerr blackholes. we also study the extremal limit, recovering the nhek geometry. in thissingular case, where the algebra of charges and the integrability conditionsget modified, we find that the computation of the zero-modes correctlyreproduces the black hole entropy. furthermore, we analyze the case of threespacetime dimensions, in which the integrability conditions notably simplifyand the field equations can be solved analytically to produce a family of exactsolutions that realize the boundary conditions explicitly. we examine otherfeatures, such as the form of the algebra in the extremal limit and therelation to other works in the literature.
