uniqueness of the fock quantization of dirac fields in 2+1 dimensions we study the fock quantization of a free dirac field in 2+1-dimensionalbackgrounds which are conformally ultrastatic, with a time-dependent conformalfactor. as it is typical for field theories, there is an infinite ambiguity inthe fock representation of the canonical anticommutation relations. differentchoices may lead to unitarily inequivalent theories that describe differentphysics. to remove this ambiguity one usually requires that the vacuum beinvariant under the unitary transformations that implement the symmetries ofthe equations of motion. however, in non-stationary backgrounds, where timetranslation is not a symmetry transformation, the requirement of vacuuminvariance is in general not enough to fix completely the fock representation.we show that this problem is overcome in the considered scenario by demanding,in addition, a unitarily implementable quantum dynamics. the combinedimposition of these conditions selects a unique family of equivalent fockrepresentations. moreover, one also obtains an essentially unique splitting ofthe time variation of the dirac field into an explicit dependence on thebackground scale factor and a quantum evolution of the corresponding creationand annihilation operators.
