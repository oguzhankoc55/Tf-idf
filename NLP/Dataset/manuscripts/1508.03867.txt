stability of a tachyon braneworld within the braneworld paradigm the tachyonic scalar field has been used togenerate models that attempt to solve some of the open problems that physicsfaces nowadays, both in cosmology and high energy physics as well. when thesefield configurations are produced by the interplay of higher dimensional warpedgravity with some matter content, braneworld models must prove to be {\itstable} under the whole set of small fluctuations of the gravitational andmatter fields background, among other consistency tests. here we present acomplete proof of the stability under scalar perturbations of tachyonic thickbraneworlds with an embedded maximally symmetric 4d space-time, revealing itsphysical consistency. this family of models contains a recently reportedtachyonic de sitter thick braneworld which possesses a series of appealingproperties. these features encompass complete regularity, asymptotic flatness(instead of being asymptotically ds or ads) even when it contains a negativebulk cosmological constant, a relevant 3-brane with ds metric which naturallyarises from the full set of field equations of the 5d background (it is notimposed), qualitatively describing the inflationary epochs of our universe, anda graviton spectrum with a single zero mode bound state that accounts for the4d graviton localised on the brane and is separated from the continuum ofkaluza-klein massive graviton excitations by a mass gap. gauge vector fieldswith a single massless bound state in its mass spectrum are also localised onthis braneworld model a fact that allows us to recover the coulomb's law of our4d world. all these properties of the above referred tachyonic braneworldtogether with the positive stability analysis provided in this work, constitutea firm step towards the construction of realistic cosmological models withinthe braneworld paradigm.
