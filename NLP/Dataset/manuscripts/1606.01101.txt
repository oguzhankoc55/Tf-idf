canonical superenergy and angular supermomentum complexes in general  relativity and some of their applications many years ago we have introduced into general relativity, {\bf gr}, thecanonical superenergy tensors, $s_i^{~k}$, and the canonical angularsupermomentum tensors, $s^{ikl}=(-)s^{kil}$, matter and gravitation. we haveobtained these tensors by special averaging of the differences of the canonicalenergy-momentum and canonical angular momentum. the averaging was performed inriemann normal coordinates, {\bf rnc(p)}; {\bf p} is beginning of thesecoordinates. about four years ago we have observed that these tensors can alsobe obtained in other, simpler way, by using the canonical superenergy andangular super momentum complexes, $_k s_i^{~k}$, and, $_k s~^{ikl}=(-)_ks^{kil}$, respectively. such complexes can be introduced into {\bf gr} in anatural way starting from canonical energy-momentum and angular momentumcomplexes.  in this paper, at first, we define the canonical superenergy and angularsupermomentum complexes in {\bf gr} and then, we apply them to analyze of aclosed system, {\bf cs}, trautman's radiative spacetimes, {\bf trs}, andfriedman universes, {\bf fu}. finally, we compare these complexes and theresults obtained with their help with the canonical superenergy and angularsupermomentum tensors and results obtained with them in past. in appendix, forconvenience, we summarize our old approach to canonical superenergy and angularsupermomentum tensors.
