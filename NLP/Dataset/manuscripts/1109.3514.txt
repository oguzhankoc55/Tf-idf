can noncommutativity affect the whole history of the universe? we study a classical, noncommutative (nc), friedmann-robertson-walkercosmological model. the spatial sections may have positive, negative or zeroconstant curvatures. the matter content is a generic perfect fluid. the initialnoncommutativity between some canonical variables is rewritten, such that, weend up with commutative variables and a nc parameter. initially, we derive thescale factor dynamic equations for the general situation, without specifyingthe perfect fluid or the curvature of the spatial sections. next, we considertwo concrete situations: a radiation perfect fluid and dust. we study allpossible scale factor behaviors, for both cases. we compare them with thecorresponding commutative cases and one with the other. we obtain, some cases,where the nc model predicts a scale factor expansion which may describe thepresent expansion of our universe. those cases are not present in thecorresponding commutative models. finally, we compare our model with another ncmodel, where the noncommutativity is between different canonical variables. weshow that, in general, it leads to a scale factor behavior that is differentfrom our model.
