do spikes persist in a quantum treatment of spacetime singularities? the classical approach to spacetime singularities leads to a simplifieddynamics in which spatial derivatives become unimportant compared to timederivatives, and thus each spatial point essentially becomes uncoupled from itsneighbors. this uncoupled dynamics leads to sharp features (called "spikes") asfollows: particular spatial points follow an exceptional dynamical path thatdiffers from that of their neighbors, with the consequence that in theneighborhood of these exceptional points the spatial profile becomes ever moresharp. spikes are consequences of the bkl-type oscillatory evolution towardsgeneric singularities of spacetime. do spikes persist when the spacetimedynamics are treated using quantum mechanics? to address this question, wetreat a hamiltonian system that describes the dynamics of the approach to thesingularity and consider how to quantize that system. we argue that thisparticular system is best treated using an affine quantization approach (ratherthan the more familiar methods of cannonical quantization) and we set up theformalism needed for this treatment. preliminary analysis of the affine storypoints to the nonexistence of quantum spikes.
