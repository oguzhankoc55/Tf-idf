can gravitational instantons really constrain axion inflation? axions play a central role in inflationary model building and othercosmological applications. this is mainly due to their flat potential, which isprotected by a global shift symmetry. however, quantum gravity is known tobreak global symmetries, the crucial effect in the present context beinggravitational instantons or giddings-strominger wormholes. we attempt toquantify, as model-independently as possible, how large a scalar potential isinduced by this general quantum gravity effect. we pay particular attention tothe crucial issue which solutions can or cannot be trusted in the presence of amoduli-stabilisation and a kaluza-klein scale. an important conclusion is that,due to specific numerical prefactors, the effect is surprisingly small even inuv-completions with the highest possible scale offered by string theory.  as we go along, we discuss in detail euclidean wormholes, cored and extremalinstantons, and how the latter arise from 5d reissner-nordstrom black holes. weattempt to dispel possible doubts that wormholes contribute to the scalarpotential by an explicit calculation. we analyse the role of stabiliseddilaton-like moduli. finally, we argue that euclidean wormholes may be theobjects satisfying the weak gravity conjecture extended to instantons.
