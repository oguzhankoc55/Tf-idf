moving mirrors and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem we investigate the random motion of a mirror in (1 + 1)-dimensions that isimmersed in a thermal bath of massless scalar particles which are interactingwith the mirror through a boundary condition. imposing the dirichlet or theneumann boundary conditions on the moving mirror, we evaluate the meanradiation reaction force on the mirror and the correlation function describingthe fluctuations in the force about the mean value. from the correlationfunction thus obtained, we explicitly establish the fluctuation-dissipationtheorem governing the moving mirror. using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem,we compute the mean-squared displacement of the mirror at finite and zerotemperature. we clarify a few points concerning the various limiting behaviorof the mean-squared displacement of the mirror. while we recover the standardresult at finite temperature, we find that the mirror diffuses logarithmicallyat zero temperature, confirming similar conclusions that have been arrived atearlier in this context. we also comment on a subtlety concerning thecomparison between zero temperature limit of the finite temperature result andthe exact zero temperature result.
