stability of perturbed geodesics in $nd$ axisymmetric spacetimes the effect of self-gravity of a disk matter is evaluated by the simplestmodes of oscillation frequencies for perturbed circular geodesics. it isplotted the radial profiles of free oscillations of an equatorial circulargeodesic perturbed within the orbital plane or in the vertical direction. thecalculation is carried out to geodesics of an axisymmetric $n$-dimensionalspacetime. the profiles are computed by examples of disks embeded infive-dimensional or six-dimensional spacetime, where it is studied the motionof free test particles for three axisymmetric cases: (i) the newtonian limit ofa general proposed $5d$ and $6d$ axisymmetric spacetime; (ii) a simplerandall-sundrum $5d$ spacetime; (iii) general $5d$ and $6d$ randall-sundrumspacetime. the equation of motion of such particles is derived and thestability study is computed for both horizontal and vertical directions, to seehow extra dimensions could affect the system. in particular, we investigate adisk constructed from schwarzschild and chazy-curzon solutions with a simpleextension for extra dimensions in the case (i), and by solving vacuum einsteinfield equations for a kind of randall-sundrum-weyl metric in cases (ii) and(iii). we find that it is possible to compute a range of possible solutionswhere such perturbed geodesics are stable. basicaly, the stable solutionsappear, for the radial direction, in special cases when the system has $5d$ andin all cases when the system has $6d$; and, for the axial direction, in allcases when the system has both $5d$ or $6d$.
