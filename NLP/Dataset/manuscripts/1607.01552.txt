spectrum of area in the faddeev formulation of gravity faddeev formulation of general relativity (gr) is considered where the metricis composed of ten vector fields or a ten-dimensional tetrad. upon partial useof the field equations, this theory results in the usual gr. earlier we haveproposed first-order representation of the minisuperspace model for the faddeevformulation where the tetrad fields are piecewise constant on the polytopeslike 4-simplices or, say, cuboids into which ${\rm i {-3pt} r}^4$ can bedecomposed, an analogue of the cartan-weyl connection-type form of thehilbert-einstein action in the usual continuum gr. in the hamiltonianformalism, the tetrad bilinears are canonically conjugate to the orthogonalconnection matrices. we evaluate the spectrum of the elementary areas,functions of the tetrad bilinears. the spectrum is discrete and proportional tothe faddeev analog $\gamma_{\rm f}$ of the barbero-immirzi parameter $\gamma$.the possibility of the tetrad and metric discontinuities in the faddeev gravityallows to consider any surface as consisting of a set of virtually independentelementary areas and its spectrum being the sum of the elementary spectra.requiring consistency of the black hole entropy calculations known in theliterature we are able to estimate $\gamma_{\rm f}$.
