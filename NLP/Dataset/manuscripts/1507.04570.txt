on static solutions of the einstein - scalar field equations in this article we study self-gravitating static solutions of theeinstein-scalarfield system in arbitrary dimensions. we discuss the existenceand the non-existence of geodesically complete solutions depending on the formof the scalar field potential $v(\phi)$, and provide full global geometricestimates when the solutions exist. our main results are summarised as follows.for the klein-gordon field, namely when $v(\phi)=m^{2}|\phi|^{2}$, it is provedthat geodesically complete solutions have ricci-flat spatial metric, haveconstant lapse and are vacuum, (that is $\phi$ is constant and equal to zero if$m\neq 0$). in particular, when the spatial dimension is three, the only suchsolutions are either minkowski or a quotient thereof (no nontrivial solutionsexist). when $v(\phi)=m^{2}|\phi|^{2}+2\lambda$, that is, when a vacuum energyor a cosmological constant is included, it is proved that no geodesicallycomplete solution exists when $\lambda&gt;0$, whereas when $\lambda&lt;0$ it isproved that no non-vacuum geodesically complete solution exists unless$m^{2}&lt;-2\lambda/(n-1)$, ($n$ is the spatial dimension) and the spatialmanifold is non-compact. the proofs are based on techniques in comparisongeometry \'a la backry-emery.
