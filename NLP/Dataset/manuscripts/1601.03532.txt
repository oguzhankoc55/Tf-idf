cartesian kerr-schild variation on the newman-janis ansatz the newman-janis ansatz is a procedure (an "ansatz" or "trick") for obtainingthe kerr spacetime from the schwarzschild spacetime. this 50 year old "trick"continues to generate heated discussion and debate even to this day. most ofthe debate focusses on whether the newman-janis procedure can be upgraded tothe status of an "algorithm", or if it is perhaps merely an inspired "ansatz",or possibly just a random "trick" of no deep physical significance. (that thenewman-janis procedure very quickly led to the discovery of the kerr-newmanspacetime is a point very much in its favour.) in the current article we willnot answer these deeper questions, we shall instead present a much simpleralternative variation on the theme of the newman-janis ansatz that might beeasier to work with. we shall present a 2-step version of the newman-janistrick that works directly with the kerr-schild "cartesian" metric presentationof the kerr spacetime. that is, we show how the original 4-step newman--janisprocedure can, (using the interplay between oblate spheroidal and cartesiancoordinates), be reduced to a considerably cleaner 2-step process.
