spacetime foam induced collective bundling of intense fields the influence of spacetime foam on a broad class of bosonic fields witharbitrary numbers of particles in the low energy regime is investigated. basedon recently formulated general description of open quantum gravitationalsystems, we analyse the propagation of scalar, electromagnetic, andgravitational waves on both long and short time scales with respect to theirmean frequencies. for the long time propagation, the markov approximation isemployed that neglects the effects of initial conditions of these waves. inthis case, despite intuitively expected decoherence and dissipation from thenoisy spacetime, we show that such phenomena turn out to be completelysuppressed for scalar bosons, photons, and gravitons, which are coupled togravity but otherwise free. the short time effects are then recovered throughthe transient non-markovian evolution. focusing on scalar bosons in initiallyincoherent states, we find that the resulting quantum dissipation dependstrongly on the distribution of the particle momentum states. we furtheridentify a hitherto undiscovered collective anti-dissipation mechanism for alarge number of particles. the surprising new effect tends to "bundle"identical particles within a sharply distributed momentum states having a widthinversely proportional to the particle number due to the thermal fluctuations,or its square root due to the vacuum fluctuations of spacetime.
