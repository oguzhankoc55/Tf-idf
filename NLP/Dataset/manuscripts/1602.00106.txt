a note on entanglement entropy, coherent states and gravity the entanglement entropy of a free quantum field in a coherent state isindependent of its stress energy content. we use this result to highlight thefact that while the einstein equations for first order variations about alocally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields seem tofollow from jacobson's principle of maximal vacuum entanglement entropy, theirpossible derivation from this principle for the physically relevant case offinite but small variations remains an open issue. we also apply this result tothe context of bianchi's identification, independent of unknown planck scalephysics, of the first order variation of bekenstein hawking area with that ofvacuum entanglement entropy. we argue that under certain technical assumptionsthis identification seems not to be extendible to the context of finite butsmall variations to coherent states. our particular method of estimation ofentanglement entropy variation reveals the existence of certain contributionsover and above those appearing in jacobson's and bianchi's works. we discussthe sense in which these contributions may be subleading to those alreadypresent in these works.
