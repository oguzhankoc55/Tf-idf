geometric phases and cyclic isotropic cosmologies in the present paper we study the evolution of the modes of a scalar field ina cyclic cosmology. in order to keep the discussion clear, we study thefeatures of a scalar field in a toy model, a friedman-robertson-walker universewith a periodic scale factor, in which the universe expands, contracts andbounces infinite times, in the approximation in which the dynamic features ofthis universe are driven by some external factor, without the backreaction ofthe scalar field under study. in particular, we show that particle productionexhibits features of the cyclic cosmology. also, by studying the berry phase ofthe scalar field, we show that contrarily to what is commonly believed, thescalar field carries information from one bounce to another in the form of aglobal phase which occurs to be generically non-zero. {the berry phase is thenevaluated numerically in the case of the effective loop quantum cosmologyclosed universe. we observe that berry's phase is nonzero, but that in thequantum regime the particle content is non-negligible.
