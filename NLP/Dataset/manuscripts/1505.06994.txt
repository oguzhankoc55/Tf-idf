the compton-schwarzschild correspondence from extended de broglie  relations the compton wavelength gives the minimum radius within which the mass of aparticle may be localized due to quantum effects, while the schwarzschildradius gives the maximum radius within which the mass of a black hole may belocalized due to classial gravity. in a mass-radius diagram, the two linesintersect near the planck point $(l_p,m_p)$, where quantum gravity effectsbecome significant. since canonical (non-gravitational) quantum mechanics isbased on the concept of wave-particle duality, encapsulated in the de broglierelations, these relations should break down near $(l_p,m_p)$. it is unclearwhat physical interpretation can be given to quantum particles with energy $e\gg m_pc^2 $, since they correspond to wavelengths $\lambda \ll l_p$ or timeperiods $t \ll t_p$ in the standard theory. we therefore propose a correctionto the standard de broglie relations, which gives rise to a modified schr{\"o}dinger equation and a modified expression for the compton wavelength, whichmay be extended into the region $e \gg m_pc^2$. for the proposed modification,we recover the expression for the schwarzschild radius for $e \gg m_pc^2$ andthe usual compton formula for $e \ll m_pc^2$. the sign of the inequalityobtained from the uncertainty principle reverses at $m \approx m_p$, so thatthe compton wavelength and event horizon size may be interpreted as minimum andmaximum radii, respectively. we interpret the additional terms in the modifiedde broglie relations as representing the self-gravitation of the wave packet.
