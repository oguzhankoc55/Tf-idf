collision of two general particles around a rotating regular hayward's  black holes the rotating regular hayward's spacetime, apart from mass ($m$) and angularmomentum ($a$), has an additional deviation parameter ($g$) due to the magneticcharge, which generalizes the kerr black hole when $g\neq0$, and for $g=0$, itgoes over to the kerr black hole. we analyze how the ergoregion is affected bythe parameter $g$ to show that the area of ergoregion increases with increasingvalues of $g$. further, for each $g$, there exist critical $a_e$, whichcorresponds to a regular extremal black hole with degenerate horizons$r=r^e_h$, and $a_e$ decrease whereas $r^e_h$ increases with an increase in theparameter $g$. ban{\~a}dos, silk and west (bsw) demonstrated that the extremalkerr black hole can act as a particle accelerator with arbitrarily highcenter-of-mass energy ($e_{cm}$) when the collision of two particles takesplace near the horizon. we study the bsw process for two particles withdifferent rest masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, moving in the equatorial plane ofextremal hayward's black hole for different values of $g$, to show that$e_{cm}$ of two colliding particles is arbitrarily high when one of theparticles takes a critical value of angular momentum. for a nonextremal case,there always exist a finite upper bound for the $e_{cm}$, which increases withthe deviation parameter $g$. our results, in the limit $g \rightarrow 0$,reduces to that of the kerr black hole.
