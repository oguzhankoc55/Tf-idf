degravitation, orbital dynamics and the effective barycentre in this article we present a particular theory of gravity in which einstein'sfield equations are modified by promoting newton's constant $g$ to a covariantdifferential operator $g_\lambda(\box_g)$. the general idea was obviouslyoutlined for the first time in [13-16] and originates from the quest of findinga mechanism that is able to degravitate the vacuum energy on cosmologicalscales. we suggest in this manuscript a precise covariant coupling model whichacts like a high-pass filter with a macroscopic distance filter scale$\sqrt{\lambda}$. in the context of this specific theory of gravity we reviewsome cosmological aspects before we briefly recall the effective relaxedeinstein equations outlined for the first time in [1]. we present a generalprocedure to determine the gravitational potentials for a far away wave zonefield point. moreover we work out the modified orbital dynamics of abinary-system as well as the effective 1.5 post-newtonian barycentre for ageneric $n$-body system. we notice that it is always possible to recover thecorresponding general relativistic results in the limit of vanishing nonlocalmodification parameters.
