manifestly scale-invariant regularization and quantum effective  operators scale invariant theories are often used to address the hierarchy problem,however the regularization of their quantum corrections introduces adimensionful coupling (dimensional regularization) or scale (pauli-villars,etc) which break this symmetry explicitly. we show how to avoid this problemand study the implications of a manifestly scale invariant regularization in(classical) scale invariant theories. we use a dilaton-dependent subtractionfunction $\mu(\sigma)$ which after spontaneous breaking of scale symmetrygenerates the usual dr subtraction scale $\mu(\langle\sigma\rangle)$. oneconsequence is that "evanescent" interactions generated by scale invariance ofthe action in $d=4-2\epsilon$ (but vanishing in $d=4$), give rise to new,finite quantum corrections. we find a (finite) correction $\deltau(\phi,\sigma)$ to the one-loop scalar potential for $\phi$ and $\sigma$,beyond the coleman-weinberg term. $\delta u$ is due to an evanescent correction($\propto\epsilon$) to the field-dependent masses (of the states in the loop)which multiplies the pole ($\propto 1/\epsilon$) of the momentum integral, togive a finite quantum result. $\delta u$ contains a non-polynomial operator$\sim \phi^6/\sigma^2$ of known coefficient and is independent of thesubtraction dimensionless parameter. a more general $\mu(\phi,\sigma)$ is ruledout since, in their classical decoupling limit, the visible sector (of thehiggs $\phi$) and hidden sector (dilaton $\sigma$) still interact at thequantum level, thus the subtraction function must depend on the dilaton only.the method is useful in models where preserving scale symmetry at quantum levelis important.
