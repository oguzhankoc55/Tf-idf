quantum gravity without vacuum dispersion many approaches to quantum gravity predict an energy dependent speed oflight. we present further numerical evidence for a scale dependent speed oflight in the causal dynamical triangulation (cdt) approach to quantum gravity.by considering the propagation of light constrained by the discretisation ofarea we obtain the same functional form of vacuum dispersion found in cdt. weshow that dimensional reduction and the discretisation of area both imply aspecific scale dependent geodesic interval, and discuss why we might naturallyexpect such a scaling. as a non-trivial test of the proposed geodesic intervalwe make a comparison with the known leading quantum correction to thegravitational potential, and predict the next-to-leading order correction.however, contrary to the widespread prediction of vacuum dispersion in quantumgravity, numerous experiments have now definitively ruled out linear vacuumdispersion beyond planckian energy scales ep , and have even constrainedquadratic dispersion at the level 1/10^8ep . motivated by these experimentalconstraints we seek to reconcile quantum gravity with the absence of vacuumdispersion. given a scale dependent geodesic interval, we argue that a scaledependent time interval is crucial to maintaining an invariant speed of light.we show how a scale dependent time interval eliminates the vacuum dispersionassociated with dimensional reduction and the discretisation of area, anddiscuss why we might naturally expect a scale dependent time interval.
