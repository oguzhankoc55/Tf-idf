gravitational multi-soliton solutions on flat space it is well known that, for even n, the n-soliton solution on the minkowskiseed, constructed using the inverse-scattering method (ism) of belinski andzakharov (bz), is the multi-kerr-nut solution. we show that, for odd n, thenatural seed to use is the euclidean space with two manifest translationalsymmetries, and the n-soliton solution is the accelerating multi-kerr-nutsolution. we thus define the n-soliton solution on flat space for any positiveinteger n. it admits both lorentzian and euclidean sections. in the lattersection, we find that a number, say m, of solitons can be eliminated in anon-trivial way by appropriately fixing their corresponding so-called bzparameters. the resulting solutions, which may split into separate classes, arecollectively denoted as [n-m]-soliton solutions on flat space. we then carryout a systematic study of the n- and [n-m]-soliton solutions on flat space.this includes, in particular, an explicit presentation of their ismconstruction, an analysis of their local geometries, and a classification ofall separate classes of solutions they form. we also show how even-solitonsolutions on the seeds of the collinearly centred gibbons-hawking and taub-nutarise from these solutions.
