fast and accurate inference on gravitational waves from precessing  compact binaries inferring astrophysical information from gravitational waves emitted bycompact binaries is one of the key science goals of gravitational-waveastronomy. in order to reach the full scientific potential ofgravitational-wave experiments we require techniques to mitigate the cost ofbayesian inference, especially as gravitational-wave signal models and analysesbecome increasingly sophisticated and detailed. reduced order models (roms) ofgravitational waveforms can significantly reduce the computational cost ofinference by removing redundant computations. in this paper we construct thefirst reduced order models of gravitational-wave signals that include theeffects of spin-precession, inspiral, merger, and ringdown in compact objectbinaries, and which are valid for component masses describing binary neutronstar, binary black hole and mixed binary systems. this work utilizes thewaveform model known as "imrphenompv2". our rom enables the use of a fastreduced order quadrature (roq) integration rule which allows us to approximatebayesian probability density functions at a greatly reduced computational cost.we find that the roq rule can be used to speed up inference by factors as highas 300 without introducing systematic bias. this corresponds to a reduction incomputational time from around half a year to a half a day, for the longestduration/lowest mass signals. the rom and roq rule are available with the maininference library of the ligo scientific collaboration, lalinference.
