complete normal ordering 1: foundations we introduce a new prescription for quantising scalar field theoriesperturbatively around a true minimum of the full quantum effective action,which is to `complete normal order' the bare action of interest. when the truevacuum of the theory is located at zero field value, the key property of thisprescription is the automatic cancellation, to any finite order in perturbationtheory, of all tadpole and, more generally, all `cephalopod' feynman diagrams.the latter are connected diagrams that can be disconnected into two pieces bycutting one internal vertex, with either one or both pieces free from externallines. in addition, this procedure of `complete normal ordering' (which is anextension of the standard field theory definition of normal ordering) reducesby a substantial factor the number of feynman diagrams to be calculated at anygiven loop order. we illustrate explicitly the complete normal orderingprocedure and the cancellation of cephalopod diagrams in scalar field theorieswith non-derivative interactions, and by using a point splitting `trick' weextend this result to theories with derivative interactions, such as thoseappearing as non-linear sigma-models in the world-sheet formulation of stringtheory. we focus here on theories with trivial vacua, generalising thediscussion to non-trivial vacua in a follow-up paper.
