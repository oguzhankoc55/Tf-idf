swiveled r\'enyi entropies this paper introduces "swiveled renyi entropies" as an alternative to therenyi entropic quantities put forward in [berta et al., phys. rev. a 91, 022333(2015)]. what distinguishes the swiveled renyi entropies from the priorproposal of berta et al. is that there is an extra degree of freedom: anoptimization over unitary rotations with respect to particular fixed bases(swivels). a consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveledrenyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the renyi familyof entropies. the swiveled renyi entropies are however generally discontinuousat $\alpha=1$ and do not converge to the von neumann entropy-based measures inthe limit as $\alpha\rightarrow1$, instead bounding them from above and below.particular variants reduce to known renyi entropies, such as the renyi relativeentropy or the sandwiched renyi relative entropy, but also lead to orderedrenyi conditional mutual informations and ordered renyi generalizations of arelative entropy difference. refinements of entropy inequalities such asmonotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as aconsequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled renyi entropies.due to the lack of convergence at $\alpha=1$, it is unclear whether theswiveled renyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, sothat the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal.
