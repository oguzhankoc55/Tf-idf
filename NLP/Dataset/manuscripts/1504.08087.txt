the schr\"odinger-langevin equation with and without thermal  fluctuations the schr\"odinger-langevin (sl) equation is considered as an effective openquantum system formalism suitable for phenomenological applications involving aquantum subsystem interacting with a thermal bath. we focus on two open issuesrelative to its solutions: the stationarity of the excited states of thenon-interacting subsystem when one considers the dissipation only and thethermal relaxation toward asymptotic distributions with the additionalstochastic term. we first show that a proper application of the madelung/polartransformation of the wave function leads to a non zero damping of the excitedstates of the quantum subsystem. we then study analytically and numerically thesl equation ability to bring a quantum subsystem to the thermal equilibrium ofstatistical mechanics. to do so, concepts about statistical mixed states andquantum noises are discussed and a detailed analysis is carried with two kindsof noise and potential. we show that within our assumptions the use of the slequation as an effective open quantum system formalism is possible and discusssome of its limitations.
