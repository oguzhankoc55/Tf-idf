a short essay on quantum black holes and underlying noncommutative  quantized space-time in our preceding paper: where does black-hole entropy lie? - some remarks onarea-entropy law, holographic principle and noncommutative space-time (2014)(see introduction), we emphasized the importance of underlying noncommutativegeometry or lorenz-covariant quantized space-time towards ultimate theory ofquantum gravity and planck scale physics. we focused there our attention on thestatistical and substantial understanding of bekenstein-hawking's area-entropylaw of black holes in terms of kinematical holographic relation (khr). khrmanifestly holds in yang's quantized space-time as the result of kinematicalreduction of spatial degrees of freedom caused by its own nature ofnoncommutative geometry and plays an important role in our approach without anyrecourse to the familiar hypothesis, so-called holographic principle. in thepresent paper, we find out a {\it unified} form of khr applicable to the wholeregion ranging from macroscopic to microscopic scales in spatial dimension $d=3.$ we notice a possibility of nontrivial modification of area-entropy law ofblack holes which becomes most remarkable in the extremely microscopic systemclose to planck scale. we finally refer to the historical background ofnoncommutative geometry or quantized space-time.
