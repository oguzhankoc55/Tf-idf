can chaos be observed in quantum gravity? full general relativity is almost certainly non-integrable and likely chaoticand therefore almost certainly possesses neither differentiable diracobservables nor a reduced phase space. it follows that the standard notion ofobservable has to be extended to include non-differentiable or evendiscontinuous generalized observables. these cannot carry poisson-algebraicstructures and do not admit a standard quantization; one thus faces a quantumrepresentation problem of gravitational observables. this has deep consequencesfor a quantum theory of gravity, which we investigate in a simple model for asystem with hamiltonian constraint that fails to be completely integrable. weshow that basing the quantization on standard topology precludes asemiclassical limit and can even prohibit any solutions to the quantumconstraints. our proposed solution to this problem is to refine topology suchthat a complete set of dirac observables becomes continuous. in the toy model,it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type topology, as e.g. used in loopgravity, is sufficient. basing quantization of the toy model on this finertopology, we find a complete set of quantum dirac observables and a suitablesemiclassical limit. this strategy is applicable to realistic candidatetheories of quantum gravity and thereby suggests a solution to a long-standingproblem which implies ramifications for the very concept of quantization. ourwork reveals a qualitatively novel facet of chaos in physics and opens up a newavenue of research on chaos in gravity which hints at deep insights into thestructure of quantum gravity.
