asymptotic behaviour of electro-$\lambda$ spacetimes we derive the asymptotic solutions for vacuum spacetimes with non-zerocosmological constant $\lambda$ coupled to maxwell fields, using thenewman-penrose formalism. this extends a recent work that dealt with the vacuumeinstein (newman-penrose) equations with $\lambda=0$. using these asymptoticsolutions, we discuss the mass-loss of an isolated electro-gravitating systemwith cosmological constant. in a universe with $\lambda&gt;0$, the physics ofelectromagnetic (em) radiation is relatively straightforward compared to thoseof gravitational radiation: 1) it is clear that outgoing em radiation resultsin a decrease to the bondi mass of the isolated system. 2) it is alsoperspicuous that if any incoming em radiation from elsewhere is present, thosebeyond the isolated system's cosmological horizon would eventually arrive atthe spacelike $\mathcal{i}$ and increase the bondi mass of the isolated system.hence, the (outgoing and incoming) em radiation fields do not couple with thebondi mass-loss formula in any unexpected manner, unlike the gravitationalcounterpart. these asymptotic solutions to the einstein-maxwell-de sitterequations presented here may be used to extend previous work based onnewman-unti's asymptotic solutions to the einstein-maxwell equations, toincorporate the cosmological constant.
