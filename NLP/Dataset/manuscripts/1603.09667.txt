friedmann inflation in horava-lifshitz gravity with a scalar field we study friedmann inflation in general horava-lifshitz (hl) gravity withdetailed and non-detailed but also without the projectability conditions.accordingly, we derive the modifications in the friedmann equations due tosingle scalar field potentials describing power-law andminimal-supersymmetrically extended inflation. by implementing four types ofthe equations-of-state charactering the cosmic background geometry, thedependence of the tensorial and spectral density fluctuations and their ratioon the inflation field is determined. the latter characterizes the timeevolution of the inflation field relative to the hubble parameter. furthermore,the ratio of tensorial-to-spectral density fluctuations is calculated independence on the spectral index. the resulting slow-roll parameters apparentlydiffer from the ones deduced from the standard general relativity (friedmanngravity). we also observe that the tensorial-to-spectral density fluctuationscontinuously decrease when moving from non-detailed hl gravity, to friedmanngravity, to hl gravity without the projectibility, and to detailed hl gravity.this regular patter is valid for three types of cosmic equations-of-state anddifferent inflation potential models. the results fit well with the recentplanck observations.
