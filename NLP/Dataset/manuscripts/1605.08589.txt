spectral analysis of the dirac operator on a 3-sphere we study the (massless) dirac operator on a 3-sphere equipped with riemannianmetric. for the standard metric the spectrum is known. in particular, theeigenvalues closest to zero are the two double eigenvalues +3/2 and -3/2. ouraim is to analyse the behaviour of eigenvalues when the metric is perturbed inan arbitrary smooth fashion from the standard one. we derive explicitasymptotic formulae for the two eigenvalues closest to zero. note that theseeigenvalues remain double eigenvalues under perturbations of the metric: theycannot split because of a particular symmetry of the dirac operator indimension three (it commutes with the antilinear operator of chargeconjugation). our asymptotic formulae show that in the first approximation ourtwo eigenvalues maintain symmetry about zero and are completely determined bythe increment of riemannian volume. spectral asymmetry is observed only in thesecond approximation of the perturbation process. as an example we consider aspecial family of metrics, the so-called generalized berger spheres, for whichthe eigenvalues can be evaluated explicitly.
