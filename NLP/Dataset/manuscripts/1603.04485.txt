a practical approach to the hamilton-jacobi formulation of holographic  renormalization we revisit the subject of holographic renormalization for asymptotically adsspacetimes. for many applications of holography, one has to handle thedivergences associated with the on-shell gravitational action. the brute forceapproach uses the fefferman-graham (fg) expansion near the ads boundary toidentify the divergences, but subsequent reversal of the expansion is needed toconstruct the infinite counterterms. while in principle straightforward, themethod is cumbersome and application/reversal of fg is formally unsatisfactory.various authors have proposed an alternative method based on thehamilton-jacobi equation. however, this approach may appear to be abstract,difficult to implement, and in some cases limited in applicability. in thispaper, we clarify the hamilton-jacobi formulation of holographicrenormalization and present a simple algorithm for its implementation toextract cleanly the infinite counterterms. while the derivation of the methodrelies on the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, the actualapplication of our algorithm does not. the work applies to any $d$-dimensionalholographic dual with asymptotic ads boundary, euclidean or lorentzian, andarbitrary slicing. we illustrate the method in several examples, including thefgpw model, a holographic model of 3d abjm theory, and cases with marginalscalars such as a dilaton-axion system.
