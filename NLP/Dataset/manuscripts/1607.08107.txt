$\infty-\infty$: vacuum energy and virtual black-holes we discuss other contributions to the vacuum energy of quantum field theoriesand quantum gravity, which have not been considered in literature. as is wellknown, the presence of virtual particles in vacuum provides the so famous andpuzzling contributions to the vacuum energy. as is well known, these mainlycome from loop integrations over the four-momenta space. however, we argue thatthese also imply the presence of a mass density of virtual particles in everyvolume cell of space-time. the most important contribution comes from quantumgravity $s^{2}\times s^{2}$ bubbles, corresponding to virtual black hole pairs.the presence of virtual masses could lead to another paradox: the space-timeitself would have an intrinsic virtual mass density contribution leading to adisastrous contraction - as is known, no negative masses exist in generalrelativity. we dub this effect {\it the cosmological problem of second type}:if not other counter-terms existed, the vacuum energy would be inevitablydestabilized by virtual-mass contributions. it would be conceivable that thecosmological problem of second type could solve the first one. virtual massesrenormalize the vacuum energy to an unpredicted parameter, as in therenormalization procedure of the standard model charges. in the limit of$m_{pl}\rightarrow \infty$ (pauli-villars limit), virtual black holes have amass density providing an infinite counter-term to the vacuum energy divergentcontribution $m_{pl} \rightarrow \infty$ (assuming $m_{uv}=m_{pl}$). therefore,in the same schwinger-feynman-tomonaga attitude, the problem of a divergentvacuum energy could be analogous to the {\it put-by-hand} procedure used forstandard model parameters.
