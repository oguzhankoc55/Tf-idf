a simple proof of the uniqueness of the einstein field equation in all  dimensions the standard argument for the uniqueness of the einstein field equation isbased on lovelock's theorem, the relevant statement of which is restricted tofour dimensions. i prove a theorem similar to lovelock's, with a physicallymodified assumption: that the geometric object representing curvature in theeinstein field equation ought to have the physical dimension of stress-energy.the theorem is stronger than lovelock's in two ways: it holds in alldimensions, and so supports a generalized argument for uniqueness; it does notassume that the desired tensor depends on the metric only up second-orderpartial-derivatives, that condition being a consequence of the proof. this hasconsequences for understanding the nature of the cosmological constant andtheories of higher-dimensional gravity. another consequence of the theorem isthat it makes precise the sense in which there can be no gravitationalstress-energy tensor in general relativity. along the way, i prove a result ofsome interest about the second jet-bundle of the bundle of metrics over amanifold.
