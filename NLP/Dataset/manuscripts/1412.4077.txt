properties of an affine transport equation and its holonomy an affine transport equation was used recently to study properties of angularmomentum and gravitational-wave memory effects in general relativity. in thispaper, we investigate local properties of this transport equation in greaterdetail. associated with this transport equation is a map between the tangentspaces at two points on a curve. this map consists of a homogeneous (linear)part given by the parallel transport map along the curve plus an inhomogeneouspart, which is related to the development of a curve in a manifold into anaffine tangent space. for closed curves, the affine transport equation definesa "generalized holonomy" that takes the form of an affine map on the tangentspace. we explore the local properties of this generalized holonomy by usingcovariant bitensor methods to compute the generalized holonomy around geodesicpolygon loops. we focus on triangles and "parallelogramoids" with sides formedfrom geodesic segments. for small loops, we recover the well-known result forthe leading-order linear holonomy ($\sim$ riemann $\times$ area), and we derivethe leading-order inhomogeneous part of the generalized holonomy ($\sim$riemann $\times$ area$^{3/2}$). our bitensor methods let us naturally computehigher-order corrections to these leading results. these corrections reveal theform of the finite-size effects that enter into the holonomy for larger loops;they could also provide quantitative errors on the leading-order results forfinite loops.
