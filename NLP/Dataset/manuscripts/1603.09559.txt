quantum weak equivalence principle from quantum estimation theory we address the problem of estimating the mass of a quantum particleinteracting with a classical gravitational field. two main scenarios areconsidered. first, the case of a freely-falling probe in a uniform field isanalyzed. then a confining potential is introduced in addition to gravity. inboth cases the ultimate bounds to precision allowed by quantum mechanics areworked out in the framework of local quantum estimation theory. we find that aslong as the particle is in free-fall, sensitivity to mass estimation throughposition measurements is suppressed. we interpret this fact as evidence of aweak equivalence principle (wep) being at work also in the quantum domain. inparticular, we prove that the information on the probe's mass that can beextracted through position measurements is unchanged by turning on a uniformgravitational field. this result inspires us to give a more general formulationof the wep, valid also for quantum probes, which rests on principles taken frominformation theory. on the other hand, by adding a confining potential term tothe hamiltonian, one can make sensitive measurements aimed at extracting thevalue of the particle's mass. in particular we show that by employing properlyquantum states, i.e. states with no classical limit, one may achieve notablygreater precisions.
