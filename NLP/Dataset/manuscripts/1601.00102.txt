covariant renormalizable gravity model as a mimetic horndeski model:  cosmological solutions and perturbations we consider the nojiri-odintsov covariant horava-like gravitational model,where diffeomorphism invariance is broken dynamically via a non-standardcoupling to a perfect fluid. the theory allows to address some of the potentialinstability problems present in horava-lifshitz gravity due to explicitdiffeomorphism invariance breaking. the fluid is instead constructed from ascalar field constrained by a lagrange multiplier. this construction allows toidentify the scalar field with the mimetic field of the recently proposedmimetic gravity. subsequently, we thoroughly explore the consequences of thisidentification. by adding a potential for the scalar field, we show how one canreproduce a number of interesting cosmological scenarios. we then turn to thestudy of perturbations around a flat flrw background, showing that the fluid inquestion behaves as an irrotational fluid, with zero sound speed. to addressthis problem, we consider a modified version of the theory, adding higherderivative terms in a way which brings us beyond the horndeski model. wecompute the sound speed in this modified higher order mimetic model and showthat it is non-zero, which means that perturbations therein can be sensiblydefined. in conclusion, we construct a renormalizable theory of gravity whichpreserves diffeomorphism invariance at the level of the action but breaks itdynamically in the uv, reduces to general relativity in the ir, allows therealization of a number of interesting cosmological scenarios and is welldefined when considering perturbations around a flat flrw background.
