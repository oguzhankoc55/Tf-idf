shapes of rotating nonsingular black hole shadows it is believed that curvature singularities are a creation of generalrelativity and hence, in the absence of a quantum gravity, models ofnonsingular black holes have received significant attention. we study theshadow (apparent shape), an optical appearance because of its stronggravitational field, cast by a nonsingular black hole which is characterized bythree parameters, i.e., mass ($m$), spin ($a$), and a deviation parameter($k$). the nonsingular black hole under consideration, is a generalization ofthe kerr black hole {that} can be recognized asymptotically ($r&gt;&gt;k, k&gt;0$)explicitly as the kerr-newman black hole, and in the limit $k \rightarrow 0$ asthe kerr black hole. it turns out that the shadow of a nonsingular black holeis a dark zone covered by {a} deformed circle. interestingly, it is seen thatthe shadow of a black hole is affected due to the parameter $k$. indeed, for agiven $a$, the size of a shadow reduces as the parameter $k$ increases and theshadow becomes more distorted as we increase the value of the parameter $k$when compared with the analogous kerr black hole shadow. we also investigate,in detail, how the ergoregion of a black hole is changed due to the deviationparameter $k$.
