vacuum energy density and pressure near a soft wall perfectly conducting boundaries, and their dirichlet counterparts for quantumscalar fields, predict nonintegrable energy densities. a more realistic modelwith a finite ultraviolet cutoff yields two inconsistent values for the forceon a curved or edged boundary (the "pressure anomaly"). a still more realistic,but still easily calculable, model replaces the hard wall by a power-lawpotential; because it involves no a posteriori modification of the formulascalculated from the theory, this model should be anomaly-free. here we firstset up the formalism and notation for the quantization of a scalar field in thebackground of a planar soft wall, and we approximate the reduced green functionin perturbative and wkb limits (the latter being appropriate when either themode frequency or the depth into the wall is sufficiently large). then wedisplay numerical calculations of energy density and pressure for the regionoutside the wall, which show that the pressure anomaly does not occur there.calculations inside the wall are postponed to later papers, which must tackleregularization and renormalization of divergences induced by the potential inthe bulk region.
