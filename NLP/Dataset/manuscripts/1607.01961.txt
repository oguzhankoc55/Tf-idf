mass decomposition of slacs lens galaxies in weyl conformal gravity we study here, using the mannheim-kazanas solution of weyl conformal theory,the mass decomposition in the representative subsample of $57$ early-typeelliptical lens galaxies of the slacs on board the hst. we begin by showingthat the solution need not be an exclusive solution of conformal gravity butcan also be viewed as a solution of a class of $f(r)$ gravity theories coupledto non-linear electrodynamics thereby rendering the ensuing results moreuniversal. since lensing involves light bending, we shall first show that thesolution adds to schwarzschild light bending caused by the luminous mass($m_{\ast }$) a positive contribution $+\gamma r$ contrary to the previousresults in the literature, thereby resolving a long standing problem. the causeof the error is critically examined. applying the expressions for light bendingtogether with an input equating einstein and weyl angles, we develop a novelalgorithm for separating the luminous component from the total lens mass(luminous+dark) within the einstein radius. our results indicate that theluminous mass estimates differ from the observed total lens masses by a linearproportionality factor. in quantitative detail, we observe that the ratios ofluminous over total lens mass ($f^{\ast }$) within the einstein radius ofindividual galaxies take on values near unity, many of which remarkably fallinside or just marginally outside the specified error bars obtained from asimulation based on the bruzual-charlot stellar population synthesis modeltogether with the salpeter imf favored on the ground of metallicity[grillo,2009]. we shall also calculate the average dark matter density ofindividual galaxies within their respective einstein spheres. the presentapproach, being truly analytic, seems to be the first of its kind attempting toprovide a new decomposition scheme distinct from the simulational ones.
