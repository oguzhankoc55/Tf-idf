dilatonic brans-dicke anisotropic collapsing fluid sphere and de broglie  quantum wave motion two dimensional (2d) analogue of vacuum sector of the brans dicke (bd)gravity [1] is studied to obtain dynamics of anisotropic spherically symmetricperfect fluid. our obtained static solutions behave as dark matter with stateequation $\gamma=\frac{p(\rho)}{\varrho}=-0.25$ but in non-static regimesbehave as regular perfect fluid with barotropic index $\gamma&gt;0.$ positivityproperty of total mass of the fluid causes that the bd parameter to be$\omega&gt;\frac{2}{3}$ and/or $\omega&lt;-1$.  locations of the event and apparent horizons of the collapsing fluid areobtained in its static regime. in case $\omega&gt;0$ the apparent horizon iscovered by event horizon where the cosmic censorship hypothesis is still valid.according to the model [1], we obtain de broglie pilot wave of our metricsolution which describes particles ensemble which become distinguishable viadifferent values of $\omega.$ incident current density of particles ensemble onthe horizons is evaluated which describe the `hawking radiation`. the de brogle-bohm quantum potential effect is calculated also on the event (apparent)horizon which is independent (dependent) to values of $\omega.$
