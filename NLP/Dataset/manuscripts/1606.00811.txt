quantum and classical aspects of scalar and vector fields around black  holes this thesis presents recent studies on test scalar and vector fields aroundblack holes. it is separated in two parts according to the asymptoticproperties of the spacetime under study. in the first part, we investigatescalar and proca fields on an asymptotically flat background. for the procafield, we obtain a complete set of equations of motion in higher dimensionalspherically symmetric backgrounds. these equations are solved numerically, bothto compute hawking radiation spectra and quasi-bound states. in the formercase, we carry out a precise study of the longitudinal degrees of freedominduced by the field mass. this can be used to improve the model in the blackhole event generators currently used at the large hadron collider. regardingquasi-bound states, we find arbitrarily long lived modes for a charged procafield, as well as for a charged scalar field, in a reissner-nordstr\"om blackhole. the second part of this thesis presents research on superradiantinstabilities of scalar and maxwell fields on an asymptotically anti-de sitterbackground. for the scalar case, we introduce a charge coupling between thefield and the background, and show that superradiant instabilities do exist forall $\ell$ modes, in higher dimensions. for the maxwell case, we first proposea general prescription to impose boundary conditions on the kerr-anti-de sitterspacetime, and obtain two robin boundary conditions. then these two conditionsare implemented to study superradiant unstable modes and vector clouds. inparticular, we find that the new branch of quasinormal modes may be unstable ina larger parameter space. furthermore, the existence of vector clouds indicatesthat one may find a vector hairy black hole solution for theeinstein-maxwell-anti-de sitter system at the nonlinear level, which impliesthat, in such system, the kerr-newman-anti-de sitter black hole is not a uniquesolution.
