renormalized volume for any conformally compact manifold with hypersurface boundary we define acanonical renormalized volume functional and compute an explicit, holographicformula for the corresponding anomaly. for the special case of asymptoticallyeinstein manifolds, our method recovers the known results. the anomaly does notdepend on any particular choice of regulator, but the coefficients ofdivergences do. we give explicit formulae for these divergences valid for anychoice of regulating hypersurface; these should be relevant to recent studiesof quantum corrections to entanglement entropies. the anomaly is expressed as aconformally invariant integral of a local q-curvature that generalizes thebranson q-curvature by including data of the embedding. in each dimension thiscanonically defines a higher dimensional generalization of the willmoreenergy/rigid string action. we show that the variation of these energyfunctionals is exactly the obstruction to solving a singular yamabe typeproblem with boundary data along the conformal infinity. this verifies a recentresult of graham and reichert proving that the first variation of the anomalyrecovers the density obstructing smooth solutions to the singular yamabeproblem. our approach relies on a canonical conformal boundary calculus and itsextension to distributions and variational problems. the results show that therenormalized volume part of the conformal holography program requires norestriction on the bulk or boundary conformal structures.
