a poincare-starobinsky-yang-mills type model of dark energy starting from the poincare gauge principle and a starobinsky-yang-mills typelagrangian a model of dark energy is developed. in order to evade anyunnecessary controversy regarding frames (i.e. einstein .vs. jordan) the theoryis treated using the original variables instead of transforming them to ascalar-tensor theory. the field equations are derived directly from theoriginal lagrangian using the variational principle. the cosmological equationsare different from the friedmann equations, but the acceleration equation givesthe same result as the one of the $\lambda $cdm model in the matter-dominatedera. furthermore, it indicates an inflation in the early time and theradiation-dominated era as the starobinsky model. the cosmological constantnaturally emerges from the yang-mills terms of the lagrangian rather than beadded artificially. the equation of state of the dark energy depends on thedensity of the matter and then the coincidence and fine tuning problem issolved naturally.  in order to compare with the popular $\lambda $cdm model, the cosmologicalperturbations is investigated. the equations for linear perturbations of themetric and for the density contrast growth are derived. the explicit analyticsolutions are obtained. the gravitational potential and the growth of thebaryon matter density perturbation can be used to clarify whether this model isin agreement with standard $\lambda $cdm predictions and experimental data.
