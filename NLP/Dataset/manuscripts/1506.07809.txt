a note on entropy of de sitter black holes a de sitter black hole or a black hole spacetime endowed with a positivecosmological constant has two killing horizons -- a black hole and acosmological event horizon surrounding it. it is natural to expect that thetotal bekenstein-hawking entropy of such spacetimes should be the sum of thetwo horizons' areas. in this work we apply the recently developed formalismusing the gibbons-hawking-york boundary term and the near horizon symmetries toderive the total entropy of such two horizon spacetimes. we construct asuitable general geometric set up for general stationary axisymmetricspacetimes with two or more than two commuting killing vector fields in anarbitrary spacetime dimensions. this framework helps us to deal with both thehorizons in an equal footing. we show that in order to obtain the total entropyof such spacetimes, the near horizon mode functions for the diffeomorphismgenerating vector fields have to be restricted in a certain manner, compared tothe single horizon spacetimes. we next discuss specific known exact solutionsbelonging to the kerr-newman- or the plebanski-demianski-de sitter families toshow that they fall into the category of our general framework. we end with asketch of further possible extensions of this work.
