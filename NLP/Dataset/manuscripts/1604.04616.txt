cosmological consequences and statefinder diagnosis of non-interacting  generalized chaplygin gas in $f(r,t)$ gravity in this paper, we investigate the cosmological consequences of a scenario forthe recently reported accelerated expansion of the universe, in which thegeneralized chaplygin gas (gcg) and the baryonic matter are responsible forthis observed phenomenon. here, we have worked in an isotropic and homogeneousflrw space time in $f(r,t)$ theory of gravity. we consider three classes ofmodels which include three different forms of $f(r,t)$ function; class i, arethose models which employ the standard chaplygin gas (scg), in class ii, we usegcg in the high pressure situations and finally, models iii make use of gcg inthe high density regimes. the effective equation of state (eos) and thedeceleration parameter for these models are calculated and showed that therelated present values are more observationally acceptable in $f(r,t)$ gravitycompared with the corresponding ones in the general relativity (gr). and, amongthem class ii have a better situation; the predictions of these models are moreconsistent with the observational values. we also consider these models via thestatefinder diagnosis tool. the discrimination between different dark energymodels is considered by varying the free parameters of the three types ofmodels.
