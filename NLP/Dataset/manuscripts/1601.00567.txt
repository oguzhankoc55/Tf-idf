a first-order approach to conformal gravity we investigate whether a spontaneously-broken gauge theory of the group$su(2,2)$ may be a genuine competitor to general relativity. the basicingredients of the theory are an $su(2,2)$ gauge field $a_{\mu}$ and a higgsfield $w$ in the adjoint representation of the group with the higgs fieldproducing the symmetry breaking $su(2,2)\rightarrow so(1,3)\times so(1,1)$. theaction for gravity is polynomial in $\{a_{\mu},w\}$ and the field equations arefirst-order in derivatives of these fields. the new $so(1,1)$ symmetry in thegravitational sector is interpreted in terms of an emergent scale symmetry andthe recovery of conformalized general relativity and fourth-order weylconformal gravity as limits of the theory- following imposition of lagrangianconstraints- is demonstrated. maximally symmetric spacetime solutions to thefull theory are found and stability of the theory around these solutions isinvestigated; it is shown that regions of the theory's parameter space describeperturbations identical to that of general relativity coupled to a massivescalar field and a massless one-form field. the coupling of gravity to matteris considered and it is shown that actions for all fields are naturallygauge-invariant, polynomial in fields and yield first-order field equations; noauxiliary fields are introduced. familiar yang-mills and klein-gordon typelagrangians are recovered on-shell in the general-relativistic limit of thetheory. in this formalism, the general-relativistic limit and the breaking ofscale invariance appear as two sides of the same coin and it is shown that thelatter generates mass terms for higgs and spinor fields.
