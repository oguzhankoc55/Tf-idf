a simple nonsingular inflationary quintessential model in the framework of a flat friedmann-lema{\^\i}tre-robertson-walker (flrw)geometry, we present a nonsingular model (no big bang singularity at finitetime) of our universe describing its evolution starting from its earlyinflationary era up to the present accelerating phase. we found that ahydrodynamical fluid with nonlinear equation of state could result in such anon singular scenario, which after the end of this inflationary stage, suffersa sudden phase transition and enters into the stiff matter dominated era, andthe universe becomes reheated due to a huge amount of particle production.finally, it asymptotically enters into the de sitter phase concluding thepresent accelerated expansion. we show that the background providing aninflationary potential leads to a power spectrum of the cosmologicalperturbations which fit well with the latest planck estimations. at the end, wecompared our viable potential with some known inflationary quintessentialpotentials, which shows that, our model is an improved version of them becauseit contains an analytic solution that allows us to perform analyticcalculations.
