microscopic properties of black holes via an alternative extended phase  space we propose an alternative view towards \textit{extended phase space} ofcharged anti-de sitter (ads) black holes by considering the cosmologicalconstant as a fixed parameter and treating the square of the charge of blackhole as a thermodynamic variable. therefore, we write down the equation ofstate as $q^{2}=q^{2}(t,\psi)$ where $\psi$ (conjugate of $q^{2} $) is theinverse of the specific volume, $\psi=1/v$. unlike previous studies which havefound no unstable regimes as a function of charge, we identify a thermodynamicinstability in this alternative extended phase space. we therefore study thecritical behavior of isotherms in $q^2-\psi$ diagram and determine that thesystem exhibits a small-large black hole phase transition at the critical point$(t_c,q^2_c, \psi_c)$. finally, we disclose the microscopic properties ofcharged ads black holes by using thermodynamic geometry. interestingly, we findthat scalar curvature has a gap between small and large black holes, and thisgap becomes exceedingly large as one moves away from the critical point alongthe transition line. therefore, we are able to attribute the sudden enlargementof the black hole to the strong repulsive nature of the internal constituentsat the phase transition.
