photon spheres and sonic horizons in black holes from supergravity and  other theories we study closed photon orbits in spherically-symmetric static solutions ofsupergravity theories, a horndeski theory, and a theory of quintessence. theseorbits lie in what we shall call a photon sphere (anti-photon sphere) if theorbit is unstable (stable). we show that in all the asymptotically flatsolutions we examine that admit a regular event horizon, and whoseenergy-momentum tensor satisfies the strong energy condition, there is one andonly one photon sphere outside the event horizon. we give an example of ahorndeski theory black hole (whose energy-momentum tensor violates the strongenergy condition) whose metric admits both a photon sphere and an anti-photonsphere. the uniqueness and non-existence also holds for asymptotically anti-desitter solutions in gauged supergravity. the latter also exhibit the projectivesymmetry that was first discovered for the schwarzschild-de sitter metrics: theunparameterised null geodesics are the same as when the cosmological or gaugecoupling constant vanishes. we also study the closely related problem ofaccretion flows by perfect fluids in these metrics. for a radiation fluid,bondi's sonic horizon coincides with the photon sphere. for a generalpolytropic equation of state this is not the case. finally we exhibitcounterexamples to a conjecture of hod's.
