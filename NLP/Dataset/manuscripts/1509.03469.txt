transverse deformations of extreme horizons we consider the inverse problem of determining all extreme black holesolutions to the einstein equations with a prescribed near-horizon geometry. weinvestigate this problem by considering infinitesimal deformations of thenear-horizon geometry along transverse null geodesics. we show that, up to agauge transformation, the linearised einstein equations reduce to an ellipticpde for the extrinsic curvature of a cross-section of the horizon. we deducethat for a given near-horizon geometry there exists a finite dimensional modulispace of infinitesimal transverse deformations. we then establish a uniquenesstheorem for transverse deformations of the extreme kerr horizon. in particular,we prove that the only smooth axisymmetric transverse deformation of thenear-horizon geometry of the extreme kerr black hole, such that cross-sectionsof the horizon are marginally trapped surfaces, corresponds to that of theextreme kerr black hole. furthermore, we determine all smooth andbiaxisymmetric transverse deformations of the near-horizon geometry of thefive-dimensional extreme myers-perry black hole with equal angular momenta. wefind a three parameter family of solutions such that cross-sections of thehorizon are marginally trapped, which is more general than the known black holesolutions. we discuss the possibility that they correspond to new fivedimensional vacuum black holes.
