binary black hole merger in f(r) theory in the near future, gravitational wave detection is set to become animportant observational tool for astrophysics. it will provide us with anexcellent means to distinguish different gravitational theories. in effectiveform, many gravitational theories can be cast into an f(r) theory. in thisarticle, we study the dynamics and gravitational waveform of an equal-massbinary black hole system in f(r) theory. we reduce the equations of motion inf(r) theory to the einstein-klein-gordon coupled equations. in this form, it isstraightforward to modify our existing numerical relativistic codes to simulatebinary black hole mergers in f(r) theory. we considered binary black holessurrounded by a shell of scalar field. we solve the initial data numericallyusing the olliptic code. the evolution part is calculated using the extendedamssncku code. both codes were updated and tested to solve the problem ofbinary black holes in f(r) theory. our results show that the binary black holedynamics in f(r) theory is more complex than in general relativity. inparticular, the trajectory and merger time are strongly affected. via thegravitational wave, it is possible to constrain the quadratic part parameter off(r) theory in the range |a_2|&lt;10^{11} m^2 . in principle, a gravitational wavedetector can distinguish between a merger of binary black hole in f(r) theoryand the respective merger in general relativity. moreover, it is possible touse gravitational wave detection to distinguish between f(r) theory and a nonself-interacting scalar field model in general relativity.
