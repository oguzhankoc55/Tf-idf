time-dependence of the holographic spectral function: diverse routes to  thermalisation we develop a new method for computing the holographic retarded propagator ingeneric (non-)equilibrium states using the state/geometry map. we check thatour method reproduces the thermal spectral function given by the son-starinetsprescription. the time-dependence of the spectral function of a relevant scalaroperator is studied in a class of non-equilibrium states. the latter arerepresented by ads-vaidya geometries with an arbitrary parameter characterisingthe timescale for the dual state to transit from an initial thermal equilibriumto another due to a homogeneous quench. for long quench duration, the spectralfunction indeed follows the thermal form at the instantaneous effectivetemperature adiabatically, although with a slight initial time delay and a bitpremature thermalisation. at shorter quench durations, several newnon-adiabatic features appear: (i) time-dependence of the spectral function isseen much before than that in the effective temperature (advancedtime-dependence), (ii) a big transfer of spectral weight to frequencies greaterthan the initial temperature occurs at an intermediate time (kink formation)and (iii) new peaks with decreasing amplitudes but in greater numbers appeareven after the effective temperature has stabilised (persistent oscillations).we find four broad routes to thermalisation for lower values of spatialmomenta. at higher values of spatial momenta, kink formations and persistentoscillations are suppressed, and thermalisation time decreases. the generalthermalisation pattern is globally top-down, but a closer look revealscomplexities.
