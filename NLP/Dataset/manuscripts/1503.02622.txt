approximations for the free evolution of self-gravitating quantum  particles the evolution of the centre-of-mass wave-function for a mesoscopic particleaccording to the schr\"odinger-newton equation can be approximated by aharmonic potential, if the wave-function is narrow compared to the size of theparticle. it was noticed by colin et al. [phys. rev. a, 93, 062102 (2016)]that, in the regime where self-gravitational effects are weak, intermediate andwider wave-functions may be approximated by a harmonic potential as well, butwith a width dependent coupling, leading to a time evolution that is determinedonly by a differential equation for the width of a gaussian wave-function as asingle parameter. such an approximation results in considerably lesscomputational effort in order to predict the self-gravitational effects on thewave-function dynamics. here, we provide an alternative approach to this kindof approximation, including a rigorous derivation of the equations of motionfor an initially gaussian wave packet, under the assumption that its shape isconserved. our result deviates to some degree from the result by colin et al.,specifically in the limit of wide wave-functions.
