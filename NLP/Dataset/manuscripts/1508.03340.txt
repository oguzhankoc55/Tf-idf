space-filling branes of gravitational ancestry we introduce a new kind of space-filling brane, which we term "g-brane"because its action is a descendant of the gravitational action. the g-brane maybe thought of as the remanent of the gravitational field when the propagatinggravitons are removed. the g-brane is different from the dirac or nambuspace-filling branes. its properties in any spacetime dimension d areexhibited. when the spacetime dimension d is greater than or equal to three,the g-brane does not possess propagating degrees of freedom, just as the diracor nambu branes. for d=3 the g-brane yields a reformulation of gravitationtheory in which the hamiltonian constraints can be solved explicitly, whilekeeping the spacetime structure manifest. for d=2 the g-brane provides arealization of the conformal algebra, i.e. a conformal field theory, in termsof two scalar fields and their conjugates, which possesses a classical centralcharge. in the g-brane reformulation of (2+1) gravity, the boundary degrees offreedom of the gravitational field in asymptotically anti-de sitter spaceappear as "matter" coupled to the (1+1) g-brane on the boundary.
