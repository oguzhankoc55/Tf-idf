spacetime dynamics of spinning particles - exact electromagnetic  analogies we compare the rigorous equations describing the motion of spinning testparticles in gravitational and electromagnetic fields, and show that if themathisson-pirani spin condition holds then exact gravito-electromagneticanalogies emerge. these analogies provide a familiar formalism to treatgravitational problems, as well as a means for comparing the two interactions.fundamental differences are manifest in the symmetries and time projections ofthe electromagnetic and gravitational tidal tensors. the physical consequencesof the symmetries of the tidal tensors are explored comparing the followinganalogous setups: magnetic dipoles in the field of non-spinning/spinningcharges, and gyroscopes in the schwarzschild, kerr, and kerr-de sitterspacetimes. the implications of the time projections of the tidal tensors areillustrated by the work done on the particle in various frames; in particular,a reciprocity is found to exist: in a frame comoving with the particle, theelectromagnetic (but not the gravitational) field does work on it, causing avariation of its proper mass; conversely, for "static observers," a stationarygravitomagnetic (but not a magnetic) field does work on the particle, and theassociated potential energy is seen to embody the hawking-wald spin-spininteraction energy. the issue of hidden momentum, and its counterintuitivedynamical implications, is also analyzed. finally, a number of issues regardingthe electromagnetic interaction and the physical meaning of dixon's equationsare clarified.
