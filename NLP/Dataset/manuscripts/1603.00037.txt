unique fock quantization of a massive fermion field in a cosmological  scenario it is well known that the fock quantization of field theories in generalspacetimes suffers from an infinite ambiguity, owing to the inequivalentpossibilities in the selection of a representation of the canonical commutationor anticommutation relations, but also owing to the freedom in the choice ofvariables to describe the field among all those related by lineartime-dependent transformations, including the dependence through functions ofthe background. in this work we remove this ambiguity (up to unitaryequivalence) in the case of a massive dirac free field propagating in aspacetime with homogeneous and isotropic spatial sections of sphericaltopology. two physically reasonable conditions are imposed in order to arriveto this result: (a) the invariance of the vacuum under the spatial isometriesof the background, and (b) the unitary implementability of the dynamicalevolution that dictates the dirac equation. we characterize the fockquantizations with a non trivial fermion dynamics that satisfy these twoconditions. then, we provide a complete proof of the unitary equivalence of therepresentations in this class under very mild requirements on the timevariation of the background, once a criterion to discern between particles andantiparticles has been set.
