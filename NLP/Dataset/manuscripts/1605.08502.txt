quasinormal modes of gravitational field perturbation of regular phantom  black holes we study the gravitational quasi-normal modes (qnms) for a kind of regularblack hole named as phantom black hole (bh), which is a solution of aself-gravitating minimally coupled scalar field with an arbitrary potential.theparameter conditions of such bh are investigated in asymptotically flat, desitter (ds), and anti de sitter (ads) spacetimes separately. considering thestandard odd parity and even parity of gravitational perturbation, thecorresponding master equations are derived and quasi-normal perturbation arediscussed in asymptotically flat and ds spacetimes. the dynamic evolution ofthe perturbation field indicates the stability of gravitational perturbationdirectly. on the whole in asymptotically flat and ds spacetimes, thegravitational perturbations have the similar characteristics for odd and evenparities. the decay speed of perturbation is strongly dependent on the scale$b$. furthermore through the analysis of hawking radiation, the thermodynamicsof such regular phantom black hole is also influenced by $b$ significantly.this might be hopeful to support a bridge for quantum interpretation of qnmsperturbation.
