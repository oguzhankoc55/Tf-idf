response of simple quantum systems to different polarizations of  gravitational waves in noncommutative phase-space owing to the extreme smallness of any noncommutative scale that may exist innature, both in the spatial and momentum sector of the quantum phase-space, acredible possibility of their detection lies in the present day gravitationalwave detector set-ups, which effectively detects the relative length-scalevariations ${\cal{o}}\left[10^{-23} \right]$. with this motivation, we haveconsidered how a free particle and harmonic oscillator in a quantum domain willrespond to linearly and circularly polarized gravitational waves if the givenphase-space has a noncommutative structure. the results show resonancebehaviour in the responses of both free particle and ho systems to gw with bothkind of polarizations. we critically analyze all the responses, and theirimplications in possible detection of noncommutativity. we use the currentlyavailable upper-bound estimates on various noncommutative parameters toanticipate the relative size of various response terms. we also argue how thequantum harmonic oscillator system we considered here can be very relevant incontext of the resonant bar detectors of gw which are already operationalcurrently.
