black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics: quasi-normal spectra and  parity splitting we discuss the quasi-normal oscillations of black holes which are sourced bya nonlinear electrodynamic field. while previous studies have focused on thecomputation of quasi-normal frequencies for the wave or higher spin equation ona fixed background geometry described by such black holes, here we compute forthe first time the quasi-normal frequencies for the coupledelectromagnetic-gravitational linear perturbations.  to this purpose, we consider a parametrized family of lagrangians for theelectromagnetic field which contains the maxwell lagrangian as a special case.in the maxwell case, the unique spherically symmetric black hole solutions aredescribed by the reissner-nordstr\"om family and in this case it is well-knownthat the quasi-normal spectra in the even- and odd-parity sectors are identicalto each other. however, when moving away from the maxwell case, we obtaindeformed reissner-nordstr\"om black holes, and we show that in this case thereis a parity splitting in the quasi-normal mode spectra. a partial explanationfor this phenomena is provided by considering the eikonal (high-frequency)limit.
