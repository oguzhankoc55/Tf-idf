on the relation between reduced quantisation and quantum reduction for  spherical symmetry in loop quantum gravity building on a recent proposal for a quantum reduction to spherical symmetryfrom full loop quantum gravity, we investigate the relation between aquantisation of spherically symmetric general relativity and a reduction at thequantum level. to this end, we generalise the previously proposed quantumreduction by dropping the gauge fixing condition on the radial diffeomorphisms,thus allowing to make direct contact between previous work on reducedquantisation. a dictionary between spherically symmetric variables andobservables with respect to the reduction constraints in the full theory isdiscussed, as well as an embedding of reduced quantum states to a sub sector ofthe quantum symmetry reduced full theory states. on this full theory subsector, the quantum algebra of the mentioned observables is computed and shownto qualitatively reproduce the quantum algebra of the reduced variables in thelarge quantum number limit for a specific choice of regularisation.insufficiencies in recovering the reduced algebra quantitatively from the fulltheory are attributed to the oversimplified full theory quantum states we use.
