frame-covariant formulation of inflation in scalar-curvature theories we develop a frame-covariant formulation of inflation in the slow-rollapproximation by generalizing the inflationary attractor solution forscalar-curvature theories. our formulation gives rise to new generalized formsfor the potential slow-roll parameters, which enable us to examine the effectof conformal transformations and inflaton reparameterizations inscalar-curvature theories. we find that cosmological observables, such as thepower spectrum, the spectral indices and their runnings, can be expressed in aconcise manner in terms of the generalized potential slow-roll parameters whichdepend on the scalar-curvature coupling function, the inflaton wavefunction,and the inflaton potential. we show how the cosmological observables ofinflation are frame-invariant in this generalized potential slow-rollformalism, as long as the end-of-inflation condition is appropriately extendedto become frame-invariant as well. we then apply our formalism to specificscenarios, such as the induced gravity inflation, higgs inflation and $f(r)$models of inflation, and obtain more accurate results, without makingadditional approximations to the potential. our results are shown to beconsistent to lowest order with those presented in the literature. finally, weoutline how our frame-covariant formalism can be naturally extended beyond thetree-level approximation, within the framework of the vilkovisky--dewitteffective action.
