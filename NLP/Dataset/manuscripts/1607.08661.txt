einstein's equations from einstein's inertial motion and newton's law  for relative acceleration we show that einstein's $r^{\hat{0} \hat{0}}$ equation for nonrelativisticmatter and strong gravitational fields is identical with newton's equation forrelative radial acceleration of neighbouring freefalling particles, sphericallyaveraged. these laws are explicitely identical with primary observer's (1)space-time slicing by radial 4-geodesics, (2) radially parallel localortho-normal bases, lonbs, (3) riemann normal 3-coordinates. hats on indicesdenote lonbs. general relativity follows from newton's law of relativeacceleration, einstein's inertial motion, lorentz covariance, andenergy-momentum conservation combined with bianchi identity. the gravitationalfield equation of newton-gauss and einstein's $r^{\hat{0} \hat{0}}$ equationare identical and linear in gravitational field for an inertial primaryobserver.---  einstein's equivalence between fictitious forces and gravitational forces isformulated as equivalence theorem in the equations of motion. with this, thegravitational field equation of 19th-century newtonian physics and einstein'sequation for $r^{\hat{0} \hat{0}}$ are identical and bilinear in thegravitational forces for non-inertial primary observers.---  $r^{\hat{0} \hat{0}} = - div \vec{e}_g$ and $2 r^{\hat{i} \hat{0}} = - (curl\vec{b}_g)^{\hat{i}}$ hold exactly for inertial primary observers, if one usesour lonb's. the gravitational $\vec{e}_g, \vec{b}_g $ are measured exactly withquasistatic particles via $(d/dt) p_{\hat{i}}$ and $(d/dt) s_{\hat{i}}$ incorrespondence with the electromagnetic $\vec{e}$ and $\vec{b}$. the$(\vec{e}_g, \vec{b}_g)$ are identical with the observer's ricci connectionalong his worldline, $(\omega_{\hat{a} \hat{b}})_{\hat{0}}$.
