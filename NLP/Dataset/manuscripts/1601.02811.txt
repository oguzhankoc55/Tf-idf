a complete cosmological scenario from $f(r,t^\varphi)$ gravity theory recent elaborated by t. harko and collaborators, the $f(r,t)$ theories ofgravity contemplate an optimistic alternative to dark energy, for which $r$ and$t$ stand for the ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor,respectively. although the literature has shown that the $t$ dependence on thegravitational part of the action - which is due to the consideration of quantumeffects - may induce some novel features in the scope of late-time cosmologicaldynamics, in the radiation-dominated universe, when $t=0$, no contributionsseem to rise from such theories. apparently, $f(r,t)$ contributions to aradiation-dominated universe may rise only from the $f(r,t^\varphi)$ approach,which is nothing but the $f(r,t)$ gravity in the case of a self-interactingscalar field whose trace of the energy-momentum tensor is $t^\varphi$. weintend, in this article, to show how $f(r,t^\varphi)$ theories of gravity cancontribute to the study of the primordial stages of the universe. our resultspredict a graceful exit from inflationary stage to a radiation-dominated era.they also predict a late-time cosmic acceleration after a matter-dominatedphase, making the $f(r,t^\varphi)$ theories able to describe, in aself-consistent way, all the different stages of the universe dynamics.
