pure spinors, intrinsic torsion and curvature in even dimensions we study the geometric properties of a $2m$-dimensional complex manifold$\mathcal{m}$ admitting a holomorphic reduction of the frame bundle to thestructure group $p \subset \mathrm{spin}(2m,\mathbb{c})$, the stabiliser of theline spanned by a pure spinor at a point. geometrically, $\mathcal{m}$ isendowed with a holomorphic metric $g$, a holomorphic volume form, a spinstructure compatible with $g$, and a holomorphic pure spinor field $\xi$ up toscale. the defining property of $\xi$ is that it determines an almost nullstructure, ie an $m$-plane distribution $\mathcal{n}_\xi$ along which $g$ istotally degenerate.  we develop a spinor calculus, by means of which we encode the geometricproperties of $\mathcal{n}_\xi$ corresponding to the algebraic properties ofthe intrinsic torsion of the $p$-structure. this is the failure of thelevi-civita connection $\nabla$ of $g$ to be compatible with the $p$-structure.in a similar way, we examine the algebraic properties of the curvature of$\nabla$.  applications to spinorial differential equations are given. in particular, wegive necessary and sufficient conditions for the almost null structureassociated to a pure conformal killing spinor to be integrable. we alsoconjecture a goldberg-sachs-type theorem on the existence of a certain class ofalmost null structures when $(\mathcal{m},g)$ has prescribed curvature.  we discuss applications of this work to the study of real pseudo-riemannianmanifolds.
