viability of variable generalised chaplygin gas - a thermodynamical  approach the viability of the variable generalised chaplygin gas (vgcg) model isanalysed from the standpoint of its thermodynamical stability criteria with thehelp of an equation of state, $p = - \frac{b}{\rho^{\alpha}}$, where $b =b_{0}v^{-\frac{n}{3}}$. here $b_{0}$ is assumed to be a positive universalconstant, $n$ is a constant parameter and $v$ is the volume of the cosmicfluid. we get the interesting result that if the well-known stabilityconditions of a fluid is adhered to, the values of $n$ are constrained to benegative definite to make $ \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial v}\right)_{s} &lt;0$\&amp; $ \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial v}\right)_{t} &lt;0$ throughout theevolution. moreover the positivity of thermal capacity at constant volume$c_{v}$ as also the validity of the third law of thermodynamics are ensured inthis case. for the particular case $n = 0$ the effective equation of statereduces to $\lambda$cdm model in the late stage of the universe while for $n&lt;0$ it mimics a phantom-like cosmology which is in broad agreement with thepresent sne ia constraints like vgcg model. the thermal equation of state isdiscussed and the eos parameter is found to be an explicit function oftemperature only. further for large volume the thermal equation of stateparameter is identical with the caloric equation of state parameter when $ t\rightarrow 0$. it may also be mentioned that like santos et al our model doesnot admit of any critical points. we also observe that although the earliermodel of lu explains many of the current observational findings of differentprobes it fails to explain the crucial tests of thermodynamical stability.
