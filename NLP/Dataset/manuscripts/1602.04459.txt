energy-momentum tensors in linearized einstein's theory and massive  gravity: the question of uniqueness the question of the uniqueness of energy-momentum tensors in the linearizedgeneral relativity and in the linear massive gravity is analyzed without usingvariational techniques. we start from a natural ansatz for the form of thetensor (for example, that it is a linear combination of the terms quadratic inthe first derivatives), and require it to be conserved as a consequence offield equations. in the case of the linear gravity in a general gauge we find afour-parametric system of conserved second-rank tensors which contains a uniquesymmetric tensor. this turns out to be the linearized landau-lifshitzpseudotensor employed often in full general relativity. we elucidate therelation of the four-parametric system to the expression proposed recently bybutcher et al. "on physical grounds" in harmonic gauge, and we show that theresults coincide in the case of high-frequency waves in vacuum after a suitableaveraging. in the massive gravity we show how one can arrive at the expressionwhich coincides with the "generalized linear symmetric landau-lifshitz" tensor.however, there exists another uniquely given simpler symmetric tensor which canbe obtained by adding the divergence of a suitable superpotential to thecanonical energy-momentum tensor following from the fierz-pauli action. incontrast to the symmetric tensor derived by the belinfante procedure whichinvolves the second derivatives of the field variables, this expressioncontains only the field and its first derivatives. it is simpler than thegeneralized landau-lifshitz tensor but both yield the same total quantitiessince they differ by the divergence of a superpotential. we also discuss therole of the gauge conditions in the proofs of the uniqueness. in the appendix,the use of the symbolic tensor manipulation software cadabra is brieflydescribed.
