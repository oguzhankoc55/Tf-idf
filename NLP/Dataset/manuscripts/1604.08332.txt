van der waals like behavior and equal area law of two point correlation  function of f(r) ads black holes to gain holographic insight into critical phenomena of $f(r)$ ads blackholes, we investigate their two point correlation function, which are dual tothe geodesic length in the bulk. we solve the equation of motion constrained bythe boundary condition numerically and probe both the effect of boundary regionsize and $f(r)$ gravity. moreover, we introduce an analogous specific heatrelated to $\delta l$. it is shown in the $t-\delta l$ graph for the case$q&lt;q_c$ that both the large radius branch and the small radius branch arestable with positive specific heat while the medium radius branch is unstablewith negative specific heat. we carry out free energy analysis to determine thefirst order phase transition temperature $t_*$ and remove the unstable branchin $t-\delta l$ curve with a bar $t=t_*$. it is shown that the values of freeenergy are influenced by the parameter $b$ showing the impact of $f(r)$gravity. however, to one's surprise, the numerical result of $t_*$ turns out tobe $0.2847050173$ for all the three choices of $b$, implying that the firstorder phase transition temperature $t_*$ is the same at least to the order of$10^{-10}$ for different choices of $b$. we also check the analogous equal arealaw numerically and find that the relative errors for the cases $\theta_0=0.1$and $\theta_0=0.2$ are small enough. the fitting functions between $ \log\mid t-t_c\mid$ and $\log\mid\delta l-\delta l_c\mid $ for both cases are alsoobtained. it is shown that the slope is around 3, implying that the criticalexponent is about $2/3$. this result is in accordance with those in formerliteratures of specific heat related to the thermal entropy or entanglemententropy .
