post-merger analytic templates for gw150914 following the new analytic description of the postmerger (ringdown) waveformof coalescing, nonprecessing, spinning, black hole binaries (bbhs) introducedin phys.~rev.~d~90, 024054 (2014), we propose an analytic, closed form,time-domain, representation of the $\ell=m=2$ gravitational radiation modeemitted after merger. this expression is given as a function of the masses anddimensionless spins $(m_{1,2},\chi_{1,2})$ of the two inspiralling objects, aswell as of the mass $m_{\rm bh}$ and (complex) frequency $\sigma_{1}$ of thefundamental quasi-normal mode of the final black hole. it is obtained by firstfitting the postmerger waveform part of several numerical relativitysimulations of the simulating extreme spacetimes (sxs) catalog and thensuitably interpolating over (symmetric) mass ratio and spins. it isdemonstrated that this analytic expression reproduces rather accurately thepost-merger waveform of other sxs datasets not used to build it and, notably,the dataset sxs:bbh:0305, corresponding to a bbh with mass ratio$m_{1}/m_{2}=1.221$, $\chi_{1}=+0.33$ and $\chi_{2}=-0.4399$, which gives theclosest match to the observed signal of gw150914. it would be interesting touse the postmerger analytic waveform template introduced here to perform a newmeasure of the frequency and damping time of the fundamental quasi-normal mode(and possibly also of individual masses and spins) of gw150914 that exploitsthe complete post-merger waveform signal and that is not restricted to only thelate-time ringdown tail. in addition, the same analytic template could also beused to measure the damping time of the second quasi-normal mode, helping thento test the general-relativistic no-hair theorem.
