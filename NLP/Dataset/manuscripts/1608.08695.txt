broken bridges: a counter-example of the er=epr conjecture in this paper, we provide a counter-example to the er=epr conjecture. in ananti-de sitter space, we construct a pair of maximally entangled but separatedblack holes. due to the vacuum decay of the anti-de sitter background toward adeeper vacuum, these two parts can be trapped by bubbles. if these bubbles arereasonably large, then within the scrambling time, there should appear aneinstein-rosen bridge between the two black holes. now by tracing more detailson the bubble dynamics, one can identify parameters such that one of the twobubbles either monotonically shrinks or expands. because of the change ofvacuum energy, one side of the black hole would evaporate completely. due tothe shrinking of the apparent horizon, a signal of one side of theeinstein-rosen bridge can be viewed from the opposite side. we analytically andnumerically demonstrate that within a reasonable semi-classical parameterregime, such process can happen. therefore, the er=epr conjecture cannot begeneric in its present form and its validity maybe restricted.
