vacuum polarization in asymptotically lifshitz black holes there has been considerable interest in applying the gauge/gravity duality tocondensed matter theories with particular attention being devoted to gravityduals (lifshitz spacetimes) of theories that exhibit anisotropic scaling. inthis context, black hole solutions with lifshitz asymptotics have also beenconstructed aiming at incorporating finite temperature effects. the goal hereis to look at quantum polarization effects in these spacetimes, and to thisaim, we develop a way to compute the coincidence limit of the green's functionfor massive, non-minimally coupled scalar fields, adapting to the presentsituation the analysis developed for the case of asymptotically anti de sitterblack holes. the basics are similar to previous calculations, however in thelifshitz case one needs to extend previous results to include a more generalform for the metric and dependence on the dynamical exponent. all formulae areshown to reduce to the ads case studied before once the value of the dynamicalexponent is set to unity and the metric functions are accordingly chosen. theanalytical results we present are general and can be applied to a variety ofcases, in fact, to all spherically symmetric lifshitz black hole solutions. wealso implement the numerical analysis choosing some known lifshitz black holesolutions as illustration.
