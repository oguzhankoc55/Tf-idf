hybrid metric-palatini brane system it is known that the metric and palatini formalisms of gravity theories havetheir own interesting features but also suffer from some different drawbacks.recently, a novel gravity theory called hybrid metric-palatini gravity was putforward to cure or improve their individual deficiencies. the action of thisgravity theory is a hybrid combination of the usual einstein-hilbert action anda $f(\mathcal{r})$ term constructed by the palatini formalism. interestingly,it seems that the existence of a light and long-range scalar field in thisgravity may modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics without conflictingwith the laboratory and solar system tests. in this paper we focus on thetensor perturbation of thick branes in this novel gravity theory. we considertwo models as examples, namely, the thick branes constructed by a backgroundscalar field and by pure gravity. the thick branes in both models have no innerstructure. however, the graviton zero mode in the first model has innerstructure when the parameter in this model is larger than its critical value.we find that the effective four-dimensional gravity can be reproduced on thebrane for both models. moreover, the stability of both brane systems againstthe tensor perturbation can also be ensured.
