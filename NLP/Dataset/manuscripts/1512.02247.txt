damped and zero-damped quasinormal modes of charged, nearly extremal  black holes despite recent progress, the complete understanding of the perturbations ofcharged, rotating black holes as described by the kerr-newman metric remains anopen and fundamental problem in relativity. in this study, we explore theexistence of families of quasinormal modes of kerr-newman black holes whosedecay rates limit to zero at extremality, called zero-damped modes in paststudies. we review the nearly extremal and wkb approximation methods forspin-weighted scalar fields (governed by the dudley-finley equation) and givean accounting of the regimes where scalar zero-damped and damped modes exist.using leaver's continued fraction method, we verify that these approximationsgive accurate predictions for the frequencies in their regimes of validity. inthe nonrotating limit, we argue that gravito-electromagnetic perturbations ofnearly extremal reissner-nordstr\"{o}m black holes have zero-damped modes inaddition to the well-known spectrum of damped modes. we provide an analyticformula for the frequencies of these modes, verify their existence using anumerical search, and demonstrate the accuracy of our formula. these results,along with recent numerical studies, point to the existence of a simpleuniversal equation for the frequencies of zero-damped gravito-electromagneticmodes of kerr-newman black holes, whose precise form remains an open question.
