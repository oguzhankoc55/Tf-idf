noncommutativity in the early universe in the present work, we study the noncommutative version of a quantumcosmology model. the model has a friedmann-robertson-walker geometry, thematter content is a radiative perfect fluid and the spatial sections have zeroconstant curvature. in this model the scale factor takes values in a boundeddomain. therefore, its quantum mechanical version has a discrete energyspectrum. we compute the discrete energy spectrum and the correspondingeigenfunctions. the energies depend on a noncommutative parameter $\beta$. wecompute the scale factor expected value ($\left&lt;a\right&gt;$) for several valuesof $\beta$. for all of them, $\left&lt;a\right&gt;$ oscillates between maxima andminima values and never vanishes. it gives an initial indication that thosemodels are free from singularities, at the quantum level. we improve thisresult by showing that if we subtract a quantity proportional to the standarddeviation of $a$ from $\left&lt;a\right&gt;$, this quantity is still positive. the$\left&lt;a\right&gt;$ behavior, for the present model, is a drastic modification ofthe $\left&lt;a\right&gt;$ behavior in the corresponding commutative version of thepresent model. there, $\left&lt;a\right&gt;$ grows without limits with the timevariable. therefore, if the present model may represent the early stages of theuniverse, the results of the present paper give an indication that$\left&lt;a\right&gt;$ may have been, initially, bounded due to noncommutativity. wealso compute the bohmian trajectories for $a$, which are in accordance with$\left&lt;a\right&gt;$, and the quantum potential $q$. from $q$, we may understandwhy that model is free from singularities, at the quantum level.
