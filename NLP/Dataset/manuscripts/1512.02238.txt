leptogenesis from loop effects in curved spacetime we describe a new mechanism -- radiatively-induced gravitational leptogenesis-- for generating the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. we show howquantum loop effects in c and cp violating theories cause matter and antimatterto propagate differently in the presence of gravity, and prove this isforbidden in flat space by cpt and translation symmetry. this generates acurvature-dependent chemical potential for leptons, allowing amatter-antimatter asymmetry to be generated in thermal equilibrium in the earlyuniverse. the time-dependent dynamics necessary for leptogenesis is provided bythe interaction of the virtual self-energy cloud of the leptons with theexpanding curved spacetime background, which violates the strong equivalenceprinciple and allows a distinction between matter and antimatter. we show herehow this mechanism is realised in a particular bsm theory, the see-saw model,where the quantum loops involve the heavy sterile neutrinos responsible forlight neutrino masses. we demonstrate by explicit computation of the relevanttwo-loop feynman diagrams how the size of the radiative corrections relevantfor leptogenesis becomes enhanced by increasing the mass hierarchy of thesterile neutrinos, and show how the induced lepton asymmetry may besufficiently large to play an important role in determining thebaryon-to-photon ratio of the universe.
