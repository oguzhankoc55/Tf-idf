stability and instability of ellis and phantom wormholes: are there  ghosts? it is concluded in the literature that ellis wormhole is unstable under smallperturbations and would decay either to the schwarzschild black hole or expandaway to infinity. while this deterministic conclusion of instability iscorrect, we show that the ellis wormhole reduces to schwarzschild black hole\textit{only} when the ellis solution parameter $\gamma $ assumes a complexvalue $-i$. we shall then reexamine stability of ellis and phantom wormholesfrom the viewpoint of local and asymptotic observers by using a completelydifferent approach, viz., we adapt tangherlini's nondeterministic, prequantalstatistical simulation about photon motion in the real optical medium to aneffective medium reformulation of motions obtained via hamilton'soptical-mechanical analogy in a gravity field. a crucial component oftangherlini's idea is the observed increase of momentum of the photons enteringa real medium. we show that this fact has a heuristic parallel in the effectivemedium\ version of the pound-rebka experiment in gravity. our conclusion isthat there is a non-zero probability that ellis and phantom wormholes couldappear stable or unstable depending on the location of observers and on thevalues of $\gamma$, leading to the possibility of \textit{ghost wormholes}(like ghost stars). the schwarzschild horizon, however, would always appearcertainly stable ($r=1$, $t=0$) to observers regardless of their location.phantom wormholes of bounded mass in the extreme limit $a\rightarrow -1$ arealso shown to be stable just as the schwarzschild black hole is. we shallpropose a thought experiment showing that our non-deterministic results couldbe numerically translated into observable deterministic signatures of ghostwormholes.
