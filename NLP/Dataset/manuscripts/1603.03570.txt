large $n$ limits in tensor models: towards more universality classes of  colored triangulations in dimension $d\geq 2$ we review an approach which aims at studying discrete (pseudo-)manifolds indimension $d\geq 2$ and called random tensor models. more specifically, weinsist on generalizing the two-dimensional notion of $p$-angulations to higherdimensions. to do so, we consider families of triangulations built out ofsimplices with colored faces. those simplices can be glued to form new buildingblocks, called bubbles which are pseudo-manifolds with boundaries. bubbles canin turn be glued together to form triangulations. the main challenge is toclassify the triangulations built from a given set of bubbles with respect totheir numbers of bubbles and simplices of codimension two. while the coloredtriangulations which maximize the number of simplices of codimension two atfixed number of simplices are series-parallel objects called melonictriangulations, this is not always true anymore when restricting attention tocolored triangulations built from specific bubbles. this opens up thepossibility of new universality classes of colored triangulations. we presentthree existing strategies to find those universality classes. the first twostrategies consist in building new bubbles from old ones for which the problemcan be solved. the third strategy is a bijection between those coloredtriangulations and stuffed, edge-colored maps, which are some sort of hypermapswhose hyperedges are replaced with edge-colored maps. we then show that thepresent approach can lead to enumeration results and identification ofuniversality classes, by working out the example of quartic tensor models. theyfeature a tree-like phase, a planar phase similar to two-dimensional quantumgravity and a phase transition between them which is interpreted as aproliferation of baby universes.
