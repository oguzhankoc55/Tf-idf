now, and the flow of time the progression of time can be understood by assuming that the hubbleexpansion takes place in 4 dimensions rather than in 3. the flow of timeconsists of the continuous creation of new moments, new nows, that accompanythe creation of new space. this model suggests a modification to the metrictensor of the vacuum that leads to testable consequences. two cosmologicaltests are proposed, but they present both experimental and theoreticalproblems. a more practical and immediate test is based on a predicted lag inthe emergence of gravitational radiation when two black holes merge. in suchmergers (as recently observed by the ligo team), a macroscopic volume (millionsof cubic kilometers) of space is created in the region in which thegravitational wave is generated; this one-time creation of new space should beaccompanied by the creation of detectable level of new time, resulting in atime delay that could be observed as a growing lag in the emission of the waveas the merger takes place
