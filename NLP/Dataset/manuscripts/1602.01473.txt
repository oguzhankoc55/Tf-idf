chaos in matrix models and black hole evaporation is the evaporation of a black hole described by a unitary theory? in order toshed light on this question ---especially aspects of this question such as ablack hole's negative specific heat---we consider the real-time dynamics of asolitonic object in matrix quantum mechanics, which can be interpreted as ablack hole (black zero-brane) via holography. we point out that the chaoticnature of the system combined with the flat directions of its potentialnaturally leads to the emission of d0-branes from the black brane, which issuppressed in the large $n$ limit. simple arguments show that the blackzero-brane, like the schwarzschild black hole, has negative specific heat, inthe sense that the temperature goes up when it evaporates by emittingd0-branes. while the largest lyapunov exponent grows during the evaporation,the kolmogorov-sinai entropy decreases. these are consequences of the genericproperties of matrix models and gauge theory. based on these results, we give apossible geometric interpretation of the eigenvalue distribution of matrices interms of gravity.  applying the same argument in the m-theory parameter region, we provide ascenario to derive the hawking radiation of massless particles from theschwarzschild black hole. finally, we suggest that by adding a fraction of thequantum effects to the classical theory, we can obtain a matrix model whoseclassical time evolution mimics the entire life of the black brane, from itsformation to the evaporation.
