electromagnetic potential in pre-metric electrodynamics: causal  structure, propagators and quantization an axiomatic approach to electrodynamics reveals that maxwell electrodynamicsis just one instance of a variety of theories for which the nameelectrodynamics is justified. they all have in common that their fundamentalinput are maxwell's equations $\textrm{d} f = 0$ (or $f = \textrm{d} a$) and$\textrm{d} h = j$ and a constitutive law $h = # f$ which relates the fieldstrength two-form $f$ and the excitation two-form $h$. a local and linearconstitutive law defines what is called local and linear pre-metricelectrodynamics whose best known application are the effective description ofelectrodynamics inside media including, e.g., birefringence. we analyze theclassical theory of the electromagnetic potential $a$ before we use methodsfamiliar from mathematical quantum field theory in curved spacetimes toquantize it in a locally covariant way. our analysis of the classical theorycontains the derivation of retarded and advanced propagators, the analysis ofthe causal structure on the basis of the constitutive law (instead of a metric)and a discussion of the classical phase space. this classical analysis sets thestage for the construction of the quantum field algebra and quantum states.here one sees, among other things, that a microlocal spectrum condition can beformulated in this more general setting.
