on the action of the complete brans-dicke theory recently the most general completion of brans-dicke theory was appeared withenergy exchanged in a uniquely defined way between the scalar field andordinary matter, given that the equation of motion for the scalar field keepsthe simple wave form of brans-dicke. here it is first found the action of thenew vacuum theory which arises as the limit of the matter theory. a symmetrytransformation of this vacuum action in the jordan frame is found whichconsists of a conformal transformation of the metric together with aredefinition of the scalar field. since the general family of vacuum theoriesis not exhausted by the above vacuum theory, the action of this family is alsofound which is parametrized by an arbitrary function of the scalar field. asfor the full theory with matter it is only found the action of the system whenthe matter lagrangian vanishes on-shell, as for example for pressureless dust.due to the interaction, the matter lagrangian is non-minimally coupled eitherin the jordan or the einstein frame.
