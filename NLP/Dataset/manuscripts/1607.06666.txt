gravity in the quantum lab at the beginning of the previous century, newtonian mechanics fell victim totwo new revolutionary theories, quantum mechanics (qm) and general relativity(gr). both theories have transformed our view of physical phenomena, with qmaccurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small lengthscales, and gr correctly describing observations at larger length scales.however, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in theirrespective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. theories andproposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidancetowards the true unifying theory. probing gr at small length scales wherequantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently therehas been a growing interest in probing the opposite regime, qm at large scaleswhere relativistic effects are important. this is principally due to the factthat experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly inrecent years with the promise of quantum technologies. here we review recentadvances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that willbe able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties, playingparticular attention to the role of quantum field theory in curved spacetime(qftcs) in describing these experiments. interestingly, theoretical work usingqftcs has illustrated that these quantum experiments could be used to enhancemeasurements of gravitational effects, such as gravitational waves (gws).furthermore, verification of such enhancements, as well as other qftcspredictions in quantum experiments, would provide the first direct validationof this limiting case of quantum gravity, several decades after it wasinitially proposed.
