earth-moon lagrangian points as a testbed for general relativity and  effective field theories of gravity in the restricted four-body problem consisting of the earth, the moon and thesun as the primaries and a spacecraft as the planetoid, we take into accountthe solar perturbation in the description of the motion of a spacecraft in thevicinity of the stable earth-moon libration points l4 and l5 both in theclassical regime and in the context of effective field theories of gravity. wethen evaluate the location of all lagrangian points in the earth-moon systemwithin the framework of general relativity. for the points l4 and l5, thecorrections of coordinates are of order a few millimeters. after that, we setup a scheme where the theory which is quantum corrected has as its classicalcounterpart the einstein theory, instead of the newtonian one. by virtue of theeffective-gravity correction to the longdistance form of the potential amongtwo point masses, all terms involving the ratio between the gravitationalradius of the primary and its separation from the planetoid get modified.within this framework, for the lagrangian points of stable equilibrium, we findquantum corrections of order two millimeters, whereas for lagrangian points ofunstable equilibrium we find quantum corrections below a millimeter. finally,general relativity corrections to newtonian position of collinear lagrangianpoints turn out to be below the millimiter, whereas on stable equilibriumpoints they are of order of a few millimiters.
