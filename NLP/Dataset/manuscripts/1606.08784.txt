nonlocal infrared modifications of gravity. a review we review an approach developed in the last few years by our group in whichgr is modified in the infrared, at an effective level, by nonlocal termsassociated to a mass scale. we begin by recalling the notion of quantumeffective action and its associated nonlocalities, illustrating some of theirfeatures with the anomaly-induced effective actions in $d=2$ and $d=4$. weexamine conceptual issues of nonlocal theories such as causality, degrees offreedoms and ghosts, stressing the importance of the fact that thesenonlocalities only emerge at the effective level. we discuss a particular classof nonlocal theories where the nonlocal operator is associated to a mass scale,and we show that they perform very well in the comparison with cosmologicalobservations, to the extent that they fit cmb, supernovae, bao and structureformation data at a level fully competitive with $\lambda$cdm, with the samenumber of free parameters. we explore some extensions of these `minimal'models, and we finally discuss some directions of investigation for derivingthe required effective nonlocality from a fundamental local qft.
