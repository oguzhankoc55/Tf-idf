emergent universe in the braneworld scenario according to padmanabhan's proposal, the difference between the surfacedegrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom in a region of space mayresult in the acceleration of universe expansion through the relation $\deltav/\delta t = n_{\rm sur}-n_{\rm bulk}$ where $n_{\rm bulk}$ and $n_{\rm sur}$are referred to the degrees of freedom related to the matter and energy contentinside the bulk and surface area, respectively \cite{pad1}. in this paper, westudy the dynamical effect of the extrinsic geometrical embedding of anarbitrary four dimensional brane in a higher dimensional bulk space andinvestigate the corresponding degrees of freedom. considering the modificationof friedmann equations arising from a general braneworld scenario, we obtain acorrection term in padmanabhan's relation, denoting the number of degrees offreedom related to the extrinsic geometry of the brane embedded in higherdimensional spacetime as $\delta v /\delta t=n_{\rm sur}-n_{\rm bulk}-n_{\rmextr}$ where $n_{\rm extr}$ is referred to the degree of freedom related to theextrinsic geometry of the brane while $n_{\rm sur}$ and $n_{\rm bulk}$ are aswell as before. finally, we study the validity of the first and second laws ofthermodynamics for this general braneworld scenario in the state of thermalequilibrium and in the presence of confined matter fields to the brane with theinduced geometric matter fields.
