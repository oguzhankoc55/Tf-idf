astrophysical calibration of gravitational-wave detectors we investigate a method to assess the validity of gravitational-wave detectorcalibration through the use of gamma-ray bursts as standard sirens. suchsignals, as measured via gravitational-wave observations, provide an estimatedluminosity distance that is subject to uncertainties in the calibration of thedata. if a host galaxy is identified for a given source then its redshift canbe combined with current knowledge of the cosmological parameters yielding thetrue luminosity distance. this will then allow a direct comparison with theestimated value and can validate the accuracy of the original calibration. weuse simulations of individual detectable gravitational-wave signals from binaryneutron star (bns) or neutron star-black hole systems, which we assume to befound in coincidence with short gamma-ray bursts, to estimate any discrepancyin the overall scaling of the calibration for detectors in the advanced ligoand advanced virgo network. we find that the amplitude scaling of thecalibration for the ligo instruments could on average be confirmed to within$\sim 10\%$ for a bns source within 100 mpc. this result is largely independentof the current detector calibration method and gives an uncertainty that iscompetitive with that expected in the current calibration procedure.confirmation of the calibration accuracy to within $\sim 20\%$ can be foundwith bns sources out to $\sim 500$ mpc.
