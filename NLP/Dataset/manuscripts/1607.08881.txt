fusion basis for lattice gauge theory and loop quantum gravity we introduce a new basis for the gauge--invariant hilbert space of latticegauge theory and loop quantum gravity in $(2+1)$ dimensions, the fusion basis.in doing so, we shift the focus from the original lattice (or spin--network)structure directly to that of the magnetic (curvature) and electric (torsion)excitations themselves. these excitations are classified by the irreduciblerepresentations of the drinfel'd double of the gauge group, and can be readily"fused" together by studying the tensor product of such representations. wewill also describe in detail the ribbon operators that create and measure theseexcitations and make the quasi--local structure of the observable algebraexplicit. since the fusion basis allows for both magnetic and electricexcitations from the onset, it turns out to be a precious tool for studying thelarge scale structure and coarse--graining flow of lattice gauge theories andloop quantum gravity. this is in neat contrast with the widely usedspin--network basis, in which it is much more complicated to account forelectric excitations, i.e. for gau\ss~constraint violations, emerging at largerscales. moreover, since the fusion basis comes equipped with a hierarchicalstructure, it readily provides the language to design states with sophisticatedmulti--scale structures. another way to employ this hierarchical structure isto encode a notion of subsystems for lattice gauge theories and $(2+1)$ gravitycoupled to point particles. in a follow--up work, we will exploit this notionto provide a new definition of entanglement entropy for these theories.
