spin precession of slow neutrons in einstein-cartan gravity with  torsion, chameleon and magnetic field we analyse a spin precession of slow neutrons in the einstein-cartan gravitywith torsion, chameleon and magnetic field. for the derivation of theheisenberg equation of motion of the neutron spin we use the effectivelow-energy potential, derived by ivanov and wellenzohn (phys. rev. d92, 125004(2015)) for slow neutrons, coupled to gravitational, chameleon and torsionfields to order 1/m, where m is the neutron mass. in addition to thislow-energy interactions we switch on the interaction of slow neutrons with amagnetic field. we show that to linear order approximation with respect togravitational, chameleon and torsion fields the dirac hamilton operator forfermions (neutrons), moving in spacetimes created by rotating coordinatesystems, contains the anti-hermitian operators of torsion-fermion (neutron)interactions, caused by torsion scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. suchanti-hermitian operators violate cp and t invariance. one may assume that inthe rotating universe and galaxies the obtained anti-hermitian torsion-fermioninteractions might be an origin of i) violation of cp and t invariance in theuniverse and ii) of baryon asymmetry.
