perturbative instability of inflationary cosmology from quantum  potentials it was argued that the raychaudhuri equation with a quantum correction termavoids the big bang singularity and proposes an everlasting universe[plb741,276(2015)]. critical comments on both conclusions and on thecorrectness of the key expressions of this work are discussed in literature[1505.03070]. in the present work, we have analyses the stability conditions bymeans of a small perturbation and concluded that the quantum corrections andtheir additional parameters lead to an unstable universe. we focused onperturbative instability in the inflationary era of the early universe andfound that both unstable and stable modes are incompatible with thecorresponding ones obtained in the standard flrw universe. we have shown thatin the evolutionary era, only unstable modes exist for a small (an)isotropicperturbation and with different equations of state. inequalities for bothunstable and stable solutions with the standard flrw space are derived. theyreveal that in the flrw flat universe both instability and stability arelikely. while negative stability modes have been obtained for radiation- andmatter-dominated eras, merely, instability modes exist in case of a finitecosmological constant and also if the vacuum energy dominates the cosmicbackground geometry.
