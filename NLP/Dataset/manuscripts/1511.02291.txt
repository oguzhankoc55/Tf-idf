revealing a possible implication by imposing lee-yang theorem on the  partition function of the universe the goals of this note are twofold: first, to revisit a mechanism proposed byho\v{r}ava and minic\cite{horava:2000fk} which generates a zero cosmologicalconstant to the universe based on boltzmann probability distribution and theholographic principle, a comparison between the zero cosmological constant andrecent observation results is given. secondly, in order to investigate thepossibility of phase-transition phenomena of the universe, a further study onan exponential class of the partition function of the universe, which is givenby shaw and barrow \cite{shaw:2011ij,barrow:2011bs} was provided byinvestigating the distribution of lee-yang zeros are given. the contribution ofthis paper is that after applying the fundamental theorem of algebra to oneaction chosen from the exponential class that derived from the shaw andbarrow's works, the lee-yang theorem can be applied to the selected action,meaning that critical phenomena might involve the growth of large-scalestructure of the universe, and the phase transition phenomena of the universemight exist during the spacetime expands.
