thermodynamics of horndeski black holes with non-minimal derivative  coupling we explore thermodynamic properties of a new class of horndeski black holeswhose action contains a non-minimal kinetic coupling of a massless real scalarand the einstein tensor. our treatment is based on the well-acceptedconsideration, where the cosmological constant is dealt with as thermodynamicpressure and the mass of black holes as thermodynamic enthalpy. we resort to anewly introduced intensive thermodynamic variable, i.e., the coupling strengthof the scalar and tensor whose dimension is length square, and thus yield boththe generalized first law of thermodynamics and the generalized smarr relation.our result indicates that this class of horndeski black holes presents richthermodynamic behaviors and critical phenomena. especially in the case of thepresence of an electric field, these black holes undergo two phase transitions.once the charge parameter exceeds its critical value, or the cosmologicalparameter does not exceed its critical value, no phase transitions happen andthe black holes are stable. as a by-product, we point out that the couplingstrength acts as the thermodynamic pressure in the behavior of thermodynamics.
