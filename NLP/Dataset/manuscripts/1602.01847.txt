prescriptions for measuring and transporting local angular momenta in  general relativity for observers in curved spacetimes, elements of the dual space of the set oflinearized poincar\'e transformations from an observer's tangent space toitself can be naturally interpreted as local linear and angular momenta. wepresent an operational procedure by which observers can measure such quantitiesusing only information about the spacetime curvature at their location. whenapplied by observers near spacelike or null infinity in stationary, vacuum,asymptotically flat spacetimes, there is a sense in which the procedure yieldsthe well-defined linear and angular momenta of the spacetime.  we also describe a general method by which observers can transport locallinear and angular momenta from one point to another, which improves previousprescriptions. this transport is not path independent in general, but becomespath independent for the measured momenta in the same limiting regime. thetransport prescription is defined in terms of differential equations, but itcan also be interpreted as parallel transport in a particular direct-sum vectorbundle. using the curvature of the connection on this bundle, we compute anddiscuss the holonomy of the transport law. we anticipate that these measurementand transport definitions may ultimately prove useful for clarifying thephysical interpretation of the bondi-metzner-sachs charges of asymptoticallyflat spacetimes.
