trace anomaly and counterterms in designer gravity we construct concrete counterterms of the balasubramanian-kraus type foreinstein-scalar theories with designer gravity boundary conditions inads$_{4}$, so that the total action is finite on-shell and satisfy a welldefined variational principle for an arbitrary scalar field potential. we focuson scalar fields with the conformal mass, $m^{2}=-2l^{-2}$, and show that theholographic mass matches the hamiltonian mass for any boundary conditions. wecompute the trace anomaly of the dual field theory in the generic case, as wellas when there exist logarithmic branches of non-linear origin. as expected, theanomaly vanishes for the boundary conditions that are ads invariant. when theanomaly does not vanish, the dual stress tensor describes a thermal gas with anequation of state related to the boundary conditions of the scalar field. whenthe anomaly vanishes, we recover the dual theory of a massless thermal gas. asan application of the formalism, we consider a general family of exact hairyblack hole solutions that, for some particular values of the parameters in themoduli potential, contains solutions of four-dimensional gauged $\mathcal{n}=8$supergravity and its $\omega$-deformation. using the ads/cft dualitydictionary, they correspond to triple trace deformations of the dual fieldtheory.
