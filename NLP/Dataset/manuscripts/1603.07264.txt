circular orbits and related quasi-harmonic oscillatory motion of charged  particles around weakly magnetized rotating black holes we study motion of charged particles in the field of a rotating black holeimmersed into an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, focusing onthe epicyclic quasi-circular orbits near the equatorial plane. separating thecircular orbits into four qualitatively different classes according to the signof the canonical angular momentum of the motion and the orientation of thelorentz force, we analyse the circular orbits using the so called forceformalism. we find the analytical solutions for the radial profiles ofvelocity, specific angular momentum and specific energy of the circular orbitsin dependence on the black hole dimensionless spin and the magnetic fieldstrength. the innermost stable circular orbits are determined for all fourclasses of the circular orbits. the stable circular orbits with outwardoriented lorentz force can extend to radii lower than the radius of thecorresponding photon circular geodesic. we calculate the frequencies of theharmonic oscillatory motion of the charged particles in the radial and verticaldirections related to the equatorial circular orbits and study the radialprofiles of the radial, $\omega_\mir$, vertical, $\omega_\mit$, and orbital,$\omega_\mip$, frequencies, finding significant differences in comparison tothe epicyclic geodesic circular motion. the most important new phenomenon isexistence of toroidal charged particle epicyclic motion with $\omega_\mir \sim\omega_{\mit} &gt;&gt; \omega_{\mip}$ that could occur around retrograde circularorbits with outward oriented lorentz force. we demonstrate that for the rapidlyrotating black holes the role of the 'wald induced charge' can be relevant.
