lares satellite thermal forces and a test of general relativity we summarize a laser-ranged satellite test of general relativity, themeasurement of the earth's dragging of inertial frames, and then describe themodeling of an important perturbing effect, thermally induced forces, on thesatellite. the frame dragging result is obtained by using about 3.5 years oflaser-ranged observations of the lares, lageos, and lageos 2 laser-rangedsatellites together with the earth gravity field model ggm05s produced by thespace geodesy mission grace. it produces a result in agreement with theprediction of general relativity: $\mu = (0.994 \pm 0.002) \pm 0.05$, where$\mu$ is the earth's dragging of inertial frames normalized to its generalrelativity value, 0.002 is the 1-sigma formal error and 0.05 is the estimatedsystematic error. the thermal force model assumes heat flow from the sun(visual) and from earth (ir) to the satellite core and to the fused silicareflectors on the satellite, and reradiation into space. for a roughly currentepoch (days 1460 - 1580 after launch) we calculate an average along track dragof $-0.50 pm/s^{2}$.
