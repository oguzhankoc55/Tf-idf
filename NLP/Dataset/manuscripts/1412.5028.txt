critical behaviors and phase transitions of black holes in higher order  gravities and extended phase spaces we consider the critical behaviors and phase transitions of gauss bonnet-borninfeld-ads black holes (gb-bi-ads) for $d=5,6$ and the extended phase space. weassume the cosmological constant, $\lambda$, the coupling coefficient $\alpha$,and the bi parameter $\beta$ to be thermodynamic pressures of the system.having made these assumptions, the critical behaviors are then studied in thetwo canonical and grand canonical ensembles. we find "reentrant and triplepoint phase transitions" (rpt-tp) and "multiple reentrant phase transitions"(multiple rpt) with increasing pressure of the system for specific values ofthe coupling coefficient $\alpha$ in the canonical ensemble. also, we observe areentrant phase transition (rpt) of gb-bi-ads black holes in the grandcanonical ensemble and for $d=6$. these calculations are then expanded to thecritical behavior of born-infeld-ads (bi-ads) black holes in the third order oflovelock gravity and in the grand canonical ensemble to find a van der waalsbehavior for $d=7$ and a reentrant phase transition for $d=8$ for specificvalues of potential $\phi$ in the grand canonical ensemble. furthermore, weobtain a similar behavior for the limit of $\beta \to \infty$, i.e charged-adsblack holes in the third order of the lovelock gravity. thus, it is shown thatthe critical behaviors of these black holes are independent of the parameter$\beta$ in the grand canonical ensemble.
