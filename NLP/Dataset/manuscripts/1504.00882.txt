entropy and quantum gravity we give a review, in the style of an essay, of the author's 1998matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis which, unlike the standard approach toentropy based on coarse-graining, offers a definition for the entropy of aclosed system as a real and objective quantity. we explain how this approachoffers an explanation for the second law of thermodynamics in general and anon-paradoxical understanding of information loss during black hole formationand evaporation in particular. it also involves a radically different fromusual description of black hole equilibrium states in which the total state ofa black hole in a box together with its atmosphere is a pure state -- entangledin just such a way that the reduced state of the black hole and of itsatmosphere are each separately approximately thermal. we also briefly recallsome recent work of the author which involves a reworking of the string-theoryunderstanding of black hole entropy consistent with this alternativedescription of black hole equilibrium states and point out that this is freefrom some unsatisfactory features of the usual string theory understanding. wealso recall the author's recent arguments based on this alternative descriptionwhich suggest that the ads/cft correspondence is a bijection between theboundary cft and just the matter degrees of freedom of the bulk theory.
