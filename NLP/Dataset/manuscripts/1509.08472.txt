interior of black holes and information recovery we analyze time evolution of a spherically symmetric collapsing matter from apoint of view that black holes evaporate by nature. we first consider aspherical thin shell that falls in the metric of an evaporating schwarzschildblack hole of which the radius $a(t)$ decreases in time. the important point isthat the shell can never reach $a(t)$ but it approaches $a(t)-a(t)\frac{da(t)}{d t}$. this situation holds at any radius because the motion of a shellin a spherically symmetric system is not affected by the outside. in this way,we find that the collapsing matter evaporates without forming a horizon.nevertheless, a hawking-like radiation is created in the metric, and the objectlooks the same as a conventional black hole from the outside. we then discusshow the information of the matter is recovered. we also consider a black holethat is adiabatically grown in the heat bath and obtain the interior metric. weshow that it is the self-consistent solution of $g_{\mu\nu}=8\pi g \langlet_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ and that the four-dimensional weyl anomaly induces theradiation and a strong angular pressure. finally, we analyze the internalstructures of the charged and the slowly rotating black holes.
