low frequency gravitational wave detection with ground based atom  interferometer arrays we propose a new detection strategy for gravitational waves (gws) below fewhertz based on a correlated array of atom interferometers (ais). our proposalallows to reduce the newtonian noise (nn) which limits all ground based gwdetectors below few hertz, including previous atom interferometry-basedconcepts. using an array of long baseline ai gradiometers yields severalestimations of the nn, whose effect can thus be reduced via statisticalaveraging. considering the km baseline of current optical detectors, a nnrejection of factor 2 could be achieved, and tested with existing ai arraygeometries. exploiting the correlation properties of the gravity accelerationnoise, we show that a 10-fold or more nn rejection is possible with a dedicatedconfiguration. considering a conservative nn model and the current developmentsin cold atom technology, we show that strain sensitivities below $1\times10^{-19}/ \sqrt{\text{hz}}$ in the $ 0.3-3 \ \text{hz}$ frequency band can bewithin reach, with a peak sensitivity of $3\times 10^{-23}/ \sqrt{\text{hz}} $at $2 \ \text{hz}$. our proposed configuration could extend the observationwindow of current detectors by a decade and fill the gap between ground-basedand space-based instruments.
