effect of a cylindrical thin-shell of matter on the electrostatic  self-force on a charge the electrostatic self-force on a point charge in cylindrical thin-shellspace-times is interpreted as the sum of a $bulk$ field and a $shell$ field.the $bulk$ part corresponds to a field sourced by the test charge placed in aspace-time without the shell. the $shell$ field accounts for the discontinuityof the extrinsic curvature ${\kappa^p}_q$. an equivalent electric problem isstated, in which the effect of the shell of matter on the field isreconstructed with the electric potential produced by a non-gravitating chargedistribution of total image charge $q$, to interpret the shell field in boththe interior and exterior regions of the space-time. the self-force on a pointcharge $q$ in a locally flat geometry with a cylindrical thin-shell of matteris calculated. the charge is repelled from the shell if${\kappa^{p}}_{p}=\kappa&lt;0$ (ordinary matter) and attracted toward the shell if$\kappa&gt;0$ (exotic matter). the total image charge is zero for exteriorproblems, while for interior problems $q/q=-\kappa \, r_e$, with $r_e$ theexternal radius of the shell. the procedure is general and can be applied tointerpret self-forces in other space-times with shells, e.g., for locally flatwormholes we found $q_{\mp}^{wh}/q=-1/ (\kappa_{wh} r_{\pm})$.
