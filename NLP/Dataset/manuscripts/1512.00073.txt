extremal higher spin black holes the gauge sector of three-dimensional higher spin gravities can be formulatedas a chern-simons theory. in this context, a higher spin black hole correspondsto a flat connection with suitable holonomy (smoothness) conditions which areconsistent with the properties of a generalized thermal ensemble. building onthese ideas, we discuss a definition of black hole extremality which isappropriate to the topological character of 3d higher spin theories. ourdefinition can be phrased in terms of the jordan class of the holonomy around anon-contractible (angular) cycle, and we show that it is compatible with thezero-temperature limit of smooth black hole solutions. while this notion ofextremality does not require supersymmetry, we exemplify its consequences inthe context of sl(3|2) + sl(3|2) chern-simons theory and show that, as usual,not all extremal solutions preserve supersymmetries. remarkably, we find inaddition that the higher spin setup allows for non-extremal supersymmetricblack hole solutions. furthermore, we discuss our results from the perspectiveof the holographic duality between sl(3|2) + sl(3|2) chern-simons theory andtwo-dimensional cfts with w_{(3|2)} symmetry, the simplest higher spinextension of the n=2 super-virasoro algebra. in particular, we computew_{(3|2)} bps bounds at the full quantum level, and relate their semiclassicallimit to extremal black hole or conical defect solutions in the 3d bulk. alongthe way, we discuss the role of the spectral flow automorphism and provide aconjecture for the form of the semiclassical bps bounds in general n=2two-dimensional cfts with extended symmetry algebras.
