summoning information in spacetime, or where and when can a qubit be? one of the most important properties of quantum information, and the oneultimately responsible for its cryptographic applications, is that it can't becopied. that statement, however, is not completely accurate. while theno-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics prevents quantum information from beingcopied in space, the reversibility of microscopic physics actually requiresthat the information be copied in time. in spacetime as a whole, therefore,quantum information is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion. we fullycharacterize which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantuminformation. because quantum information can be delocalized through quantumerror correction and teleportation, it need not follow well-definedtrajectories. instead, replication of the information in any configuration ofspacetime regions not leading to violations of causality or the no-cloningprinciple is allowed. to demonstrate this, we answer the operational questionof exactly when the information can be summoned to a set of spacetime points,showing how to do so efficiently using a combination of teleportation andcodeword-stabilized quantum codes. this provides a simple and completedescription of where and when a qubit can be located in spacetime, revealing aremarkable variety of possibilities.
