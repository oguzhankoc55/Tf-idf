f(lovelock) theories of gravity f(lovelock) gravities are simple generalizations of the usual f(r) andlovelock theories in which the gravitational action depends on some arbitraryfunction of the corresponding dimensionally-extended euler densities. in thispaper we study several aspects of these theories in general dimensions. westart by identifying the generalized boundary term which makes thegravitational variational problem well-posed. then, we show that these theoriesare equivalent to certain scalar-tensor theories and how this relation ischaracterized by the hessian of f. we also study the linearized equations ofthe theory on general maximally symmetric backgrounds. remarkably, we find thatthese theories do not propagate the usual ghost-like massive gravitonscharacteristic of higher-derivative gravities on such backgrounds. in somenon-trivial cases, the additional scalar associated to the trace of the metricperturbation is also absent, being the usual graviton the only dynamical field.in those cases, the linearized equations are exactly the same as in einsteingravity up to an overall factor, making them appealing as holographic toymodels. we also find constraints on the couplings of a broad family offive-dimensional f(lovelock) theories using holographic entanglement entropy.finally, we construct new analytic asymptotically flat and ads/ds black holesolutions for some classes of f(lovelock) gravities in various dimensions.
