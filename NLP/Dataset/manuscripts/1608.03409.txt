equation of state in the presence of gravity we investigate how an equation of state for matter is affected when a gravityis present. for this purpose we consider a box of ideal gas in the presence ofnewtonian gravity. in addition to the ordinary thermodynamic quantities, acharacteristic variable which represents a weight per unit area relative to theaverage pressure is required in order to describe a macroscopic state of thegas. although the density and pressure are not uniform due to the presence ofgravity, the ideal gas law itself is satisfied for the thermodynamic quantitieswhen averaged over the system. assuming that the system follows an adiabaticprocess further, we obtain a {\it new} relation between the averaged pressureand density, which defers from the conventional equation of state for the idealgas in the absence of gravity. applying our results to a small volume in anewtonian star, however, we find that the conventional one is reliable for mostastrophysical situations when the characteristic scale is small. on the otherhand, gravity effects become significant near the surface of a newtonian star.
