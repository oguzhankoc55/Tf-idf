higher spin black holes with soft hair we construct a new set of boundary conditions for higher spin gravity,inspired by a recent "soft heisenberg hair"-proposal for general relativity onthree-dimensional anti-de sitter. the asymptotic symmetry algebra consists of aset of affine $\hat u(1)$ current algebras. its associated canonical chargesgenerate higher spin soft hair. we focus first on the spin-3 case and thenextend some of our main results to spin-$n$, many of which resemble the spin-2results: the generators of the asymptotic $w_3$ algebra naturally emerge fromcomposite operators of the $\hat u(1)$ charges through a twisted sugawaraconstruction; our boundary conditions ensure regularity of the euclideansolutions space independently of the values of the charges; solutions, which wecall "higher spin black flowers", are stationary but not necessarilyspherically symmetric. finally, we derive the entropy of higher spin blackflowers, and find that for the branch that is continuously connected to the btzblack hole, it depends only on the affine purely gravitational zero modes.using our map to $w$-algebra currents we recover well-known expressions forhigher spin entropy. we also address higher spin black flowers in the metricformalism and achieve full consistency with previous results.
