cosmology without einstein's assumption that inertial mass produces  gravity giving up einstein's assumption, implicit in his 1916 field equations, thatinertial mass, even in its appearance as energy, is equivalent to activegravitational mass and therefore is a source of gravity allows revising thefield equations to a form in which a positive cosmological constant is seen to(mis)represent a uniform negative net mass density of gravitationallyattractive and gravitationally repulsive matter. field equations with bothpositive and negative active gravitational mass densities of both primordialand continuously created matter incorporated, along with two scalar fields to`relax the constraints' on the space-time geometry, yield cosmologicalsolutions that exhibit inflation, deceleration, coasting, acceleration, and a`big bounce' instead of a `big bang', and provide good fits to a hubble diagramof type ia supernovae data. the repulsive matter is identified as the backsides of the `drainholes' introduced by the author in 1973 as solutions ofthose same field equations. drainholes (prototypical examples of `traversablewormholes') are topological tunnels in space which gravitationally attract ontheir front, entrance sides and repel more strongly on their back, exit sides.the front sides serve both as the gravitating cores of the visible, baryonicparticles of primordial matter and as the continuously created, invisibleparticles of the `dark matter' needed to hold together the large scalestructures seen in the universe; the back sides serve as the misnamed `darkenergy' driving the current acceleration of the expansion of the universe.formation of cosmic voids, walls, filaments, and nodes is attributed toexpulsion of drainhole entrances from regions populated by drainhole exits, andaccumulation of the entrances on boundaries separating those regions.
