spherically symmetric sector of self dual ashtekar gravity coupled to  matter: anomaly-free algebra of constraints with holonomy corrections using self dual ashtekar variables, we investigate (at the effective level)the spherically symmetry reduced model of loop quantum gravity, both in vacuumand when coupled to a scalar field. within the real ashtekar-barberoformulation, the system scalar field coupled to spherically symmetric gravityis known to possess a non closed (quantum) algebra of constraints once theholonomy corrections are introduced, which forbids the loop quantization of themodel. moreover, the vacuum case, while not anomalous, introduces modificationswhich are usually interpreted as a signature change of the metric in the deepquantum region. we show in this paper that both those difficulties disappearwhen working with self dual ashtekar variables, both in the vacuum case and inthe case of gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field. in this framework, thealgebra of the holonomy corrected constraints is anomaly free and reproducesthe classical hypersurface deformation algebra without any deformations. apossible path towards quantization of this model is briefly discussed.
