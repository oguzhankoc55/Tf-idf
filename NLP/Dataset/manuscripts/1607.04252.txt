complete conservative dynamics for inspiralling compact binaries with  spins at fourth post-newtonian order in this work we complete the spin dependent conservative dynamics ofinspiralling compact binaries at the fourth post-newtonian order, and inparticular the recent derivation of the next-to-next-to-leading orderspin-squared interaction potential. we derive the physical equations of motionof the position and the spin from a direct variation of the action. further, wederive the quadratic in spin hamiltonians, as well as their expressions in thecenter of mass frame. we construct the conserved integrals of motion, whichform the poincare algebra. this construction provided a consistency check forthe validity of our result, which is crucial in particular in the currentabsence of another independent derivation of the next-to-next-to-leading orderspin-squared interaction. finally, we provide here the complete gauge invariantrelations among the binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital frequency ofan inspiralling binary with generic compact spinning components to the fourthpost-newtonian order. these high post-newtonian orders, in particular takinginto account the spins of the binary constituents, will enable to gain moreaccurate information on the constituents from even more sensitive gravitationalwave detections to come.
