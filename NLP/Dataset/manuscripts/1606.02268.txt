zero modes in de sitter background there are five well-known zero modes in the conformal fluctuations of themetric of de sitter (ds) spacetime. for euclidean signature, they can beassociated with certain spherical harmonics on the $s^4$ sphere, viz., thevector representation $\bf5$ of the global $so(5)$ isometry. they appear, forexample, in the perturbative calculation of the effective action of de sitterspace, even on-shell, as well as in models containing matter fields. these zeromodes are shown to be associated with a would-be collective excitation of thevolume form $dv_4$, which alternatively may be viewed as a legacy of invarianceunder global translations in flat five-dimensions. we argue that these modesshould be regarded as unphysical, similar to gauge modes, and removed from thespectrum of fluctuations. the effective action remains $so(5)$ invariant afterthis surgery.  for lorentzian signature, a similar analysis is expected to apply to$so(4,1)$ invariance, although there are subtleties that have not been resolvedassociated with the infrared behavior of fluctuations of the metric on thehyperboloid. we do not believe these represent an insuperable obstacle toanalytic continuation from euclidean to lorentzian signature.  for convenience, we frame our discussion in the context of renormalizablegravity, but we show that the conclusions apply equally to the correspondingzero modes in einstein gravity.
