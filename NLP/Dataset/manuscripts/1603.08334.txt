comparing dualities and gauge symmetries we discuss some aspects of the relation between dualities and gaugesymmetries. both of these ideas are of course multi-faceted, and we confineourselves to making two points. both points are about dualities in stringtheory, and both have the 'flavour' that two dual theories are 'closer incontent' than you might think. for both points, we adopt a simple conception ofa duality as an 'isomorphism' between theories: more precisely, as appropriatebijections between the two theories' sets of states and sets of quantities.  the first point (section 3) is that this conception of duality meshes withtwo dual theories being 'gauge related' in the general philosophical sense ofbeing physically equivalent. for a string duality, such as t-duality andgauge/gravity duality, this means taking such features as the radius of acompact dimension, and the dimensionality of spacetime, to be 'gauge'.  the second point (sections 4, 5 and 6) is much more specific. we give aresult about gauge/gravity duality that shows its relation to gauge symmetries(in the physical sense of symmetry transformations that arespacetime-dependent) to be subtler than you might expect. for gauge theories,you might expect that the duality bijections relate only gauge-invariantquantities and states, in the sense that gauge symmetries in one theory will beunrelated to any symmetries in the other theory. this may be so in general; andindeed, it is suggested by discussions of polchinski and horowitz. but we showthat in gauge/gravity duality, each of a certain class of gauge symmetries inthe gravity/bulk theory, viz. diffeomorphisms, is related by the duality to aposition-dependent symmetry of the gauge/boundary theory.
