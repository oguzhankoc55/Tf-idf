head-on collision of ultrarelativistic particles in ghost-free theories  of gravity we study linearized equations of a ghost-free gravity in four- andhigher-dimensional spacetimes. we consider versions of such a theory where thenonlocal modification of the $\box$ operator has the form $\box\exp[(-\box/\mu^2)^n]$, where $n=1$ or $n=2n$. we first obtain the newtoniangravitational potential for a point mass for such models and demonstrate thatit is finite and regular in any number of spatial dimensions $d\ge 3$. thesecond result of the paper is calculation of the gravitational field of anultrarelativistic particle in such theories. and finally, we study a head-oncollision of two ultrarelativistic particles. we formulated conditions of theapparent horizon formation and showed that there exists a mass gap formini-black-hole production in the ghost-free theory of gravity. in the casewhen the center-of-mass energy is sufficient for the formation of the apparenthorizon, the latter has two branches, the outer and the inner ones. when theenergy increases the outer horizon tends to the schwarzschild-tangherlinilimit, while the inner horizon becomes closer to $r=0$.
