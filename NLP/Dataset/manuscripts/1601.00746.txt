test particles in a magnetized conformastatic spacetime a class of exact conformastatic solutions of the einstein-maxwell fieldequations is presented in which the gravitational and electromagneticpotentials are completely determined by a harmonic function. we derive theequations of motion for neutral and charged particles in a spacetime backgroundcharacterized by this class of solutions. as an example, we focus on theanalysis of a particular harmonic function, which generates a singularity-freeand asymptotically flat spacetime that describes the gravitational field of apunctual mass endowed with a magnetic field. in this particular case, weinvestigate the main physical properties of equatorial circular orbits. we showthat due to the electromagnetic interaction, it is possible to have chargedtest particles which stay at rest with respect to a static observer located atinfinity. additionally, we obtain an analytic expression for the perihelionadvance of test particles and the corresponding explicit value in the case of apunctual magnetic mass. we show that the analytical expressions obtained fromour analysis are sufficient for being confronted with observations in order toestablish whether such objects can exist in nature.
