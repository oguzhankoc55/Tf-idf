correlation measure equivalence in dynamic causal structures we prove an equivalence transformation between the correlation measurefunctions of the causally-unbiased quantum gravity space and thecausally-biased standard space. the theory of quantum gravity fuses the dynamic(nonfixed) causal structure of general relativity and the quantum uncertaintyof quantum mechanics. in a quantum gravity space, the events are causallynonseparable and all time bias vanishes, which makes it no possible to use thestandard causally-biased entropy and the correlation measure functions. since acorrected causally-unbiased entropy function leads to an undefined, obscuremathematical structure, in our approach the correction is made in the datarepresentation of the causally-unbiased space. we prove that the standardcausally-biased entropy function with a data correction can be used to identifycorrelations in dynamic causal structures. as a corollary, all mathematicalproperties of the causally-biased correlation measure functions are preservedin the causally-unbiased space. the equivalence transformation allows us tomeasure correlations in a quantum gravity space with the stable, well-definedmathematical background and apparatus of the causally-biased functions ofquantum shannon theory.
