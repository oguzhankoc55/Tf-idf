measurability of the tidal deformability by gravitational waves from  coalescing binary neutron stars combining new gravitational waveforms derived by long-term (14--16 orbits)numerical-relativity simulations with waveforms by an effective-one-body (eob)formalism for coalescing binary neutron stars, we construct hybrid waveformsand estimate the measurability for the dimensionless tidal deformability of theneutron stars, $\lambda$, by advanced gravitational-wave detectors. we focus onthe equal-mass case with the total mass $2.7m_\odot$. we find that for an eventat a hypothetical effective distance of $d_{\rm eff}=200$ mpc, thedistinguishable difference in the dimensionless tidal deformability will be$\approx 100$, 400, and 800 at 1-$\sigma$, 2-$\sigma$, and 3-$\sigma$ levels,respectively, for advanced ligo. if the true equation of state is stiff and thetypical neutron-star radius is $r \gtrsim 13 $ km, our analysis suggests thatthe radius will be constrained within $\approx 1$ km at 2-$\sigma$ level for anevent at $d_{\rm eff}=200$ mpc. on the other hand, if the true equation ofstate is soft and the typical neutron-star radius is $r\lesssim 12$ km , itwill be difficult to narrow down the equation of state among many soft ones,although it is still possible to discriminate the true one from stiff equationsof state with $r\gtrsim 13$ km. we also find that gravitational waves frombinary neutron stars will be distinguished from those from spinless binaryblack holes at more than 2-$\sigma$ level for an event at $d_{\rm eff}=200$mpc. the validity of the eob formalism, taylor-t4, and taylor-f2 approximantsas the inspiral waveform model is also examined.
