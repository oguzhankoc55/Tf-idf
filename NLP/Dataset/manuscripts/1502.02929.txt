structure of neutron stars in higher dimensional einstein-lambda gravity in this paper, we consider a spherical symmetric metric to obtain thehydrostatic equilibrium equation of stars in d-dimensions. we calculate thestructure properties of neutron star in einstein-lambda gravity by employingthe modern equations of state of neutron star matter derived from microscopicmany-body calculations. considering the positive and negative values of thecosmological constant, we compute the maximum mass of the neutron stars andobtain the schwarzschild radius for these objects in 4-dimensions. our resultsshow that there is an upper limit for the maximum mass of neutron star forpositive value of cosmological constant. on the other hand, we show that theeinstein gravity can not explain the structure of neutron star with negativevalue of lambda. then, considering the obtained hydrostatic equilibriumequation for 5 and 6 dimensions and by employing the mentioned equations ofstate of neutron star matter, we investigate the maximum mass and theschwarzschild radius for the neutron stars. we find that the einstein gravitywithout lambda anticipate the existence of black holes in 5 and 6 dimensions.in order to have a neutron star, we should add the cosmological constant to thelagrangian of einstein gravity. our calculations show that by applying lambda,we can obtain a very small neutron star.
