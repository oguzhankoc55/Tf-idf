quantum field theory of gravity with spin and scaling gauge invariance  and spacetime dynamics with quantum inflation treating the gravitational force on the same footing as the electroweak andstrong forces, we present a quantum field theory of gravity based on spin andscaling gauge symmetries. a biframe spacetime is initiated to describe such aquantum gravity theory. the gravifield sided on both locally flat noncoordinatespacetime and globally flat minkowski spacetime is an essential ingredient forgauging global spin and scaling symmetries. the locally flat gravifieldspacetime spanned by the gravifield is associated with a noncommutativegeometry characterized by a gauge-type field strength of the gravifield. acoordinate-independent and gauge-invariant action for the quantum gravity isbuilt in the gravifield basis. in the coordinate basis, we derive equations ofmotion for all quantum fields including the gravitational effect and obtainbasic conservation laws for all symmetries. the equation of motion forgravifield tensor is deduced in connection directly with the totalenergy-momentum tensor. when the spin and scaling gauge symmetries are brokendown to a background structure that possesses the global lorentz and scalingsymmetries, we obtain exact solutions by solving equations of motion for thebackground fields in a unitary basis. the massless graviton and massive spinonresult as physical quantum degrees of freedom. the resulting lorentz-invariantand conformally flat background gravifield space-time is characterized by acosmic vector with a nonzero cosmological mass scale. the conformal size of theuniverse becomes singular at the cosmological horizon and turns out to beinflationary. a mechanism for quantum inflation is demonstrated to generate theinflation of the early universe. two types of gravity equation result, one isas the extension to einstein's equation of general relativity, and the other isa new one that characterizes spinon dynamics.
