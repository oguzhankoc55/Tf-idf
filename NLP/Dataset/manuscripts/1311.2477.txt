characterisation of the energy of gaussian beams on lorentzian manifolds  - with applications to black hole spacetimes it is known that using the gaussian beam approximation one can show thatthere exist solutions of the wave equation on a general globally hyperboliclorentzian manifold whose energy is localised along a given null geodesic for afinite, but arbitrarily long time. in this paper, we show that the energy ofsuch a localised solution is determined by the energy of the underlying nullgeodesic. this result opens the door to various applications of gaussian beamson lorentzian manifolds that do not admit a globally timelike killing vectorfield. in particular we show that trapping in the exterior of kerr or at thehorizon of an extremal reissner-nordstr\"om black hole necessarily leads to a`loss of derivative' in a local energy decay statement. we also demonstrate theobstruction formed by the red-shift effect at the event horizon of aschwarzschild black hole to scattering constructions from the future (where thered-shift turns into a blue-shift): we construct solutions to the backwardsproblem whose energies grow exponentially for a finite, but arbitrarily longtime. finally, we give a simple mathematical realisation of the heuristics forthe blue-shift effect near the cauchy horizon of sub-extremal and extremalblack holes: we construct a sequence of solutions to the wave equation whoseinitial energies are uniformly bounded, whereas the energy near the cauchyhorizon goes to infinity.
