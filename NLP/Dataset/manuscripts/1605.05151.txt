mass-loss of an isolated gravitating system due to energy carried away  by gravitational waves, with cosmological constant we derive the asymptotic solutions for vacuum spacetimes with non-zerocosmological constant $\lambda$, using the newman-penrose formalism. ourapproach is based exclusively on the physical spacetime, i.e. we do notexplicitly deal with conformal rescaling nor the conformal spacetime. byinvestigating the schwarzschild-de sitter spacetime in spherical coordinates,we subsequently stipulate the fall-offs of the null tetrad and spincoefficients for asymptotically de sitter spacetimes such that the terms whichwould give rise to the bondi mass-loss due to energy carried by gravitationalradiation (i.e. involving $\sigma^o$) must be non-zero. after solving thevacuum newman-penrose equations asymptotically, we obtain the bondi mass-lossformula by integrating the bianchi identity involving $d'\psi_2$ over a compact2-surface on $\mathcal{i}$. whilst our original intention was to studyasymptotically de sitter spacetimes, the use of spherical coordinates impliesthat this readily applies for $\lambda&lt;0$, and yields exactly the knownasymptotically flat spacetimes when $\lambda=0$. in other words, our asymptoticvacuum solutions with $\lambda\neq0$ reduce smoothly to those where$\lambda=0$, in spite of the distinct characters of $\mathcal{i}$ beingspacelike, timelike and null for de sitter, anti-de sitter and minkowski,respectively. unlike for $\lambda=0$ where no incoming radiation corresponds tosetting $\psi^o_0=0$ on some initial null hypersurface, for $\lambda\neq0$, noincoming radiation requires $\psi^o_0=0$ everywhere.
