modelling lares temperature distribution and thermal drag the lares satellite, a laser-ranged space experiment to contribute togeophysics observation, and to measure the general relativistic lense-thirringeffect, has been observed to undergo an anomalous along-track orbitalacceleration of -0.4 pm/s$^2$ (pm := picometer). this "drag" is not surprising;along track drag has previously been observed with the related lageossatellites (-3.4 pm/s$^2$). it is hypothesized that the drag is principally dueto anisotropic thermal radiation from the satellite's exterior. we report theresults of numerical computations of the along-track orbital decay of the laressatellite during the first 126 days after launch. the results depend to asignificant degree on the visual and ir absorbance $\alpha$ and emissivity$\epsilon$ of the fused silica cube corner reflectors. we present results fortwo values of $\alpha_{ir}$ = $\epsilon_{ir}$: 0.82, a standard number for"clean" fused silica; and 0.60, a possible value for silica with slight surfacecontamination subjected to the space environment. the heating and the resultantalong-track acceleration depend on the plane of the orbit, the sun position,and in particular on the occurrence of eclipses, all of which are functions oftime. thus we compute the drag for specific days. we compare our model toobservational data, available for a 120-day period starting with the 7th dayafter launch, which shows the average acceleration of -0.4 pm/s$^2$. with ourmodel the average along-track drag over this 120-day period for ccr$\alpha_{ir}$ = $\epsilon_{ir}$ = 0.82 was computed to be -0.59 pm/s$^2$. forccr $\alpha_{ir}$ = $\epsilon_{ir}$ = 0.60 we compute -0.36 pm/s$^2$. thus, ourmodel demonstrates that most of the anomalous along-track acceleration can beexplained by thermal thrust, but there could be smaller contributions fromunmodelled effects.
