twisted geometries, twistors and conformal transformations the twisted geometries of spin network states are described by simpletwistors, isomorphic to null twistors with a time-like direction singled out.the isomorphism depends on the immirzi parameter, and reduces to the identitywhen the parameter goes to infinity. using this twistorial representation westudy the action of the conformal group su(2,2) on the classical phase space ofloop quantum gravity, described by twisted geometry. the generators oftranslations and conformal boosts do not preserve the geometric structure,whereas the dilatation generator does. it corresponds to a 1-parameter familyof embeddings of t*sl(2,c) in twistor space, and its action preserves theintrinsic geometry while changing the extrinsic one - that is the boosts amongpolyhedra. we discuss the implication of this action from a dynamical point ofview, and compare it with a discretisation of the dilatation generator of thecontinuum phase space, given by the lie derivative of the group character. atleading order in the continuum limit, the latter reproduces the sametransformation of the extrinsic geometry, while also rescaling the areas andvolumes and preserving the angles associated with the intrinsic geometry. awayfrom the continuum limit its action has an interesting non-linear structure,but is in general incompatible with the closure constraint needed for thegeometric interpretation. as a side result, we compute the precise relationbetween the extrinsic geometry used in twisted geometries and the one definedin the gauge-invariant parametrization by dittrich and ryan, and show that thesecondary simplicity constraints they posited coincide with those dynamicallyderived in the toy model of [1409.0836].
