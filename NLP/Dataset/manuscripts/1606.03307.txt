entanglement, holography and causal diamonds we argue that the degrees of freedom in a d-dimensional cft can bere-organized in an insightful way by studying observables on the moduli spaceof causal diamonds (or equivalently, the space of pairs of timelike separatedpoints). this 2d-dimensional space naturally captures some of the fundamentalnonlocality and causal structure inherent in the entanglement of cft states.for any primary cft operator, we construct an observable on this space, whichis defined by smearing the associated one-point function over causal diamonds.known examples of such quantities are the entanglement entropy of vacuumexcitations and its higher spin generalizations. we show that in holographiccfts, these observables are given by suitably defined integrals of dual bulkfields over the corresponding ryu-takayanagi minimal surfaces. furthermore, weexplain connections to the operator product expansion and the first law ofentanglement entropy from this unifying point of view. we demonstrate that forsmall perturbations of the vacuum, our observables obey linear two-derivativeequations of motion on the space of causal diamonds. in two dimensions, thelatter is given by a product of two copies of a two-dimensional de sitterspace. for a class of universal states, we show that the entanglement entropyand its spin-three generalization obey nonlinear equations of motion with localinteractions on this moduli space, which can be identified with liouville andtoda equations, respectively. this suggests the possibility of extending thedefinition of our new observables beyond the linear level more generally and insuch a way that they give rise to new dynamically interacting theories on themoduli space of causal diamonds. various challenges one has to face in order toimplement this idea are discussed.
