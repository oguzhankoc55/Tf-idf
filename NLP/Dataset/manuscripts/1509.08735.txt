is the proton radius puzzle evidence of extra dimensions? the proton charge radius inferred from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy is notcompatible with the previous value given by codata-2010, which, on its turn,essentially relies on measurements of the electron-proton interaction. theproton's new size was extracted from the 2s-2p lamb shift in the muonichydrogen, which showed an energy excess of 0.3 mev in comparison to thetheoretical prediction, evaluated with the codata radius. higher-dimensionalgravity is a candidate to explain this discrepancy, since the muon-protongravitational interaction is stronger than the electron-proton interaction and,in the context of braneworld models, the gravitational potential can be hugelyamplified in short distances when compared to the newtonian potential.motivated by these ideas, we study a muonic hydrogen confined in a thick brane.we show that the muon-proton gravitational interaction modified by extradimensions can provide the additional separation of 0.3 mev between 2s and 2pstates. in this scenario, the gravitational energy depends on thehigher-dimensional planck mass and indirectly on the brane thickness. studyingthe behavior of the gravitational energy with respect to the brane thickness ina realistic range, we find constraints for the fundamental planck mass thatsolve the proton radius puzzle and are consistent with previous experimentalbounds.
