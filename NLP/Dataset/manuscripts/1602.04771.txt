analyzing modified unimodular gravity via lagrange multipliers the so-called unimodular version of general relativity is revisited.unimodular gravity is constructed by fixing the determinant of the metric, whatleads to the trace-free part of the equations instead of the usual einsteinfield equations. then, a cosmological constant naturally arises as anintegration constant. while unimodular gravity turns out equivalent to generalrelativity (gr) at the classical level, it provides important differences atthe quantum level. here we extend the unimodular constraint to some extensionsof general relativity that have drawn a lot of attention over the last years,as $f(r)$ gravity (or its scalar-tensor picture) and gauss-bonnet gravity. thecorresponding unimodular version of such theories is constructed as well as theconformal transformation that relates the einstein and jordan frames for thesenon-minimally coupled theories. from the classical point of view, theunimodular versions of such extensions are completely equivalent to theiroriginals, but an effective cosmological constant arises naturally, what mayprovide a richer description of the universe evolution. here we analyze thecase of starobisnky inflation and compared with the original one.
