non-relativistic anti-snyder model and some applications we examine the (2+1)-dimensional dirac equation in a homogeneous magneticfield under the non-relativistic anti-snyder model which is relevant todeformed special relativity (dsr) since it exhibits an intrinsic upper bound ofthe momentum of free particles. after setting up the formalism, exact eigensolutions are derived in momentum space representation and they are expressedin terms of finite orthogonal romanovski polynomials. there is a finite maximumnumber of allowable bound states due to the orthogonality of the polynomialsand the maximum energy is truncated at the maximum n. similar to the minimallength case, the degeneracy of the dirac-landau levels in anti- snyder modelare modified and there are states that do not exist in the ordinary quantummechanics limit. by taking zero mass limit, we explore the motion of effectivezero mass charged fermions in graphene like material and obtained a maximumbound of deformed parameter. furthermore, we consider the modified energydispersion relations and its application in describing the behavior ofneutrinos oscillation under modified commutation relations.
