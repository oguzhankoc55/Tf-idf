non-singular brans-dicke collapse in deformed phase space we study the collapse process of a homogeneous perfect fluid (in flrwbackground) with a barotropic equation of state in brans-dicke (bd) theory inthe presence of phase space deformation effects. such a deformation isintroduced as a particular type of non-commutativity between phase spacecoordinates. for the commutative case, it has been shown in the literature[m.a. scheel, s.l. shapiro and s.a. teukolsky, phys. rev. d. 51, 4236 (1995)],that the dust collapse in bd theory leads to the formation of a spacetimesingularity which is covered by an event horizon. in comparison to generalrelativity (gr), the authors concluded that the final state of black holes inbd theory is identical to the gr case but differs from gr during the dynamicalevolution of the collapse process. however, the presence of non-commutativeeffects influences the dynamics of the collapse scenario and consequently anon-singular evolution is developed in the sense that a bounce emerges at aminimum radius, after which an expanding phase begins. such a behavior isobserved for positive values of the bd coupling parameter. for large positivevalues of the bd coupling parameter, when non-commutative effects are present,the dynamics of collapse process differs from the gr case. finally, we showthat for negative values of the bd coupling parameter, the singularity isreplaced by an oscillatory bounce occurring at a finite time, with thefrequency of oscillation and amplitude being damped at late times.
