a new model for spherically symmetric anisotropic compact star in this article we obtain a new anisotropic solution for einstein's fieldequation of embedding class one metric. the solution is representing therealistic objects such as $her~x-1$ and $rxj~1856-37$. we perform detailedinvestigation of both objects by solving numerically the einstein fieldequations under with anisotropic pressure. the physical features of theparameters depend on the anisotropic factor i.e. if anisotropy is zeroeverywhere inside the star then the density and pressures will become zero andmetric turns out to be flat. we report our results and compare with the abovementioned two compact objects on a number of key aspects: the central density,the surface density onset and the critical scaling behavior, the effective massand radius ratio, the anisotropization with isotropic initial conditions,adiabatic index and red shift. along with this we have also made a comparisonbetween the classical limit and theoretical model treatment of the compactobjects. finally we discuss the implications of our findings for the stabilitycondition in relativistic compact star.
