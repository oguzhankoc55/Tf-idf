quantum typicality in spin network states of quantum geometry in this letter we extend the so-called typicality approach, originallyformulated in statistical mechanics contexts, to su(2) invariant spin networkstates. our results do not depend on the physical interpretation of thespin-network, however they are mainly motivated by the fact that spin-networkstates can describe states of quantum geometry, providing a gauge-invariantbasis for the kinematical hilbert space of several background independentapproaches to quantum gravity. the first result is, by itself, the existence ofa regime in which we show the emergence of a typical state. we interpret thisas the prove that, in that regime there are certain (local) properties ofquantum geometry which are "universal". such set of properties is heralded bythe typical state, of which we give the explicit form. this is our secondresult. in the end, we study some interesting properties of the typical state,proving that the area-law for the entropy of a surface must be satisfied at thelocal level, up to logarithmic corrections which we are able to bound.
