the evolution of brown-york quasilocal energy due to evolution of  lovelock gravity in a system of m0-branes recently, it has been suggested in [jhep 12(2015)003] that the brown-yorkmechanism can be used to measure the quasilocal energy in lovelock gravity. wehave used this method in a system of m0-branes and show that the brown-yorkenergy evolves in the process of birth and growth of lovelock gravity. this canhelp us to predict phenomenological events which are emerged as due todynamical structure of lovelock gravity in our universe. in this model, first,m0-branes join to each other and form an m3-brane and an anti-m3-branesconnected by an m2-brane. this system is named bion. universes andanti-universes live on m3-branes and m2 plays the role of wormhole betweenthem. by passing time, m2 dissolves in m3's and nonlinear massive gravities,like lovelock massive gravity, emerges and grows. by closing m3-branes, bionevolves and wormhole between branes makes a transition to black hole. duringthis stage, brown-york energy increases and shrinks to large values at thecolliding points of branes. by approaching m3-branes towards each other, thesquare energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states areproduced. to remove these states, m3-branes compact, the sign of compactedgravity changes, anti-gravity is created which leads to getting away of branesfrom each other. also, the lovelock gravity disappears and it's energy forms anew m2 between m3-branes. by getting away of branes from each other, brown-yorkenergy decreases and shrinks to zero.
