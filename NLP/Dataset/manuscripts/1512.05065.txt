information travels in massless fields in 1+1 dimensions where energy  cannot it has been demonstrated that, in (1+1) spacetime dimensions, massless fieldscan be used for information transmission even between parties that aretime-like rather than light-like separated - and even without the receiverobtaining any energy from the sender. here, it is shown that this phenomenon isnot limited to a particular model of signaling device, but is based on generalproperties of the quantum field: energy propagates strictly only on thelightcone, whereas perturbations to the field amplitude, which can carryinformation, permeate also the inside of the future lightcone of the sender. itis also shown that this timelike and energyless signaling in massless fieldsoccurs in dirichlet cavities, which shows that the phenomenon is not confinedto setups with a zero mode. moreover, it is shown that the phenomenon extendsbeyond perturbation theory, namely by deriving the phenomenonnon-perturbatively for the case where the sender and receiver systems aremodelled as harmonic oscillators. to illustrate the propagation of energy inmassless fields, the energy density is calculated that results from temporarilycoupling an unruh-dewitt detector at rest to the vacuum of the field.
