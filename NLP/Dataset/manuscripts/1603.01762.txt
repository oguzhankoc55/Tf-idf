another approach to test gravity around a black hole pulsars orbiting around the black hole at our galactic center provide us aunique testing site for gravity. in this work, we propose an approach to probethe gravity around the black hole introducing two phenomenological parameterswhich characterize deviation from the vacuum einstein theory. the twophenomenological parameters are associated with the energy momentum tensor inthe framework of the einstein theory. therefore, our approach can be regardedas the complement to the parametrized post-newtonian framework in whichphenomenological parameters are introduced for deviation of gravitationaltheories from general relativity. in our formulation, we take the possibilityof existence of a relativistic and exotic matter component into account. sincethe pulsars can be regarded as test particles, as the first step, we considergeodesic motion in the system composed of a central black hole and a perfectfluid whose distribution is static and spherically symmetric. it is found thatthe mass density of the fluid and a parameter of the equation of state can bedetermined with precision with $0.1\%$ if the density on the pulsar orbit islarger than $10^{-9}~{\rm g/cm^3}$.
