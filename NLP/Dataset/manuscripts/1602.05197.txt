classical static final state of collapse with supertranslation memory the kerr metric models the final classical black hole state aftergravitational collapse of matter and radiation. any stationary metric which isclose to the kerr metric has been proven to be diffeomorphic to it. now, finitesupertranslation diffeomorphisms are symmetries which map solutions toinequivalent solutions as such diffeomorphisms generate conserved superrotationcharges. the final state of gravitational collapse is therefore parameterizedby its mass, angular momentum and supertranslation field, signaled by itsconserved superrotation charges.  in this paper, we first derive the angle-dependent energy conservation lawrelating the asymptotic value of the supertranslation field of the final stateto the details of the collapse and subsequent evolution of the system. we thengenerate the static solution with an asymptotic supertranslation field and westudy some of its properties. up to a caveat, the deviation from theschwarzschild metric could therefore be predicted on a case-by-case basis fromaccurate modeling of the angular dependence of the ingoing and outgoing energyfluxes leading to the final state.
