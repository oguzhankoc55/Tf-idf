decoupling of the re-parametrization degree of freedom and a generalized  probability in quantum cosmology the high degree of symmetry renders the dynamics of cosmological as well assome black hole spacetimes describable by a system of finite degrees offreedom. these systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. one oftheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reducedactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that canbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. in thecase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a lagrangian quadraticin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it bedefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of theequations. in the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations andthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants. in the second case, thesystem can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the "gauge" freedom istransferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. in thispaper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedomin terms of the remaining one, say $q$. by considering these $n-1$ degrees offreedom as arbitrary but given functions of $q$, we manage to extract a twodimensional pure gauge system consisting of the lapse $n$ and the arbitrary$q$: in a way, we decouple the reparametrization invariance from the rest ofthe equations of motion. the solution of the corresponding quantum twodimensional system is used for the definition of a generalized probability forevery configuration $f^i (q)$, be it classical or not. the main result is that,interestingly enough, this probability attains its extrema on the classicalsolution of the initial $n$-dimensional system.
