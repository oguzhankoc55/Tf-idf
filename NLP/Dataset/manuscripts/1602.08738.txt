on the cylindrically symmetric wormholes whcr^e: the motion of test  particles in this article we partially implement the program outlined in the previouspaper of the authors [a. v. aminova and p. i. chumarov, phys. rev. d 88, 044005(2013)]. the program owes its origins to the following comment in paper [m.cveti\v{c} and d. youm, nucl. phys. b, 438, 182 (1995), addendum-ibid. 449,146(1995)], where a class of static spherically symmetric solutions in$(4+n)$-dimensional kaluza--klein theory was studied: "...we suspect that thesame thing [as for spherical symmetry] will happen for axially symmetricstationary configurations, but it remains to be proven". we study the radialand non-radial motion of test particles in the cylindrically symmetricwormholes found in the authors'paper of type $\rm whcr^e$ in 6-dimensionalreduced kaluza--klein theory with abelian gauge field and two dilaton fields,with particular attention to the extent to which the wormhole is traversable.in the case of non-radial motion along a hypersurface z=const we show that, asin the kerr and schwarzschild geometries, we should distinguish between orbitswith impact parameters greater resp. less than a certain critical value $d_c$,which corresponds to the unstable circular orbit of radius $u_c$ $(r_c)$. for$d^2&gt;d_c^2$ there are two kinds of orbits: orbits of the first kind arrive frominfinity and have pericenter distances greater than $u_c$, whereas orbits ofthe second kind have apocenter distances less than $u_c$ and terminate at thesingularity at $u=-\infty$ $(r=0)$. for $d=d_c$ orbits of the first and secondkinds merge and both orbits spiral an infinite number of times toward theunstable circular orbit $u=u_c$. for $d^2&lt;d_c^2$ we have only orbits of onekind: starting at infinity, they cross the wormhole throat and terminate at thesingularity.
