waiting for unruh how long does a uniformly accelerated observer need to interact with aquantum field in order to record thermality in the unruh temperature? weaddress this question for a pointlike unruh-dewitt detector, coupled linearlyto a real klein-gordon field of mass $m\ge0$ and treated within first orderperturbation theory, in the limit of large detector energy gap$e_{\text{gap}}$. we first show that when the interaction duration $\delta t$is fixed, thermality in the sense of detailed balance cannot hold as$e_{\text{gap}}\to\infty$, and this property generalises from the unruh effectto any kubo-martin-schwinger state satisfying certain technical conditions. wethen specialise to a massless field in four spacetime dimensions and show thatdetailed balance does hold when $\delta t$ grows as a power-law in$e_{\text{gap}}$ as $e_{\text{gap}}\to\infty$, provided the switch-on andswitch-off intervals are stretched proportionally to $\delta t$ and theswitching function has sufficiently strong fourier decay. by contrast, if$\delta t$ grows by stretching a plateau in which the interaction remains atconstant strength but keeping the duration of the switch-on and switch-offintervals fixed, detailed balance at $e_{\text{gap}}\to\infty$ requires $\deltat$ to grow faster than any polynomial in $e_{\text{gap}}$, under mild technicalconditions. these results also hold for a static detector in a minkowski heatbath.  the results limit the utility of the large $e_{\text{gap}}$ regime as a probeof thermality in time-dependent versions of the hawking and unruh effects, suchas an observer falling into a radiating black hole. they may also haveimplications on the design of prospective experimental tests of the unruheffect.
