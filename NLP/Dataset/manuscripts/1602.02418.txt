a black hole solution of higher-dimensional weyl-yang-kaluza-klein  theory by the wu-yang ansatz we consider the weyl-yang gauge theory of gravitation in a$(4+3)$-dimensional curved space-time within the scenario of the non-abeliankaluza-klein theory for the source and torsion-free limits. the explicit formsof the field equations containing a new spin current term and theenergy-momentum tensors in the usual four dimensions are obtained by thewell-known dimensional reduction procedure. in this limit, these fieldequations admit (anti)-dyon and magnetic (anti)-monopole solutions as well as anon-einsteinian solution in the presence of a generalized wu-yang ansatz andsome specific scalar potentials when the extra dimensions associated with theround and squashed three-sphere $s^{3}$ are, respectively, included. the(anti)-dyonic solution has similar properties to those of thereissner-nordstr\"{o}m-de sitter black holes of the einstein-yang-mills system.the cosmological constant naturally appears in this approach, and that itassociates with the constant dilaton field as well as the three-sphere radius.it is demonstrated that the squashing parameter $\ell$ not only behaves as theconstant charge, but also its sign can determine whether the solution is adyon/monopole or an anti-dyon/anti-monopole. it is also shown that whether thesource term reduces to camenzind's current density, and that the existence ofnon-constant dilaton fields is essential for finding new black hole solutionsin the weyl-yang gauge theory.
