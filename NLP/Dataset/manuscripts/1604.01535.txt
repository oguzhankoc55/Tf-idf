zero temperature holographic superfluids with two competing orders we initiate the investigation of the zero temperature holographic superfluidswith two competing orders, where besides the vacuum phase, two one bandsuperfluid phases, the coexistent superfluid phase has also been found in theads soliton background for the first time. we construct the complete phasediagram in the $e-\mu$ plane by numerics, which is consistent with ourqualitative analysis. furthermore, we calculate the corresponding opticalconductivity and sound speed by the linear response theory. the onset of poleof optical conductivity at $\omega=0$ indicates that the spontaneous breakingphase always represents the superfluid phase, and the residue of pole isincreased with the chemical potential, which is consistent with the fact thatthe particle density is essentially the superfluid density for zero temperaturesuperfluids. in addition, the resulting sound speed demonstrates thenon-smoothness at the critical points as the order parameter of condensate,which indicates that the phase transitions can also be identified by thebehavior of sound speed. moreover, as expected from the boundary conformalfield theory, the sound speed saturates to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ at the largechemical potential limit for our two band holographic superfluid model.
