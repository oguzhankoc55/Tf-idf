classical and quantum cosmology of minimal massive bigravity in a friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) space-time background we study theclassical cosmological models in the context of recently proposed theory ofnonlinear minimal massive bigravity. we show that in the presence of perfectfluid the classical field equations acquire contribution from the massivegraviton as a cosmological term which is positive or negative depending on thedynamical competition between two scale factors of bigravity metrics. we obtainthe classical field equations for flat and open universes in the ordinary andschutz representation of perfect fluid. focusing on the schutz representationfor flat universe, we find classical solutions exhibiting singularities atearly universe with vacuum equation of state. then, in the schutzrepresentation, we study the quantum cosmology for flat universe and derive theschrodinger-wheeler-dewitt equation. we find its exact and wave packetsolutions and discuss on their properties to show that the initial singularityin the classical solutions can be avoided by quantum cosmology. similar to thestudy of hartle-hawking no-boundary proposal in the quantum cosmology of derham, gabadadze and tolley (drgt) massive gravity, it turns out that the massof graviton predicted by quantum cosmology of the minimal massive bigravity islarge at early universe. this is in agreement with the fact that at earlyuniverse the cosmological constant should be large.
