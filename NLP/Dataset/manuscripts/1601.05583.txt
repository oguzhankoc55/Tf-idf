rapidly rotating neutron stars in dilatonic einstein-gauss-bonnet theory we construct sequences of rapidly rotating neutron stars in dilatoniceinstein-gauss-bonnet theory, employing two equations of state for the nuclearmatter. we analyze the dependence of the physical properties of these neutronstars on the gauss-bonnet coupling strength. for a given equation of state wedetermine the physically relevant domain of rapidly rotating neutron stars,which is delimited by the set of neutron stars rotating at the kepler limit,the set of neutron stars along the secular instability line, and the set ofstatic neutron stars. as compared to einstein gravity, the presence of thegauss-bonnet term decreases this domain, leading to lower values for themaximum mass as well as to smaller central densities. the quadrupole moment isdecreased by the gauss-bonnet term for rapidly rotating neutron stars, while itis increased for slowly rotating neutron stars. the universal relation betweenthe quadrupole moment and the moment of inertia found in general relativityappears to extend to dilatonic einstein-gauss-bonnet theory with very littledependence on the coupling strength of the gauss-bonnet term. the neutron starscarry a small dilaton charge.
