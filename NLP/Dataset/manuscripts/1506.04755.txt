metric perturbations produced by eccentric equatorial orbits around a  kerr black hole we present the first numerical calculation of the (local) metric perturbationproduced by a small compact object moving on an eccentric equatorial geodesicaround a kerr black hole, accurate to first order in the mass ratio. theprocedure starts by first solving the teukolsky equation to obtain the weylscalar $\psi_4$ using semi-analytical methods. the metric perturbation is thenreconstructed from $\psi_4$ in an (outgoing) radiation gauge, adding theappropriate non-radiative contributions arising from the shifts in mass andangular momentum of the spacetime.  as a demonstration we calculate the generalized redshift $u$ as a function ofthe orbital frequencies $\omega_r$ and $\omega_\phi$ to linear order in themass ratio, a gauge invariant measure of the conservative corrections to theorbit due to self-interactions. in schwarzschild, the results surpass theexisting result in the literature in accuracy, and we find new estimates forsome of the unknown 4pn and 5pn terms in the post-newtonian expansion of $u$.in kerr, we provide completely novel values of $u$ for eccentric equatorialorbits. calculation of the full self-force will appear in a forthcoming paper.
