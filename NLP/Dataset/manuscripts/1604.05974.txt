gravitational wave stress tensor from the linearised field equations a conserved stress energy tensor for weak field gravitational waves instandard general relativity is derived directly from the linearised waveequation alone, for an arbitrary gauge. the form of the tensor leads directlyto the classical expression for the outgoing wave energy in any harmonic gauge.the method described here, however, is a much simpler, shorter, and morephysically motivated approach than is the customary procedure, which involves alengthy and cumbersome second-order (in wave-amplitude) calculation startingwith the einstein tensor. our method has the added advantage of exhibiting thedirect coupling between the outgoing energy flux in gravitational waves and thework done by the gravitational field on the sources. for nonharmonic gauges,the derived wave stress tensor has an index asymmetry. this coordinate artefactmay be removed by techniques similar to those used in classical electrodynamics(where this issue also arises), but only by appeal to a more lengthycalculation. for any harmonic gauge, however, the stress tensor is manifestlysymmetric and its derivation depends, in its entirety, on the first-order waveequation.
