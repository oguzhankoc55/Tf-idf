problem of time in slightly inhomogeneous cosmology the problem of time (pot) is a multi-faceted conceptual incompatibilitybetween various areas of theoretical physics. whilst usually stated as betweengr and qm, in fact 8/9ths of it is already present at the classical level. thuswe adopt a `top-down' classical and then quantum approach. i consider a localresolution to the problem of time that is machian, which was previouslyrealized for relational triangle and minisuperspace models. this resolution hasthree levels: classical, semiclassical and combinedsemiclassical-histories-records. this article's specific model is a slightlyinhomogeneous cosmology considered for now at the classical level. this ismotivated by how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structureformation - galaxies and cmb hotspots - might have been seeded by quantumcosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. inparticular, i consider the perturbations about $s^3$ case of this involving upto second order, which has a number of parallels with the halliwell-hawkingmodel but has a number of conceptual differences and useful upgrades. thearticle's main features are that the elimination part of the model's thinsandwich is straightforward, but the modewise split of the constraints fail tobe first-class constraints. thus the elimination part only arises as anintermediate geometry between superspace and riem. the reduced geometries havesurprising singularities influenced by the matter content of the universe,though the n-body problem anticipates these with its collinear singularities. ialso give a `basis set' of kuchar beables for this model arena.
