zero rest-mass fields and the newman-penrose constants on flat space zero rest-mass fields of spin 1 (the electromagnetic field) and spin 2propagating on flat space and their corresponding newman-penrose (np) constantsare studied near spatial infinity. the aim of this analysis is to clarify thecorrespondence between data for these fields on a spacelike hypersurface andthe value of their corresponding np constants at future and past null infinity.to do so, the framework of the cylinder at spatial infinity is employed to showthat, expanding the initial data in terms spherical harmonics and powers of thegeodesic spatial distance $\rho$ to spatial infinity, the np constantscorrespond to the data for the highest possible spherical harmonic at fixedorder in $\rho$. in addition, it is shown that the np constants at future andpast null infinity, for both the maxwell and spin-2 case, are related to eachother as they arise from the same terms in the initial data. moreover, it isshown that this observation is true for generic data (not necessarilytime-symmetric). this identification is a consequence of both the evolution andconstraint equations.
