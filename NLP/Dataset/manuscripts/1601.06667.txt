on d-brane-anti d-brane effective actions and their all order bulk  singularity structures all four point functions of brane anti brane system including their correctall order $\alpha'$ corrections have been addressed. all five point functionsof one closed string ramond-ramond (rr), two real tachyons and either one gaugefield or the scalar field in both symmetric and asymmetric pictures have alsobeen explored. the entire analysis of $&lt;c^{-2} a^0 t^0 t ^{0}&gt;$ is carried out.not only does it fix the vertex operator of rr in asymmetric picture and inhigher point functions of string theory amplitudes but also it confirms thefact that there is no issue of picture dependence of the mixed closed rr, gaugefields, tachyons and fermion fields in all symmetric or anti symmetric ones. wecompute $&lt;c^{-2} \phi^0 t^0 t ^{0}&gt;$ s-matrix in the presence of a transversescalar field, two real tachyons and that reveals two different kinds of bulksingularity structures, involving an infinite number of $u$- channel gaugefield and $(u+s'+t')$- channel scalar bulk poles. in order to produce all thosebulk singularity structures, we define various couplings at the level of theeffective field theory that involve the mixing term of chern-simons coupling(with c-potential field) and a covariant derivative of the scalar field thatcomes from the pull-back of brane. eventually we explore their all order$\alpha'$ corrections in the presence of brane anti brane system where variousremarks will be also pointed out.
