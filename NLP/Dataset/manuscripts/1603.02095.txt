quasinormal modes of relativistic stars and interacting fields the quasinormal modes of relativistic compact objects encode importantinformation about the gravitational response associated with astrophysicalphenomena. detecting such oscillations would provide us with a uniqueunderstanding of the properties of compact stars, and may give definitiveevidence for the existence of black holes. however, computing quasinormal modesin realistic astrophysical environments is challenging due to the complexity ofthe spacetime background and of the dynamics of the perturbations. we discusstwo complementary methods for computing the quasinormal modes of sphericallysymmetric astrophysical systems, namely, the direct integration method and thecontinued-fraction method. we extend these techniques to dealing with genericcoupled systems of linear equations, with the only assumption being theinteraction between different fields is effectively localized within a finiteregion. in particular, we adapt the continued-fraction method to include caseswhere a series solution can be obtained only outside an effective region. as anapplication, we compute the polar quasinormal modes of boson stars by using thecontinued-fraction method for the first time. the methods discussed here can beapplied to other situations in which the perturbations effectively couple onlywithin a finite region of space.
