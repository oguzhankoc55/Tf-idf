the conformal universe i: physical and mathematical basis of conformal  general relativity this is the first of three papers on conformal general relativity (cgr),which differs from einstein's general relativity (gr) in that it requiresaction--integral invariance under local scale transformations in addition togeneral coordinate transformations. the theory is here introduced in thesemiclassical approximation as a preliminary approach to a quantum theoreticalimplementation. the idea of a conformal--invariant extension of gr wasintroduced by weyl in 1919. for several decades it had little impact, as cgrimplies that all fields are massless. today this does not appear to be anunsurmountable difficulty since nonzero mass parameters may result from thespontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry. the theory leads to veryinteresting results and predictions: 1) the spontaneous breakdown of conformalsymmetry is only possible in a 4d--spacetime with small negative curvature; 2)cgr requires the introduction of a ghost scalar field $\sigma(x)$ invested withgeometric meaning and a physical scalar field $\varphi(x)$ of zero mass, bothof which have nonzero vacuum expectation values; 3) in order to preserve$s$--matrix unitarity, $\sigma(x)$ and $\varphi(x)$ must interact in such a waythat the total energy density is bounded from below; 4) this interaction makes$\varphi(x)$ behave like a higgs field of varying mass, which is capable ofpromoting a huge energy transfer from geometry to matter identifiable as thebig bang; 5) in the course of time, the higgs boson mass becomes a constant andcgr converges to gr.
