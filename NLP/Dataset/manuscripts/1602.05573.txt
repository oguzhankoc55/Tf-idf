gravitational wave astrophysics, data analysis and multimessenger  astronomy this paper reviews gravitational wave sources and their detection. one of themost exciting potential sources of gravitational waves are coalescing binaryblack hole systems. they can occur on all mass scales and be formed in numerousways, many of which are not understood. they are generally invisible inelectromagnetic waves, and they provide opportunities for deep investigation ofeinstein's general theory of relativity. sect. 1 of this paper considers waysthat binary black holes can be created in the universe, and includes theprediction that binary black hole coalescence events are likely to be the firstgravitational wave sources to be detected. the next parts of this paper addressthe detection of chirp waveforms from coalescence events in noisy data. suchanalysis is computationally intensive. sect. 2 reviews a new and powerfulmethod of signal detection based on the gpu-implemented summed parallelinfinite impulse response filters. such filters are intrinsically real timealorithms, that can be used to rapidly detect and localise signals. sect. 3 ofthe paper reviews the use of gpu processors for rapid searching forgravitational wave bursts that can arise from black hole births andcoalescences. in sect. 4 the use of gpu processors to enable fast efficientstatistical significance testing of gravitational wave event candidates isreviewed. sect. 5 of this paper addresses the method of multimessengerastronomy where the discovery of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitationalwave events can be used to identify sources, understand their nature and obtainmuch greater science outcomes from each identified event.
