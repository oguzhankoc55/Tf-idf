lifshitz scaling effects on holographic paramagnetism/ferromagneism  phase transition in the probe limit, we investigate holographic paramagnetism-ferromagnetismphase transition in the four-dimensional (4d) and five-dimensional(5d) lifshitzblack holes by means of numerical and semi-analytical methods, which isrealized by introducing a massive 2-form field coupled to the maxwell field. wefind that the lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$ contributes evidently to magneticmoment and hysteresis loop of single magnetic domain quantitatively notqualitatively. concretely, in the case without external magnetic field, thespontaneous magnetization and ferromagnetic phase transition happen when thetemperature gets low enough, and the critical exponent for the magnetic momentis always $1/2$, which is in agreement with the result from mean field theory.and the increasing $z$ enhances the phase transition and increases the dcresistivity which behaves as the colossal magnetic resistance effect in somematerials. furthermore, in the presence of the external magnetic field, themagnetic susceptibility satisfies the cure-weiss law with a general $z$. butthe increase of $z$ will result in shortening the period of the externalmagnetic field.
