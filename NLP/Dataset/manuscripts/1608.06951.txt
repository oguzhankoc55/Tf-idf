the weak gravity conjecture and effective field theory the weak gravity conjecture (wgc) is a proposed constraint on theories withgauge fields and gravity, requiring the existence of light charged particlesand/or imposing an upper bound on the field theory cutoff $\lambda$. if takenas a consistency requirement for effective field theories (efts), it rules outpossibilities for model-building including some models of inflation. idemonstrate simple models which satisfy all forms of the wgc, but which throughhiggsing of the original gauge fields produce low-energy efts with gauge forcesthat badly violate the wgc. these models illustrate specific loopholes inarguments that motivate the wgc from a bottom-up perspective; for example thearguments based on magnetic monopoles are evaded when the magnetic confinementthat occurs in a higgs phase is accounted for. this indicates that the wgcshould not be taken as a veto on efts, even if it turns out to be a robustproperty of uv quantum gravity theories. however, if the latter is true thenparametric violation of the wgc at low energy comes at the cost of non-minimalfield content in the uv. i propose that only a very weak constraint isapplicable to efts, $\lambda \lesssim \left(-\log g \right)^{-1/2}m_\text{pl}$, motivated by entropy bounds. remarkably, efts produced byhiggsing a theory that satisfies the wgc can saturate but not violate thisbound.
