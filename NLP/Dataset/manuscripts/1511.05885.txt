$z_2$ massive axions, domain walls and inflation we have analyzed a $u(1)$ model which is broken explicitly to a $z_2$ model.the model results in generating two stable domain walls, in contrast with themore common $n_{dw}=1$ version which is prevalently used to explain axioninvisibility for $u_{pq}(1)$ model. we have been meticulous to take intoaccount any possible relation with previous studies, even if they apparentlybelong to different lines of research. then we have scrutinized the domain wallproperties of the model,proposing a rigorous approximate solution which fullysatisfies boundary conditions and the static virial theorem simultaneously.invoking the mentioned approximation, we have been able to obtain an analyticalinsight about the effect of parameters on the domain wall features,particularly on their surface energy density which is of great importance incosmological studies when one tries to avoid domain wall energy dominationproblem. next, we have mainly focused on the likely inflationary scenarios ofthe model, including saddle point inflation, again insisting on analyticaldiscussions to be able to follow the role of parameters. we have tried tocategorize any inflationary scenario into the known categories to takeadvantage of the previous detailed studies under the inflationary topic overthe decades. we have concluded that any successful inflationary scenariorequires large fields definition for the model. calculations are mainly doneanalytically and numerical results are used as supportive material.
