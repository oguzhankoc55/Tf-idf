cosmological consequences of an adiabatic matter creation process in this paper we investigate the cosmological consequences of a continuousmatter creation associated with the production of particles by thegravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum. to illustrate this, threephenomenological models are considered. an equivalent scalar field descriptionis presented for each models. the effects on the cosmic microwave backgroundpower spectrum are analyzed for the first time in the context of adiabaticmatter creation cosmology. further, we introduce a model independent treatment,$om$, which depends only on the hubble expansion rate and the cosmologicalredshift to distinguish any cosmological model from $\lambda$cdm by providing anull test for the cosmological constant, meaning that, for any two redshifts$z_1$, $z_2$, $om (z)$ is same, i.e. $om (z_1)- om (z_2)= 0$. also, thisdiagnostic can differentiate between several cosmological models by indicatingtheir quintessential/ phantom behavior without knowing the accurate value ofthe matter density, and the present value of the hubble parameter. for ourmodels, we find that particle production rate is inversely proportional to$om$. finally, the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamicsbounded by the apparent horizon has been examined.
