hierarchical follow-up of sub-threshold candidates of an all-sky  einstein@home search for continuous gravitational waves on ligo sixth science  run data we report results of an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves withfrequency between 50 and 510 hz from isolated compact objects, i.e. neutronstars. a new hierarchical multi-stage approach is taken, supported by thecomputing power of the einstein@home project, allowing to probe more deeplythan ever before. 16 million sub-threshold candidates from the initial search[lvc,arxiv:1606.09619] are followed up in three stages. none of thosecandidates is consistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 90%confidence level upper limits are placed on the amplitudes of continuous wavesfrom the target population. between 170.5 and 171 hz we set the mostconstraining 90% confidence upper limit on the strain amplitude h0 at 4.3x10-25, while at the high end of our frequency range we achieve an upper limit of7.6x10-25. these are the most constraining all-sky upper limits to date andconstrain the ellipticity of rotating compact objects emitting at 300 hz at adistance d to less than 6x10-7 [d/100pc].
