black hole based quantum computing in labs and in the sky analyzing some well established facts, we give a model-independentparameterization of black hole quantum computing in terms of a set of macro andmicro quantities and their relations. these include the relations between theextraordinarily-small energy gap of black hole qubits and important time-scalesof information-processing, such as, scrambling time and page's time. we thenshow, confirming and extending previous results, that other systems of naturewith identical quantum informatics features are attractive bose-einsteinsystems at the critical point of quantum phase transition. here we establish acomplete isomorphy between the quantum computational properties of these twosystems. in particular, we show that the quantum hair of a critical condensateis strikingly similar to the quantum hair of a black hole. irrespectivelywhether one takes the similarity between the two systems as a remarkablecoincidence or as a sign of a deeper underlying connection, the following isevident. black holes are not unique in their way of quantum informationprocessing and we can manufacture black hole based quantum computers in labs bytaking advantage of quantum criticality.
