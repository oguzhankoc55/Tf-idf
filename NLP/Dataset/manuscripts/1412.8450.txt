massles multi gravity: covariant, stable, two-derivative interacting  massless multi-graviton theories we present a general model of interacting metric fields with the sum ofmassless non-interacting spin 2 fields as the linear limit. in thenon-interacting limit the model is reduced to a sum of general relativityactions, with the usual einstein-hilbert kinetic term for each metric field.until now the accepted view was that such theories are inconsistent since ithas been proven that ghost terms and/or discontinuity in the number of degreesof freedom at the zero interaction limit, are unavoidable. we do not refutethese results, but instead prove by construction that they do not necessarilylead to inconsistencies. in particular, our suggested theories are: 1.energetically stable, i.e. their hamiltonian is bounded from below and themulti-minkowski metric configuration is the unique ground state. 2. continuousin the zero interaction limit so that general relativity solutions are restoredsmoothly. 3. include no higher than two derivative lagrangian terms. inaddition, the dominant energy condition is maintained with respect to allmetric fields for all field configurations.
