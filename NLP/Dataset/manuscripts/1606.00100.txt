superradiant (in)stability of $d$-dimensional  reissner-nordstr\"{o}m-anti-de sitter black hole mirror system gaining insight into the behavior of a perturbed black hole surrounded by areflecting mirror in asymptotically anti-de sitter space-time is of greatinterest for current fundamental and practical research. in this paper, adetailed analysis for superradiant stability of the system composed by a$d$-dimensional reissner-nordstr\"{o}m-anti-de sitter (rn-ads) black hole and areflecting mirror under charged scalar perturbations are presented in thelinear regime. it is found that the stability of the system is heavily affectedby the mirror radius as well as the mass of the scalar perturbation, ads radiusand the dimension of space-time. in a higher dimensional space-time, the degreeof instability of the superradiant modes will be severely weakened.nevertheless, the degree of instability can be magnified significantly bychoosing a suitable value of the mirror radius. remarkably, when the mirrorradius is smaller than a threshold value the system becomes stable. we alsofind that massive charged scalar fields cannot trigger the instabilities in thebackground of $d$-dimensional asymptotically flat rn black hole. for a givenscalar charge, a small rn-ads black hole can be superradiantly unstable, whilea large one may be always stable under charged scalar field with or without areflecting mirror. we show that these results can be easily expounded andunderstood with the help of factorized potential analysis.
