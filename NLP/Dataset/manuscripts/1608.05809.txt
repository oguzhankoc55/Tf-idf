metric measure space as a framework for gravitation in this manuscript, we show how conformal invariance can be incorporated in aclassical theory of gravitation, in the context of metric measure space. metricmeasure space involves a geometrical scalar $f$, dubbed as density function,which here appears as a conformal degree of freedom. in this framework, wepresent conformally invariant field equations, the relevant identities andgeodesic equations. in metric measure space, the volume element and accordinglythe operators with integral based definitions are modified. for instance, thedivergence operator in this space differs from the riemannian one. as a result,a gravitational theory formulated in this space has a generalized secondbianchi identity and a generalized conservation of energy-momentum tensor. itis shown how, by using the generalized identity for conservation ofenergy-momentum tensor, one can obtain a conformally invariant geodesicequation. by comparison of the geodesic equations in metric measure space withthe bohmian trajectories, in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, arelation between density function $f$ and the quantum potential is proposed.this suggests metric measure space to be considered as a suitable framework forgeometric description of bohm's quantum mechanics. on the other hand, as it isknown, weyl geometry is one of the main approaches to construct conformallyinvariant gravitational models. regarding the fact that the connection in theintegrable weyl space is modified and in metric measure space remains the sameas it is in the riemann space, the mathematical analogy between these twospaces is also discussed.
