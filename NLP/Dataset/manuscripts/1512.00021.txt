recent developments in bimetric theory this review is dedicated to recent progress in the field of classical,interacting, massive spin-2 theories, with a focus on ghost-free bimetrictheory. we will outline its history and its development as a nontrivialextension and generalisation of nonlinear massive gravity. we present adetailed discussion of the consistency proofs of both theories, before wereview einstein solutions to the bimetric equations of motion in vacuum as wellas the resulting mass spectrum. we introduce couplings to matter and thendiscuss the general relativity and massive gravity limits of bimetric theory,which correspond to decoupling the massive or the massless spin-2 field fromthe matter sector, respectively. more general classical solutions are reviewedand the present status of bimetric cosmology is summarised. an interestingcorner in the bimetric parameter space which could potentially give rise to anonlinear theory for partially massless spin-2 fields is also discussed.relations to higher-curvature theories of gravity are explained and finally wegive an overview of possible extensions of the theory and review itsformulation in terms of vielbeins.
