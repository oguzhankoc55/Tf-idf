a study of positive energy condition in bianchi v spacetimes via noether  symmetries in this paper we use noether symmetries of the geodesic lagrangian in bianchiv spacetimes to study various cosmological solutions of einstein's fieldequations. our first result is the identification of the subalgebras of noethersymmetries of the equations of motions in such spacetimes with dimension 4, 5,6, 7, 9 or 10 of the maximal algebra of lie point symmetries of dimension 13.secondly we give physical interpretation of new cosmological solutions whichsatisfy positive energy condition and yield critical bounds on the expansioncoefficient $\alpha$, in which the underlying non-flat spacetimes carryinteresting physical properties. specifically the energy density behaves in oneof the following ways. (i) it is positive and constant for all time. (ii) itvaries with time and attains a global maximum after some time and thenasymptotically converges to zero. (iii) it increases for all time and attains amaximum value at the asymptotic limit $t\rightarrow \infty$. in particular anon-flat spacetime is obtained that mimics the expansion in a flat frw universedominated by vacuum energy such that the expansion factor has the same form inboth. however, the energy density is dynamical in the former.
