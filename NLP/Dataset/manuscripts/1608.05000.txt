hairy lovelock black holes and stueckelberg mechanism for weyl symmetry lovelock theory of gravity -and, in particular, einstein theory- admits blackhole solutions that can be equipped with a hair by conformally coupling thetheory to a real scalar field. this is a secondary hair, meaning that it doesnot endow the black hole with new quantum numbers. it rather consists of anon-trivial scalar field profile of fixed intensity which turns out to beregular everywhere outside and on the horizon and, provided the cosmologicalconstant is negative, behaves at large distance in a way compatible with theanti-de sitter (ads) asymptotic. in this paper, we review the main features ofthese hairy black hole solutions, such as their geometrical and thermodynamicalproperties. the conformal coupling to matter in dimension $d&gt;4$ in principleincludes higher-curvature terms. these couplings are obtained from the lovelockaction through the stueckelberg strategy. as a consequence, the resultingscalar-tensor theory exhibits a self-duality under field redefinition thatresembles t-duality. through this field redefinition, the matter content of thetheory transforms into a lovelock action for a dual geometry. since the hairyblack holes only exist for special relations between the dual lovelock couplingconstants, it is natural to compare those relations with the causality boundscoming from ads/cft. we observe that, while the lower causality bound is alwaysobeyed, the upper causality bound is violated. the latter, however, issaturated in the large $d$ limit.
