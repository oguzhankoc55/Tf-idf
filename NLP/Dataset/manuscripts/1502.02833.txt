on the initial singularity problem in rainbow cosmology it has been recently claimed that the initial singularity might be avoided inthe context of rainbow cosmology, where one attempts to account forquantum-gravitational corrections through an effective-theory description basedon an energy-dependent ("rainbow") space-time metric. we here scrutinize thisexciting hypothesis much more in depth than previous analyses. in particular,we take into account all requirements for singularity avoidance, whilepreviously only a subset of these requirements had been considered. moreover,we show that the implications of a rainbow metric for thermodynamics are moresignificant than previously appreciated. through the analysis of twoparticularly meaningful examples of rainbow metrics we find that our concernsare not merely important conceptually, but actually change in quantitativelysignificant manner the outcome of the analysis. notably we only find exampleswhere the singularity is not avoided, though one can have that in the regimewhere our semi-classical picture is still reliable the approach to thesingularity is slowed down when compared to the standard classical scenario. weconclude that the study of rainbow metrics provides tantalizing hints ofsingularity avoidance but is inconclusive, since some key questions remain tobe addressed just when the scale factor is very small, a regime which, as hereargued, cannot be reliably described by an effective rainbow-metric picture.
