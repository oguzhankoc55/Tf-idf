satellite test of the equivalence principle as a probe of modified  newtonian dynamics the proposed satellite test of the equivalence principle (step) will detectpossible violations of the weak equivalence principle by measuring relativeaccelerations between test masses of different composition with a precision ofone part in $10^{18}$. a serendipitous byproduct of the experimental design isthat the absolute (common-mode) acceleration of the test masses is alsomeasured to high precision as they oscillate along a common axis under theinfluence of restoring forces produced by the position sensor currents, whichin drag-free mode lead to newtonian accelerations as small as $10^{-14}$ g.this is deep inside the low-acceleration regime where modified newtoniandynamics (mond) diverges strongly from the newtonian limit of generalrelativity. we show that mond theories (including those based on thewidely-used $n$-family of interpolating functions as well as the covarianttensor-vector-scalar formulation) predict an easily detectable increase in thefrequency of oscillations of the step test masses if the strong equivalenceprinciple holds. if it does not hold, mond predicts a cumulative increase inoscillation amplitude which is also detectable. step thus provides a new andpotentially decisive test of newton's law of inertia, as well as theequivalence principle in both its strong and weak forms.
