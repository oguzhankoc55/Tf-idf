dependence of the black body force on spacetime geometry and topology in this manuscript we compute the corrections to the black body force due tospacetime geometry and topology. this recently discovered attractive force onneutral atoms is caused by the thermal radiation emitted from black bodies andhere we investigate it in systems with spherical and cylindrical symmetries.for some astrophysical objects we find that the corrected force is greater thanthe flat case, showing that this kind of correction can be quite relevant whencurved spaces are considered. then we consider four cases: the schwarzschildspacetime, the non-relativistic infinity cylinder, and both the static andstationary cosmic strings. for the spherically symmetric case we find that twocorrections appear: one due to the gravitational modification of thetemperature and the other due to the modification of the solid angle subtendedby the atom. we apply the found results to a typical neutron star and to thesun. for the cylindrical case, which is locally flat, no gravitationalcorrection to the temperature exists. however, we find the curious fact thatthe black body force depends on the topology of the spacetime through themodification of the azimuthal angle and therefore of the solid angle. for thestatic cosmic string we find that the force is null for zero thickness case.for the stationary one, we find that the force is non-null even for the thincase.
