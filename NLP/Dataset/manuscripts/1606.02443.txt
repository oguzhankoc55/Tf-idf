gravitational memory charges of supertranslation and superrotation on  rindler horizons in a rindler-type coordinate system spanned in a region outside of a blackhole horizon, we have nonvanishing classical holographic charges as soft hairson the horizon for stationary black holes. taking a large black hole masslimit, the spacetimes with the charges are described by asymptotic rindlermetrics. we construct a general theory of gravitational holographic charges fora 1+3-dimensional linearized gravity field in the minkowski background withrindler horizons. although matter crossing a rindler horizon causes horizondeformation and a time-dependent coordinate shift, that is, gravitationalmemory, the supertranslation and superrotation charges on the horizon can bedefined during and after its passage through the horizon. it is generallyproven that holographic states on the horizon cannot store any informationabout absorbed perturbative gravitational waves. however, matter crossing thehorizon really excites holographic states. by using gravitational memoryoperators, which consist of the holographic charge operators, we suggest aresolution of the no-cloning paradox of quantum information between matterfalling into the horizon and holographic charges on the horizon from theviewpoint of the contextuality of quantum measurement.
