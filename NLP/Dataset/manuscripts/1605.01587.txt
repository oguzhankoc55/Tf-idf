angular momentum-free of the entropy relations for rotating kaluza-klein  black holes based on a mathematical lemma related to the vandermonde determinant and twotheorems derived from the first law of black hole thermodynamics, weinvestigate the angular momentum independence of the entropy sum as well as theentropy product of general rotating kaluza-klein black holes in higherdimensions. we show that for both non-charged rotating kaluza-klein black holesand non-charged rotating kaluza-klein-ads black holes, the angular momentum ofthe black holes will not be present in entropy sum relation in dimensions$d\geq4$, while the independence of angular momentum of the entropy productholds provided that the black holes possess at least one zero rotationparameter $a_j$ = 0 in higher dimensions $d\geq5$, which means that thecosmological constant does not affect the angular momentum-free property ofentropy sum and entropy product under the circumstances that charge $\delta=0$.for the reason that the entropy relations of charged rotating kaluza-kleinblack holes as well as the non-charged rotating kaluza-klein black holes inasymptotically flat spacetime act the same way, it is found that the charge hasno effect in the angular momentum-independence of entropy sum and product inasymptotically flat spactime.
