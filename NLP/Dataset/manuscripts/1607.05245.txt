nonlinear dynamics from the relativistic boltzmann equation in the  friedmann-lema\^itre-robertson-walker spacetime the dissipative dynamics of an expanding massless gas with constant crosssection in a spatially flat friedmann-lema\^itre-robertson-walker (flrw)universe is studied. the mathematical problem of solving the full nonlinearrelativistic boltzmann equation is recast into an infinite set of nonlinearordinary differential equations for the moments of the one-particledistribution function. momentum-space resolution is determined by the number ofnon-hydrodynamic modes included in the moment hierarchy, i.e., by thetruncation order. we show that in the flrw spacetime the non-hydrodynamic modesdecouple completely from the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. this results inthe system flowing as an ideal fluid while at the same time producing entropy.the solutions to the nonlinear boltzmann equation exhibit transient tails ofthe distribution function with nontrivial momentum dependence. the evolution ofthis tail is not correctly captured by the relaxation time approximation nor bythe linearized boltzmann equation. however, the latter probes additionalhigh-momentum details unresolved by the relaxation time approximation. whilethe expansion of the flrw spacetime is slow enough for the system to movetowards (and not away from) local thermal equilibrium, it is not sufficientlyslow for the system to actually ever reach complete local equilibrium.equilibration is fastest in the relaxation time approximation, followed, inturn, by kinetic evolution with a linearized and a fully nonlinear boltzmanncollision term.
