accuracy in measuring the neutron star mass in gravitational wave  parameter estimation for black hole-neutron star binaries recently, two gravitational wave (gw) signals, named as gw150914 andgw151226, have been detected by the two ligo detectors. although both signalswere identified as originating from merging black hole (bh) binaries, gws fromsystems containing neutron stars (nss) are also expected to be detected in thenear future by the advanced detector network. in this work, we assess theaccuracy in measuring the ns mass ($m_{ns}$) for the gws from bh-ns binariesadopting the advanced ligo sensitivity with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. byusing the fisher matrix method, we calculate the measurement errors ($\sigma$)in $m_{ns}$ assuming the ns mass of $1 \leq m_{ns}/m_{\odot} \leq 2$ and lowmass bhs with the range of $4 \leq m_{bh}/m_{\odot} \leq 10$. we used thetaylorf2 waveform model where the spins are aligned with the orbital angularmomentum, but here we only consider the bh spins. we find that the fractionalerrors ($\sigma/m_{ns} \times 100$) are in the range of $10\% - 50\%$ in ourmass region for a given dimensionless bh spin as $\chi_{bh} = 0$. the errorstend to increase as the bh spin increases, and this tendency is stronger forhigher ns masses (or higher total masses). in particular, for the highest massnss ($m_{ns}=2~m_{\odot}$), the errors $\sigma$ can be larger than the truevalue of $m_{ns}$ if the dimensionless bh spin exceeds $\sim 0.6$.
