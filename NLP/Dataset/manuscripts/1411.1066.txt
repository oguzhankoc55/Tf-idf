supergravity backgrounds for deformations of ads_n x s^n supercoset  string models we consider type iib supergravity backgrounds corresponding to the deformedads_n x s^n supercoset string models of the type constructed in arxiv:1309.5850which depend on one deformation parameter \k. in ads_2 x s^2 case we find thatthe deformed metric can be extended to a full supergravity solution withnon-trivial dilaton, rr scalar and rr 5-form strength. the solution depends ona free parameter (called a) that should be chosen as a particular function of\k to correspond to the deformed supercoset model. in ads_3 x s^3 case the fullsolution supported by the dilaton, rr scalar and rr 3-form strength exists onlyin the two special cases of a=0 and a=1. we conjecture that there may be a moregeneral one-parameter solution supported by several rr fields that forparticular a=a(\k) corresponds to the supercoset model. in the most complicateddeformed ads_5 x s^5 case we were able to find only the expressions for thedilaton and the rr scalar. the full solution is likely to be supported by acombination of the 5-form and 3-form rr field strengths. we comment on thesingularity structure of the resulting metric and exact dilaton field.
