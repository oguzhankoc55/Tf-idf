exponential fading to white of black holes in quantum gravity quantization of the gravitational field could allow the existence of ahypothetical decay channel of black holes into white holes with an explicittime-reversal symmetry. the definition of a meaningful decay probability forthis channel is studied in spherically symmetric situations. as a firstnontrivial calculation, we present the functional integration over a set ofgeometries using a single-variable function to interpolate between black-holeand white-hole geometries in a bounded region of spacetime. this computationgives a finite result which depends only on the schwarzschild mass and aparameter measuring the width of the interpolating region. the associatedprobability distribution displays an exponential decay law on the latterparameter, with a mean lifetime inversely proportional to the schwarzschildmass. in physical terms this would imply that matter collapsing to a black holefrom a finite radius bounces back elastically and instantaneously, withnegligible time delay as measured by external observers. this picture invitesto reconsider the ultimate nature of astrophysical black holes and suggeststhat quantum gravity effects might show up in upcoming observations ofgravitational waves.
