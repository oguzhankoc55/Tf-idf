quantum corrections to the mukhanov-sasaki equations recently, a lot of attention has been paid to the modifications of the powerspectrum of primordial fluctuations caused by quantum cosmology effects. theorigin of these modifications are corrections to the mukhanov-sasaki equationsthat govern the propagation of the primeval cosmological perturbations. thespecific form of these corrections depends on a series of details of thequantization approach and of the prescription followed to implement it.generally, nonetheless, the complexity of the theoretical quantum formulationis simplified in practice appealing to a semiclassical or effectiveapproximation, in order to perform concrete numerical computations. in thiswork, we introduce technical tools and design a procedure to deal with thesequantum corrections beyond the most direct approximations employed so far inthe literature. in particular, by introducing an interaction picture, weextract the quantum dynamics of the homogeneous geometry in absence of scalarfield potential and inhomogeneities, dynamics that has been intensively studiedand that can be integrated. the rest of our analysis focuses on the interactionevolution, putting forward methods to cope with it. the ultimate aim is todevelop treatments that increase our ability to discriminate between thepredictions of different quantization proposals for cosmological perturbations.
