the nonlinear field space theory in recent years the idea that not only the configuration space of particles,i.e. spacetime, but also the corresponding momentum space may have nontrivialgeometry has attracted significant attention, especially in the context ofquantum gravity. the aim of this letter is to extend this concept to the domainof field theories, by introducing field spaces (i.e. phase spaces of fieldvalues) that are not affine spaces. after discussing the motivation and generalaspects of our approach we present a detailed analysis of the prototype(quantum) nonlinear field space theory of a scalar field on the minkowskibackground. we show that the nonlinear structure of a field space leads tonumerous interesting predictions, including: non-locality, generalization ofthe uncertainty relations, algebra deformations, constraining of the maximaloccupation number, shifting of the vacuum energy and renormalization of thecharge and speed of propagation of field excitations. furthermore, a compactfield space is a natural way to implement the "principle of finiteness" ofphysical theories, which once motivated the born-infeld theory. thus thepresented framework has a variety of potential applications in the theories offundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity), as well as in condensed matterphysics (e.g. continuous spin chains), and can shed new light on the issue ofdivergences in quantum field theories.
