non-minimally coupled dark fluid in schwarzschild spacetime if one assumes a particular form of non-minimal coupling, called theconformal coupling, of a perfect fluid with gravity in the fluid-gravitylagrangian then one gets modified einstein field equation. in the modifiedeinstein equation, the effect of the non-minimal coupling does not vanish ifone works with spacetimes for which the ricci scalar vanishes. in the presentwork we use the schwarzschild metric in the modified einstein equation, inpresence of non-minimal coupling with a fluid, and find out the energy-densityand pressure of the fluid. in the present case the perfect fluid is part of thesolution of the modified einstein equation. we also solve the modified einsteinequation, using the flat spacetime metric and show that in presence ofnon-minimal coupling one can accommodate a perfect fluid of uniformenergy-density and pressure in the flat spacetime. in both the cases the fluidpressure turns out to be negative. except these non-trivial solutions it mustbe noted that the vacuum solutions also remain as trivial valid solutions ofthe modified einstein equation in presence of non-minimal coupling.
