field dynamics on the trapping horizon in vaidya spacetime in this article, we shed some light on the field theoretic aspect of ageneric {\it trapping horizon}(th) with a view to probe beyond the chern-simonsinterpretation of an equilibrium th, namely {\it isolated horizon}(ih) in thegauge theoretic formulation of gravity. after having dealt with the fieldequations on a generic th, finally we examine those equations for the th invaidya spacetime. it is manifest that the nature of evolution of cross-sectionsof a th depends on the association of matter. most interestingly, we find thatthe pullback of the field equations to a cross-section of the th in vaidyaspacetime is identical to that of an ih which is an indication that thedynamical quantum states of a th may be constructed by implementing quantummechanical perturbation theory to that of a quantum ih. this is a small butimportant clue for finding a way to quantize a generic th , which in turn, willgive us a new perspective, from a field theoretic point of view, about thedynamics of the horizon geometry resulting from the back reaction of hawkingradiation.
