vacuum type d initial data a vacuum type d initial data set is a vacuum initial data set of the einsteinfield equations whose data development cointains a region where the space-timeis of petrov type d. in this paper we give a {\em systematic} characterisationof a vacuum type d initial data set. by systematic we mean that the onlyquantities involved are those appearing in the vacuum constraints, namely thefirst fundamental form (riemannian metric) and the second fundamental form. ourcharacterisation is a set of conditions consisting of the vacuum constraintsand some additional differential equations for the first and second fundamentalforms. these conditions can be regarded as a system of partial differentialequations on a riemannian manifold and the solutions of the system contain allpossible {\em regular} vacuum type d initial data sets. as an application weparticularise our conditions for the case of vacuum data whose data developmentis a subset of the kerr solution. this has applications in the formulation ofthe non-linear stability problem of the kerr black hole.
