gravitational radiation from massless particle collisions we compute classical gravitational bremsstrahlung from the gravitationalscattering of two massless particles at leading order in the (center of mass)deflection angle $\theta\sim 4 g \sqrt{s}/b = 8 g e/b \ll 1$. the calculation,although non-perturbative in the gravitational constant, is surprisingly simpleand yields explicit formulae --in terms of multidimensional integrals-- for thefrequency and angular distribution of the radiation. in the range $ b^{-1} &lt;\omega &lt; (ge)^{-1}$, the gw spectrum behaves like $ \log (1/ge\omega) d\omega$, is confined to cones of angular sizes (around the deflected particletrajectories) ranging from $o(\theta)$ to $o(1/\omega b)$, and exactlyreproduces, at its lower end, a well-known zero-frequency limit.  at $\omega &gt; (ge)^{-1}$ the radiation is confined to cones of angular size oforder $\theta (ge\omega)^{-1/2}$ resulting in a scale-invariant($d\omega/\omega$) spectrum. the total efficiency in gw production is dominatedby this "high frequency" region and is formally logarithmically divergent inthe uv. if the spectrum is cutoff at the limit of validity of ourapproximations (where a conjectured bound on gw power is also saturated), thefraction of incoming energy radiated away turns out to be $\frac{1}{2 \pi}\theta ^2 \log \theta^{-2}$ at leading logarithmic accuracy.
