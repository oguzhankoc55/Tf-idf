information retrieval from black holes it is generally believed that, when matter collapses to form a black hole,the complete information about the initial state of the matter cannot beretrieved by future asymptotic observers, through local measurements. this iscontrary to the expectation from a unitary evolution in quantum theory andleads to (a version of) the black hole information paradox. classically,nothing else, apart from mass, charge and angular momentum is expected to berevealed to such asymptotic observers after the formation of a black hole.semi-classically, black holes evaporate after their formation through thehawking radiation. the dominant part of the radiation is expected to be thermaland hence one cannot know anything about the initial data from the resultantradiation. however, there can be sources of distortions which make theradiation non-thermal. although the distortions are not strong enough to makethe evolution unitary, these distortions carry some part of informationregarding the in-state. in this work, we show how one can decipher theinformation about the in-state of the field from these distortions. we showthat the distortions of a particular kind --- which we call {\it non-vacuumdistortions} --- can be used to \emph{fully} reconstruct the initial data. theasymptotic observer can do this operationally by measuring certain well-definedobservables of the quantum field at late times. we demonstrate that a generalclass of in-states encode all their information content in the correlation oflate time out-going modes. further, using a $1+1$ dimensional cghs model toaccommodate back-reaction self-consistently, we show that observers can alsoinfer and track the information content about the initial data, during thecourse of evaporation, unambiguously. implications of such informationextraction are discussed.
