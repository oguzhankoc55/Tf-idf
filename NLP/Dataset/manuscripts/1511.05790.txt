nonadiabatic bounce and an inflationary phase in the quantum mixmaster  universe following our previous paper, bergeron et al, smooth quantum dynamics of themixmaster universe, phys. rev. d 92, 061302(r) (2015), concerning thequantization of the vacuum bianchi ix model and the born-huang-oppenheimerframework, we present a further analysis of the dynamical properties of themodel. consistently with the deep quantum regime, we implement the harmonicapproximation of the anisotropy potential. we thus obtain manageable dynamicalequations. we study the quantum anisotropic oscillations during the bouncingphase of the universe. neglecting the backreaction from transitions betweenquantum anisotropy states we obtain analytical results. in particular, weidentify a parameter which is associated with dynamical properties of thequantum model and describes a sort of phase transition. once the parameterexceeds its critical value, the born-huang-oppenheimer approximation breaksdown. the application of the present result to a simple model of the universeindicates that the parameter indeed exceeds its critical value and that theretakes place a huge production of anisotropy at the bounce. this in turn mustlead to a sustained phase of accelerated expansion, an inflationary phase. thequantitative inclusion of backreaction shall be examined in a follow-up paperbased on the vibronic approach.
