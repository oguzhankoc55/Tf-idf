on the uv dimensions of loop quantum gravity planck-scale dynamical dimensional reduction is attracting more and moreinterest in the quantum-gravity literature since it seems to be a modelindependent effect. however different studies base their results on differentconcepts of spacetime dimensionality. most of them rely on the\textit{spectral} dimension, others refer to the \textit{hausdorff} dimensionand, very recently, it has been introduced also the \textit{thermal} dimension.we here show that all these distinct definitions of dimension give the sameoutcome in the case of the effective regime of loop quantum gravity (lqg). thisis achieved by deriving a modified dispersion relation from thehypersurface-deformation algebra with quantum corrections. moreover we alsoobserve that the number of uv dimensions can be used to constrain theambiguities in the choice of these lqg-based modifications of the diracspacetime algebra. in this regard, introducing the \textit{polymerization} ofconnections i.e. $k \rightarrow \frac{\sin(\delta k)}{\delta}$, we find thatthe leading quantum correction gives $d_{uv} = 2.5$. this result may indicatethat the running to the expected value of two dimensions is ongoing, but it hasnot been completed yet. finding $d_{uv}$ at ultra-short distances would requireto go beyond the effective approach we here present.
