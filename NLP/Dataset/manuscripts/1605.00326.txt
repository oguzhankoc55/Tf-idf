brans-dicke galileon and the variational principle this paper is aimed at a (mostly) pedagogical exposition of the derivation ofthe motion equations of certain modifications of general relativity. here wederive in all detail the motion equations in the brans-dicke theory with thecubic self-interaction. this is a modification of the brans-dicke theory by theaddition of a term in the lagrangian which is non-linear in the derivatives ofthe scalar field: it contains second-order derivatives. this is the basis ofthe so-called brans-dicke galileon. we pay special attention to the variationalprinciple and to the algebraic details of the derivation. it is shown howhigher order derivatives of the fields appearing in the intermediatecomputations cancel out leading to second order motion equations. the readerwill find useful tips for the derivation of the field equations ofmodifications of general relativity such as the scalar-tensor theories and$f(r)$ theories, by means of the (stationary action) variational principle. thecontent of this paper is specially recommended to those graduate andpostgraduate students who are interested in the study of the mentionedmodifications of general relativity.
