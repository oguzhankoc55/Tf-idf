a parametrix for quantum gravity? in the sixties, dewitt discovered that the advanced and retarded greenfunctions of the wave operator on metric perturbations in the de donder gaugemake it possible to define classical poisson brackets on the space offunctionals that are invariant under the action of the full diffeomorphismgroup of spacetime. he therefore tried to exploit this property to defineinvariant commutators for the quantized gravitational field, but the operatorcounterpart of such classical poisson brackets turned out to be a hard task. onthe other hand, the mathematical literature studies often an approximateinverse, the parametrix, which is, strictly, a distribution. we here suggestthat such a construction might be exploited in canonical quantum gravity. webegin with the simplest case, i.e. fundamental solution and parametrix for thelinear, scalar wave operator; the next step are tensor wave equations, againfor linear theory, e.g. maxwell theory in curved spacetime. last, the nonlineareinstein equations are studied, relying upon the well-establishedchoquet-bruhat construction, according to which the fifth derivatives ofsolutions of a nonlinear hyperbolic system solve a linear hyperbolic system.the latter is solved by means of kirchhoff-type formulas, while the formerfifth-order equations can be solved by means of well-established parametrixtechniques for elliptic operators. but then the metric components that solvethe vacuum einstein equations can be obtained by convolution of such aparametrix with kirchhoff-type formulas. some basic functional equations forthe parametrix are also obtained, that help in studying classical and quantumversion of the jacobi identity.
