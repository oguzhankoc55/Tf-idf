way-out to the gravitino problem in intersecting d-brane pati-salam  models we discuss the gravitino problem in contest of the exotic see-saw mechanismfor neutrinos and leptogenesis, uv completed by intersecting d-branespati-salam models. in the exotic see-saw model, supersymmetry is broken at highscales $m_{susy}&gt;10^{9}\, \rm gev$ and this seems in contradiction withgravitino bounds from inflation and baryogenesis. however, if gravitino is thelightest stable supersymmetric particle, it will not decay into other susyparticles, avoiding the gravitino problem and providing a good cold darkmatter. gravitini are super heavy dark particles and they can be produced bynon-adiabatic expansion during inflation. intriguingly, from bounds on thecorrect abundance of dark matter, we also constrain the neutrino sector. we seta limit on the exotic instantonic coupling of $&lt;10^{-2}\div 10^{-3}$. this alsosets important constrains on the calabi-yau compactifications and on the stringscale. this model strongly motivates very high energy dm indirect detection ofneutrini and photons of $10^{11}\div 10^{13}\, \rm gev$: gravitini can decay onthem in a cosmological time because of soft r-parity breaking effectiveoperators.
