a toy model of black hole complementarity we consider the algebra of simple operators defined in a time band in a cftwith a holographic dual. when the band is smaller than the light crossing timeof ads, an entire causal diamond in the center of ads is separated from theband by a horizon. we show that this algebra obeys a version of thereeh-schlieder theorem: the action of the algebra on the cft vacuum canapproximate any low energy state in the cft arbitrarily well, but no operatorwithin the algebra can exactly annihilate the vacuum. we show how to relatelocal excitations in the complement of the central diamond to simple operatorsin the band. local excitations within the diamond are invisible to the algebraof simple operators in the band by causality, but can be related to complicatedoperators called "precursors". we use the reeh-schlieder theorem to write downa simple and explicit formula for these precursors on the boundary. we commenton the implications of our results for black hole complementarity and theemergence of bulk locality from the boundary.
