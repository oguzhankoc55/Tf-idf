black hole entropy predictions without the immirzi parameter and hawking  radiation of a single-partition black hole by pointing out an error in the previous derivation of the area spectrumbased on ashtekar's variables, we suggest a new area spectrum; instead of thenorm of ashtekar's gravitational electric field, we show that the norm of our"new" gravitational electric field based on our "newer" variables, which weconstruct in this paper for this purpose, gives the correct area spectrum. inparticular, our "newer" variables are mathematically consistent; the constraintalgebra is closed. moreover, by using our new area spectrum, we "almostcorrectly" predict the bekenstein-hawking entropy without having to adjust theimmirzi parameter; we show that a numerical formula actually yielded$0.997\cdots$, which is very close to 1, the expected value with the black holeentropy given as $a/4$. we conjecture that the difference, 0.003, is due to theextra dimensions that may modify the area spectrum. then, we derive a formulafor the degeneracy for a single-partition black hole, i.e., a black hole madeof a single unit area, and explicitly show that our area spectrum correctlyreproduces the degeneracy. furthermore, by using two totally different methods,we obtain the proportionality constant "$c$" related to the degeneracy. thefirst method based on fitting yields 172$\sim$173 while the second methodyields 172.87$\cdots$, which strongly suggest that our area spectrum is on theright track. we also show that the area spectra based on ashtekar variablesneither reproduce the degeneracy of single-partition black hole nor yieldagreement for $c$ obtained by using the two methods.
