cosmological singularity theorems for $f(r)$ gravity theories in the present work some generalizations of the hawking singularity theoremsin the context of $f(r)$ theories are presented. the assumptions are of thesegeneralized theorems is that the matter fields satisfy the conditions$\bigg(t_{ij}-\frac{g_{ij}}{2} t\bigg)k^i k^j\geq 0$ for any generic unit timelike field, that the scalaron takes bounded positive values during itsevolution, and that the resulting space time is globally hyperbolic. then, ifthere exist a cauchy hyper surface $\sigma$ for which the expansion parameter$\theta$ of the geodesic congruence emanating orthogonally from $\sigma$satisfies some specific conditions, it may be shown that the resulting spacetime is geodesically incomplete. some mathematical results of reference\cite{fewster} are very important for proving this. the generalized theoremspresented here apply directly some specific models such as the hu-sawicki orstarobinsky ones \cite{especif3}, \cite{capoziello4}. however, for otherscenarios, some extra assumptions should be implemented for the geodesicincompleteness to take place. however, the negation of the hypothesis of theseresults does not necessarily imply that a singularity is absent, but that othermathematical results should be considered to prove that.
