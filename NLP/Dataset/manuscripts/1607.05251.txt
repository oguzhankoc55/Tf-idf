the emergence of gravitational wave science: 100 years of development of  mathematical theory, detectors, numerical algorithms, and data analysis tools on september 14, 2015, the newly upgraded laser interferometergravitational-wave observatory (ligo) recorded a loud gravitational-wave (gw)signal, emitted a billion light-years away by a coalescing binary of twostellar-mass black holes. the detection was announced in february 2016, in timefor the hundredth anniversary of einstein's prediction of gws within the theoryof general relativity (gr). the signal represents the first direct detection ofgws, the first observation of a black-hole binary, and the first test of gr inits strong-field, high-velocity, nonlinear regime. in the remainder of itsfirst observing run, ligo observed two more signals from black-hole binaries,one moderately loud, another at the boundary of statistical significance. thedetections mark the end of a decades-long quest, and the beginning of gwastronomy: finally, we are able to probe the unseen, electromagnetically darkuniverse by listening to it. in this article, we present a short historicaloverview of gw science: this young discipline combines gr, arguably thecrowning achievement of classical physics, with record-setting, ultra-low-noiselaser interferometry, and with some of the most powerful developments in thetheory of differential geometry, partial differential equations,high-performance computation, numerical analysis, signal processing,statistical inference, and data science. our emphasis is on the synergy betweenthese disciplines, and how mathematics, broadly understood, has historicallyplayed, and continues to play, a crucial role in the development of gw science.we focus on black holes, which are very pure mathematical solutions ofeinstein's gravitational-field equations that are nevertheless realized innature, and that provided the first observed signals.
