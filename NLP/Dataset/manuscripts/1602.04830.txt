the klein-gordon-fock equation in the curved spacetime of the  kerr-newman (anti) de sitter black hole exact solutions of the klein-gordon-fock (kgf) general relativistic equationthat describe the dynamics of a massive, electrically charged scalar particlein the curved spacetime geometry of a charged, rotating kerr-newman-(anti) desitter black hole are investigated. in the general case of a rotating, charged,cosmological black hole the solution of the kgf equation with the method ofseparation of variables results in fuchsian differential equations for theradial and angular parts which contain more than three finite singularities andthereby generalise the heun differential equations. for particular values ofthe physical parameters (i.e mass of the scalar particle) these fuchsianequations reduce to heun equations and the solutions are expressed in terms ofheun functions. for other values of the parameters some of the extra singularpoints are false singular points. we derive the conditions on the coefficientsof the generalised fuchsian equation such that a singular point is a falsepoint. in such a case the exact solution of the fuchsian equation can inprinciple be simplified and expressed in terms of heun functions. we alsoderive the exact solutions of the radial and angular equations for a massivescalar (charged) particle in the kerr-newman spacetime. the analytic solutionsare expressed in terms of confluent heun functions. moreover, we derived theconstraints on the parameters of the theory such that the solution simplifiesand expressed in terms of confluent kummer hypergeometric functions. startingfrom the equation obeyed by the derivative, we construct several expansions ofthe solutions of the heun equation in terms of generalised hypergeometricfunctions of lauricella-appell.
