puncture initial data for black-hole binaries with high spins and high  boosts we solve the hamiltonian and momentum constraints of general relativity fortwo black-holes with nearly extremal spins and relativistic boosts in thepuncture formalism. we use a non-conformally-flat ansatz with an attenuatedsuperposition of two lorentz-boosted, conformally-kerr orconformally-schwarzschild 3-metrics and their corresponding extrinsiccurvatures. we compare evolutions of these data with the standard bowen-yorkconformally-flat ansatz (technically limited to intrinsic spins$\chi=s/m^2_{\text{adm}}=0.928$ and boosts $p/m_{\text{adm}}=0.897$), finding,typically, an order of magnitude smaller burst of spurious radiation andagreement with inspiral and merger. as a first case study, we evolve twoequal-mass black-holes from rest with an initial separation of $d=12m$ andspins $\chi_i=s_i/m_i^2=0.99$, compute the waveforms produced by the collision,the energy and angular momentum radiated, and the recoil of the final remnantblack-hole. we find that the black-hole trajectories curve at closeseparations, leading to the radiation of angular momentum. we also studyorbiting non-spinning and moderate-spin black-hole binaries and compare thesewith standard bowen-york data. we find a substantial reduction in thenon-physical initial burst of radiation which leads to cleaner waveforms.finally, we study the case of orbiting binary black hole systems with spinmagnitude $\chi_i=0.95$ in an aligned configuration and compare waveform andfinal remnant results with those of the sxs collaboration, finding excellentagreement. this represent the first moving puncture evolution of orbiting andspinning black holes exceeding the bowen-york limit. finally, we studydifferent choices of the initial lapse and lapse evolution equation in themoving puncture approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of thesimulations.
