dynamical behavior and jacobi stability analysis of wound strings we numerically solve the equations of motion (eom) for two models of circularcosmic string loops with windings in a simply connected internal space. sincethe windings cannot be topologically stabilized, stability must be achieved (ifat all) dynamically. as toy models for realistic compactifications, we considerwindings on a small section of $\mathbb{r}^2$, which is valid as anapproximation to any simply connected internal manifold if the winding radiusis sufficiently small, and windings on an $s^2$ of constant radius$\mathcal{r}$. we then use kosambi-cartan-chern (kcc) theory to analyze thejacobi stability of the string equations and determine bounds on the physicalparameters that ensure dynamical stability of the windings. we find that, forthe same initial conditions, the curvature and topology of the internal spacehave nontrivial effects on the microscopic behavior of the string in the higherdimensions, but that the macroscopic behavior is remarkably insensitive to thedetails of the motion in the compact space. this suggests thathigher-dimensional signatures may be extremely difficult to detect in theeffective $(3+1)$-dimensional dynamics of strings compactified on an internalspace, even if configurations with nontrivial windings persist over long timeperiods.
