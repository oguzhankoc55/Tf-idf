accuracy of binary black hole waveform models for aligned-spin binaries coalescing binary black holes are among the primary science targets forsecond generation ground-based gravitational wave (gw) detectors. reliable gwmodels are central to detection of such systems and subsequent parameterestimation. this paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy ofrecent waveform models for binary black holes with aligned spins, utilizing anew set of $84$ high-accuracy numerical relativity simulations. our analysiscovers comparable mass binaries ($1\le m_1/m_2\le 3$), and samplesindependently both black hole spins up to dimensionless spin-magnitude of $0.9$for equal-mass binaries and $0.85$ for unequal mass binaries. furthermore, wefocus on the high-mass regime (total mass $\gtrsim 50m_\odot$). the two mostrecent waveform models considered (phenomd and seobnrv2) both perform very wellfor signal detection, losing less than 0.5\% of the recoverable signal-to-noiseratio $\rho$, except that seobnrv2's efficiency drops mildly for both blackhole spins aligned with large magnitude. for parameter estimation, modelinginaccuracies of seobnrv2 are found to be smaller than systematic uncertaintiesfor moderately strong gw events up to roughly $\rho\lesssim 15$. phenomd'smodeling errors are found to be smaller than seobnrv2's, and are generallyirrelevant for $\rho\lesssim 20$. both models' accuracy deteriorates withincreased mass-ratio, and when at least one black hole spin is large andaligned. the seobnrv2 model shows a pronounced disagreement with the numericalrelativity simulation in the merger phase, for unequal masses andsimultaneously both black hole spins very large and aligned. two older waveformmodels (phenomc and seobnrv1) are found to be distinctly less accurate than themore recent phenomd and seobnrv2 models. finally, we quantify the bias expectedfrom all gw models during parameter estimation for recovery of binary's massesand spins.
