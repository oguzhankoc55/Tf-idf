an operational approach to spacetime symmetries: lorentz transformations  from quantum communication in most approaches to fundamental physics, spacetime symmetries arepostulated a priori and then explicitly implemented in the theory. thisincludes lorentz covariance in quantum field theory and diffeomorphisminvariance in quantum gravity, which are seen as fundamental principles towhich the final theory has to be adjusted. in this paper, we suggest, within amuch simpler setting, that this kind of reasoning can actually be reversed, bytaking an operational approach inspired by quantum information theory. weconsider observers in distinct laboratories, with local physics described bythe laws of abstract quantum theory, and without presupposing a particularspacetime structure. we ask what information-theoretic effort the observershave to spend to synchronize their descriptions of local physics. if there are"enough" observables that can be measured universally on several differentquantum systems, we show that the observers' descriptions are related by anelement of the orthochronous lorentz group o^+(3,1), together with a globalscaling factor. not only does this operational approach predict the lorentztransformations, but it also accurately describes the behavior of relativisticstern-gerlach devices in the wkb approximation, and it correctly predicts thatquantum systems carry lorentz group representations of different spin. thisresult thus hints at a novel information-theoretic perspective on spacetime.
