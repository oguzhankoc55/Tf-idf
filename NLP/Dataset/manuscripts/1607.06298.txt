solar system dynamics in general relativity recent work in the literature has advocated using the earth-moon-planetoidlagrangian points as observables, in order to test general relativity andeffective field theories of gravity in the solar system. however, since thethree-body problem of classical celestial mechanics is just an approximation ofa much more complicated setting, where all celestial bodies in the solar systemare subject to their mutual gravitational interactions, while solar radiationpressure and other sources of nongravitational perturbations also affect thedynamics, it is conceptually desirable to improve the current understanding ofsolar system dynamics in general relativity, as a first step towards a moreaccurate theoretical study of orbital motion in the weak-gravity regime. forthis purpose, starting from the einstein equations in the de donder-lanczosgauge, this paper arrives first at the levi-civita lagrangian for the geodesicmotion of celestial bodies, showing in detail under which conditions theeffects of internal structure and finite extension get cancelled in generalrelativity to first post-newtonian order. the resulting nonlinear ordinarydifferential equations for the motion of planets and satellites are solved forthe earth's orbit about the sun, written down in detail for the sun-earth-moonsystem, and investigated for the case of planar motion of a body immersed inthe gravitational field produced by the other bodies (e.g. planets with theirsatellites). at this stage, we prove an exact property, according to which thefourth-order time derivative of the original system leads to a linear system ofordinary differential equations. this opens an interesting perspective onforthcoming research on planetary motions in general relativity within thesolar system, although the resulting equations remain a challenge for numericaland qualitative studies.
