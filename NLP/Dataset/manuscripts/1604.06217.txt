single electron relativistic clock interferometer although time is one of the fundamental notions in physics, it does not havea unique description. in quantum theory time is a parameter ordering thesuccession of the probability amplitudes of a quantum system, while accordingto relativity theory each system experiences in general a different propertime, depending on the system's world line, due to time to time dilation. it istherefore of fundamental interest to test the notion of time in the regimewhere both quantum and relativistic effects play a role, for example, whendifferent amplitudes of a single quantum clock experience different magnitudesof time dilation. here we propose a realization of such an experiment with asingle electron in a penning trap. the clock can be implemented in theelectronic spin precession and its time dilation then depends on the radial(cyclotron) state of the electron. we show that coherent manipulation anddetection of the electron can be achieved already with present day technology.a single electron in a penning trap is a technologically ready platform wherethe notion of time can be probed in a hitherto untested regime, where itrequires a relativistic as well as quantum description.
