quantum field theory in de sitter universe: ambient space formalism quantum field theory in the $4$-dimensional de sitter space-time isconstructed in the ambient space formalism in a rigorous mathematicalframework. this work is based on the group representation theory and theanalyticity of the complexified pseudo-riemannian manifolds. the unitaryirreducible representations of de sitter group and their corresponding hilbertspaces are reformulated in the ambient space formalism. defining the creationand annihilation operators, quantum field operators and their correspondinganalytic two-point functions for various spin fields have been constructed. thevarious spin massless fields can be constructed in terms of the masslessconformally coupled scalar field in this formalism. then the quantum masslessminimally coupled scalar field operator, for the first time, is alsoconstructed on bunch-davies vacuum state which preserve the analyticity. weshow that the massless fields with $s \geq 3$ cannot propagate in de sitterambient space formalism. the massless gauge invariant field equations for $s=1,\frac{3}{2}, 2$ are studied. the gauge spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ fields satisfy thegrassmannian algebra, and hence provoke one to couple them with the gaugespin-$2$ field and the super-algebra is naturally appeared.
