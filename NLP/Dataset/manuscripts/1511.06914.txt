notes on translational and rotational properties of tensor fields in  relativistic quantum mechanics recently, several discussions on the possible observability of 4-vectorfields have been published in literature. furthermore, several authors recentlyclaimed existence of the helicity=0 fundamental field. we re-examine the theoryof antisymmetric tensor fields and 4-vector potentials. we study the masslesslimits. in fact, a theoretical motivation for this venture is the old papers ofogievetskii and polubarinov, hayashi, and kalb and ramond. they proposed theconcept of the notoph, whose helicity properties are complementary to those ofthe photon. we analyze the quantum field theory with taking into account massdimensions of the notoph and the photon. it appears to be possible to describeboth photon and notoph degrees of freedom on the basis of the modifiedbargmann-wigner formalism for the symmetric second-rank spinor. next, weproceed to derive equations for the symmetric tensor of the second rank on thebasis of the bargmann-wigner formalism in a straightforward way. the symmetricmultispinor of the fourth rank is used. due to serious problems with theinterpretation of the results obtained on using the standard procedure wegeneralize it and obtain the spin-2 relativistic equations, which areconsistent with the general relativity. thus, in fact we deduced thegravitational field equations from relativistic quantum mechanics. therelations of this theory with the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation andf(r) are discussed. particular attention has been paid to the correctdefinitions of the energy-momentum tensor and other noether currents in theelectromagnetic theory, the relativistic theory of gravitation, the generalrelativity, and their generalizations. we estimate possible interactions,fermion-notoph, graviton-notoph, photon-notoph, and we conclude that they canprobably be seen in experiments in the next few years.
