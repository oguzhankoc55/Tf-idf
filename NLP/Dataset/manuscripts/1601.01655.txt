finite energy quantization on a topology changing spacetime the "trousers" spacetime is a pair of flat 2d cylinders ("legs") merging intointo a single one ("trunk"). in spite of its simplicity this spacetime has afew features (including, in particular, a naked singularity in the "crotch")each of which is presumably unphysical, but for none of which a mechanism isknown able to prevent its occurrence. therefore it is interesting and importantto study the behavior of the quantum fields in such a space. anderson anddewitt were the first to consider the free scalar field in the trousersspacetime. they argued that the crotch singularity produces an infinitelybright flash, which was interpreted as evidence that the topology of space isdynamically preserved. similar divergencies were later discovered by manogue,copeland and dray who used a more exotic quantization scheme. later yet thesame result obtained within a somewhat different approach led sorkin to theconclusion that the topological transition in question is suppressed in quantumgravity.  in this paper i show that the anderson--dewitt divergence is an artifact oftheir choice of the fock space. by choosing a different one-particle hilbertspace one gets a quantum state in which the components of the stress-energytensor (set) are bounded in the frame of a free-falling observer.
