is classical flat kasner spacetime flat in quantum gravity? quantum nature of classical flat kasner spacetime is studied using effectivespacetime description in loop quantum cosmology. we find that even though thespacetime curvature vanishes at the classical level, non-trivial quantumgravitational effects can arise. for the standard loop quantization ofbianchi-i spacetime, which uniquely yields universal bounds on expansion andshear scalars and results in a generic resolution of strong singularities, wefind that a flat kasner metric is not a physical solution of the effectivespacetime description, except in a limit. the lack of a flat kasner metric atthe quantum level results from a novel feature of the loop quantum bianchi-ispacetime: quantum geometry induces non-vanishing spacetime curvaturecomponents, making it not ricci flat even when no matter is present. thenon-curvature singularity of the classical flat kasner spacetime is avoided,and the effective spacetime transits from a flat kasner spacetime in asymptoticfuture, to a minkowski spacetime in asymptotic past. interestingly, for analternate loop quantization which does not share some of the fine features ofthe standard quantization, flat kasner spacetime with expected classicalfeatures exists. in this case, even with non-trivial quantum geometric effects,the spacetime curvature vanishes. these examples show that the character ofeven a flat classical vacuum spacetime can alter in a fundamental way inquantum gravity and is sensitive to the quantization procedure.
