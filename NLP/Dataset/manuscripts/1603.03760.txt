on conserved charges and thermodynamics of the ads$_{4}$ dyonic black  hole four-dimensional gravity in the presence of a dilatonic scalar field and anabelian gauge field is considered. this theory corresponds to the bosonicsector of a kaluza-klein dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensionalsupergravity which induces a determined self-interacting potential for thescalar field. we compute the conserved charges and carry out the thermodynamicsof an anti-de sitter (ads) dyonic black hole solution recently proposed. thecharges coming from symmetries of the action are computed by using theregge-teitelboim hamiltonian approach. these correspond to the mass, whichacquires contributions from the scalar field, and the electric charge.integrability conditions are introduced because the scalar field leads tonon-integrable terms in the variation of the mass. these conditions aregenerically solved by introducing boundary conditions that arbitrarily relatesthe leading and subleading terms of the scalar field fall-off. the hamiltonianeuclidean action, computed in the grand canonical ensemble, is obtained bydemanding the action to attain an extremum. its value is given by a radialboundary term plus an additional polar angle boundary term due to the presenceof a magnetic monopole. remarkably, the magnetic charge can be identified fromthe variation of the additional polar angle boundary term, confirming that thefirst law of black hole thermodynamics is a consequence of having awell-defined and finite hamiltonian action principle, even if the charge doesnot come from a symmetry of the action. the temperature and electrostaticpotential are determined demanding regularity on the black hole solution,whereas the value of the magnetic potential is already identified in thevariation of the additional polar angle boundary term. consequently, the firstlaw of black hole thermodynamics is identically satisfied by construction.
