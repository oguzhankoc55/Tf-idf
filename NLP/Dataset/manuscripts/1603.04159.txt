hawking fluxes and anomalies in the rotating regular black holes with  the time-delay based on the anomaly cancellation we are going to compute the hawking fluxes(the hawking thermal flux and the total flux of energy-momentum tensor) fromthe rotating regular black hole with a time-delay proposed in arxiv:1510.08828.to this purpose, in the three metrics proposed in arxiv:1510.08828, we firsttry to perform the dimensional reduction to the infinite two-dimensionalmassless free models in which the anomaly cancellation is possible toward thefield theories in the near-horizon region. as a result, we can demonstrate thatin two of them the dimensional reduction is possible. hence we perform theanomaly cancellation in these two metrics, and finally we obtain the hawkingfluxes in these two metrics which involves the three effects: 1) the quantumgravity effect regularizing the gravity sources of the black holes, 2) rotationof the black hole, 3) the time-delay. our result could be considered tocorrespond to a more realistic hawking fluxes. further what hawking fluxes canbe obtained from the anomaly cancellation would be interesting in terms of therelation between a consistency of quantum field theories and black holethermodynamics.
