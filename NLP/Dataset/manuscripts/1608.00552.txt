scattering of massless scalar waves by magnetically charged black holes  in einstein-yang-mills-higgs theory the existence of classical solutions of the einstein-yang-mills-higgsequations describing black holes inside 't hooft-polyakov magnetic monopolesimplies that not all stationary magnetically charged black holes can beuniquely described by their asymptotic characteristics. in fact, in a certaindomain of parameters, there exist different spherically-symmetric, non-rotatingand asymptotically-flat classical black hole solutions of theeinstein-yang-mills-higgs equations which have the same adm mass and the samemagnetic charge but significantly different geometries in the near-horizonregions. (these are black hole solutions which are described by areissner-nordstr\"om metric on the one hand and the "magnetic monopole blackhole solutions" which can be interpreted as black holes inside 'thooft-polyakov magnetic monopoles described by a metric which is not ofreissner-nordstr\"om form on the other hand.) one can experimentallydistinguish such black holes with same asymptotic characteristics but differentnear-horizon geometries classically by probing the near-horizon regions of theblack holes. we show that one way to probe the near-horizon region of a blackhole which allows to distinguish magnetically charged black holes with sameasymptotic characteristics but different near-horizon geometries is byclassical scattering of waves. using the example of a minimally-coupledmassless probe scalar field scattered by a magnetically charged black hole, wefind that the scattering cross sections are different for magnetically chargedblack holes with different near-horizon geometries but same asymptoticcharacteristics. in particular, the characteristic glory peaks are located atdifferent scattering angles.
