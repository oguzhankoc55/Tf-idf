thermodynamics of acoustic black holes in two dimensions it is well-known that the thermal hawking-like radiation can be emitted fromthe acoustic horizon, but the thermodynamic-like understanding for acousticblack holes was rarely made. in this paper, we will show that the kinematicconnection can lead to the dynamic connection at the horizon between the fluidand gravitational models in two dimension, which implies that there exists thethermodynamic-like description for acoustic black holes. then, we discuss thefirst law of thermodynamics for the acoustic black hole via an intriguingconnection between the gravitational-like dynamics of the acoustic horizon andthermodynamics. we obtain a universal form for the entropy of acoustic blackholes, which has an interpretation similar to the entropic gravity. we alsodiscuss the specific heat, and find that the derivative of the velocity ofbackground fluid can be regarded as a novel acoustic analogue of thetwo-dimensional dilaton potential, which interprets why the two-dimensionalfluid dynamics can be connected to the gravitational dynamics but difficult forfour-dimensional case. in particular, when a constraint is added for the fluid,the analogue of a schwarzschild black hole can be realized.
