new type of hill-top inflation we suggest a new type of hill-top inflation originating from the initialconditions in the form of the microcanonical density matrix for thecosmological model with a large number of quantum fields conformally coupled togravity. initial conditions for inflation are set up by cosmological instantonsdescribing underbarrier oscillations in the vicinity of the inflaton potentialmaximum. these periodic oscillations of the inflaton field and cosmologicalscale factor are obtained within the approximation of two coupled oscillatorssubject to the slow roll regime in the euclidean time. this regime ischaracterized by rapid oscillations of the scale factor on the background of aslowly varying inflaton, which guarantees smallness of slow roll parameters$\epsilon$ and $\eta$ of the following inflation stage. a hill-like shape ofthe inflaton potential is shown to be generated by logarithmic loop correctionsto the tree-level asymptotically shift-invariant potential in the non-minimalhiggs inflation model and $r^2$-gravity. the solution to the problem ofhierarchy between the planckian scale and the inflation scale is discussedwithin the concept of conformal higher spin fields, which also suggests themechanism bringing the model below the gravitational cutoff and, thus,protecting it from large graviton loop corrections.
