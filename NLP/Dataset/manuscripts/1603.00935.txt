dynamics of nonlinear waves on bounded domains this thesis is concerned with dynamics of conservative nonlinear waves onbounded domains. in general, there are two scenarios of evolution. either thesolution behaves in an oscillatory, quasiperiodic manner or the nonlineareffects cause the energy to concentrate on smaller scales leading to aturbulent behaviour. which of these two possibilities occurs depends on a modeland the initial conditions. in the quasiperiodic scenario there exist veryspecial time-periodic solutions. they result for a delicate balance betweendispersion and nonlinear interaction. the main body of this dissertation isconcerned with construction (by means of perturbative and numerical methods) oftime-periodic solutions for various nonlinear wave equations on boundeddomains. while turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recentresearch in general relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena. numericalstudies of a self-gravitating massless scalar field in spherical symmetry gaveevidence that anti-de sitter space is unstable against black hole formation. onthe other hand there appeared many examples of asymptotically anti-de sittersolutions which evade turbulent behaviour and appear almost periodic for longtimes. we discuss here these two contrasting scenarios putting specialattention to the construction and properties of strictly time-periodicsolutions. we analyze different models where solutions of this type exist.moreover, we describe similarities and differences among these modelsconcerning properties of time-periodic solutions and methods used for theirconstruction.
