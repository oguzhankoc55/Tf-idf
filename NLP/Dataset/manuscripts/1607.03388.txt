probing extra dimension through gravitational wave observations of  compact binaries and their electromagnetic counterparts the gravitational wave (gw) observations of compact binaries and theirpossible electromagnetic counterparts may be used to probe the nature of theextra dimension. it is widely accepted that gravitons and photons are the onlytwo completely confirmed objects that can travel along the null geodesics inour four-dimensional space-time. however, if there exists extra dimensions andonly gws can propagate freely in the bulk, the causal propagations of gws andelectromagnetic waves (emws) are in general different. in this paper, we studythe null geodesics of gws and emws in a five-dimensional anti-de sitterspace-time in the present of the curvature of the universe. we show that forgeneral cases the horizon radius of gws is longer than emws within the equaltime. taking the gw150914 event detected by the advanced laser interferometergravitational-wave observatory and the x-ray event detected by the fermigamma-ray burst monitor as an example, we study how the curvature $k$ and theconstant curvature radius $l$ affect the horizon radii of gws and emws in thede sitter and einstein-de sitter models of the universe. this provides analternative method for probing extra dimension through future gw observationsof compact binaries and their electromagnetic counterparts.
