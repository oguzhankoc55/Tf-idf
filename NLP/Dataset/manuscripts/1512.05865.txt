quasi-normal modes of black holes in lovelock gravity we study quasinormal modes of black holes in lovelock gravity. we formulatethe wkb method adapted to lovelock gravity for the calculation of quasinormalfrequencies (qnfs). as a demonstration, we calculate various qnfs of lovelockblack holes in seven and eight dimensions. we find that the qnfs showremarkable features depending on the coefficients of the lovelock terms, thespecies of perturbations, and spacetime dimensions. in the case of the scalarfield, when we increase the coefficient of the third order lovelock term, thereal part of qnfs increases, but the decay rate becomes small irrespective ofthe mass of the black hole. for small black holes, the decay rate ceases todepend on the gauss-bonnet term. in the case of tensor type perturbations ofthe metric field, the tendency of the real part of qnfs is opposite to that ofthe scalar field. the qnfs of vector type perturbations of the metric show noparticular behavior. the behavior of qnfs of the scalar type perturbations ofthe metric field is similar to the vector type. however, available data arerather sparse, which indicates that the wkb method is not applicable to manymodels for this sector.
