conserved charges, surface degrees of freedom, and black hole entropy in this thesis, we study the hamiltonian and covariant phase spacedescription of gravitational theories. the phase space represents the allowedfield configurations and is accompanied by a closed nondegenerate 2 form- thesymplectic form. we will show that local/gauge symmetries of the action fallinto two different categories in the phase space formulation. thosecorresponding to constraints in the phase space, and those associated withnontrivial conserved charges. we argue that while the former is related toredundant gauge degrees of freedom, the latter leads to physically distinctstates of the system, known as surface degrees of freedom and can induce alower dimensional dynamics on the system. these ideas are then implemented tobuild the phase space of specific gravitational systems: 1) asymptotically ads3spacetimes, and 2) near horizon geometries of extremal black holes (nheg) inarbitrary dimension. in the ads3 phase space, we show that brown-henneauxasymptotic symmetries can be extended inside the bulk of spacetime and hencebecome symplectic symmetries of the phase space. we will show that in the nhegphase space, surface gravitons form a virasoro algebra in four dimensions, anda novel generalization of virasoro in higher dimensions. the central charge ofthe algebra is proportional to the entropy of the corresponding extremal blackhole. we study the holographic description of nheg phase space and show thatthe charges can be computed through a liouville type stress tensor defined overa lower dimensional torus. we will discuss whether surface gravitons can serveas the microscopic origin of black hole entropy.
