universality in the shape dependence of holographic r\'enyi entropy for  general higher derivative gravity we consider higher derivative gravity and obtain universal relations for theshape coefficients $(f_a, f_b, f_c)$ of the shape dependent universal part ofthe r\'enyi entropy for four dimensional cfts in terms of the parameters $(c,t_2, t_4)$ of two-point and three-point functions of stress tensors. as aconsistency check, these shape coefficients $f_a$ and $f_c$ satisfy thedifferential relation as derived previously for the r\'enyi entropy.interestingly, these holographic relations also apply to weakly coupledconformal field theories such as theories of free fermions and vectors but areviolated by theories of free scalars. the mismatch of $f_a$ for scalars hasbeen observed in the literature and is due to certain delicate boundarycontributions to the modular hamiltonian. interestingly, we find a combinationof our holographic relations which are satisfied by all free cfts includingscalars. we conjecture that this combined relation is universal for generalcfts in four dimensional spacetime. finally, we find there are similaruniversal laws for holographic r\'enyi entropy in general dimensions.
