rescuing complementarity with little drama the amps paradox challenges black hole complementarity by apparentlyconstructing a way for an observer to bring information from the outside of theblack hole into its interior if there is no drama at its horizon, makingmanifest a violation of monogamy of entanglement. we propose a new resolutionto the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infallingobserver in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing thehorizon. our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition(we call it "little drama") which is the "complementarity dual" of scramblingof information on the stretched horizon. when translated to the description ofthe black hole interior, this implies that the fine-grained quantum informationof infalling matter is rapidly diffused across the entire interior whileclassical observables and coarse-grained geometry remain unaffected. under theassumption that information has diffused throughout the interior, we considerthe difficulty of the information-theoretic task that an observer must performafter crossing the event horizon of a schwarzschild black hole in order toverify a violation of monogamy of entanglement. we find that the time requiredto complete a necessary subroutine of this task, namely the decoding of bellpairs from the interior and the late radiation, takes longer than the maximumamount of time that an observer can spend inside the black hole before hittingthe singularity. therefore, an infalling observer cannot observe monogamyviolation before encountering the singularity.
