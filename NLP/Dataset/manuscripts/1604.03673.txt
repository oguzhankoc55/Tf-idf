accelerated observers, thermal entropy, and spacetime curvature assuming that an accelerated observer with four-velocity ${\bf u}_{\rm r}$ ina curved spacetime attributes the standard bekenstein-hawking entropy and unruhtemperature to his "local rindler horizon", we show that the $\rm \it change$in horizon area under parametric displacements of the horizon has a veryspecific thermodynamic structure. specifically, it entails information aboutthe time-time component of the einstein tensor: $\bf g({\bf u}_{\rm r}, {\bfu}_{\rm r})$. demanding that the result holds for all accelerated observers,this actually becomes a statement about the full einstein tensor, $\rm \bf g$.  we also present some perspectives on the free fall with four-velocity ${\bfu}_{\rm ff}$ across the horizon that leads to such a loss of entropy for anaccelerated observer. motivated by results for some simple quantum systems atfinite temperature $t$, we conjecture that at high temperatures, there exists auniversal, system-independent curvature correction to partition function andthermal entropy of $\rm \it any$ freely falling system, characterised by thedimensional quantity $\delta = {\bf r({\bf u}_{\rm ff}, {\bf u}_{\rm ff})}\left(\hbar c/kt \right)^2$.
