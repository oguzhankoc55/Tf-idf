orbital angular momentum of scalar field generated by gravitational  scatterings it has been expected that astronomical observations to detect the orbitalangular momenta of electromagnetic waves may give us a new insight intoastrophysics. previous works pointed out the possibility that a rotating blackhole can produce orbital angular momenta of electromagnetic waves throughgravitational scattering, and the spin parameter of the black hole can bemeasured by observing them. however, the mechanism how the orbital angularmomentum of the electromagnetic wave is generated by the gravitationalscattering has not been clarified sufficiently. in this paper, in order tounderstand it from a point of view of gravitational lensing effects, weconsider an emitter which radiates a spherical wave of the real massless scalarfield and study the deformation of the scalar wave by the gravitationalscattering due to a black hole by invoking the geometrical opticsapproximation. we show that the frame dragging caused by the rotating blackhole is not a necessary condition for generating the orbital angular momentumof the scalar wave. however, its components parallel to the direction cosinesof images appear only if the black hole is rotating.
