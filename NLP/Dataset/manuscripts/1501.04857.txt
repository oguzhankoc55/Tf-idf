exploring the origin of minkowski spacetime following minkowski's formulation of special relativity, it is generallyaccepted that we live in a four-dimensional world consisting of three space andone time dimension. due to its fundamental importance, a variety of argumentshave been proposed over the years attempting to derive this spacetime structurefrom underlying physical principles. in our approach, we show how minkowskispacetime arises from the geometrical properties of three dimensional space. wedemonstrate this through modeling physical space with clifford's geometricalgebra of three dimensions. we indeed find using this representation that atime-like dimension arises naturally within this space but also extendsspacetime to eight dimensions through incorporating four spin degrees offreedom. this expanded arena of spacetime produces a generalized group oflorentz transformations and provides a natural description of fundamentalparticles. nearly all standard results are returned in this expanded structureand so its main achievement is that it provides an efficient alternativeformalism to the conventional four-vector formalism but we were also able toidentify several areas where new physics may be indicated.
