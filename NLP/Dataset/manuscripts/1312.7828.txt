hamiltonian and noether charges in first order gravity we consider gravity in four dimensions in the vielbein formulation, where thefundamental variables are a tetrad $e$ and a so(3,1) connection $\omega$. westart with the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphisminvariance which includes, besides the standard palatini term, other terms thateither do not change the equations of motion, or are topological in nature. forour analysis we employ the covariant hamiltonian formalism where the phasespace $\gamma$ is given by solutions to the equations of motion. we considerspacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying asymptotically flatboundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying isolated horizonsboundary conditions. for this extended action we study the effect of thetopological terms on the hamiltonian formulation. we prove two results. thefirst one is rather generic, applicable to any field theory with boundaries:the addition of topological terms (and any other boundary term) does not modifythe symplectic structure of the theory. the second result pertains to theconserved hamiltonian and noether charges, whose properties we analyze indetail, including their relationship. while the hamiltonian charges areunaffected by the addition of topological and boundary terms, we show in detailthat the noether charges {\em do} change. thus, a non-trivial relation betweenthese two sets of charges arises when the boundary and topological terms neededfor a consistent formulation are included.
