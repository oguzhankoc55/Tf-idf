a study on the initial singularity in rainbow gravity-based cosmology using a one-dimensional minisuperspace model with a dimensionless ratio$\frac{e}{e_{pl}}$, we study the ininial singularity problem at the quantumlevel for the closed rainbow cosmology with a homogeneous isotropic classicalspace-time background. to this end, we derive the hamiltonian within theframework of schutz's formalism for an ideal fluid with a cosmologicalconstant. we characterize the behavior of the system at the early stages offormation of the universe through analyzing the relevant shapes for thepotential sector of the hamiltonian for various matter sources, each separatelymodified by two known rainbow functions. we show that for both rainbow universemodels used here, there is the possibility of eliminating the initialsingularity by forming a potential barrier and static universe for a non-zerovalue of the scale factor. we investigate their quantum stability and show thatfor a energy-dependent space-time geometry with energies comparable to theplanck energy, the non-zero value of the scale factor may be stable. it isshown that under certain constraints the rainbow universe model filled with anexotic matter as a domain wall fluid plus a cosmological constant can result ina non-singular harmonic universe. in addition, we demonstrate that theharmonically oscillating universe with respect to the scale factor is sensitiveto $\frac{e}{e_{pl}}$ and that at high energies it may become stable quantummechanically.
