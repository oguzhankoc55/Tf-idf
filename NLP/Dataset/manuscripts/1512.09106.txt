gravitational tension, spacetime pressure and black hole volume we study the first law of black hole thermodynamics in the presence ofsurrounding gravitational fields and argue that variations of these fields arenaturally incorporated in the first law by defining gravitational tension orgravitational binding energy. we demonstrate that this notion can also beapplied in anti-de sitter spacetime, in which the surrounding gravitationalfield is sourced by a cosmological fluid, therefore showing that spacetimevolume and gravitational tension encode the same physics as spacetime pressureand black hole volume. we furthermore show that it is possible to introduce adefinition of spacetime pressure and black hole volume for any spacetime withcharacteristic length scales which does not necessarily require a cosmologicalconstant sourcing einstein equations. however, we show that black hole volumeis non-universal in the flat spacetime limit, questioning its significance. weillustrate these ideas by studying the resulting black hole volume ofkaluza-klein black holes and of a toy model for a black hole binary system infive spacetime dimensions (the black saturn solution) as well as of severalnovel perturbative black hole solutions. these include the higher-dimensionalkerr-newman solution in anti-de sitter spacetime as well as other black holesin plane wave and lifshitz spacetimes.
