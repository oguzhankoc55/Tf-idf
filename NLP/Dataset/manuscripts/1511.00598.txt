phase transition of charged black holes in brans-dicke theory through  geometrical thermodynamics in this paper, we take into account black hole solutions ofbrans-dicke-maxwell theory and investigate their stability and phase transitionpoints. we apply the concept of geometry in thermodynamics to obtain phasetransition points and compare its results with those, calculated in canonicalensemble through heat capacity. we show that these black holes enjoy secondorder phase transitions. we also show that there is a lower bound for thehorizon radius of physical charged black holes in brans-dicke theory which isoriginated from restrictions of positivity of temperature. in addition, we findthat employing specific thermodynamical metric in the context of geometricalthermodynamics, yields divergencies for thermodynamical ricci scalar in placesof the phase transitions. it will be pointed out that due to characteristicsbehavior of thermodynamical ricci scalar around its divergence points, one isable to distinguish the physical limitation point from the phase transitions.in addition, the free energy of these black holes will be obtained and itsbehavior will be investigated. it will be shown that the behavior of the freeenergy in the place where the heat capacity diverges, demonstrates second orderphase transition characteristics.
