a theory of emergent quantum mechanics and classical emergent gravity quantum systems are viewed as emergent systems from the fundamental degreesof freedom and the laws and rules of quantum mechanics understood as aneffective description, valid for the emergent systems and specially useful tohandle probabilistic predictions of measurements of observables. a hilbertspace structure is constructed and associated with the space of wave functionsof quantum mechanical systems from the hilbert space formulation of theunderlying hamilton-randers model. in the general framework of this theory wecan prove the emergence of born's rule from ergodic considerations. a geometricmechanism for a natural spontaneous reduction of the quantum states based onthe concentration of measure phenomena as it appears in metric geometry, isdiscussed. the conditions for the existence of concentration of measure arealso fundamental to show the existence of stable vacua states for the quantizedmatter hamiltonian. another consequence of the concentration of measure is theemergence of a weak equivalence principle for one of the dynamics of thefundamental degrees of freedom. moreover, since such interaction appears onlyin the dynamical domain when localization of each of the possible quantumobservables happens, it must be classical. after this, it is shown that theoperators associated with quantum observables follow the heisenberg's equationof dynamics for matter. we discuss the double slit experiment, the interferencephenomena in produced by a quantum system in an external gravitationalpotential, a mechanism explaining non-quantum locality, entanglement and howbell's inequalities should be violated.
