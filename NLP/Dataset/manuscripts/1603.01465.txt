a note on the relations between thermodynamics, energy definitions and  friedmann equations in what follows, we investigate the relation between the friedmann andthermodynamic pressure equations, through solving the friedmann andthermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously. our investigation shows that aperfect fluid, as a suitable solution for the friedmann equations leading tothe standard modelling of the universe expansion history, cannot simultaneouslysatisfy the thermodynamic pressure equation and those of friedmann. moreover,we consider various energy definitions, such as the komar mass, and solve thefriedmann and thermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously to get somemodels for dark energy. the cosmological consequences of obtained solutions arealso addressed. our results indicate that some of obtained solutions may unifythe dominated fluid in both the primary inflationary and current acceleratingeras into one model. in addition, by taking into account a cosmic fluid of aknown equation of state, and combining it with the friedmann and thermodynamicpressure equations, we obtain the corresponding energy of these cosmic fluidsand face their limitations. finally, we point out the cosmological features ofthis cosmic fluid and also study its observational constraints.
