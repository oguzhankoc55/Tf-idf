forced fluid dynamics from blackfolds in general supergravity  backgrounds we present a general treatment of the leading order dynamics of thecollective modes of charged dilatonic $p$-brane solutions of (super)gravitytheories in arbitrary backgrounds. to this end we employ the general strategyof the blackfold approach which is based on a long-wavelength derivativeexpansion around an exact or approximate solution of the (super)gravityequations of motion. the resulting collective mode equations are formulated asforced hydrodynamic equations on dynamically embedded hypersurfaces. we derivethem in full generality (including all possible asymptotic fluxes and dilatonprofiles) in a far-zone analysis of the (super)gravity equations and inrepresentative examples in a near-zone analysis. an independent treatment basedon the study of external couplings in hydrostatic partition functions is alsopresented. special emphasis is given to the forced collective mode equationsthat arise in type iia/b and eleven-dimensional supergravities, where besidesthe standard lorentz force couplings our analysis reveals additional couplingswith the background, including terms that arise from chern-simons interactions.we also present a general overview of the blackfold approach and some of thekey conceptual issues that arise when applied to arbitrary backgrounds.
