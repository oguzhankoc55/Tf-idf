back to parmenides after a brief introduction to issues that plague the realization of a theoryof quantum gravity, i suggest that the main one concerns definingsuperpositions of causal structures. this leads me to a distinction betweentime and space, to a further degree than that present in the canonical approachto general relativity. with this distinction, one can make sense ofsuperpositions as interference between alternative paths in the relationalconfiguration space of the entire universe. but the full use of relationalismbrings us to a timeless picture of nature, as it does in the canonical approach(which culminates in the wheeler-dewitt equation). after a discussion ofparmenides and the eleatics' rejection of time, i show that there is a middleground between their view of absolute timelessness and a view of physics takingplace in timeless configuration space. in this middle ground, even thoughchange does not fundamentally exist, the illusion of change can be recovered ina way not permitted by parmenides. it is recovered through a particular densitydistribution over configuration space which gives rise to 'records'.incidentally, this distribution seems to have the potential to dissolve furtheraspects of the measurement problem that can still be argued to haunt theapplication of decoherence to many-worlds quantum mechanics. i end with adiscussion indicating that the conflict between the conclusions of this paperand our view of the continuity of the self may still intuitively bother us.nonetheless, those conclusions should be no more challenging to our intuitionthan derek parfit's thought experiments on the subject.
