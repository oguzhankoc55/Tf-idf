topological structure of the vacuum, cosmological constant and dark  energy in this review we present a theory of cosmological constant and dark energy(de), based on the topological structure of the vacuum. the multiple pointprinciple (mpp) is reviewed. it demonstrates the existence of the two vacuainto the sm. the froggatt-nielsen's prediction of the top-quark and higgsmasses is given in the assumption that there exist two degenerate vacua in thesm. this prediction was improved by the next order calculations. we alsoconsidered b.g. sidharth's theory of cosmological constant based on thenon-commutative geometry of the planck scale space-time, what gives anextremely small de density providing the accelerating expansion of theuniverse. theory of two degenerate vacua - the planck scale phase andelectroweak (ew) phase - also is reviewed, topological defects in these vacuaare investigated, also the compton wavelength phase suggested by b.g. sidharthwas discussed. a general theory of the phase transition and the problem of thevacuum stability in the sm is reviewed. assuming that the recently discoveredat the lhc new resonance with mass $m_s \simeq 750$ gev is a new scalar $s$bound state $6t + 6\bar t$, earlier predicted by c.d. froggatt, h.b. nielsenand l.v. laperashvili, we try to provide the vacuum stability in the sm andexact accuracy of the mpp.
