creation of matter in a noncommutative universe the dark matter and dark energy problem, that is now dominating the researchin cosmology, makes the question of the origin of mass-energy content of theuniverse more urgent than ever. there are two philosophies regarding thisquestion: according to mach's principle it is matter that generates geometry ofspace-time, and according to wheeler's geometrodynamics some configurations ofspace-time geometry are to be interpreted as its material content. neither ofthese philosophies has led to success. in the present paper, we show that thereexists an algebraic generalisation of geometry that reconciles, in a sense,these two seemingly opposite standpoints. the geometry is constructed with thehelp of a noncommutative algebra of smooth functions on a groupoid and itsderivations. the groupoid in question has a nice physical interpretation: itcan be regarded as a space of lorentz rotations. in this way, lorentzsymmetries are inherent to the generalised geometry of space-time. we definethe action for this geometry and, by varying it, obtain generalised vacuumeinstein equations (for a simplified model). it turns out that these equationscontain additional terms (with respect to the standard vacuum einsteinequations) which are naturally interpreted as the components of theenergy-momentum tensor. matter is thus created out of purely geometric degreesof freedom. we find two exact solutions (for even more simplified case). weargue that the creation of matter, being a global effect, makes the contrastbetween mach and wheeler philosophies ineffective.
