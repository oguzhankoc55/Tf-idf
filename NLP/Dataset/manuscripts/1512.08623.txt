on the possibility of generating supermassive black holes from  self-gravitating bose-einstein condensates comprising of bosonic dark matter observed active galactic nuclei at redshifts $\gtrsim 6$ suggest thatsupermassive black holes (smbhs) had formed early on. accretion of matter ontoremnants of population iii stars leading to smbhs is a very slow process, andtherefore, such models encounter difficulties in explaining quasars detected at$ z \gtrsim 6$. in this paper, we invoke collapse of dark bosonic halo matter,existing initially in self-gravitating bose-einstein condensate (bec) phase, tolead to formation of smbh. making use of gross-pitaevskii equation andemploying a gaussian trial wavefunction, we determine the time dependence ofits parameters and thereby, track the time evolution of the wavefunction. ifthe condensate, made up of identical dark bosons of mass $m$, collapses to forma black hole of mass $m_{eff}$ as soon as the former's effective size shrinksbelow the corresponding schwarzschild radius, a simple inequality $ m \ m_{eff}\gtrsim 0.64 \ m^2_{pl} $ can be derived, that ensues from a competitionbetween attractive self-gravity and quantum repulsion arising due touncertainty principle. we show that formation of smbhs takes place on dynamicaltime scales $\sim 10^8$ yrs. existence of ultra-light ($m \sim 10^{-23} \\mbox{ev}$) dark bosons not only can lead to smbhs of mass $\sim 10^{12} \m_\odot$ at $ z &gt; 6$ but also such particles can masquerade both as dark matteras well as dark energy. discovery of aligned radio-jets in the elais-n1 gmrtdeep field leads us to make simple estimates to demonstrate that vortices of arotating bec that collapse to form black holes can give rise to smbhs withaligned spins on scales exceeding cluster size length scales, each with angularmomentum $j \lesssim 3.6 \ n_w \frac {g m^2} {c}$, where $n_w$ and $m$ are thewinding number and mass of a vortex, respectively.
