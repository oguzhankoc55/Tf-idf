linear spin-2 fields in most general backgrounds we derive the full perturbative equations of motion for the most generalbackground solutions in ghost-free bimetric theory in its metric formulation.clever field redefinitions at the level of fluctuations enable us to circumventthe problem of varying a square-root matrix appearing in the theory. thisgreatly simplifies the expressions for the linear variation of the bimetricinteraction terms. we show that these field redefinitions exist and areuniquely invertible if and only if the variation of the square-root matrixitself has a unique solution, which is a requirement for the linearised theoryto be well-defined. as an application of our results we examine the constraintstructure of ghost-free bimetric theory at the level of linear equations ofmotion for the first time. we identify a scalar combination of equations whichis responsible for the absence of the boulware-deser ghost mode in the theory.the bimetric scalar constraint is in general not manifestly covariant in itsnature. however, in the massive gravity limit the constraint assumes acovariant form when one of the interaction parameters is set to zero. for thatcase our analysis provides an alternative and almost trivial proof of theabsence of the boulware-deser ghost. our findings generalise previous resultsin the metric formulation of massive gravity and also agree with studies of itsvielbein version.
