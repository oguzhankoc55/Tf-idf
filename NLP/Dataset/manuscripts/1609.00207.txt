gravitational action with null boundaries we present a complete discussion of the boundary term in the actionfunctional of general relativity when the boundary includes null segments inaddition to the more usual timelike and spacelike segments. we confirm thatambiguities appear in the contribution from a null segment, because it dependson an arbitrary choice of parametrization for the generators. we also show thatsimilar ambiguities appear in the contribution from a codimension-two surfaceat which a null segment is joined to another (spacelike, timelike, or null)segment. the parametrization ambiguity can be tamed by insisting that the nullgenerators be affinely parametrized; this forces each null contribution to theboundary action to vanish, but leaves intact the fredom to rescale the affineparameter by a constant factor on each generator. once a choice ofparametrization is made, the ambiguity in the joint contributions can beeliminated by formulating well-motivated rules that ensure the additivity ofthe gravitational action. enforcing these rules, we calculate the time rate ofchange of the action when it is evaluated for a so-called "wheeler-dewittpatch" of a black hole in asymptotically-anti de sitter space. we recover anumber of results cited in the literature, obtained with a less completeanalysis.
