a study of cosmic expansion generated by non-conservation of matter in  the framework of brans-dicke theory the present study, on the expansion of universe, is based on an assumptionregarding the possibility of inter-conversion between matter and dark energy,through some interaction of matter with the scalar field in the framework ofbrans-dicke theory. the field equations for a spatially flat space-time havebeen solved using an empirical dependence of scalar field parameter upon thescale factor. to represent the behaviour regarding the non-conservation ofmatter, a function, expressed in terms of the hubble parameter, has beenempirically incorporated into the field equations. their solution shows that,this function, whose value is proportional to the matter content of theuniverse, decreases monotonically with time. this matter-field interactiongenerates late time acceleration, causing the deceleration parameter to changeits sign from positive to negative. time dependence of the proportion of darkenergy component of the universe has been determined and shown graphically.time variation of gravitational constant and the brans-dicke dimensionlessparameter has been analyzed in the present study. the rate of generation ofdark energy from matter has been found to affect the time variations ofdeceleration parameter and gravitational constant.
