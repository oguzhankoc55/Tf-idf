null-stream pointing with pulsar timing arrays locating sources on the sky is one of the largest challenges in gravitationalwave astronomy, owing to the omni-directional nature of gravitational wavedetection techniques, and the often intrinsically weak signals being observed.ground-based detectors can address the pointing problem by observing with anetwork of detectors, effectively triangulating signal locations by observingthe arrival times across the network. space-based detectors will observelong-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to theirlocation on the sky, using doppler shifts of the signal to locate the skyposition. while these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector ornetwork, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards oneexpects from electromagnetic astronomy. another technique that can be used forsky localization is null-stream pointing. in the case where multipleindependent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitationalwaves will appear in each of the data streams. taking the signals from multipledetectors in linear combination with each other, one finds there is a twoparameter family of coefficients that effectively null the gravitational wavesignal; those two parameters are the angles that define the sky location of thesource. this technique has been demonstrated for a network of ground-basedinterferometric observatories, and for 6-link space interferometers. this paperderives and extends the null-stream pointing method to the unique case ofpulsar timing residuals. the basic method is derived and demonstrated, and thenecessity of using the method with multiple sub-arrays of pulsars in the pulsartiming array network is considered.
