noether symmetries and duality transformations in cosmology we discuss the relation between noether (point) symmetries and discretesymmetries for a class of minisuperspace cosmological models. we show that whena noether symmetry exists for the gravitational lagrangian then there exists acoordinate system in which a reversal symmetry exists. moreover as far asconcerns the scale-factor duality symmetry of the dilaton field, we show thatit is related to the existence of a noether symmetry for the field equations,and the reversal symmetry in the normal coordinates of the symmetry vectorbecomes scale-factor duality symmetry in the original coordinates. inparticular the same point symmetry as also the same reversal symmetry existsfor the brans-dicke- scalar field with linear potential while now the discretesymmetry in the original coordinates of the system depends on the brans-dickeparameter and it is a scale-factor duality when $\omega_{bd}=1$. furthermore,in the context of the o'hanlon theory for $f\left( r\right) $-gravity, it ispossible to show how a duality transformation in the minisuperspace can be usedto relate different gravitational models.
