black holes as collapsed polymers we propose that a large schwarzschild black hole (bh) is a bound state ofhighly excited, long, closed strings at the hagedorn temperature. the size ofthe bound state is smaller than the string random-walk scale and determineddynamically by the string attractive interactions. it is further proposed thatthe effective free-energy density of the bound state should be expressed as afunction of its entropy density. for a macroscopic bh, the free-energy densitycontains only linear and quadratic terms, in analogy with that of a collapsedpolymer when expressed as a function of the polymer concentration. using theeffective free energy, we derive scaling relations for the entropy, energy andsize of the bound state and show that these agree with the scaling relations ofthe bh; in particular, with the area law for the bh entropy. the area laworiginates from the inverse scaling of the effective temperature with thebound-state radius. we also find that the energy density of the bound state isequal to its pressure.
