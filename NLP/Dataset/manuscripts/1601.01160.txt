phase structure of the born-infeld-anti-de sitter black holes probed by  non-local observables with the non-local observables such as two point correlation function andholographic entanglement entropy, we probe the phase structure of theborn-infeld-anti-de sitter black holes. we find for the case $bq&gt;0.5$, thephase structure is similar to that of the reissner-nordstr\"om-ads black hole,namely the black hole undergoes a hawking-page phase transition, a first orderphase transition, and a second order phase transition. while for the case$bq&lt;0.5$, we find there is a new branch for the infinitesimally small blackhole so that a pseudo phase transition emerges besides the original first orderphase transition. for the first order phase transition and the pseudo phasetransition, the equal area law is checked, and for the second order phasetransition, the critical exponent of the analogous heat capacity is obtained inthe neighborhood of the critical points. all the results show that the phasestructure of the non-local observables is the same as that of the thermalentropy regardless of the size of the boundary region in the field theory.
