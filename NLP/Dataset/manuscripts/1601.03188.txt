a story of phases, duals, and adjoints for a local lorentz covariant  theory of mass dimension one fermions we introduce a fermionic spin one-half quantum field with eigenspinors of thecharge conjugation operator as its expansion coefficients. for the eigenspinorswe make a very specific choice of the locality phases and provide theirexplicit expressions. we construct an analytic proof that these do not satisfydirac equation. under the dirac dual the naive expectation for the lagrangiandensity fails and we use this fact to motivate and undertake a mathematicaltheory of duals for the spinors, and provide the correct spinorial lagrangiandensity. we use the new dual to introduce an adjoint for the introduced quantumfield. it differs from the standard adjoint given, for example, in weinberg'sclassic on the theory of quantum fields. without reference to any lagrangiandensity or a wave equation we evaluate the feynman-dyson propagator for thefield. it is determined not only by the knowledge of the quantum field but alsoby the definition of the field adjoint. it establishes the mass dimensionalityof the field to be $1$, and not $3/2$, thus leading to an unexpected lagrangiandensity for the new fermions. this allows us to evaluate the localityanti-commutators. the result of calculations presented here shows the new fieldto be local in the sense of schwinger. the entire formalism is lorentzcovariant.
