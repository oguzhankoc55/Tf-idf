on shearing fluids with homogeneous densities in this paper, we study shearing spherically symmetric homogeneous densityfluids in comoving coordinates. it is found that the expansion of thefour-velocity of a perfect fluid is homogeneous, whereas its shear is generatedby an arbitrary function of time m(t), related to the mass function of thedistribution. this function is found to bear a functional relationship withdensity. the field equations are reduced to two coupled first order ordinarydifferential equations for the metric coefficients, g 11 and g 22. we haveexplored a class of solutions assuming that m is a linear function of thedensity. this class embodies, as a subcase, the complete class of shear-freesolutions. we have discussed the off quoted work of kustaanheimo (1947) andhave noted that it deals with shear-free fluids having anisotropic pressure. itis shown that the anisotropy of the fluid is characterized by an arbitraryfunction of time. we have discussed some issues of historical priorities andcredentials related to shear-free solutions. recent controversial claims bymitra (2011, 2012) have also been addressed. we found that the singularity andthe shearing motion of the fluid are closely related. hence, there is a needfor fresh look to the solutions obtained earlier in comoving coordinates.keywords (separated by '-') shearing solution - perfect fluids - homogeneousdensity
