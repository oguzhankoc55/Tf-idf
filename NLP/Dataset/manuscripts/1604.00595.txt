non-spherically symmetric black string perturbations in the large d  limit we consider non-spherically symmetric perturbations of the uncharged blackstring/flat black brane in the large dimension (d) limit of general relativity.we express the perturbations in a simplified form using variables introduced byishibashi and kodama. we apply the large d limit to the equations, and showthat this leads to decoupling of the equations in the near-horizon andasymptotic regions. it also enables use of matched asymptotic expansions toobtain approximate analytical solutions and to analyze stability of the blackstring/brane. for a large class of non-spherically symmetric perturbations, weprove that there are no instabilities in the large d limit. for the rest, weprovide additional matching arguments that indicate that the black string/braneis stable. in the \emph{static} limit, we show that for \emph{all}non-spherically symmetric perturbations, there is no instability. this is proofthat the gross-perry-yaffe mode for semiclassical black hole perturbations isthe unique unstable mode even in the large d limit. this work is also a directanalytical indication that the only instability of the black string is thegregory-laflamme instability.
