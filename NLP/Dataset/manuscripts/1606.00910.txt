gravity's rainbow: a bridge between lqc and dsr the doubly special relativity (dsr) theories are investigated in order totake into account an observer-independent length scale in special relativityframework. it is widely believed that any quantum theory of gravity wouldreduce to a dsr model at the flat limit when purely gravitational and quantummechanical effects are negligible. gravity's rainbow is a simple generalizationof dsr theories to incorporate gravity. in this paper, we show that theeffective friedmann equations that are suggested by loop quantum cosmology(lqc) can be exactly reobtained in rainbow cosmology setup. the deformedgeometry of lqc then completely fixes the modified dispersion relation andresults in unique dsr model. in comparison with standard lqc scenario whereonly the geometry is modified, both of the geometry and matter parts getmodifications in our setup. in this respect, we find that the total number ofmicrostates for the universe is finite which suggests the statistical originfor the energy and entropy density bounds. these results explicitly show thatthe dsr theories are appropriate candidates for the flat limit of loop quantumgravity.
