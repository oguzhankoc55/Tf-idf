mirror quintic vacua: hierarchies and inflation we study the moduli space of type iib string theory flux compactifications onthe mirror of the cy quintic 3-fold in p4. we focus on the dynamics of the fourdimensional moduli space, defined by the axio-dilaton {\tau} and the complexstructure modulus z. the z-plane has critical points, the conifold, theorbifold and the large complex structure with non trivial monodromies. we findthe solutions to the picard-fuchs equations obeyed by the periods of the cy inthe full z-plane as a series expansion in z around the critical points toarbitrary order. this allows us to discard fake vacua, which appear as a resultof keeping only the leading order term in the series expansions. due tomonodromies vacua are located at a given sheet in the z-plane. a ds vacuumappears for a set of fluxes. we revisit vacua with hierarchies among the 4d and6d physical scales close to the conifold point and compare them with thosefound at leading order in [1, 2]. we explore slow-roll inflationary directionsof the scalar potential by looking at regions where the multi-field slow-rollparameters {\epsilon} and {\eta} are smaller than one. the value of {\epsilon}depends strongly on the approximation of the periods and to achieve a stablevalue, several orders in the expansion are needed. we do not find realisationsof single field axion monodromy inflation. instead, we find that inflationaryregions appear along linear combinations of the four real field directions andfor certain configurations of fluxes.
