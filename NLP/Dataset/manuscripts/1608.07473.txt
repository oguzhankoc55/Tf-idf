from physical symmetries to emergent gauge symmetries gauge symmetries indicate redundancies in the description of the relevantdegrees of freedom of a given field theory and restrict the nature ofobservable quantities. one of the problems faced by emergent theories ofrelativistic fields is to understand how gauge symmetries can show up insystems that contain no trace of these symmetries at a more fundamental level.in this paper we start a systematic study aimed to establish a satisfactorymathematical and physical picture of this issue, dealing first with abelianfield theories. we discuss how the trivialization, due to the decoupling andlack of excitation of some degrees of freedom, of the noether currentsassociated with physical symmetries leads to emergent gauge symmetries inspecific situations. an example of a relativistic field theory of a vectorfield is worked out in detail in order to make explicit how this mechanismworks and to clarify the physics behind it. the interplay of these ideas withwell-known results of importance to the emergent gravity program, such as theweinberg-witten theorem, are discussed.
