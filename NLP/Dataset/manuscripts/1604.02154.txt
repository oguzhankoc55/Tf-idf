radiation from a d-dimensional collision of shock waves: two dimensional  reduction and carter-penrose diagram we analyse the causal structure of the two dimensional (2d) reducedbackground used in the perturbative treatment of a head-on collision of two$d$-dimensional aichelburg-sexl gravitational shock waves. after defining allcausal boundaries, namely the future light-cone of the collision and the pastlight-cone of a future observer, we obtain characteristic coordinates using twoindependent methods. the first is a geometrical construction of the null rayswhich define the various light cones, using a parametric representation. thesecond is a transformation of the 2d reduced wave operator for the problem intoa hyperbolic form. the characteristic coordinates are then compactifiedallowing us to represent all causal light rays in a conformal carter-penrosediagram. our construction holds to all orders in perturbation theory. inparticular, we can easily identify the singularities of the source functionsand of the green's functions appearing in the perturbative expansion, at eachorder, which is crucial for a successful numerical evaluation of any higherorder corrections using this method.
