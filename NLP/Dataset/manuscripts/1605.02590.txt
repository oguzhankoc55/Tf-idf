teleparallel loop quantum cosmology in a system of intersecting branes recently, some authors have removed the big bang singularity in teleparallelloop quantum cosmology (lqc) and have shown that the universe may undergo anumber of oscillations. we investigate the origin of this type of teleparalleltheory in a system of intersecting branes in m-theory in which the anglebetween them changes with time. this system is constructed by two intersectinganti-d8-branes, one compacted d4-brane and the other a d3-brane. these branesare built by joining m0-branes which develop in decaying fundamental strings.the compacted d4-brane is located between two intersecting anti-d8 branes andglues to one of them. our universe is located on the d3 brane which wraps thed4 brane from one end and sticks to one of the anti-d8 branes from another one.in this system, there are three types of ?elds, corresponding to compacted d4branes, intersecting branes and d3-branes. these ?elds interact with each otherand make the angle between branes oscillate. by decreasing this angle andapproaching the intersecting anti-d8 branes towards each other, the d4 branerolls, the d3 brane wraps around the d4 brane, and t he universe contracts. byseparating the intersecting branes and increasing the angle, the d4 brane rollsin the opposite direction, the d3 brane separates from it and the expansionbranch begins. also, the interaction between branes in this system gives us theexact form of the relevant lagrangian for teleparallel lqc.
