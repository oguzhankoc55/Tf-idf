configuration spaces in fundamental physics i consider configuration spaces for $n$-body problems, gauge theories and forgr in both geometrodynamical and ashtekar variables forms, includingminisuperspace and inhomogeneous perturbations thereabout in the former case.these examples include many interesting spaces of shapes (with and withoutwhichever of local or global notions of scale). in considering reducedconfiguration spaces, stratified manifolds arise. three strategies to deal withthese are `excise', `unfold' and `accept'. i show that spaces of trianglesarising from various interpretations of 3-body problems already serve as modelarena for all three. i furthermore argue in favour of the `accept' strategy onrelational grounds. this approach requires sheaf methods (which go beyond fibrebundles and general bundles, which i contrast with sheaves and presheaves insome appendices). sheaf methods are also required for the stratifold constructthat pairs some well-behaved stratified manifolds with sheaves. i apply arguingagainst `excise' and `unfold' to gr's superspace and thin sandwich, and to theremoval of collinear configurations in mechanics. non-redundant configurationsare also useful in providing more accurate names for various spaces andtheories.
