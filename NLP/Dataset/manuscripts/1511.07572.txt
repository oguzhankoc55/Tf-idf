gaussian quantum steering and its asymmetry in curved spacetime we study gaussian quantum steering and its asymmetry in the background of aschwarzschild black hole. we present a gaussian channel description of quantumstate evolution under the influence of the hawking radiation. we find thatthermal noise introduced by hawking effect will destroy the steerabilitybetween an inertial observer alice and an accelerated observer bob who hoversoutside the event horizon, while it generates steerability between bob and ahypothetical observer anti-bob inside the event horizon. unlike entanglementbehaviors in curved spacetime, here the steering from alice to bob suffers froma "sudden death" and the steering from anti-bob to bob experiences a "suddenbirth" with increasing hawking temperature. we also find that the gaussiansteering is always asymmetric and the maximum steering asymmetry cannot exceed$\ln 2$, which means the state never evolves to an extremal asymmetry state.furthermore, we obtain the parameter settings that maximize steering asymmetryand find that (i) $s=arccosh(\frac{\cosh^2 r}{1-\sinh^2r})$ is the criticalpoint of steering asymmetry, and (ii) the attainment of maximal steeringasymmetry indicates the transition between one-way steerability and both-waysteerability for the two-mode gaussian state under the influence of hawkingradiation.
