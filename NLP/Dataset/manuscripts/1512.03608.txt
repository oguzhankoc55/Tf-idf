study of parametrized dark energy models with a general non-canonical  scalar field in this paper, we have considered various dark energy models in the frameworkof a non-canonical scalar field with a lagrangian density of the form ${\call}(\phi, x)=f(\phi)x{\left(\frac{x}{m^{4}_{pl}}\right)}^{\alpha -1} - v(\phi)$,which provides the standard canonical scalar field model for $\alpha=1$ and$f(\phi)=1$. in this particular non-canonical scalar field model, we havecarried out the analysis for $\alpha=2$. we have then obtained cosmologicalsolutions for constant as well as variable equation of state parameter($\omega_{\phi}(z)$) for dark energy. we have also performed the data analysisfor three different functional forms of $\omega_{\phi}(z)$ by using thecombination of sn ia, bao and cmb datasets. we have found that for all thechoices of $\omega_{\phi}(z)$, the sn ia $+$ cmb/bao dataset favors the pastdecelerated and recent accelerated expansion phase of the universe.furthermore, using the combined dataset, we have observed that thereconstructed results of $\omega_{\phi}(z)$ and $q(z)$ are almost choiceindependent and the resulting cosmological scenarios are in good agreement withthe $\lambda$cdm model (within the $1\sigma$ confidence contour). we have alsoderived the form of the potentials for each model and the resulting potentialsare found to be a quartic potential for constant $\omega_{\phi}$ and apolynomial in $\phi$ for variable $\omega_{\phi}$.
