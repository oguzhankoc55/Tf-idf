quantum gravity kinematics from extended tqfts we show how extended topological quantum field theories (tqfts) can be usedto obtain a kinematical setup for quantum gravity, i.e. a kinematical hilbertspace together with a representation of the observable algebra includingoperators of quantum geometry. in particular, we consider the holonomy-fluxalgebra of (2+1)-dimensional euclidean loop quantum gravity, and construct anew representation of this algebra that incorporates a positive cosmologicalconstant. the vacuum state underlying our representation is defined by theturaev-viro tqft. we therefore construct here a generalization, or moreprecisely a quantum deformation at root of unity, of the previously-introducedsu(2) bf representation. the extended turaev-viro tqft provides a descriptionof the excitations on top of the vacuum, which are essential to allow for arepresentation of the holonomies and fluxes. these excitations agree with theones induced by massive and spinning particles, and therefore the frameworkpresented here allows automatically for a description of the coupling of suchmatter to (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant. the newrepresentation presents a number of advantages over the representations whichexist so far. it possesses a very useful finiteness property which guaranteesthe discreteness of spectra for a wide class of quantum (intrinsic andextrinsic) geometrical operators. the notion of basic excitations leads to afusion basis which offers exciting possibilities for constructing states withinteresting global properties. the work presented here showcases how theframework of extended tqfts can help design new representations and understandthe associated notion of basic excitations. this is essential for theconstruction of the dynamics of quantum gravity, and will enable the study ofpossible phases of spin foam models and group field theories from a newperspective.
