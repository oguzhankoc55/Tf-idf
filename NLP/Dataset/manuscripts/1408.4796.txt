novel exact charged mass distribution in classical field theory and the  notion of point-like elementary electric charge the existence of stable, charged elementary 'point particles' still is abasically unsolved puzzle in theoretical physics. e.g., in quantumelectrodynamics the infinite self-energy of the dirac point electron is 'sweptunder the carpet' by renormalizing its mass. the present work takes a freshlook at the problem by including gravity---without resorting to string theory.using einstein's equations for the gravitational fields in a general staticisotropic metric with the full energy-momentum tensor (for the charged materialmass and the electromagnetic fields) as the source term, an exact solution witha well-defined characteristic radius emerges where mass and charge accumulate:$r_{\rm c}{=}\sqrt{r_{\rm e}r_o/2}$---with $r_{\rme}{=}e^2\!/4\pi\epsilon_omc^2{\approx}10^{-15}$m being the 'classical' electronradius and where $r_o{=}2mg/c^2\,{\approx}\,10^{-57}$m is the schwarzschildradius belonging to the observable mass $m{\approx}10^{-30}$kg. the novel'einstein-maxwell' gravitational electron radius can also be written as $r_{\rmc}{=}\ell_{\rm p}\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm e}}$, where $\ell_{\rm p}{=}\sqrt{\hbarg/c^3}{\approx}10^{-35}$m is the fundamental planck length and $\alpha_{\rme}{=}e^2\!/4\pi\epsilon_o\hbar c{\approx}1/137$ the fine-structure constant,which yields $r_{\rm c}^{\rm electron}{=}1.38063{\times}10^{-36}$m. the impliedabsence of infinite mass renormalization opens up new perspectives for unifyingnon-gravitational quantum theory and non-renormalizable general relativity.  pacs numbers: 04.20.cv, 04.20.jb, 04.20.-q, 04.40.nr, 04.40.-b
