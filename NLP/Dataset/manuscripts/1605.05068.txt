interacting ghost dark energy model: dynamical system analysis we study the impacts of interaction between dark matter and dark energy inthe context of ghost dark energy model. using the dynamical system analysis, weobtain the fixed points of the system for different types of interactions whilethe universe is filled with radiation, matter (including dark matter andluminous matter) and dark energy components. we consider the stability of thefixed points in details for different cases. in all cases there is an unstablematter dominated epoch and a stable late time dark energy dominated phase.however, we find that adding the linear interaction, the evolution of ghostdark energy model does not contain the radiation dominated epoch in the earlytimes which is a necessary point in any cosmic model. this failure resolvedwhen we add the non-linear interaction to the model. we also find an upperbound for the value of the coupling constant of the interaction between darkmatter and dark energy as b &lt; 0.57 . this bound is necessary to have adecelerating and unstable matter dominated phase.
