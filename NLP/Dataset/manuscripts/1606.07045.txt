evading the non-continuity equation in the f(r, t) formalism we present a new approach for the $f(r,t)$ formalism, by exploring the extraterms of its effective energy-momentum tensor $t_{\mu\nu}^{eff}$, namely$\tilde{t}_{\mu\nu}$. those arise from the consideration of quantum effects,which are usually neglected in general relativity and $f(r)$ theories, and aresummed to the usual matter energy-momentum tensor, yielding$t_{\mu\nu}^{eff}=t_{\mu\nu}+\tilde{t}_{\mu\nu}$. purely from the bianchiidentities, the conservation of both parts of the effective energy-momentumtensor is obtained, rather than the non-conservation of the matter one,originally approached in the $f(r,t)$ theories. in this way, the intriguingscenario of matter-creation, which still lacks observational evidences, isevaded. one is left, then, with two sets of cosmological equations to besolved: the friedmann-like equations along with the conservation of$t_{\mu\nu}$ and along with the conservation of $\tilde{t}_{\mu\nu}$. wepresent a physical interpretation for the conservation of the extra terms ofthe effective energy-momentum tensor, which is related to the presence of stiffmatter in the universe. the cosmological features of this approach arepresented and discussed as well as the benefits of evading the matterenergy-momentum tensor non-conservation.
