synthetic approach to the singularity problem we try to convince the reader that the categorical version of differentialgeometry, called synthetic differential geometry (sdg), offers valuable toolswhich can be applied to work with some unsolved problems of general relativity.we do this with respect to the space-time singularity problem. the essentialdifference between the usual differential geometry and sdg is that the latterenriches the real line by introducing infinitesimal of various kinds. owing tothis geometry acquires a tool to penetrate "infinitesimally small" parts of agiven manifold. however, to make use of this tool we must switch from thecategory of sets to some other suitable category. we try two topoi: the topos${\cal g}$ of germ determined ideals and the so-called basel topos ${\cal b}$.the category of manifolds is a subcategory of both of them. in ${\cal g}$, weconstruct a simple model of a contracting sphere. as the sphere shrinks, itscurvature increases, but when the radius of the sphere reaches infinitesimalvalues, the curvature becomes infinitesimal and the singularity is avoided. thetopos ${\cal b}$, unlike the topos ${\cal g}$, has invertible infinitesimal andinfinitely large nonstandard natural numbers. this allows us to see whathappens when a function "goes through a singularity". when changing from thecategory of sets to another topos, one must be ready to switch from classicallogic to intuitionistic logic. this is a radical step, but the logic of theuniverse is not obliged to conform to the logic of our brains.
