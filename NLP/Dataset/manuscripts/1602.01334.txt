symplectically invariant flow equations for n=2, d=4 gauged supergravity  with hypermultiplets we consider n=2 supergravity in four dimensions, coupled to an arbitrarynumber of vector- and hypermultiplets, where abelian isometries of thequaternionic hyperscalar target manifold are gauged. using a static andspherically or hyperbolically symmetric ansatz for the fields, aone-dimensional effective action is derived whose variation yields all theequations of motion. by imposing a sort of dirac charge quantization condition,one can express the complete scalar potential in terms of a superpotential andwrite the action as a sum of squares. this leads to first-order flow equations,that imply the second-order equations of motion. the first-order flow turns outto be driven by hamilton's characteristic function in the hamilton-jacobiformalism, and contains among other contributions the superpotential of thescalars. we then include also magnetic gaugings and generalize the flowequations to a symplectically covariant form. moreover, by rotating the chargesin an appropriate way, an alternative set of non-bps first-order equations isobtained that corresponds to a different squaring of the action. finally, weuse our results to derive the attractor equations for near-horizon geometriesof extremal black holes.
