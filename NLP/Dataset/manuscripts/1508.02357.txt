an improved pipeline to search for gravitational waves from compact  binary coalescence we describe the pycbc all-sky compact-object binary search pipeline, whichhas been used to search for gravitational waves in the first observing run ofadvanced ligo. we give a complete description of the pipeline including thesteps used to identify candidate events, compute their detection statisticvalue and measure their statistical significance. starting with calibratedstrain data streams from the detectors, the pipeline estimates a single averagenoise power spectral density that is used to place a bank of templatewaveforms. high-amplitude noise transients are removed prior to filtering thedata through this bank, and the same template bank is used for all detectors inthe network. for each detector's data stream, in each template, the matchedfilter signal-to-noise ratio is calculated, triggers are identified in thematched filter time series and a chi-squared waveform consistency test isperformed. we describe improved methods for these steps that suppress the noisebackground of the search and reduce the pipeline's computational cost. wedescribe a new method of testing that a gravitational-wave signal is observedin coincidence in a detector network, and describe the methods used to measurethe false alarm rate of the search and the statistical significance ofcandidates events. the new algorithms used and the subsequentcomputational-cost reductions allow the use of a simpler pipeline topology. thepipeline can measure false alarm rate of the search to values ~ 4 orders ofmagnitude smaller than the pipeline used in initial ligo's sixth science runsat no additional computational cost. using data from ligo's science run, weshow that the new algorithms reduce the background noise in the search, givinga ~ 30% increase in sensitive volume for binary neutron star systems.
