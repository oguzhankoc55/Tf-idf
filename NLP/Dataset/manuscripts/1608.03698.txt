self-similar motion of a nambu-goto string we study the self-similar motion of a string in a self-similar spacetime byintroducing the concept of a self-similar string, which is defined as the worldsheet to which a homothetic vector field is tangent. it is shown that in thenambu-goto theory, the equations of motion for a self-similar string reduce tothose for a particle. moreover, under certain conditions such as thehypersurface orthogonality of the homothetic vector field, the equations ofmotion for a self-similar string simplify to the geodesic equations on a(pseudo) riemannian space. as a concrete example, we investigate a self-similarnambu-goto string in a spatially flat friedmann-lema\^itre-robertson-walkerexpanding universe with self-similarity, and obtain solutions of open andclosed strings, which have various nontrivial configurations depending on therate of the cosmic expansion. for instance, we obtain a circular solution thatevolves linearly in the cosmic time while keeping its configuration by thebalance between the effects of the cosmic expansion and string tension. we alsoshow the instability for linear radial perturbation of the circular solutions.
