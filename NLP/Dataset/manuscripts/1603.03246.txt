inertial quantum sensors using light and matter the past few decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to manipulateand coherently control matter-waves. although the duality between particles andwaves has been well tested since de broglie introduced the matter-wave analogof the optical wavelength in 1924, manipulating atoms with a level of coherencethat enables one to use these properties for precision measurements has onlybecome possible with our ability to produce atomic samples exhibitingtemperatures of only a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero. sincethe initial experiments a few decades ago, the field of atom optics hasdeveloped in many ways, with both fundamental and applied significance. theexquisite control of matter waves offers the prospect of a new generation offorce sensors exhibiting unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy, forapplications from navigation and geophysics to tests of general relativity.thanks to the latest developments in this field, the first commercial productsusing this quantum technology are now available. in the future, our ability tocreate large coherent ensembles of atoms will allow us an even more precisecontrol of the matter-wave and the ability to create highly entangled statesfor non-classical atom interferometry.
