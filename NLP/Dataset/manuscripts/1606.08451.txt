mode-sum regularization of $\left\langle \phi^{2} \right\rangle$ in the  angular-splitting method the computation of the renormalized stress-energy tensor or$\left\langle\phi^{2}\right\rangle_{ren}$ in curved spacetime is a challengingtask, at both the conceptual and technical levels. recently we developed a newapproach to compute such renormalized quantities in asymptotically-flat curvedspacetimes, based on the point-splitting procedure. our approach requires thespacetime to admit some symmetry. we already implemented this approach tocompute $\left\langle \phi^{2}\right\rangle _{ren}$ in a stationary spacetimeusing t-splitting, namely splitting in the time-translation direction. here wepresent the angular-splitting version of this approach, aimed for computingrenormalized quantities in a general (possibly dynamical) spherically-symmetricspacetime. to illustrate how the angular-splitting method works, we use it hereto compute $\left\langle \phi^{2}\right\rangle _{ren}$ for a quantum masslessscalar field in schwarzschild background, in various quantum states (boulware,unruh, and hartle-hawking states). we find excellent agreement with the resultsobtained from the t-splitting variant, and also with other methods. our maingoal in pursuing this new mode-sum approach was to enable the computation ofthe renormalized stress-energy tensor in a dynamical spherically symmetricbackground, e.g. an evaporating black hole. the angular-splitting variantpresented here is most suitable to this purpose.
