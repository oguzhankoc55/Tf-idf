hydro-elastic complementarity in black branes at large d we obtain the effective theory for the non-linear dynamics of blackbranes---both neutral and charged, in asymptotically flat or anti-desitterspacetimes---to leading order in the inverse-dimensional expansion. we findthat black branes evolve as viscous fluids, but when they settle down they aremore naturally viewed as solutions of an elastic soap-bubble theory. the twoviews are complementary: the same variable is regarded in one case as theenergy density of the fluid, in the other as the deformation of the elasticmembrane. the large-d theory captures finite-wavelength phenomena beyond theconventional reach of hydrodynamics. for asymptotically flat charged blackbranes (either reissner-nordstrom or p-brane-charged black branes) it yieldsthe non-linear evolution of the gregory-laflamme instability at large d and itsendpoint at stable non-uniform black branes. for reissner-nordstrom ads blackbranes we find that sound perturbations do not propagate (have purely imaginaryfrequency) when their wavelength is below a certain charge-dependent value. wealso study the polarization of black branes induced by an external electricfield.
