on the weak-field limit of pleba\'nski class electrodynamics pleba\'nski's class of nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics is considered whichis for several reasons of interest at the present time. in particular thequestion is answered under which circumstances maxwell's original fieldequations are recovered approximately and which post-maxwellian effects couldarrise. to this end a weak field approximation method is developed allowing tocalculate post-maxwellian corrections up to nth order. in some respect this isanalogue of determining "post-newtonian" corrections from relativisticmechanics by a low velocity approximation. as a result we got a series oflinear field equations which can be solved order by order. in this context thesolutions of the lower orders occur as source terms inside the higher orderfield equations and represent a "post-maxwellian" self-interaction of theelectromagnetic field which increases order by order. one has to decide betweenproblems with and without external source-terms, because without also highfrequency solutions can be approximately described by maxwell's originalequations. the higher order approximations which describe "post-maxwellian"effects can give rise for experimental tests of pleba\'nksi's class. finallytwo boundary value problems are discussed to have examples at hand.
