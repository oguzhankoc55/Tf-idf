a geodesic model in conformal superspace in this paper, i look for the most general geometrodynamical symmetriescompatible with spatial relational principles. i argue that they lead either toa completely static universe, or one embodying spatial conformaldiffeomorphisms. demanding locality for an action compatible with theseprinciples severely limits its form, both for the gravitational part as well asall matter couplings. the simplest and most natural choice for pure gravity hastwo propagating physical degrees of freedom (and no refoliation-invariance).the system has a geometric interpretation as a geodesic model in infinitedimensional conformal superspace. conformal superspace is a stratifiedmanifold, with different strata corresponding to different isometry groups.choosing space to be (homeomorphic to) $s^3$, conformal superspace has apreferred stratum with maximal stabilizer group. this stratum consists of asingle point -- corresponding to the conformal geometry of the round 3-sphere.this is the most homogeneous non-degenerate geometry. the path integraltransition amplitude from this special initial condition defines a unique,static, wave-functional over conformal superspace. this and the lack ofrefoliation invariance allow me to implement an unusual sort of gauge-fixing:given the initial representative of the gauge orbit, it fixes the pathvelocities to be parallel propagated, i.e. it fixes a horizontal lift for eachpath in the principal fiber bundle as opposed to a section of the principalfiber bundle, as is usually done. this facilitates the writing of thefadeev-popov determinant for our system and its brst symmetries, and completelydetermines the gauge-fixed path integral, which can be shown to be weyl-anomalyfree.
