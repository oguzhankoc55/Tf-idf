the principle of the fermionic projector, chapters 0-4 the "principle of the fermionic projector" provides a new mathematicalframework for the formulation of physical theories and is a promising approachfor physics beyond the standard model. the book begins with a brief review ofrelativity, relativistic quantum mechanics and classical gauge theories, withthe emphasis on the basic physical concepts and the mathematical foundations.the external field problem and klein's paradox are discussed and then resolvedby introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-timewhich generalizes the notion of the dirac sea. the mathematical core of thebook is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employmethods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. thefermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variationalprinciples in space-time. the mathematical tools for the analysis of thecorresponding euler-lagrange equations are developed. a particular variationalprinciple is proposed which gives rise to an effective interaction showing manysimilarities to the interactions of the standard model.  the main chapters of the book are easily accessible for beginning graduatestudents in mathematics or physics. several appendices provide supplementarymaterial which will be useful to the experienced researcher.
