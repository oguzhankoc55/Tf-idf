thermodynamics of the variable modified chaplygin gas a cosmological model with a new variant of chaplygin gas obeying an equationof state(eos), $p = a\rho - \frac{b}{\rho^{\alpha}}$ where $b= b_{0}a^{n}$ isinvestigated in the context of its thermodynamical behaviour. here $b_{0}$ and$n$ are constants and $a$ is the scale factor. we show that the equation ofstate of this `variable modified chaplygin gas' (vmcg) can describe the currentaccelerated expansion of the universe. following standard thermodynamicalcriteria we mainly discuss the classical thermodynamical stability of the modeland find that the new parameter, $n$ introduced in vmcg plays a crucial role indetermining the stability considerations and should always be \emph{negative.}we further observe that although the earlier model of lu explains many of thecurrent observational findings of different probes it fails the desirable testsof thermodynamical stability. we also note that for $n &lt; 0$ our model points toa phantom type of expansion which, however, is found to be compatible withcurrent sne ia observations and cmb anisotropy measurements. further the thirdlaw of thermodynamics is obeyed in our case. our model is very general in thesense that many of earlier works in this field may be obtained as a specialcase of our solution. an interesting point to note is that the model alsoapparently suggests a smooth transition from the big bang to the big rip in itswhole evaluation process.
