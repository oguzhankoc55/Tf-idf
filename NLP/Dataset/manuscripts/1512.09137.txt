on the "spin connection foam" picture of quantum gravity from  precanonical quantization precanonical quantization is based on a generalization of the hamiltonianformalism to field theory, the so-called de donder-weyl (dw) theory, which doesnot require a spacetime splitting and treats the space-time variables on anequal footing. quantum dynamics is described by a precanonical wave function onthe finite dimensional space of field coordinates and space-time coordinates,which satisfies a partial derivative precanonical schr\"odinger equation. thestandard qft in the functional schr\"odinger representation can be derived fromthe precanonical quantization in a limiting case. an analysis of theconstraints within the dw hamiltonian formulation of the einstein-palatinivielbein formulation of gr and quantization of the generalized dirac bracketsdefined on differential forms lead to the covariant precanonical schr\"odingerequation for quantum gravity. the resulting dynamics of quantum gravity isdescribed by the wave function or transition amplitudes on the total space ofthe bundle of spin connections over space-time. thus, precanonical quantizationleads to the "spin connection foam" picture of quantum geometry represented bya generally non-gaussian random field of spin connection coefficients, whoseprobability distribution is given by the precanonical wave function. thenormalizability of precanonical wave functions is argued to lead to thequantum-gravitational avoidance of curvature singularities. possibleconnections with lqg are briefly discussed.
