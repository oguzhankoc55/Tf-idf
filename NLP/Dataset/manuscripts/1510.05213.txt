new solutions of exotic charged black holes and their stability we find a class of charged black hole solutions in third order lovelockgravity. to obtain this class of solutions, we are not confined to the usualassumption of maximal symmetry on the horizon and will consider the solutionwhose boundary is einstein space with supplementary conditions on its weyltensor. the weyl tensor of such exotic horizons exposes two charge-likeparameter to the solution. these parameters in addition with the electriccharge, cause different features in compare with the charged solution withconstant-curvature horizon. for this class of asymptotically (a)ds solutions,the electric charge dominates the behavior of the metric as r goes to zero, andthus the central singularity is always timelike. we also compute thethermodynamic quantities for these solutions and will show that the first lawof thermodynamics is satisfied. we also show that the extreme black holes withnonconstant-curvature horizons whose ricci scalar are zero or a positiveconstant could exist depending on the value of the electric charge andcharged-like parameters. finally, we investigate the stability of the blackholes by analyzing the behavior of free energy and heat capacity specially inthe limits of small and large horizon radius. we will show that in contrastwith charged solution with constant-curvature horizon, a phase transitionoccurs between very small and small black holes from a stable phase to anunstable one, while the large black holes show stability to both perturbativeand non-perturbative fluctuations.
