surface area products for kerr-taub-nut space-time we examine properties of the inner and outer horizon thermodynamics oftaub-nut (newman-unti-tamburino) and kerr-taub-nut (ktn) black hole (bh) infour dimensional \emph{lorentzian geometry}. we compare and contrasted theseproperties with the properties of reissner nordstr{\o}m (rn) bh and kerr bh. wefocus on "area product", "entropy product", "irreducible mass product" of theevent horizon and cauchy horizons. due to mass-dependence, we speculate thatthese products have no beautiful quantization feature. nor does it has anyuniversal property. we further observe that the \emph{first law} of bhthermodynamics and \emph {smarr-gibbs-duhem} relations do not hold for taub-nut(tn) and ktn bh in lorentzian regime. the failure of these aforementionedfeatures are due to presence of the non-trivial nut charge which makes thespace-time to be asymptotically non-flat, in contrast with rn bh and kerr bh.the another reason of the failure is that lorentzian tn and lorentzian ktngeometry contains \emph{dirac-misner type singularity}, which is amanifestation of a non-trivial topological twist of the manifold. the blackhole \emph{mass formula} and \emph{christodoulou-ruffini mass formula} for tnand ktn bhs are also computed. this thermodynamic product formulae gives usfurther understanding to the nature of bh entropy (inner and outer) at themicroscopic level.
