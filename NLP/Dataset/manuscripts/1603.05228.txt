finite temperature fermion condensate, charge and current densities in a  (2+1)-dimensional conical space we evaluate the fermion condensate and the expectation values of the chargeand current densities for a massive fermionic field in (2+1)-dimensionalconical spacetime with a magnetic flux located at the cone apex. theconsideration is done for both irreducible representations of the cliffordalgebra. the expectation values are decomposed into the vacuum expectationvalues and contributions coming from particles and antiparticles. all thesecontributions are periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equalto the flux quantum. related to the non-invariance of the model under theparity and time-reversal transformations, the fermion condensate and the chargedensity have indefinite parity with respect to the change of the signs of themagnetic flux and chemical potential. the expectation value of the radialcurrent density vanishes. the azimuthal current density is the same for boththe irreducible representations of the clifford algebra. it is an odd functionof the magnetic flux and an even function of the chemical potential. thebehavior of the expectation values in various asymptotic regions of theparameters are discussed in detail. in particular, we show that for points nearthe cone apex the vacuum parts dominate. for a massless field with zerochemical potential the fermion condensate and charge density vanish. simpleexpressions are derived for the part in the total charge induced by the planarangle deficit and magnetic flux. combining the results for separate irreduciblerepresentations, we also consider the fermion condensate, charge and currentdensities in parity and time-reversal symmetric models. possible applicationsto graphitic nanocones are discussed.
