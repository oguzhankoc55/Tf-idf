hidden symmetries of the higgs oscillator and the conformal algebra we give a solution to the long-standing problem of constructing thegenerators of hidden symmetries of the quantum higgs oscillator, a particle ona d-sphere moving in a central potential varying as the inverse cosine-squaredof the polar angle. this superintegrable system is known to possess a richalgebraic structure, including a hidden su(d) symmetry that can be deduced fromclassical conserved quantities and degeneracies of the quantum spectrum. thequantum generators of this su(d) have not been constructed thus far, except atd=2, and naive quantization of classical conserved quantities leads to deformedlie algebras with quadratic terms in the commutation relations. the nonlocalgenerators we obtain here satisfy the standard su(d) lie algebra, and theirconstruction relies on a recently discovered realization of the conformalalgebra, which contains a complete set of raising and lowering operators forthe higgs oscillator. this operator structure has emerged from a relationbetween the higgs oscillator schroedinger equation and the klein-gordonequation in anti-de sitter spacetime. from such a point-of-view, theconstruction of the hidden symmetry generators reduces to manipulations withinthe abstract conformal algebra so(d,2).
