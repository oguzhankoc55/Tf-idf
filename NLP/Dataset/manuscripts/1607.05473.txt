relativistic gravity gradiometry: the mashhoon--theiss effect in general relativity, relativistic gravity gradiometry involves themeasurement of the relativistic tidal matrix, which is theoretically obtainedfrom the projection of the riemann curvature tensor onto the orthonormal tetradframe of an observer. the observer's 4-velocity vector defines its localtemporal axis and its local spatial frame is defined by a set of threeorthonormal nonrotating gyro directions. the general tidal matrix for thetimelike geodesics of kerr spacetime has been calculated by marck\cite{marck}.we are interested in the measured components of the curvature tensor along theinclined "circular" geodesic orbit of a test mass about a slowly rotatingastronomical object of mass $m$ and angular momentum $j$. therefore, wespecialize marck's results to such a "circular" orbit that is tilted withrespect to the equatorial plane of the kerr source. to linear order in $j$, werecover the mashhoon--theiss effect, which is due to a small denominator("resonance") phenomenon involving the frequency of geodetic precession. themashhoon--theiss effect shows up as a special long-period gravitomagnetic partof the relativistic tidal matrix. the physical interpretation of this effect isbriefly discussed.
