black holes turn white fast, otherwise stay black: no half measures recently, various authors have proposed that the first ultraviolet effect onthe gravitational collapse of massive stars to black holes is the transitionbetween a black-hole geometry and a white-hole geometry, though their proposalsare radically different in terms of their physical interpretation andcharacteristic time scales [1,2]. several decades ago, it was shown by eardleythat white holes are highly unstable to the accretion of small amounts ofmatter, being rapidly turned into black holes [3]. studying the crossing ofnull shells on geometries describing the black-hole to white-hole transition,we obtain the conditions for the instability to develop in terms of theparameters of these geometries. we conclude that transitions with longcharacteristic time scales are pathologically unstable: occasionalperturbations away from the perfect vacuum around these compact objects, evenif being imperceptibly small, suffocate the white hole explosion. on the otherhand, geometries with short characteristic time scales are shown to be robustagainst perturbations, so that the corresponding processes could take place inreal astrophysical scenarios. this motivates a conjecture about the transitionamplitudes of different decay channels for black holes in a suitableultraviolet completion of general relativity.
