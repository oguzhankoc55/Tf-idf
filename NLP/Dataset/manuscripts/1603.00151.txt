gravitational wave memory in ds$_{4+2n}$ and 4d cosmology we argue that massless gravitons in all even dimensional de sitter (ds)spacetimes higher than two admit a linear memory effect arising from theirpropagation inside the null cone. assume that gravitational waves (gws) arebeing generated by an isolated source, and over only a finite period of time.outside of this time interval, suppose the shear-stress of the gw sourcebecomes negligible relative to its energy-momentum and its mass quadrupolemoments settle to static values. we then demonstrate, the transverse-traceless(tt) gw contribution to the perturbation of any ds$_{4+2n}$ written in aconformally flat form -- after the source has ceased and the primary gw trainhas passed -- amounts to a spacetime constant shift in the flat metricproportional to the difference between the tt parts of the source's final andinitial mass quadrupole moments. as a byproduct, we present solutions toeinstein's equations linearized about de sitter backgrounds of all dimensionsgreater than three. we then point out there is a similar but approximate tailinduced linear gw memory effect in 4d matter dominated universes. our work hereserves to improve upon and extend the 4d cosmological results ofarxiv:1504.06337, which in turn preceded complementary work by bieri, garfinkleand yau (arxiv:1509.01296) and by kehagias and riotto (arxiv:1602.02653).
