on a holographic dark energy model with a nojiri-odintsov cut-off in  general relativity in this paper we consider the models of the accelerated expanding large scaleuniverse~(according to general relativity) containing a generalized holographicdark energy with a nojiri - odintsov cut - off. the second component of thedarkness is assumed to be the pressureless cold dark matter according toobserved symmetries of the large scale universe. moreover, we assume specificforms of the interaction between these two components and besides thecosmographic analysis, we discuss appropriate results from $om$ and $om3$analysis and organize a closer look to the models via the statefinder hierarchyanalysis, too. in this way we study mainly impact of the interaction on thedynamics of the background of our universe~(within specific forms ofinteraction). to complete the cosmographic analysis, the present day values ofthe statefinder parameters $(r,s)$ and $(\omega^{\prime}_{de}, \omega_{de})$has been estimated for all cases and the validity of the generalized second lawof thermodynamics is demonstrated. our study showed that theoretical resultsfrom considered phenomenological models are consistent with the availableobservational data and symmetries.
