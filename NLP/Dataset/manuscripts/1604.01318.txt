the energy-momentum tensor for a dissipative fluid in general relativity considering the growing interest of the astrophysicist community in the studyof dissipative fluids with the aim of getting a more realistic description ofthe universe, we present in this paper a physical analysis of theenergy-momentum tensor of a viscous fluid with heat flux. we introduce thegeneral form of this tensor and, using the approximation of small velocitygradients, we relate the stresses of the fluid with the viscosity coefficients,the shear tensor and the expansion factor. exploiting these relations, we canwrite the stresses in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the normal surface tothe 4-velocity vector of the fluid, and we can also establish a connectionbetween the perfect fluid and the symmetries of the spacetime. on the otherhand, we calculate the energy conditions for a dissipative fluid throughcontractions of the energy-momentum tensor with the 4-velocity vector of anarbitrary observer. this method is interesting because it allows us to computethe conditions in a reasonable easy way and without considering anyapproximation or restriction on the energy-momentum tensor.
