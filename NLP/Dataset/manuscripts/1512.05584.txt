solution phase space and conserved charges: a general formulation for  charges associated with exact symmetries we provide a general formulation for calculating conserved charges forsolutions to generally covariant gravitational theories with possibly otherinternal gauge symmetries, in any dimensions and with generic asymptoticbehaviors. these solutions are generically specified by a number of exact(continuous, global) symmetries and some parameters. we define "parametricvariations" as field perturbations generated by variations of the solutionparameters. employing the covariant phase space method, we establish that theset of these solutions (up to pure gauge transformations) form a phase space,the \emph{solution phase space}, and that the tangent space of this phase spaceincludes the parametric variations. we then compute conserved charge variationsassociated with the exact symmetries of the family of solutions, caused byparametric variations. integrating the charge variations over a path in thesolution phase space, we define the conserved charges. in particular, werevisit "black hole entropy as a conserved charge" and the derivation of thefirst law of black hole thermodynamics. we show that the solution phase spacesetting enables us to define black hole entropy by an integration over anycompact, codminesion-2, smooth spacelike surface encircling the hole, as wellas to a natural generalization of wald and iyer-wald analysis to casesinvolving gauge fields.
