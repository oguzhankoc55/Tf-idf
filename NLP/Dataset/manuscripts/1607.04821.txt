dirac equation in 2-dimensional curved spacetime, particle creation, and  coupled waveguide arrays when quantum fields are coupled to gravitational fields, spontaneous particlecreation may occur similarly to when they are coupled to externalelectromagnetic fields. gravitational fields can be incorporated as backgroundspacetime if the back-action of matter on it can be neglected, yieldingmodified dirac or klein-gordon equations for elementary fermions and bosonsrespectively. the semi-classical description predicts particle creation in manyscenarios including expanding universe, near the event horizon of a black hole(the hawking effect), and an accelerating observer in flat spacetime (the unruheffect). in this work, we give a pedagogical introduction to the dirac equationin a general 2d spacetime and show examples of spinor wave packet dynamics insome background spacetimes. in particular, we cover the phenomenon of particlecreation in a time-dependent metric. photonic analogs of these effects are thenproposed, where classical light propagating in an array of coupled waveguidesprovides a visualisation of the dirac spinor propagating in curved 2dspacetime. the extent to which such a single-particle description can be saidto mimic particle creation is discussed.
