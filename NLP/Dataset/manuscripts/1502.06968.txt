invariant set theory and the symbolism of quantum measurement elements of a novel theory of quantum physics are developed, synthesising therole of symbolism in describing quantum measurement and in the topologicalrepresentation of fractal invariant sets in nonlinear dynamical systems theory.in this synthesis, the universe $u$ is treated as an isolated deterministicdynamical system evolving precisely on a measure-zero fractal invariant subset$i_u$ of its state space. a non-classical approach to the physics of $u$ isdeveloped by treating the geometry of $i_u$ as more primitive than dynamicalevolution equations on $i_u$. a specific symbolic representation of $i_u$ isconstructed which encodes quaternionic multiplication and from which thestatistical properties of complex hilbert space vectors are emergent. thehilbert space itself arises as the singular limit of invariant set theory as afractal parameter $n \rightarrow \infty$. although the hilbert space of quantumtheory is counterfactually complete, the measure-zero set $i_u$ iscounterfactually incomplete, no matter how large is $n$. such incompletenessallows reinterpretations of familiar quantum phenomena, consistent with realismand local causality. the non-computable nature of $i_u$ ensures that thesereinterpretations are neither conspiratorial nor retrocausal and, through ahomeomorphism with the ring of $2^n$-adic integers, are robust to noise andhence not fine tuned. the non-commutativity of hilbert space observablesemerges from the symbolic representation of $i_u$ through the genericnumber-theoretic incommensurateness of $\phi/\pi$ and $\cos \phi$. invariantset theory implies a much stronger synergy between cosmology and quantumphysics than exists in contemporary theory, suggesting a novel approach tosynthesising gravitational and quantum physics and providing new perspectiveson the dark universe and information loss in black holes.
