electrically charged kerr black holes with scalar hair we construct electrically charged kerr black holes (bhs) with scalar hair.firstly, we take an uncharged scalar field, interacting with theelectromagnetic field only indirectly, via the background metric. thecorresponding family of solutions, dubbed kerr-newman bhs with ungauged scalarhair, reduces to (a sub-family of) kerr-newman bhs in the limit of vanishingscalar hair and to uncharged rotating boson stars in the limit of vanishinghorizon. it adds one extra parameter to the uncharged solutions: the totalelectric charge. this leading electromagnetic multipole moment is unaffected bythe scalar hair and can be computed by using gauss's law on any closed2-surface surrounding (a spatial section of) the event horizon. by contrast,the first sub-leading electromagnetic multipole -- the magnetic dipole moment--, gets suppressed by the scalar hair, such that the gyromagnetic ratio isalways smaller than the kerr-newman value ($g=2$). secondly, we consider agauged scalar field and obtain a family of kerr-newman bhs with gauged scalarhair. the electrically charged scalar field now stores a part of the totalelectric charge, which can only be computed by applying gauss' law at spatialinfinity and introduces a new solitonic limit -- electrically charged rotatingboson stars. in both cases, we analyse some physical properties of thesolutions.
