0903.3242	kinematic signatures of subvirial initial conditions in young clusters	motivated by kinematic observations of young embedded clusters, this paperexplores possible kinematic signatures produced by asphericity and departuresfrom initial virial equilibrium in these systems. specifically, the kinematicquantity that is measured and calculated in this study is the distribution ofthe line-of-sight velocities as a function of position along the cluster.although clusters are found within a wide range of sizes, we focus on theregime with stellar membership $n \sim 10^3$. the gravitational potential ofthese young clusters is dominated by the gas, and the geometry of the gasdistribution is generalized to include axisymmetric (and triaxial) forms. withthis loss of symmetry, the kinematic results thus depend on viewing angle. thiswork also considers the stars to begin their trajectories with subvirialspeeds, as indicated by observations of core motions in such clusters. ourresults determine the conditions necessary for the kinematic signature todisplay interesting structure, i.e., a non-spherical potential, a viewing anglethat is not along one of the principal axes, and subvirial starting conditions.we characterize the effects on this signature due to projection angle, initialstellar velocities, cluster elongation, and star formation efficiency. finally,we compare our theoretical results to recent kinematic observations of theorion nebula cluster; we find that the observations can be explained providedthat the cluster is non-spherical, starts with subvirial initial velocities,and is not viewed along a principal axis.

0906.1954	hill's equation with random forcing parameters: the limit of delta  function barriers	this paper considers random hill's equations in the limit where the periodicforcing function becomes a dirac delta function. for this class of equations,the forcing strength $q_k$, the oscillation frequency $\af_k$, and the periodare allowed to vary from cycle to cycle. such equations arise in astrophysicalorbital problems in extended mass distributions, in the reheating problem forinflationary cosmologies, and in periodic schr{\"o}dinger equations. the growthrates for solutions to the periodic differential equation can be described by amatrix transformation, where the matrix elements vary from cycle to cycle.working in the delta function limit, this paper addresses several coupledissues: we find the growth rates for the $2 \times 2$ matrices that describethe solutions. this analysis is carried out in the limiting regimes of bothlarge $q_k \gg 1$ and small $q_k \ll 1$ forcing strength parameters. for thelatter case, we present an alternate treatment of the dynamics in terms of afokker-planck equation, which allows for a comparison of the two approaches.finally, we elucidate the relationship between the fundamental parameters$(\af_k,q_k)$ appearing in the stochastic differential equation and the matrixelements that specify the corresponding discrete map. this work providesanalytic -- and accurate -- expressions for the growth rates of thesestochastic differential equations in both the $q_k \gg1 $ and the $q_k \ll 1$limits.

0906.4030	general analysis of type i planetary migration with stochastic  perturbations	this paper presents a generalized treatment of type i planetary migration inthe presence of stochastic perturbations. in many planet-forming disks, thetype i migration mechanism, driven by asymmetric torques, acts on a short timescale and compromises planet formation. if the disk also supports mhdinstabilities, however, the corresponding turbulent fluctuations produceadditional stochastic torques that modify the steady inward migration scenario.this work studies the migration of planetary cores in the presence ofstochastic fluctuations using complementary methods, including a fokker-planckapproach and iterative maps. stochastic torques have two main effects: [1]through outward diffusion, a small fraction of the planetary cores can survivein the face of type i inward migration. [2] for a given starting condition, theresult of any particular realization of migration is uncertain, so that resultsmust be described in terms of the distributions of outcomes. in addition toexploring different regimes of parameter space, this paper considers theeffects of the outer disk boundary condition, varying initial conditions, andtime-dependence of the torque parameters. for disks with finite radii, thefraction of surviving planets decreases exponentially with time. we find thesurvival fractions and decay rates for a range of disk models, and find theexpected distribution of locations for surviving planets. for expected diskproperties, the survival fraction lies in the range $0.01 &lt; p_s &lt; 0.1$.

0908.1380	migration of extrasolar planets: effects from x-wind accretion disks	magnetic fields are dragged in from the interstellar medium during thegravitational collapse that forms star/disk systems. consideration of meanfield magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) in these disks shows that magnetic effectsproduce subkeplerian rotation curves and truncate the inner disk. this letterexplores the ramifications of these predicted disk properties for the migrationof extrasolar planets. subkeplerian flow in gaseous disks drives a newmigration mechanism for embedded planets and modifies the gap opening processesfor larger planets. this subkeplerian migration mechanism dominates over type imigration for sufficiently small planets (m_p &lt; 1 m_\earth) and/or close orbits(r &lt; 1 au). although the inclusion of subkeplerian torques shortens the totalmigration time by only a moderate amount, the mass accreted by migratingplanetary cores is significantly reduced. truncation of the inner disk edge(for typical system parameters) naturally explains final planetary orbits withperiods p=4 days. planets with shorter periods p=2 days can be explained bymigration during fu-ori outbursts, when the mass accretion rate is high and thedisk edge moves inward. finally, the midplane density is greatly increased atthe inner truncation point of the disk (the x-point); this enhancement, inconjunction with continuing flow of gas and solids through the region, supportsthe in situ formation of giant planets.

0910.4679	dynamical evolution of young embedded clusters: a parameter space survey	this paper investigates the dynamical evolution of embedded stellar clustersfrom the protocluster stage, through the embedded star-forming phase, and outto ages of 10 myr -- after the gas has been removed from the cluster. therelevant dynamical properties of young stellar clusters are explored over awide range of possible star formation environments using n-body simulations.many realizations of equivalent initial conditions are used to produce robuststatistical descriptions of cluster evolution including the cluster boundfraction, radial probability distributions, as well as the distributions ofclose encounter distances and velocities. these cluster properties arepresented as a function of parameters describing the initial configuration ofthe cluster, including the initial cluster membership n, initial stellarvelocities, cluster radii, star formation efficiency, embedding gas dispersaltime, and the degree of primordial mass segregation. the results of thisparameter space survey, which includes about 25,000 simulations, provide astatistical description of cluster evolution as a function of the initialconditions. we also present a compilation of the fuv radiation fields providedby these same cluster environments. the output distributions from this studycan be combined with other calculations, such as disk photoevaporation modelsand planetary scattering cross sections, to ascertain the effects of thecluster environment on the processes involved in planet formation.

0708.0335	eccentricity evolution of giant planet orbits due to circumstellar disk  torques	the extrasolar planets discovered to date possess unexpected orbitalelements. most orbit their host stars with larger eccentricities and smallersemi-major axes than similarly sized planets in our own solar system do. it isgenerally agreed that the interaction between giant planets and circumstellardisks (type ii migration) drives these planets inward to small radii, but theeffect of these same disks on orbital eccentricity, e, is controversial.several recent analytic calculations suggest that disk-planet interactions canexcite eccentricity, while numerical studies generally produce eccentricitydamping. this paper addresses this controversy using a quasi-analytic approach,drawing on several preceding analytic studies. this work refines the currenttreatment of eccentricity evolution by removing several approximations from thecalculation of disk torques. we encounter neither uniform damping nor uniformexcitation of orbital eccentricity, but rather a function de/dt that varies inboth sign and magnitude depending on eccentricity and other solar systemproperties. most significantly, we find that for every combination of disk andplanet properties investigated herein, corotation torques produce negativevalues of de/dt for some range in e within the interval [0.1, 0.5]. ifcorotation torques are saturated, this region of eccentricity dampingdisappears, and excitation occurs on a short timescale of less than 0.08 myr.thus, our study does not produce eccentricity excitation on a timescale of afew myr -- we obtain either eccentricity excitation on a short time scale, oreccentricity damping on a longer time scale. finally, we discuss theimplications of this result for producing the observed range in extrasolarplanet eccentricity.

0708.3101	orbital instabilities in a triaxial cusp potential	this paper constructs an analytic form for a triaxial potential thatdescribes the dynamics of a wide variety of astrophysical systems, includingthe inner portions of dark matter halos, the central regions of galacticbulges, and young embedded star clusters. specifically, this potential resultsfrom a density profile of the form $\rho (m) \propto m^{-1}$, where the radialcoordinate is generalized to triaxial form so that $m^2 = x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 +z^2/c^2 $. using the resulting analytic form of the potential, and thecorresponding force laws, we construct orbit solutions and show that a robustorbit instability exists in these systems. for orbits initially confined to anyof the three principal planes, the motion in the perpendicular direction can beunstable. we discuss the range of parameter space for which these orbits areunstable, find the growth rates and saturation levels of the instability, anddevelop a set of analytic model equations that elucidate the essential physicsof the instability mechanism. this orbit instability has a large number ofastrophysical implications and applications, including understanding theformation of dark matter halos, the structure of galactic bulges, the survivalof tidal streams, and the early evolution of embedded star clusters.

1009.5717	stability of magnetized disks and implications for planet formation	this paper considers gravitational perturbations in geometrically thin diskswith rotation curves dominated by a central object, but with substantialcontributions from magnetic pressure and tension. the treatment is general, butthe application is to the circumstellar disks that arise during thegravitational collapse phase of star formation. we find the dispersion relationfor spiral density waves in these generalized disks and derive the stabilitycriterion for axisymmetric $(m=0)$ disturbances (the analog of the toomreparameter $q_t$) for any radial distribution of the mass-to-flux ratio$\lambda$. the magnetic effects work in two opposing directions: on one hand,magnetic tension and pressure stabilize the disk against gravitational collapseand fragmentation; on the other hand, they also lower the rotation rate makingthe disk more unstable. for disks around young stars the first effect generallydominates, so that magnetic fields allow disks to be stable for higher surfacedensities and larger total masses. these results indicate that magnetic fieldsact to suppress the formation of giant planets through gravitationalinstability. finally, even if gravitational instability can form a secondarybody, it must lose an enormous amount of magnetic flux in order to become aplanet; this latter requirement represents an additional constraint for planetformation via gravitational instability and places a lower limit on theelectrical resistivity.

0708.4238	ambipolar diffusion in molecular cloud cores and the gravomagneto  catastrophe	this paper re-examines the problem of ambipolar diffusion as a mechanism forthe production and runaway evolution of centrally condensed molecular cloudcores, a process that has been termed the gravomagneto catastrophe. ourcalculation applies in the geometric limit of a highly flattened core andallows for a semi-analytic treatment of the full problem, although physicalfixes are required to resolve a poor representation of the central region. anoteworthy feature of the overall formulation is that the solutions for theambipolar diffusion portion of the evolution for negative times ($t &lt; 0$) matchsmoothly onto the collapse solutions for positive times ($t &gt; 0$). thetreatment shows that the resulting cores display non-zero, butsub-magnetosonic, inward velocities at the end of the diffusion epoch, inagreement with current observations. another important result is the derivationof an analytic relationship between the dimensionless mass to flux ratio$\lambda_0\equiv f_0^{-1}$ of the central regions produced by runaway corecondensation and the dimensionless measure of the rate of ambipolar diffusion$\epsilon$. in conjunction with previous work showing that ambipolar diffusiontakes place more quickly in the presence of turbulent fluctuations, i.e., thatthe effective value of $\epsilon$ can be enhanced by turbulence, the resultanttheory provides a viable working hypothesis for the formation of isolatedmolecular-cloud cores and their subsequent collapse to form stars and planetarysystems.

1011.1486	effects of turbulence, eccentricity damping, and migration rate on the  capture of planets into mean motion resonance	pairs of migrating extrasolar planets often lock into mean motion resonanceas they drift inward. this paper studies the convergent migration of giantplanets (driven by a circumstellar disk) and determines the probability thatthey are captured into mean motion resonance. the probability that such planetsenter resonance depends on the type of resonance, the migration rate, theeccentricity damping rate, and the amplitude of the turbulent fluctuations.this problem is studied both through direct integrations of the full 3-bodyproblem, and via semi-analytic model equations. in general, the probability ofresonance decreases with increasing migration rate, and with increasing levelsof turbulence, but increases with eccentricity damping. previous work has shownthat the distributions of orbital elements (eccentricity and semimajor axis)for observed extrasolar planets can be reproduced by migration models withmultiple planets. however, these results depend on resonance locking, and thisstudy shows that entry into -- and maintenance of -- mean motion resonancedepends sensitively on migration rate, eccentricity damping, and turbulence.

1011.3150	an investigation of the loss of planet-forming potential in intermediate  sized young embedded star clusters	a large fraction of stars forming in our galaxy are born within clustersembedded in giant molecular clouds. in these environments, the background uvradiation fields impinging upon circumstellar disks can often dominate over theradiation fields produced by each disk's central star. as a result, thisbackground radiation can drive the evaporation of circumstellar disks and leadto the loss of planet forming potential within a cluster. this paper presents adetailed analysis of this process for clusters whose stellar membership fallswithin the range $100 \le n \le 1000$. for these intermediate-sized clusters,the background uv field is often dominated by the most massive stellar member.due to the steep slope of the initial mass function, the amount of backgrounduv light that bathes clusters of similar size displays significant variance. asa result, we perform a statistical analysis of this problem by calculatingdistributions of fuv flux values impinging upon star/disk systems for severalcluster scenarios. we find that in the absence of dust attenuation, giantplanet formation would likely be inhibited in approximately half of systemsforming within intermediate-sized clusters regardless of stellar membership. incontrast, the presence of dust can significantly lower this value, with theeffect considerably more pronounced in more populated clusters.

1101.4234	magnetically controlled outflows from hot jupiters	recent observations that indicate that some extrasolar planets observed intransit can experience mass loss from their surfaces. motivated by thesefindings, this paper considers outflows from hot jupiters in the regime wherethe flow is controlled by magnetic fields. given the mass loss rates estimatedfrom current observations --- and from theoretical arguments --- magneticfields will dominate the flow provided that field strength near the planet isgreater than $\sim1$ gauss, comparable to the surface fields of the sun andjupiter. the problem can be separated into an inner regime, near the planet,where the outflow is launched, and an outer regime where the flow follows(primarily) stellar field lines and interacts with the stellar wind. this paperconcentrates on the flow in the inner regime. for a dipole planetary field witha spatially constant background contribution, we construct a set of orthogonalcoordinates that follow the field lines and determine the correspondingdifferential operators. under the assumption of isothermal flow, weanalytically find the conditions required for escaping material to passsmoothly through the sonic transition, and then estimate the mass outflowrates. these magnetically controlled outflows differ significantly fromprevious spherical models: the outflow rates are somewhat smaller, typically${\dot m}$ $\sim 10^{9}$ g/s, and the flow is launched primarily from the polarregions of the planet. in addition, if the stellar wind is strong enough, theflow could be reversed and the planet could gain mass from the star.

1101.5827	on the anomalous radii of the transiting extrasolar planets	we present a systematic evaluation of the agreement between the observedradii of 90 well-characterized transiting extrasolar giant planets and theircorresponding model radii. our model radii are drawn from previously publishedcalculations of core-less giant planets that have attained their asymptoticradii, and which have been tabulated for a range of planet masses andequilibrium temperatures. (we report a two-dimensional polynomial fittingfunction that accurately represents the models). as expected, the model radiiprovide a statistically significant improvement over a null hypothesis that thesizes of giant planets are completely independent of mass and effectivetemperature. as is well known, however, fiducial models provide an insufficientexplanation; the planetary radius anomalies are strongly correlated withplanetary equilibrium temperature. we find that the radius anomalies have abest-fit dependence, ${\cal r}\propto t_{\rm eff}^{\alpha}$, with$\alpha=1.4\pm0.6$. incorporating this relation into the model radii leads tosubstantially less scatter in the radius correlation. the extra temperaturedependence represents an important constraint on theoretical models for hotjupiters. using simple scaling arguments, we find support for the hypothesis ofbatygin and stevenson (2010) that this correlation can be attributed to aplanetary heating mechanism that is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic couplingbetween the planetary magnetic field and near-surface flow that is accompaniedby ohmic dissipation at adiabatic depth. additionally, we find that thetemperature dependence is likely too strong to admit kinetic heating as theprimary source of anomalous energy generation within the majority of theobserved transiting planets.

1109.5104	accretion of rocky planets by hot jupiters	the observed population of hot jupiters displays a stunning variety ofphysical properties, including a wide range of densities and core sizes for agiven planetary mass. motivated by the observational sample, this paper studiesthe accretion of rocky planets by hot jupiters, after the jovian planets havefinished their principal migration epoch and become parked in $\sim4$-dayorbits. in this scenario, rocky planets form later and then migrate inward dueto torques from the remaining circumstellar disk, which also damps the orbitaleccentricity. this mechanism thus represents one possible channel forincreasing the core masses and metallicities of hot jupiters. this paperdetermines probabilities for the possible end states for the rocky planet:collisions with the jovian planets, accretion onto the star, ejection from thesystem, and long-term survival of both planets. these probabilities depend onthe mass of the jovian planet and its starting orbital eccentricity, as well asthe eccentricity damping rate for the rocky planet. since these systems arehighly chaotic, a large ensemble ($n\sim10^3$) of simulations with effectivelyequivalent starting conditions is required. planetary collisions are commonwhen the eccentricity damping rate is sufficiently low, but are rare otherwise.for systems that experience planetary collisions, this work determines thedistributions of impact velocities -- both speeds and impact parameters -- forthe collisions. these velocity distributions help determine the consequences ofthe impacts, e.g., where energy and heavy elements are deposited within thegiant planets.

1109.5948	magnetically controlled accretion flows onto young stellar objects	(abridged) accretion from disks onto young stars is thought to followmagnetic field lines from the inner disk edge to the stellar surface. theaccretion flow thus depends on the geometry of the magnetic field. this paperextends previous work by constructing a collection of orthogonal coordinatesystems, including the corresponding differential operators, where onecoordinate traces the magnetic field lines. this formalism allows for an(essentially) analytic description of the geometry and the conditions requiredfor the flow to pass through sonic points. using this approach, we revisit theproblem of magnetically controlled accretion flow in a dipole geometry, andthen generalize the treatment to consider magnetic fields with multiplecomponents, including dipole, octupole, and split monopole contributions. thisapproach can be generalized further to consider more complex magnetic fieldconfigurations. observations indicate that accreting young stars havesubstantial dipole and octupole components, and that accretion flow istransonic. if the effective equation of state for the fluid is too stiff, theflow cannot pass smoothly through the sonic points in steady state. for amultipole field of order \ell, we derive a constraint on the polytropic index,n&gt;\ell+3/2, required for steady transonic flow to reach free-fall velocities.for octupole fields, inferred on surfaces of t tauri stars, n&gt;9/2, so that theflow must be close to isothermal. the inclusion of octupole field componentsproduces higher densities at the stellar surface and smaller hot spots, whichoccur at higher latitudes; the magnetic truncation radius is also modified.this contribution thus increases our understanding of magnetically controlledaccretion for young stellar objects and can be applied to a variety ofadditional astrophysical problems.

1110.4562	magnetic interactions in pre-main-sequence binaries	young stars typically have strong magnetic fields, so that the magnetospheresof newly formed close binaries can interact, dissipate energy, and producesynchrotron radiation. the v773 tau a binary system, a pair of t tauri starswith a 51 day orbit, displays such a signature, with peak emission taking placenear periastron. this paper proposes that the observed emission arises from thechange in energy stored in the composite magnetic field of the system. we modelthe fields using the leading order (dipole) components and show that thispicture is consistent with current observations. in this model, the observedradiation accounts for a fraction of the available energy of interactionbetween the magnetic fields from the two stars. assuming antisymmetry, wecompute the interaction energy $e_{\rm int}$ as a function of the stellarradii, the stellar magnetic field strengths, the binary semi-major axis, andorbital eccentricity, all of which can be measured independently of thesynchrotron radiation. the variability in time and energetics of thesynchrotron radiation depend on the details of the annihilation of magneticfields through reconnection events, which generate electric fields thataccelerate charged particles, and how those charged particles, especially fastelectrons, are removed from the interaction region. however, the majorqualitative features are well described by the background changes in the globalmagnetic configuration driven by the orbital motion. the theory can be testedby observing a collection of pre-main-sequence binary systems.

1206.5857	effects of collisions with rocky planets on the properties of hot  jupiters	observed hot jupiters exhibit a wide range of physical properties. for agiven mass, many planets have inflated radii, while others are surprisinglycompact and may harbor large central cores. motivated by the observationalsample, this paper considers possible effects from collisions of smaller rockyplanets with gas giant planets. in this scenario, the jovian planets migratefirst and enter into (approximately) 4 day orbits, whereas rocky planets (mass= 0.1-20 that of earth) migrate later and then encounter the gaseous giants.previous work indicates that the collision rates are high for such systems.this paper calculates the trajectories of incoming rocky planets as they orbitwithin the gaseous planets and are subjected to gravitational, frictional, andtidal forces. these collisions always increase the metallicity of the jovianplanets. if the incoming rocky bodies survive tidal destruction and reach thecentral regions, they provide a means of producing large planetary cores. boththe added metallicity and larger cores act to decrease the radii of the gasgiants at fixed mass. the energy released during these collisions provides thejovian planet with an additional heat source; here we determine the radiallayers where kinetic energy of the colliding body is dissipated, including theenergy remaining upon impact with the existing core. this process could havelong-term effects if the colliding body deposits significant energy deep in theinterior, in regions of high opacity. both hot jupiters and newly formed gasgiants have inflated radii, large enough to allow incoming rocky planets tosurvive tidal disruption, enhance the central core mass, and depositsignificant energy (in contrast, denser giant planets with the mass and radiusof jupiter are expected to tidally destroy incoming rocky bodies).

1211.3078	mean motion resonances in exoplanet systems: an investigation into  nodding behavior	motivated by the large number of extrasolar planetary systems that are nearmean motion resonances, this paper explores a related type of dynamicalbehavior known as "nodding". here, the resonance angle of a planetary systemexecutes libration (oscillatory motion) for several cycles, circulates for oneor more cycles, and then enters once again into libration. this type ofcomplicated dynamics can affect our interpretation of observed planetarysystems that are in or near mean motion resonance. this work shows thatplanetary systems in (near) mean motion resonance can exhibit nodding behavior,and outlines the portion of parameter space where it occurs. this problem isaddressed using both full numerical integrations of the planetary systems andvia model equations obtained through expansions of the disturbing function. inthe latter approach, we identify the relevant terms that allow for nodding. thetwo approaches are in agreement, and show that nodding often occurs when asmall body is in an external mean motion resonance with a larger planet. as aresult, the nodding phenomenon can be important for interpreting observationsof transit timing variations, where the existence of smaller bodies is inferredthrough their effects on larger, observed transiting planets. for example, inactively nodding planetary systems, both the amplitude and frequency of thetransit timing variations depend on the observational time window.

1303.3841	evolution of planetary systems with time dependent stellar mass loss	observations indicate that intermediate mass stars, binary stars, and stellarremnants often host planets; a complete explanation of these systems requiresan understanding of how planetary orbits evolve as their central stars losemass. motivated by these dynamical systems, this paper generalizes in twodirections previous studies of orbital evolution in planetary systems withstellar mass loss: [1] many previous treatments focus on constant mass lossrates and much of this work is carried out numerically. here we study a classof single planet systems where the stellar mass loss rate is time dependent.the mass loss rate can be increasing or decreasing, but the stellar mass alwaysdecreases monotonically. for this class of models, we develop analyticapproximations to specify the final orbital elements for planets that remainbound after the epoch of mass loss, and find the conditions required for theplanets to become unbound. we also show that for some mass loss functions,planets become unbound only in the asymptotic limit where the stellar massvanishes. [2] we consider the chaotic evolution for two planet systems withstellar mass loss. here we focus on a model consisting of analogs of jupiter,saturn, and the sun. by monitoring the divergence of initially similartrajectories through time, we calculate the lyapunov exponents of the system.this analog solar system is chaotic in the absence of mass loss with lyapunovtime in the range 5 - 10 myr; we find that the lyapunov time decreases withincreasing stellar mass loss rate, with a nearly linear relationship betweenthe two time scales. taken together, the results of this paper help provide anexplanation for a wide range of dynamical evolution that occurs in solarsystems with stellar mass loss.

1306.0902	exclusion of cosmic rays in protoplanetary disks: stellar and magnetic  effects	(abridged) cosmic rays (crs) are thought to provide an important source ofionization in the outermost and densest regions of protoplanetary disks;however, it is unknown to what degree they are physically present. as isobserved in the solar system, stellar winds can inhibit the propagation ofcosmic rays within the circumstellar environment and subsequently into thedisk. in this work, we explore the hitherto neglected effects of cosmic raymodulation by both stellar winds and magnetic field structures and study howthese processes act to reduce disk ionization rates. we construct atwo-dimensional protoplanetary disk model of a t-tauri star system, focusing onionization from stellar and interstellar fuv, stellar x-ray photons, and cosmicrays. we show that stellar winds can power a heliosphere-like analogue, i.e., a"t-tauriosphere," diminishing cosmic ray ionization rates by several orders ofmagnitude at low to moderate cr energies (e_cr&lt;1 gev). we explore models ofboth the observed solar wind cosmic ray modulation and a highly simplifiedestimate for "elevated" cosmic ray modulation as would be expected from a youngt-tauri star. in the former (solar analogue) case, we estimate the ionizationrate from galactic cosmic rays to be zeta_cr~(0.23-1.4) x 1e-18 s^-1. thisrange of values, which we consider to be the maximum cr ionization rate for thedisk, is more than an order of magnitude lower than what is generally assumedin current models for disk chemistry and physics. in the latter case, i.e., fora "t-tauriosphere," the ionization rate by cosmic rays is zeta_cr&lt;1e-20 s^-1,which is 1000 times smaller than the interstellar value. indeed, if winds areas efficient at cosmic ray modulation as predicted here, short-livedradionuclides (now extinct) would have provided the major source of ionization(zeta_rn~7.3e-19 s^-1) in the planet-forming zone of the young solar nebula.

1307.4368	viscous evolution and photoevaporation of circumstellar disks due to  external fuv radiation fields	this paper explores the effects of fuv radiation fields from external starson circumstellar disk evolution. disks residing in young clusters can beexposed to extreme levels of fuv flux from nearby ob stars, and observationsshow that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated.typical fuv flux levels can be factors of \sim 10^{2} - 10^{4} higher than theinterstellar value. these fields are effective in driving mass loss fromcircumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the hoststar, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitationalpotential well is shallow. we combine viscous evolution (an \alpha-disk model)with an existing fuv photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disklifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, includingmass loss rates, disk masses, and radii. we also consider the effects of x-rayphotoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that fordisks around solar-mass stars, externally-generated fuv fields are often thedominant mechanism in depleting disk material. for sufficiently largeviscosities, fuv fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entirerange of parameter space. disks with viscosity parameter \alpha = 10^{-3} areeffectively dispersed within 1-3 myr; for higher viscosities (\alpha = 10^{-2})disks are dispersed within \sim 0.25 - 0.5 myr. furthermore, disk radii aretruncated to less than \sim100 au, which can possibly affect the formation ofplanets. our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed massesand radii of proplyds in the orion nebula cluster.

1309.0018	radionuclide ionization in protoplanetary disks: calculations of decay  product radiative transfer	we present simple analytic solutions for the ionization rate$\zeta_{\rm{slr}}$ arising from the decay of short-lived radionuclides (slrs)within protoplanetary disks. we solve the radiative transfer problem for thedecay products within the disk, and thereby allow for the loss of radiation atlow disk surface densities; energy loss becomes important outside $r\gtrsim30$for typical disk masses $m_g=0.04$ m$_\odot$. previous studies ofchemistry/physics in these disks have neglected the impact of ionization byslrs, and often consider only cosmic rays (crs), because of the high cr-ratepresent in the ism. however, recent work suggests that the flux of crs presentin the circumstellar environment could be substantially reduced by relativelymodest stellar winds, resulting in severely modulated cr ionization rates,$\zeta_{\rm{cr}}$, equal to or substantially below that of slrs($\zeta_{\rm{slr}}\lesssim10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$). we compute the net ionizingparticle fluxes and corresponding ionization rates as a function of positionwithin the disk for a variety of disk models. the resulting expressions areespecially simple for the case of vertically gaussian disks (frequently assumedin the literature). finally, we provide a power-law fit to the ionization ratein the midplane as a function of gas disk surface density and time. dependingon location in the disk, the ionization rates by slrs are typically in therange $\zeta_{\rm{slr}}\sim(1-10)\times10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$.

1310.2179	magnetic and gravitational disk-star interactions: an interdependence of  pms stellar rotation rates and spin-orbit misalignments	the presence of giant gaseous planets that reside in close proximity to theirhost stars may be a consequence of large-scale radial migration through theproto-planetary nebulae. within the context of this picture, significantorbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planetscan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignmentwith the spin axes of their host stars. therefore, the acquisition of orbitalobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-starinteractions. here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbitmisalignment of sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentumtransfer. we begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotationalevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction andaccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. we devoteparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show thatwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process islargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.specific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surfacefields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order ofmagnitude). subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics ofdisk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and diskproperties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited insystems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. moreover, we showthat the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through anencounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and thedisk-torquing frequency. cumulatively, the model developed herein opens up apreviously unexplored avenue towards understanding star-disk evolution and itsconsequences in a unified manner.

1310.2577	evolution of planetary orbits with stellar mass loss and tidal  dissipation	intermediate mass stars and stellar remnants often host planets, and thesedynamical systems evolve because of mass loss and tides. this paper considersthe combined action of stellar mass loss and tidal dissipation on planetaryorbits in order to determine the conditions required for planetary survival.stellar mass loss is included using a so-called jeans model, described by adimensionless mass loss rate \gamma and an index \beta. we use an analogousprescription to model tidal effects, described here by a dimensionlessdissipation rate \gamma and two indices (q,p). the initial conditions aredetermined by the starting value of angular momentum parameter \eta(equivalently, the initial eccentricity) and the phase \theta of the orbit.within the context of this model, we derive an analytic formula for thecritical dissipation rate \gamma, which marks the boundary between orbits thatspiral outward due to stellar mass loss and those that spiral inward due totidal dissipation. this analytic result\gamma=\gamma(\gamma,\beta,q,p,\eta,\theta) is essentially exact for initiallycircular orbits and holds to within an accuracy of 50% over the entiremulti-dimensional parameter space, where the individual parameters vary byseveral orders of magnitude. for stars that experience mass loss, the stellarradius often displays quasi-periodic variations, which produce correspondingvariations in tidal forcing; we generalize the calculation to include suchpulsations using a semi-analytic treatment that holds to the same accuracy asthe non-pulsating case. these results can be used in many applications, e.g.,to predict/constrain properties of planetary systems orbiting white dwarfs.

1404.3091	effects of turbulence on cosmic ray propagation in protostars and young  star/disk systems	the magnetic fields associated with young stellar objects are expected tohave an hour-glass geometry, i.e., the magnetic field lines are pinched as theythread the equatorial plane surrounding the forming star but merge smoothlyonto a background field at large distances. with this field configuration,incoming cosmic rays experience both a funneling effect that acts to enhancethe flux impinging on the circumstellar disk and a magnetic mirroring effectthat acts to reduce that flux. to leading order, these effects nearly cancelout for simple underlying magnetic field structures. however, the environmentssurrounding young stellar objects are expected to be highly turbulent. thispaper shows how the presence of magnetic field fluctuations affects the processof magnetic mirroring, and thereby changes the flux of cosmic rays strikingcircumstellar disks. turbulence has two principle effects: 1) the (single)location of the magnetic mirror point found in the absence of turbulence isreplaced with a wide distribution of values. 2) the median of the mirror pointdistribution moves outward for sufficiently large fluctuation amplitudes(roughly when $\delta b/b_0&gt;0.2$ at the location of the turbulence-free mirrorpoint); the distribution becomes significantly non-gaussian in this regime aswell. these results may have significant consequences for the ionizationfraction of the disk, which in turn dictates the efficiency with which diskmaterial can accrete onto the central object. a similar reduction in cosmic rayflux can occur during the earlier protostellar stages; the decrease inionization can help alleviate the magnetic braking problem that inhibits diskformation.

1405.5142	distributions of short-lived radioactive nuclei produced by young  embedded stellar clusters	most star formation in the galaxy takes place in clusters, where the mostmassive members can affect the properties of other constituent solar systems.this paper considers how clusters influence star formation and formingplanetary systems through nuclear enrichment from supernova explosions, wheremassive stars deliver short-lived radioactive nuclei (slrs) to their localenvironment. the decay of these nuclei leads to both heating and ionization,and thereby affects disk evolution, disk chemistry, and the accompanyingprocess of planet formation. nuclear enrichment can take place on two spatialscales: [1] within the cluster itself ($\ell\sim1$pc), the slrs are deliveredto the circumstellar disks associated with other cluster members. [2] on thenext larger scale ($\ell\sim2-10$pc), slrs are injected into the backgroundmolecular cloud; these nuclei provide heating and ionization to nearbystar-forming regions, and to the next generation of disks. for the firstscenario, we construct the expected distributions of radioactive enrichmentlevels provided by embedded clusters. clusters can account for the slr massfractions inferred for the early solar nebula, but typical slr abundances arelower by a factor of $\sim10$. for the second scenario, we find thatdistributed enrichment of slrs in molecular clouds leads to comparableabundances. for both the direct and distributed enrichment processes, themasses of $^{26}$al and $^{60}$fe delivered to individual circumstellar diskstypically fall in the range $10-100pm_\odot$ (where$1pm_\odot=10^{-12}m_\odot$). the corresponding ionization rate due to slrstypically falls in the range $\zeta_{slr}\sim1-5\times10^{-19}$ sec$^{-1}$.this ionization rate is smaller than that due to cosmic rays,$\zeta_{cr}\sim10^{-17}$ sec$^{-1}$, but will be important in regions wherecosmic rays are attenuated (e.g., disk mid-planes).

1408.2835	exclusion of cosmic rays in protoplanetary disks. ii. chemical gradients  and observational signatures	the chemical properties of protoplanetary disks are especially sensitive totheir ionization environment. sources of molecular gas ionization includecosmic rays, stellar x-rays and short-lived radionuclides, each of which varieswith location in the disk. this behavior leads to a significant amount ofchemical structure, especially in molecular ion abundances, which is imprintedin their submillimeter rotational line emission. using an observationallymotivated disk model, we make predictions for the dependence of chemicalabundances on the assumed properties of the ionizing field. we calculate theemergent line intensity for abundant molecular ions and simulate sensitiveobservations with the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) fora disk at d=100 pc. the models readily distinguish between high ionizationrates ($\zeta\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ per h$_2$) and below, but it becomesdifficult to distinguish between low ionization models when$\zeta\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. we find that \htdp\ emission is notdetectable for sub-interstellar cr rates with alma (6h integration), and that\ntdp\ emission may be a more sensitive tracer of midplane ionization. hco$^+$traces x-rays and high cr rates ($\zeta_{\rm{cr}}\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$),and provides a handle on the warm molecular ionization properties where co ispresent in the gas. furthermore, species like hco$^+$, which emits from a wideradial region and samples a large gradient in temperature, can exhibitring-like emission as a consequence of low-lying rotational level de-excitationnear the star. this finding highlights a scenario where rings are notnecessarily structural or chemical in nature, but simply a result of theunderlying line excitation properties.

1408.3636	magnetically controlled mass loss from extrasolar planets in close  orbits	we consider the role magnetic fields play in guiding and controllingmass-loss via evaporative outflows from exoplanets that experience uvirradiation. first we present analytic results that account for planetary andstellar magnetic fields, along with mass-loss from both the star and planet. wethen conduct series of numerical simulations for gas giant planets, and varythe planetary field strength, background stellar field strength, uv heatingflux, and planet mass. these simulations show that the flow is magneticallycontrolled for moderate field strengths and even the highest uv fluxes, i.e.,planetary surface fields $b_p\gtrsim 0.3$ gauss and fluxes $f_{uv}\sim10^{6}$erg s$^{-1}$. we thus conclude that outflows from all hot jupiters withmoderate surface fields are magnetically controlled. the inclusion of magneticfields highly suppresses outflow from the night-side of the planet. only themagnetic field lines near the pole are open and allow outflow to occur. thefraction of open field lines depends sensitively on the strength (and geometry)of the background magnetic field from the star, along with the uv heating rate.the net effect of the magnetic field is to suppress the mass loss rate by(approximately) an order of magnitude. finally, some open field lines do notallow the flow to pass smoothly through the sonic point; flow along thesestreamlines does not reach steady-state, resulting in time-variable mass-loss.

1411.2859	on the stability of extrasolar planetary systems and other closely  orbiting pairs	this paper considers the stability of tidal equilibria for planetary systemsin which stellar rotation provides a significant contribution to the angularmomentum budget. we begin by applying classic stability considerations for twobodies to planetary systems --- where one mass is much smaller than the other.the application of these stability criteria to a subset of the kepler sampleindicates that the majority of the systems are not in a stable equilibriumstate. motivated by this finding, we generalize the stability calculation toinclude the quadrupole moment for the host star. in general, a stableequilibrium requires that the total system angular momentum exceeds a minimumvalue (denoted here as $l_x$) and that the orbital angular momentum of theplanet exceeds a minimum fraction of the total. most, but not all, of theobserved planetary systems in the sample have enough total angular momentum toallow an equilibrium state. even with the generalizations of this paper,however, most systems have too little orbital angular momentum (relative to thetotal) and are not in an equilibrium configuration. finally, we consider thetime evolution of these planetary systems; the results constrain the tidalquality factor of the stars and suggest that $10^6\le{q_\ast}\le10^7$.

1411.5431	alignment of protostars and circumstellar disks during the embedded  phase	star formation proceeds via the collapse of a molecular cloud core overmultiple dynamical timescales. turbulence within cores results in a spatiallynon-uniform angular momentum of the cloud, causing a stochastic variation inorientation of the disk forming from the collapsing material. in the absence ofstar-disk angular momentum coupling, such disk-tilting would provide a naturalmechanism for production of primordial spin-orbit misalignments in theresulting planetary systems. however, owing to high accretion rates in theembedded phase of star formation, the inner edge of the circumstellar diskextends down to the stellar surface, resulting in efficient gravitational andaccretional angular momentum transfer between the star and the disk. here, wedemonstrate that the resulting gravitational coupling is sufficient to suppressany significant star-disk misalignment, with accretion playing a secondaryrole. the joint tilting of the star-disk system leads to a stochastic wanderingof star-aligned bipolar outflows. such wandering widens the effective openingangle of stellar outflows, allowing for more efficient clearing of theremainder of the protostar's gaseous envelope. accordingly, the processesdescribed in this work provide an additional mechanism responsible forsculpting the stellar initial mass function (imf).

1412.1491	constraining the x-ray and cosmic ray ionization chemistry of the tw hya  protoplanetary disk: evidence for a sub-interstellar cosmic ray rate	we present an observational and theoretical study of the primary ionizingagents (cosmic rays and x-rays) in the tw hya protoplanetary disk. we use a setof resolved and unresolved observations of molecular ions and other molecularspecies, encompassing eleven lines total, in concert with a grid of diskchemistry models. the molecular ion constraints comprise new data from thesubmillimeter array on hco$^+$, acquired at unprecedented spatial resolution,and data from the literature, including alma observations of n$_2$h$^+$. wevary the model incident cr flux and stellar x-ray spectra and find that twhya's hco$^+$ and n$_2$h$^+$ emission are best fit by a moderately hard x-rayspectra, as would be expected during the "flaring" state of the star, and a lowcr ionization rate, $\zeta_{\rm cr}\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. this low cr rateis the first indication of the presence of cr exclusion by winds and/ormagnetic fields in an actively accreting t tauri disk system. with this newconstraint, our best fit ionization structure predicts a low turbulence"dead-zone" extending from the inner edge of the disk out to $50-65$ au. thisregion coincides with an observed concentration of millimeter grains, and wepropose that the inner region of tw hya is a dust (and possibly planet) growthfactory as predicted by previous theoretical work.

1412.3172	wind-driven exclusion of cosmic rays in the protoplanetary disk  environment	the recent (apparent) passage of the voyager 1 spacecraft into interstellarspace provides us with front-row seats to the complex interplay between thesolar wind and the protective surrounding bubble known as heliosphere. theheliosphere extends radially out to $\sim100$ au from the sun, and within thissphere of influence, the solar wind modulates the incoming flux of galacticcosmic rays (crs), especially those at low energies. newly formed stars, whichsupport both strong magnetic fields and winds, are expected to produceanalogous regions of cr exclusion, perhaps at elevated levels. such young starsare encircled by molecular gas-rich disks, and the net removal of crs from thecircumstellar environment significantly reduces the expected cr ionization ratein the disk gas, most likely by many orders-of-magnitude. the loss ofionization reduces disk turbulence, and thereby affects both planet-formationand active chemical processes in the disk. we present models of cr exclusionand explore the implications for turbulence and for predicted chemicalabundances. we also discuss means by which alma can be used to search forextrasolar heliosphere-analogs around young stars.

1501.00911	cross sections for planetary systems interacting with passing stars and  binaries	most planetary systems are formed within stellar clusters, and theseenvironments can shape their properties. this paper considers scatteringencounters between solar systems and passing cluster members, and calculatesthe corresponding interaction cross sections. the target solar systems aregenerally assumed to have four giant planets, with a variety of startingstates, including circular orbits with the semimajor axes of our planets, amore compact configuration, an ultra-compact state with multiple mean motionresonances, and systems with massive planets. we then consider the effects ofvarying the cluster velocity dispersion, the relative importance of binariesversus single stars, different stellar host masses, and finite startingeccentricities of the planetary orbits. for each state of the initial system,we perform an ensemble of numerical scattering experiments and determine thecross sections for eccentricity increase, inclination angle increase, planetejection, and capture. this paper reports results from over 2 millionindividual scattering simulations. using supporting analytic considerations,and fitting functions to the numerical results, we find a universal formulathat gives the cross sections as a function of stellar host mass, clustervelocity dispersion, starting planetary orbital radius, and final eccentricity.the resulting cross sections can be used in a wide variety of applications. asone example, we revisit constraints on the birth aggregate of our solar systemdue to dynamical scattering and find $n&lt;10^4$ (consistent with previousestimates).

1504.01680	torque on an exoplanet from an anisotropic evaporative wind	winds from short-period earth and neptune mass exoplanets, driven by highenergy radiation from a young star, may evaporate a significant fraction of aplanet's mass. if the momentum flux from the evaporative wind is not alignedwith the planet/star axis, then it can exert a torque on the planet's orbit.using steady-state one-dimensional evaporative wind models we estimate thistorque using a lag angle that depends on the product of the speed of theplanet's upper atmosphere and a flow timescale for the wind to reach its sonicradius. we also estimate the momentum flux from time-dependent one-dimensionalhydrodynamical simulations. we find that only in a very narrow regime in planetradius, mass and stellar radiation flux is a wind capable of exerting asignificant torque on the planet's orbit. similar to the yarkovsky effect, thewind causes the planet to drift outward if atmospheric circulation is prograde(super-rotating) and in the opposite direction if the circulation isretrograde. a close-in super earth mass planet that loses a large fraction ofits mass in a wind could drift a few percent of its semi-major axis. while thischange is small, it places constraints on the evolution of resonant pairs suchas kepler 36 b and c.

1505.01845	the five planets in the kepler-296 binary system all orbit the primary:  a statistical and analytical analysis	kepler-296 is a binary star system with two m-dwarf components separated by0.2 arcsec. five transiting planets have been confirmed to be associated withthe kepler-296 system; given the evidence to date, however, the planets couldin principle orbit either star. this ambiguity has made it difficult toconstrain both the orbital and physical properties of the planets. using bothstatistical and analytical arguments, this paper shows that all five planetsare highly likely to orbit the primary star in this system. we performed amarkov-chain monte carlo simulation using a five transiting planet model,leaving the stellar density and dilution with uniform priors. using importancesampling, we compared the model probabilities under the priors of the planetsorbiting either the brighter or the fainter component of the binary. a modelwhere the planets orbit the brighter component, kepler-296a, is stronglypreferred by the data. combined with our assertion that all five planets orbitthe same star, the two outer planets in the system, kepler-296 ae andkepler-296 af, have radii of 1.53 +/- 0.26 and 1.80 +/- 0.31 r_earth,respectively, and receive incident stellar fluxes of 1.40 +/- 0.23 and 0.62 +/-0.10 times the incident flux the earth receives from the sun. this level ofirradiation places both planets within or close to the circumstellar habitablezone of their parent star.

1505.06158	planets in other universes: habitability constraints on density  fluctuations and galactic structure	motivated by the possibility that different versions of the laws of physicscould be realized within other universes, this paper delineates the galacticparameters that allow for habitable planets and revisits constraints on theamplitude $q$ of the primordial density fluctuations. previous work indicatesthat large values of $q$ lead to galaxies so dense that planetary orbits cannotsurvive long enough for life to develop. small values of $q$ lead to delayedstar formation, loosely bound galaxies, and compromised heavy elementretention. this work generalizes previous treatments: [a] we consider modelsfor the internal structure of galaxies and find the fraction of galactic realestate that allows stable, long-lived planetary orbits. [b] we perform a largeensemble of numerical simulations to estimate cross sections for the disruptionof planetary orbits due to interactions with passing stars. [c] we considerdisruption due to the background radiation fields produced by the galaxies. [d]one consequence of intense galactic background radiation fields is that someportion of the galaxy, denoted as the galactic habitable zone, will provide theright flux levels to support habitable planets for essentially any planetaryorbit. as $q$ increases, the fraction of stars in a galaxy that allow forhabitable planets decreases due to both orbital disruption and the intensebackground radiation. however, the outer parts of the galaxy always allow forhabitable planets, so that the value of $q$ does not have a well-defined upperlimit. moreover, some galactic habitable zones are large enough to support morepotentially habitable planets than the galaxies found in our universe. theseresults suggest that the possibilities for habitability in other universes aresomewhat more favorable and far more diverse than previously imagined.

0805.1681	turbulence in extrasolar planetary systems implies that mean motion  resonances are rare	this paper considers the effects of turbulence on mean motion resonances inextrasolar planetary systems and predicts that systems rarely survive in aresonant configuration. a growing number of systems are reported to be inresonance, which is thought to arise from the planet migration process. ifplanets are brought together and moved inward through torques produced bycircumstellar disks, then disk turbulence can act to prevent planets fromstaying in a resonant configuration. this paper studies this process throughnumerical simulations and via analytic model equations, where both approachesinclude stochastic forcing terms due to turbulence. we explore how theamplitude and forcing time intervals of the turbulence affect the maintenanceof mean motion resonances. if turbulence is common in circumstellar disksduring the epoch of planet migration, with the amplitudes indicated by currentmhd simulations, then planetary systems that remain deep in mean motionresonance are predicted to be rare. more specifically, the fraction of resonantsystems that survive over a typical disk lifetime of 1 myr is of order 0.01. ifmean motion resonances are found to be common, their existence would placetight constraints on the amplitude and duty cycle of turbulent fluctuations incircumstellar disks. these results can be combined by expressing the expectedfraction of surviving resonant systems in the approximate form p_b = c /n_{orb}^{1/2}, where the dimensionless parameter c = 10 - 50 and where n_{orb}is the number of orbits for which turbulence is active.

1511.00009	oscillations of relative inclination angles in compact extrasolar  planetary systems	the kepler mission has detected dozens of compact planetary systems with morethan four transiting planets. this sample provides a collection of close-packedplanetary systems with relatively little spread in the inclination angles ofthe inferred orbits. a large fraction of the observational sample containslimited multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity ofmulti transiting systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutualinclinations, allowing them to appear as single-transiting systems in atransit-based survey. this paper begins an exploration of the effectiveness ofdynamical mechanisms in exciting orbital inclination within exoplanetarysystems of this class. for these tightly packed systems, we determine that theorbital inclination angles are not spread out appreciably throughself-excitation. in contrast, the two kepler multi-planet systems withadditional non-transiting planets are susceptible to oscillations of theirinclination angles, which means their currently observed configurations couldbe due to planet-planet interactions alone. we also provide constraints andpredictions for the expected transit duration variations (tdvs) for eachplanet. in these multi-planet compact kepler systems, oscillations of theirinclination angles are remarkably hard to excite; as a result, they tend toremain continually mutually transiting (cmt-stable). we study this issuefurther by augmenting the planet masses and determining the enhancement factorrequired for oscillations to move the systems out of transit. the oscillationsof inclination found here inform the recently suggested dichotomy in the sampleof solar systems observed by kepler.

1512.03070	hot jupiter breezes: time-dependent outflows from extrasolar planets	we explore the dynamics of magnetically controlled outflows from hotjupiters, where these flows are driven by uv heating from the central star. inthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to passsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not existin general. this paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,where the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. we consider thecase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scalesfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. because the flow cannotpass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-calledbreeze solutions. one manifestation of the time variability is that the flowsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the massoutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. because the flow is subsonic,information can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, inpart, the time scale of the flow variability. this work finds the relationshipbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. inpractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphereof influence of the planet. the measured time variability can be used, inprinciple, to constrain the parameters of the system (e.g., the strengths ofthe surface magnetic fields).

astro-ph;0102126	astronomical engineering: a strategy for modifying planetary orbits	the sun's gradual brightening will seriously compromise the earth's biospherewithin ~ 1e9 years. if earth's orbit migrates outward, however, the biospherecould remain intact over the entire main-sequence lifetime of the sun. in thispaper, we explore the feasibility of engineering such a migration over a longtime period. the basic mechanism uses gravitational assists to (in effect)transfer orbital energy from jupiter to the earth, and thereby enlarges theorbital radius of earth. this transfer is accomplished by a suitableintermediate body, either a kuiper belt object or a main belt asteroid. theobject first encounters earth during an inward pass on its initial highlyelliptical orbit of large (~ 300 au) semimajor axis. the encounter transfersenergy from the object to the earth in standard gravity-assist fashion bypassing close to the leading limb of the planet. the resulting outboundtrajectory of the object must cross the orbit of jupiter; with proper timing,the outbound object encounters jupiter and picks up the energy it lost toearth. with small corrections to the trajectory, or additional planetaryencounters (e.g., with saturn), the object can repeat this process over manyencounters. to maintain its present flux of solar energy, the earth mustexperience roughly one encounter every 6000 years (for an object mass of 1e22g). we develop the details of this scheme and discuss its ramifications.

astro-ph;0301561	migration and dynamical relaxation in crowded systems of giant planets	this paper explores the intermediate-time dynamics of newly formed solarsystems with a focus on possible mechanisms for planetary migration. weconsider two limiting corners of the available parameter space -- crowdedsystems containing n=10 giant planets in the outer solar system, and solarsystems with n=2 planets that are tidally interacting with a circumstellardisk. for a given set of initial conditions, dynamical relaxation leads to awell-defined distribution of possible solar systems. for each class of initialconditions, we perform large numbers of n-body simulations to obtain astatistical description of the possible outcomes. for n=10 planet systems, weconsider several different planetary mass distributions; we also performsecondary sets of simulations to explore chaotic behavior and longer termdynamical evolution. for systems with 10 planets initially populating theradial range 5 - 30 au, these scattering processes naturally produce planetaryorbits with $a\sim1$ au and the full range of possible eccentricity, butshorter period orbits are difficult to achieve. to account for the observedeccentric giant planets, we also explore a mechanism that combines dynamicalscattering and tidal interactions with a circumstellar disk. this combinedmodel naturally produces the observed range of semi-major axis andeccentricity. we discuss the relative merits of the different migrationmechanisms for producing the observed eccentric giant planets.

astro-ph;0304004	formation of supermassive black holes in galactic bulges: a rotating  collapse model consistent with the $\mbh-\sigma$ relation	motivated by the observed correlation between black hole masses $\mbh$ andthe velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of host galaxies, we develop a theoreticalmodel of black hole formation in galactic bulges (this paper generalizes anearlier apj letter). the model assumes an initial state specified by a auniform rotation rate $\omega$ and a density distribution of the form $\rho =\aeff^2 / 2 \pi g r^2$ (so that $\aeff$ is an effective transport speed). theblack hole mass is determined when the centrifugal radius of the collapse flowexceeds the capture radius of the central black hole (for schwarzschildgeometry). this model reproduces the observed correlation between the estimatedblack hole masses and the velocity dispersions of galactic bulges, i.e., $\mbh\approx 10^8 m_\odot (\sigma/200 {\rm km s^{-1}})^4$, where $\sigma = \sqrt{2}\aeff$. to obtain this normalization, the rotation rate $\omega \approx 2\times 10^{15}$ rad/s. the model also defines a bulge mass scale $m_b$. if weidentify the scale $m_b$ with the bulge mass, the model determines the ratio$\mrat$ of black hole mass to the host mass: $\mrat$ $\approx$ 0.0024$(\sigma/200 {\rm km s^{-1}})$, again in reasonable agreement with observedvalues. in this scenario, supermassive black holes form quickly (in $\sim10^5$yr) and are born rapidly rotating (with $a/m \sim 0.9$). this paper also showshow these results depend on the assumed initial conditions; the most importantquantity is the initial distribution of specific angular momentum in thepre-collapse state.

astro-ph;0304561	dynamical stability of earth-like planetary orbits in binary systems	this paper explores the stability of an earth-like planet orbiting a solarmass star in the presence of an outer-lying intermediate mass companion. theoverall goal is to estimate the fraction of binary systems that allowearth-like planets to remain stable over long time scales. we numericallydetermine the planet's ejection time $\tauej$ over a range of companion masses($m_c$ = 0.001 -- 0.5 $m_\odot$), orbital eccentricities $\epsilon$, andsemi-major axes $a$. this suite of $\sim40,000$ numerical experiments suggeststhat the most important variables are the companion's mass $m_c$ and periastrondistance $\rmin$ = $a(1-\epsilon)$ to the primary star. at fixed $m_c$, theejection time is a steeply increasing function of $\rmin$ over the range ofparameter space considered here (although the ejection time has a distributionof values for a given $\rmin$). most of the integration times are limited to 10myr, but a small set of integrations extend to 500 myr. for each companionmass, we find fitting formulae that approximate the mean ejection time as afunction of $\rmin$. these functions can then be extrapolated to longer timescales. by combining the numerically determined ejection times with theobserved distributions of orbital parameters for binary systems, we estimatethat (at least) 50 percent of binaries allow an earth-like planet to remainstable over the 4.6 gyr age of our solar system.

astro-ph;0404383	photoevaporation of circumstellar disks due to external fuv radiation in  stellar aggregates	when stars form in small groups (n = 100 - 500 members), their circumstellardisks are exposed to little euv radiation but a great deal of fuv radiationfrom massive stars in the group. this paper calculates mass loss rates forcircumstellar disks exposed to external fuv radiation. previous work treatedlarge disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius exceedsthe critical radius (supercritical disks) where the sound speed in the fuvheated layer exceeds the escape speed. this paper shows that significant massloss still takes place for subcritical systems. some of the gas extends beyondthe disk edge (above the disk surface) to larger distances where thetemperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. theevaporation rate is a sensitive function of the stellar mass and disk radius,which determine the escape speed, and the external fuv flux, which determinesthe temperature structure of the flow. disks around red dwarfs are readilyevaporated and shrink to disk radii of 15 au on short time scales (10 myr) whenexposed to moderate fuv fields with $g_0$ = 3000. although disks around solartype stars are more durable, these disks shrink to 15 au in 10 myr for intensefuv radiation fields with $g_0$ = 30,000; such fields exist in the central 0.7pc of a cluster with n = 4000 stars. if our solar system formed in the presenceof such strong fuv radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why neptuneand uranus in our solar system are gas poor, whereas jupiter and saturn are gasrich. this mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production ofkuiper belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficientlylarge clusters, such as the hyades, especially for disks associated with lowmass stars.

astro-ph;0504648	lithopanspermia in star forming clusters	this paper considers the lithopanspermia hypothesis in star forming groupsand clusters, where the chances of biological material spreading from one solarsystem to another is greatly enhanced (relative to the field) due to the closeproximity of the systems and lower relative velocities. these effects more thancompensate for the reduced time spent in such crowded environments. this paperuses 300,000 monte carlo scattering calculations to determine the crosssections for rocks to be captured by binaries and provides fitting formulae forother applications. we assess the odds of transfer as a function of theejection speed and number of members in the birth aggregate. the odds of anygiven ejected meteroid being recaptured by another solar system are relativelylow. because the number of ejected rocks per system can be large, virtually allsolar systems are likely to share rocky ejecta with all of the other solarsystems in their birth cluster. the number of ejected rocks that carry livingmicroorganisms is much smaller and less certain, but we estimate that severalmillion rocks can be ejected from a biologically active solar system. fortypical birth environments, the capture of life bearing rocks is expected tooccur 10 -- 16,000 times per cluster (under favorable conditions), depending onthe ejection speeds. only a small fraction of the captured rocks impact thesurfaces of terrestrial planets, so that only a few lithopanspermia events areexpected (per cluster).

astro-ph;0505234	giant planet migration through the action of disk torques and planet  scattering	this paper presents a parametric study of giant planet migration through thecombined action of disk torques and planet-planet scattering. the torquesexerted on planets during type ii migration in circumstellar disks readilydecrease the semi-major axes, whereas scattering between planets increases theorbital eccentricities. this paper presents a parametric exploration of thepossible parameter space for this migration scenario using two (initial)planetary mass distributions and a range of values for the time scale ofeccentricity damping (due to the disk). for each class of systems, manyrealizations of the simulations are performed in order to determine thedistributions of the resulting orbital elements of the surviving planets; thispaper presents the results of 8500 numerical experiments. our goal is to studythe physics of this particular migration mechanism and to test it againstobservations of extrasolar planets. the action of disk torques andplanet-planet scattering results in a distribution of final orbital elementsthat fills the a-e plane, in rough agreement with the orbital elements ofobserved extrasolar planets. in addition to specifying the orbital elements, wecharacterize this migration mechanism by finding the percentages of ejected andaccreted planets, the number of collisions, the dependence of outcomes onplanetary masses, the time spent in 2:1 and 3:1 resonances, and the effects ofthe planetary imf. we also determine the distribution of inclination angles ofsurviving planets and the distribution of ejection speeds for exiled planets.

astro-ph;0512330	early evolution of stellar groups and clusters: environmental effects on  forming planetary systems	this paper studies the dynamical evolution of young stellar clusters with $n$= 100 - 1000 members. we use n-body simulations to explore how evolutiondepends on system size $n$ and the initial conditions. motivated by recentobservations of extremely young systems, this study compares subvirial andvirial starting states. multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100simulations per case) are used to build up a robust statistical description ofthese systems, e.g., distributions of closest approaches, mass profiles, anddistributions of radial locations. these results provide a framework from whichto assess the effects of these clusters on star and planet formation. thedistributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with distributions offuv luminosities (also calculated here) to determine the radiation exposure ofcircumstellar disks. the distributions of closest approaches are used inconjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here from $10^5$scattering experiments) to determine the probability of solar systemdisruption. we also use the nearby cluster ngc 1333 as a test case. our mainconclusion is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect onforming planetary systems: interaction rates are low so that the typical solarsystem experiences a single encounter within 1000 au. radiation exposure islow, with median fuv flux $g_0$ = 900, so that photoevaporation of disks isonly important beyond 30 au. given the low interaction rates and modestradiation levels, we suggest that solar system disruption is a rare event inthese clusters.

astro-ph;0606346	effects of secular interactions in extrasolar planetary systems	this paper studies the effects of dynamical interactions among the planets inobserved extrasolar planetary systems, including hypothetical additionalbodies, with a focus on secular perturbations. these interactions cause theeccentricities of the planets to explore a distribution of values over timescales that are long compared to observational time baselines, but shortcompared to the age of the systems. the same formalism determines theeccentricity forcing of hypothetical test bodies (terrestrial planets) in thesesystems and we find which systems allow for potentially habitable planets. suchplanets would be driven to nonzero orbital eccentricity and we derive thedistribution of stellar flux experienced by the planets over the course oftheir orbits. the general relativistic corrections to secular interactiontheory are included in the analysis and such effects are important in systemswith close planets ($\sim$4 day orbits). some extrasolar planetary systems(e.g., upsilon andromedae) can be used as a test of general relativity, whereasin other systems, general relativity can be used to constrain the systemparameters (e.g., $\sin i \gta 0.93$ for hd160691). for the case of hotjupiters, we discuss how the absence of observed eccentricity implies theabsence of companion planets.

astro-ph;0609326	baryonic collapse within dark matter halos and the formation of gaseous  galactic disks	this paper constructs an analytic framework for calculating the assembly ofgalactic disks from the collapse of gas within dark matter halos, with the goalof determining the surface density profiles. gas parcels (baryons) fall throughthe potentials of dark matter halos on nearly ballistic, zero energy orbits andcollect in a rotating disk. the dark matter halos have a nearly universal form,as determined previously through numerical simulations. the calculation isfirst carried out for a variety of pre-collapse mass distributions and rotationprofiles, including polytropic spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halopotential. the resulting disk surface density profiles have nearly power-lawforms, with well-defined edges. this idealized scenario is generalized toinclude non-spherical starting states and multiple accretion events (due to gasbeing added to the halo via merger events). this latter complication isexplored in detail and considers a log-normal distribution for the angularmomenta of the pre-collapse states. if this distribution is wide, then thecomposite surface density approaches a universal power-law form, independent ofthe shape of the constituent profiles. when the angular momentum distributionhas an intermediate width, the composite surface density attains a nearlyexponential form, roughly consistent with profiles of observed galaxies.

(2002) by introducing a parameter, \gamma, that controls therate of mass accretion, dln(m) / dln(a) ~ a^(-\gamma), and find that this formcharacterizes both hierarchical and monolithic formation. subhalo decay ratesare exponential in time with a much shorter time scale for wdm halos. at theend of the simulations, we find truncated hernquist density profiles for halosin both the cdm and wdm cosmologies. there is a systematic shift to lowerconcentration for wdm halos, but both cosmologies lie on the same locusrelating concentration and formation epoch. because the form of the densityprofile remains unchanged, our results indicate that the equilibrium halodensity profile is set independently of the halo formation process.

(2) weshow that the average ratio $\rave$ of the amplitude of tensor perturbations(gravity wave perturbations) to scalar density perturbations is bounded fromabove: $\rave \le$ 1.6. we also show that the ratio $\rave$ is proportional tothe change $\delta \phi$ in the field: $\rave \approx 0.42 \delta \phi/\mp$.thus, if tensor perturbations are important for the formation of structure,then the width $\delta \phi$ must be comparable to the planck mass. (3) weconstrain the change $\delta v$ of the potential and the change $\delta \phi$of the inflation field during the portion of inflation when cosmologicalstructure is produced. we find both upper and lower bounds for $\delta \phi$and for $\delta v$. in addition, these constraints are then used to derive abound on the scale $\lambda$, which is the scale of the height of the potential

astro-ph;9511095	infall collapse solutions in the inner limit: radiation pressure and its  effects on star formation	in this paper, we study infall collapse solutions for star formation in thesmall radius limit where the particle orbits become nearly pressure-free. wegeneralize previous solutions to simultaneously include the effects of bothradiation pressure and angular momentum. the effects of radiation pressure canbe modeled using a modified potential; for representative cases of suchpotentials, we obtain analytical solutions for the density and velocity fields.in general, radiation pressure limits the maximum mass of a forming star byreversing the infall when the star becomes sufficiently large. our resultsimply that this maximum mass scale is given by the condition that theturnaround radius $r_r$ (the radius at which the radiation pressure forceexceeds the gravitational force) exceeds the centrifugal radius $r_c$ (theangular momentum barrier). the maximum mass scale for a star forming within arotating collapse flow with radiation pressure depends on the initialconditions, but is generally much larger than for the case of spherical infallconsidered previously. in particular, stars with masses $m_\ast$ $\sim 100$$m_\odot$ can form for a fairly wide range of initial conditions.

astro-ph;9601139	a theory of the imf for star formation in molecular clouds	we present models for the initial mass function (imf) for stars formingwithin molecular clouds. these models use the idea that stars determine theirown masses through the action of powerful stellar outflows. this concept allowsus to calculate a semi-empirical mass formula (semf), which provides thetransformation between initial conditions in molecular clouds and the finalmasses of forming stars. for a particular semf, a given distribution of initialconditions predicts a corresponding imf. we consider several differentdescriptions for the distribution of initial conditions in star formingmolecular clouds. we first consider the limiting case in which only onephysical variable -- the effective sound speed -- determines the initialconditions. in this limit, we use observed scaling laws to determine thedistribution of sound speed and the semf to convert this distribution into animf. we next consider the opposite limit in which many different independentphysical variables play a role in determining stellar masses. in this limit,the central limit theorem shows that the imf approaches a log-normal form.realistic star forming regions contain an intermediate number of relevantvariables; we thus consider intermediate cases between the two limits. ourresults show that this picture of star formation and the imf naturally producesstellar mass distributions that are roughly consistent with observations. thispaper thus provides a calculational framework to construct theoretical modelsof the imf.

0810.4076	mean motion resonances in extrasolar planetary systems with turbulence,  interactions, and damping	this paper continues previous work on the effects of turbulence on meanmotion resonances in extrasolar planetary systems. turbulence is expected toarise in the disks that form planets, and these fluctuations act to compromiseresonant configurations. this paper extends previous work by considering howinteractions between the planets and possible damping effects imposed by thedisk affect the outcomes. these physical processes are studied using threeapproaches: numerical integrations of the 3-body problem with additionalforcing due to turbulence, model equations that reduce the problem tostochastically driven oscillators, and fokker-planck equations that describethe time evolution of an ensemble of systems. with this combined approach, weelucidate the physics of how turbulence can remove extrasolar planetary systemsfrom mean motion resonance. as expected, systems with sufficiently largedamping (dissipation) can maintain resonance, in spite of turbulent forcing. inthe absence of strong damping, ensembles of these systems exhibit two regimesof behavior, where the fraction of the bound states decreases as a power-law oras an exponential. both types of behavior can be understood through the modeldeveloped herein. for systems with weak interactions between planets, the modelreduces to a stochastic pendulum, and the fraction of bound states decreases asa power-law. for highly interactive systems, the dynamics are more complicatedand the fraction of bound states decreases exponentially. we show how planetaryinteractions lead to drift terms in the fokker-planck equation and account forthis exponential behavior. in addition to clarifying the physical processesinvolved, this paper strengthens the finding that turbulence implies that meanmotions resonances should be rare.

hep-ph;9302321	general solutions for tunneling of scalar fields with quartic potentials	for the theory of a single scalar field $\varphi$ with a quartic potential$v(\varphi)$, we find semi-analytic expressions for the euclidean action inboth four and three dimensions. the action in four dimensions determines thequantum tunneling rate at zero temperature from a false vacuum state to thetrue vacuum state; similarly, the action in three dimensions determines thethermal tunneling rate for a finite temperature theory. we show that for allquartic potentials, the action can be obtained from a one parameter family ofinstanton solutions corresponding to a one parameter family of differentialequations. we find the solutions numerically and use polynomial fittingformulae to obtain expressions for the euclidean action. these results allowone to calculate tunneling rates for the entire possible range of quarticpotentials, from the thin-wall (nearly degenerate) limit to the opposite limitof vanishing barrier height. we also present a similar calculation forpotentials containing $\varphi^4 \ln \varphi^2$ terms, which arise in theone-loop approximation to the effective potential in electroweak theory.
