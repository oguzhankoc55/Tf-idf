0904.1204	radio and mid-infrared identification of blast source counterparts in  the chandra deep field south	we have identified radio and/or mid-infrared counterparts to 198 out of 350sources detected at &gt;=5 sigma over ~ 9 square degrees centered on the chandradeep field south (cdfs) by the balloon-borne large aperture submillimetertelescope (blast) at 250, 350 and 500 um. we have matched 114 of thesecounterparts to optical sources with previously derived photometric redshiftsand fitted seds to the blast fluxes and fluxes at 70 and 160 um acquired withthe spitzer space telescope. in this way, we have constrained dusttemperatures, total far-infrared/sub-millimeter luminosities and star formationrates for each source. our findings show that on average, the blast sources lieat significantly lower redshifts and have significantly lower rest-frame dusttemperatures compared to submm sources detected in surveys conducted at 850 um.we demonstrate that an apparent increase in dust temperature with redshift inour sample arises as a result of selection effects. finally, we provide thefull multi-wavelength catalog of &gt;= 5 sigma blast sources contained within thecomplete ~ 9 square degree survey area.

0911.2511	obscured star formation at z = 0.84 with hizels: the relationship  between star formation rate and h-alpha or ultra-violet dust extinction	[abridged] we compare h-alpha, ultraviolet (uv) and infrared (ir) indicatorsof star formation rate (sfr) for a sample of z = 0.84 galaxies from the high-zemission line survey (hizels). using multi-wavelength diagnostics, we estimatethat 5 - 11 per cent of h-alpha emitters at this redshift are active galacticnuclei. we detect 35 per cent of the h-alpha emitters individually at 24microns, and stack the star-forming emitters on deep 24-micron images in orderto calculate the typical sfrs of our galaxies. these are compared to theobserved h-alpha line fluxes in order to estimate the extinction at z = 0.84,and we find a significant increase in dust extinction for galaxies with highersfrs. we demonstrate that the local relationship between sfr and extinction issuitable for our sample, and attribute the overall increase in dust extinctionfor z = 0.84 galaxies to an increase in the average sfr, rather than to achange in dust properties. we calculate the uv extinction, and find a similardependence on sfr, but no evidence for a 2175 angstrom uv bump in the dustattenuation law. we calculate the conversion between the dust attenuation ofnebular and stellar radiation, gamma, and show that gamma = 0.50 +/- 0.14. theextinction / sfr relationship is shown to be applicable to galaxies with arange of morphologies and bulge-to-disk ratios, to both merging and non-merginggalaxies, and to galaxies within high- and low-density environments, implyingthat it is a fundamental property of star-forming regions. in order to allowfuture studies to correct for a sfr-dependent amount of dust extinction, wepresent an equation to predict the extinction of a galaxy, based solely uponits observed h-alpha luminosity, and use this to recalculate the h-alphaluminosity function and star formation rate density at z = 0.84.

1003.2647	a joint analysis of blast 250--500um and laboca 870um observations in  the extended chandra deep field south	we present a joint analysis of the overlapping blast 250, 350, 500um, andlaboca 870um observations (from the less survey) of the ecdf-s. out to z~3, theblast filters sample near the peak wavelength of far-infrared (fir) emissionfrom galaxies (rest-frame wavelengths ~60--200um), primarily produced by dustheated through absorption in star-forming clouds. however, identifyingcounterparts to individual blast peaks is very challenging, given the largebeams (fwhm 36--60"). in contrast, the 870um observations have a significantlysmaller 19" fwhm beam, and are sensitive to higher redshifts (z~1--5, andpotentially beyond) due to the more favourable negative k-correction. we usethe less data, as well as deep spitzer and vla imaging, to identify 118individual sources that produce significant emission in the blast bands. wecharacterize the temperatures and fir luminosities for a subset of 69 sourceswhich have well-measured submm seds and redshift measurements out to z~3. forflux-limited sub-samples in each blast band, and a dust emissivity index\beta=2.0, we find a median temperature t=30k (all bands) as well as medianredshifts: z=1.1 (interquartile range 0.2--1.9) for s250 &gt; 40mjy; z=1.3(interquartile range 0.6--2.1) for s350 &gt; 30mjy; and z=1.6 (interquartile range1.3--2.3) for s500 &gt; 20mjy. taking into account selection effects for oursurvey (a bias toward detecting lower-temperature galaxies), we find noevidence for evolution in the local fir-temperature correlation out to z~2.5.comparing with star-forming galaxy sed templates, about 8% of our sampleappears to exhibit significant excesses in the radio and/or mid-ir, consistentwith those sources harbouring an agn. we describe the following techniques intwo appendices: our `matched filter' for identifying sources in the presence ofpoint-source confusion; and our approach for identifying counterparts usinglikelihood ratios.

1004.1099	evidence of different star formation histories for high- and  low-luminosity radio galaxies	we present the results of our investigation into the stellar populations of24 radio galaxies at z~0.5 drawn from four complete, low-frequency selectedradio surveys. we use the strength of the 4000a break as an indicator of recentstar formation, and compare this with radio luminosity, optical spectralclassification and morphological classification. we find evidence of differentstar formation histories for high- and low-luminosity radio sources; our groupof low radio luminosity sources (typically fri-type sources) has systematicallyolder stellar populations than the higher radio luminosity group. our sample isalso fairly well divided by optical spectral classification. we find thatgalaxies classified as having low excitation spectra (legs) possess olderstellar populations than high excitation line objects (hegs), with the hegsshowing evidence for recent star formation. we also investigate the linkbetween radio morphology, as used by owen &amp; laing (1989), and the stellarpopulations. we find that there is a preference for the "fat-double" sources tohave older stellar populations than the "classical double" sources, althoughthis is also linked to these sources lying predominantly in the leg and hegcategories respectively. these results are consistent with the hypothesis thathegs are powered by accretion of cold gas, which could be supplied, forexample, by recent mergers, secular instabilities, or filamentary cold flows.these processes could also trigger star formation in the host galaxy. the hostgalaxies of the legs do not show evidence for recent star formation and aninflux of cold gas, and are consistent with being powered by the accretion ofthe hot phase of the inter-stellar medium.

1005.5126	reversal of fortune: confirmation of an increasing star  formation-density relation in a cluster at z=1.62	we measure the rest-frame colors (dust-corrected), infrared luminosities,star formation rates, and stellar masses of 92 galaxies in a spitzer-selectedcluster at z=1.62. by fitting spectral energy distributions (seds) to 10-bandphotometry (0.4 micron &lt; lambda(obs) &lt;8 micron) and measuring 24 micron fluxesfor the 12 spectroscopically confirmed and 80 photometrically selected members,we discover an exceptionally high level of star formation in the cluster coreof ~1700 msun/yr per mpc^2. the cluster galaxies define a strong blue sequencein (u-v) color and span a range in color. we identify 17 members withl(ir)&gt;10^(11) lsun, and these ir luminous members follow the same trend ofincreasing star formation with stellar mass that is observed in the field atz~2. using rates derived from both the 24 micron imaging and sed fitting, wefind that the relative fraction of star-forming members triples from the lowestto highest galaxy density regions, e.g. the ir luminous fraction increases from~8% at sigma~10 gal per mpc^2 to ~25% at sigma&gt;100 gal per mpc^2. the observedincrease is a reversal of the well-documented trend at z&lt;1 and signals that wehave reached the epoch when massive cluster galaxies are still forming asubstantial fraction of their stars.

1008.2344	the evolution of the fundamental plane of radio galaxies from z~0.5 to  the present day	we present deep spectroscopic data for a 24-object subsample of our full41-object z~0.5 radio galaxy sample in order to investigate the evolution ofthe fundamental plane of radio galaxies. we find that the low-luminosity,fri-type, radio galaxies in our sample are consistent with the localfundamental plane of radio galaxies defined by bettoni et al. when correctedfor simple passive evolution of their stellar populations. however, we findthat the higher luminosity, frii-type radio galaxies are inconsistent with thelocal fundamental plane if only passive evolution is considered, and findevidence for a rotation in the fundamental plane at z~0.5 when compared withthe local relation. we show that neither passive evolution, nor amass-dependent evolution in the mass-to-light ratio, nor an evolution in thesize of the host galaxies can, by themselves, plausibly explain the observedtilt. however, we suggest that some combination of all three effects, with sizeevolution as the dominant factor, may be sufficient to explain the differencebetween the planes. we also find evidence for a correlation between host galaxyvelocity dispersion and radio luminosity at the 97% significance level withinour sub-sample, although further observations are required in order todetermine whether this is different for the fri and frii radio sources.assuming that the m_bh - sigma relation still holds at z~0.5, this implies thatradio luminosity scales with black hole mass, in agreement with previousstudies.

1105.3753	candels: the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy  survey	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over theapproximate redshift (z) range 8--1.5. it will image &gt;250,000 distant galaxiesusing three separate cameras on the hubble space telescope, from themid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure type iasupernovae at z&gt;1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles forcosmology. five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each withextensive ancillary data. the use of five widely separated fields mitigatescosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples ofgalaxies down to a stellar mass of 10^9 m_\odot to z \approx 2, reaching theknee of the ultraviolet luminosity function (uvlf) of galaxies to z \approx 8.the survey covers approximately 800 arcmin^2 and is divided into two parts. thecandels/deep survey (5\sigma\ point-source limit h=27.7 mag) covers \sim 125arcmin^2 within goods-n and goods-s. the candels/wide survey includes goods andthree additional fields (egs, cosmos, and uds) and covers the full area to a5\sigma\ point-source limit of h \gtrsim 27.0 mag. together with the hubbleultra deep fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding cake" approachthat has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. data from the survey arenonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. inthis paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the candels teamscience goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selectionand geometry, and the observing design. the hubble data processing and productsare described in a companion paper.

1107.2397	the host galaxies and black-hole:galaxy mass ratios of luminous quasars  at z~4	we present and analyse the deepest, high-quality ks-band images ever obtainedof luminous quasars at z~4, in an attempt to determine the basic properties oftheir host galaxies less than 1 gyr after the first recorded appearance ofblack holes with mbh &gt; 10^9 msol. to maximise the robustness of our results wehave carefully selected two sdss quasars at z~4. these quasars arerepresentative of the most luminous quasars known at this epoch but they also,crucially, lie within 40 arcsec of comparably-bright foreground stars (requiredfor accurate psf definition), and have redshifts which ensure line-free ks-bandimaging. the data were obtained in excellent seeing (&lt;0.4-arcsec) at the esovlt with integration times of ~5.5 hours per source. via carefully-controlledseparation of host-galaxy and nuclear light, we estimate the luminosities andstellar masses of the host galaxies, and set constraints on their half-lightradii. the quasar host galaxies have k-band luminosities similar to radiogalaxies at comparable redshifts, suggesting that these quasar hosts are alsoamong the most massive galaxies in existence at this epoch. however, the quasarhosts are a factor ~5 smaller than the host galaxies of luminous low-redshiftquasars. we estimate the stellar masses of the z~4 host galaxies to lie in therange 2-10x10^11 msol, and use the civ emission line in the sloan spectra toestimate the masses of their black holes. the results imply ablack-hole:host-galaxy mass ratio mbh:mgal~0.01-0.05. this is an order ofmagnitude higher than typically seen in the low-redshift universe, and isconsistent with existing evidence for a systematic growth in this mass ratiowith increasing redshift, at least for objects selected as powerful agn.

1108.6058	the stellar masses and specific star-formation rates of submillimetre  galaxies	establishing the stellar masses (m*), and hence specific star-formation rates(ssfrs) of submillimetre galaxies (smgs) is crucial for determining their rolein the cosmic galaxy/star formation. however, there is as yet no consensus overthe typical m* of smgs. specifically, even for the same set of smgs, thereported average m* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from ~5x10^10 mo to~5x10^11 mo. here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to suchwidely varying results. we find that, contrary to recent claims in theliterature, potential contamination of irac 3-8 um photometry from hot dustassociated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the publisheddiscrepancies in derived m*. instead, we expose in detail how inferred m*depends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify theindividual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial massfunction, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and differentforms of assumed star-formation history. we review current observationalevidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from thehydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choicesof these model inputs, the average m* of smgs is ~2x10^11 mo. we also confirmthat this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latestmeasurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving m* function of theoverall galaxy population. m* of this order imply that the average ssfr of smgsis comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z&gt;2, at 2-3 gyr^-1.this supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any m*, mostsmgs simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies atthese redshifts. conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint thatsmgs are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmichistory of star-formation.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1110.3786	what turns galaxies off? the different morphologies of star-forming and  quiescent galaxies since z~2 from candels	we use hst/wfc3 imaging from the candels multicycle treasury survey, inconjunction with the sloan digital sky survey, to explore the evolution ofgalactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses &gt;3e10m_sun from z=2.2 tothe present epoch, a time span of 10gyr. we explore the relationship betweenrest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity and galaxystructure. we confirm the dramatic increase from z=2.2 to the present day inthe number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3e10m_sun reported byothers. we further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems haveconcentrated light profiles, as parametrized by the sersic index, and thepopulation of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. we examine thejoint distribution of star formation activity, sersic index, stellar mass,inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. quiescencecorrelates poorly with stellar mass at all z&lt;2.2. quiescence correlates wellwith sersic index at all redshifts. quiescence correlates well with `velocitydispersion' and stellar surface density at z&gt;1.3, and somewhat less well atlower redshifts. yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence andgalaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominentbulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominatedgalaxies have significant star formation. noting the rarity of quiescentgalaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (andperhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important conditionfor quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10gyr, inqualitative agreement with the agn feedback paradigm.

1202.4770	the physics of the fundamental metallicity relation	we present a simple, redshift-independent analytic model that explains thelocal fundamental metallicity relation (fmr), taking into account the physicalprocesses of star formation, inflow of metal-poor intergalactic medium (igm)gas, and the outflow of metal rich interstellar medium (ism) gas. we show thatthe physics of the fmr can be summarised as follows: for massive galaxies withstellar mass m_* &gt;= 10^11 solar masses, ism metal enrichment due to starformation is compensated by inflow of metal poor igm gas, leading to a constantvalue of the gas metallicity with star formation rate (sfr); outflows arerendered negligible as a result of the large potential wells of these galaxies.on the other hand, as a result of their smaller sfr, less massive galaxiesproduce less heavy elements that are also more efficiently ejected due to theirshallow potential wells; as a result, for a given m_*, the gas metallicitydecreases with sfr. for such galaxies, the outflow efficiency determines boththe slope, and the knee of the metallicity-sfr relation. without changing anyparameters, this simple model is also successfully matched to the gas fraction- gas metallicity relation observed for a sample of about 260 nearby galaxies.

1206.0735	candels: the contribution of the observed galaxy population to cosmic  reionization	we present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from asample of 483 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;8. these galaxies were selected from new deepnear-infrared hst imaging from the candels, hudf09 and ers programs. incontrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that thedistribution of galaxy ultraviolet (uv) luminosities follows a schechterdistribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below ourobservable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxieswhich we can observe, free from these assumptions. we find that the observablepopulation of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized igm at z=6, if the averageionizing photon escape fraction (f_esc) is ~30%. a number of previous studieshave measured uv luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5x, withmany concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless alarge population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, orextremely high values of f_esc were present. the observed uv luminosity densityfrom our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fullyreionized igm unless f_esc&gt;50%. combining our observations with constraints onthe emission rate of ionizing photons from ly-alpha forest observations at z=6,we can constrain f_esc&lt;34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the onlycontributors to reionization, or &lt;13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity functionextends to m_uv = -13. these escape fractions are sufficient to completereionization by z=6. these constraints imply that the volume ionized fractionof the igm becomes less than unity at z&gt;7, consistent with a number ofcomplementary reionization probes. if faint galaxies dominate reionization,future jwst observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing anindirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

1211.1034	simulating the assembly of galaxies at redshifts z = 6 - 12	we use state-of-the-art simulations to explore the physical evolution ofgalaxies in the first billion years of cosmic time. first, we demonstrate thatour model reproduces the basic statistical properties of the observedlyman-break galaxy (lbg) population at z = 6 - 8, including the evolvingultra-violet (uv) luminosity function (lf), the stellar-mass density (smd), andthe average specific star-formation rates (ssfr) of lbgs with m_{uv} &lt; -18 (abmag). encouraged by this success we present predictions for the behaviour offainter lbgs extending down to m_{uv} &lt;= -15 (as will be probed with the jameswebb space telescope) and have interrogated our simulations to try to gaininsight into the physical drivers of the observed population evolution. we findthat mass growth due to star formation in the mass-dominant progenitor buildsup about 90% of the total z ~ 6 lbg stellar mass, dominating over the masscontributed by merging throughout this era. our simulation suggests that theapparent "luminosity evolution" depends on the luminosity range probed: thesteady brightening of the bright end of the lf is driven primarily by genuinephysical luminosity evolution and arises due to a fairly steady increase in theuv luminosity (and hence star-formation rates) in the most massive lbgs.however, at fainter luminosities the situation is more complex, due in part tothe more stochastic star-formation histories of lower-mass objects; at thisend, the evolution of the uv lf involves a mix of positive and negativeluminosity evolution (as low-mass galaxies temporarily brighten then fade)coupled with both positive and negative density evolution (as new low-massgalaxies form, and other low-mass galaxies are consumed by merging). we alsopredict the average ssfr of lbgs should rise from ssfr = 4.5 gyr^-1 at z = 6 toabout 11 gyr^-1 by z = 9.

1212.1448	the 2012 hubble ultra deep field (udf12): observational overview	we present the 2012 hubble ultra deep field campaign (udf12), a large128-orbit cycle 19 \hst\ program aimed at extending previous wfc3/irobservations of the udf by quadrupling the exposure time in the f105w filter,imaging in an additional f140w filter, and extending the f160w exposure time by50%. the principal scientific goal of this project is to determine whethergalaxies reionized the universe; our observations are designed to provide arobust determination of the star formation density at $z$$\,\gtrsim\,$8,improve measurements of the ultraviolet continuum slope at$z$$\,\sim\,7\,-\,$8, facilitate the construction of new samples of$z$$\,\sim\,9\,-\,$10 candidates, and enable the detection of sources up to$z$$\,\sim\,$12. for this project we committed to combining these and otherwfc3/ir imaging observations of the udf area into a single homogeneous dataset,to provide the deepest near-infrared observations of the sky currentlyachievable. in this paper we present the observational overview of the project,motivated by its scientific goals, and describe the procedures used in reducingthe data as well as the final products that are produced. we have used the mostup up-to-date methods for calibrating and combining the images, in particularpaying attention to correcting several instrumental effects. we release thefull combined mosaics, comprising a single, unified set of mosaics of the udf,providing the deepest near-infrared blank-field view of the universe obtainedto date, reaching magnitudes as deep as ab$\,\sim\,$30 in the near-infrared,and yielding a legacy dataset on this field of lasting scientific value to thecommunity.

1212.3869	evolution of the sizes of galaxies over 7&lt;z&lt;12 revealed by the 2012  hubble ultra deep field campaign	we analyze the redshift- and luminosity-dependent sizes of dropout galaxycandidates in the redshift range z~7-12 using deep images from the udf12campaign, data which offers two distinct advantages over that used in earlierwork. firstly, we utilize the increased s/n ratio offered by the udf12 imagingto provide improved size measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in thehudf. specifically, we stack the new deep f140w image with the existing f125wdata in order to provide improved measurements of the half-light radii ofz-dropouts. similarly we stack this image with the new deep udf12 f160w imageto obtain new size measurements for a sample of y-dropouts. secondly, becausethe udf12 data have allowed the construction of the first robust galaxy samplein the hudf at z&gt;8, we have been able to extend the measurement of averagegalaxy size out to significantly higher redshifts. restricting our sizemeasurements to sources which are now detected at &gt;15sigma, we confirm earlierindications that the average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies are extremelysmall, 0.3-0.4 kpc, comparable to the sizes of giant molecular associations inlocal star-forming galaxies. we also confirm that there is a clear trend ofdecreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift, and provide the firstevidence that this trend continues beyond z~8. modeling the evolution of theaverage half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s, we obtain a best-fit index ofs=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, mid-way between the physicallyexpected evolution for baryons embedded in dark halos of constant mass (s=-1)and constant velocity (s=-1.5). a clear size-luminosity relation, such as thatfound at lower redshift, is also evident in both our z- and y-dropout sample.this relation can be interpreted in terms of a constant surface density of starformation over a range in luminosity of 0.05-1.0l*_z=3.(abridged)

1212.4819	the uv luminosity function of star-forming galaxies via dropout  selection at redshifts z ~ 7 and 8 from the 2012 ultra deep field campaign	we present a catalog of high redshift star-forming galaxies selected to liewithin the redshift range z ~ 7-8 using the ultra deep field 2012 (udf12), thedeepest near-infrared (near-ir) exposures yet taken with the hubble spacetelescope. as a result of the increased near-infrared exposure time compared toprevious hst imaging in this field, we probe 0.65 (0.25) mag fainter inabsolute uv magnitude, at z ~ 7 (8), which increases confidence in ameasurement of the faint end slope of the galaxy luminosity function. through a0.7 mag deeper limit in the key f105w filter that encompasses or lies justlongward of the lyman break, we also achieve a much-refined color-colorselection that balances high redshift completeness and a low expectedcontamination fraction. we improve the number of drop-out selected udf sourcesto 47 at z ~ 7 and 27 at z ~ 8. incorporating brighter archival andground-based samples, we measure the z ~ 7 uv luminosity function to anabsolute magnitude limit of m_uv = -17 and find a faint end schechter slope of\alpha = -1.87+/- 0.18. using a similar color-color selection at z ~ 8 thattakes account of our newly-added imaging in the f140w filter, and incorporatingarchival data from the hippies and borg campaigns, we provide a robust estimateof the faint end slope at z ~ 8, \alpha = -1.94 +/- 0.23. we briefly discussour results in the context of earlier work and that derived using the sameudf12 data but with an independent photometric redshift technique (mclure et al2012).

1301.1228	new constraints on cosmic reionization from the 2012 hubble ultra deep  field campaign	understanding cosmic reionization requires the identification andcharacterization of early sources of hydrogen-ionizing photons. the 2012 hubbleultra deep field (udf12) campaign has acquired the deepest infrared images withthe wide field camera 3 aboard hubble space telescope and, for the first time,systematically explored the galaxy population deep into the era when cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) data indicates reionization was underway. the udf12campaign thus provides the best constraints to date on the abundance,luminosity distribution, and spectral properties of early star-forminggalaxies. we synthesize the new udf12 results with the most recent constraintsfrom cmb observations to infer redshift-dependent ultraviolet (uv) luminositydensities, reionization histories, and electron scattering optical depthevolution consistent with the available data. under reasonable assumptionsabout the escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons and the intergalacticmedium clumping factor, we find that to fully reionize the universe by redshiftz~6 the population of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z~7-9 likely mustextend in luminosity below the udf12 limits to absolute uv magnitudes ofm_uv\sim -13 or fainter. moreover, low levels of star formation extending toredshifts z~15-25, as suggested by the normal uv colors of z\simeq7-8 galaxiesand the smooth decline in abundance with redshift observed by udf12 toz\simeq10, are additionally likely required to reproduce the optical depth toelectron scattering inferred from cmb observations.

1302.6996	unravelling obese black holes in the first galaxies	we predict the existence and observational signatures of a new class ofobjects that assembled early, during the first billion years of cosmic time:obese black-hole galaxies (obgs). obgs are objects in which the mass of thecentral black hole initially exceeds that of the stellar component of the hostgalaxy, and the luminosity from black-hole accretion dominates the starlight.from a cosmological simulation, we demonstrate that there are sites where starformation is initially inhibited and direct-collapse black holes (dcbhs) formdue to the photo-dissociating effect of lyman-werner radiation on molecularhydrogen. we show that the formation of obgs is inevitable, because theprobability of finding the required extra-galactic environment and the rightphysical conditions in a halo conducive to dcbh formation is quite high in theearly universe. we estimate an obg number density of 0.009/mpc^3 at z~8 and0.03/mpc^3 at z~6. extrapolating from our simulation volume, we infer that themost luminous quasars detected at z~6 likely transited through an earlier obgphase. we find that these primordial galaxies start off with an over-massive bhand acquire their stellar component from subsequent merging as well as in-situstar formation. in doing so, they inevitably go through an obg phase dominatedby the accretion luminosity at the eddington rate or below, released from thegrowing bh. the obg phase is characterised by an ultra-violet (uv) spectrumwith slope of beta ~ -2.3 and the absence of a balmer break. obgs should alsobe spatially unresolved, and are expected to be brighter than the majority ofknown high-redshift galaxies. obgs could potentially be revealed via hstfollow-up imaging of samples of brighter lyman-break galaxies provided bywide-area ground-based surveys such as ultravista, and should be easilyuncovered and studied with instruments aboard jwst...(abridged)

1302.6999	clues to the past: local group progenitors amongst high-redshift lyman  break galaxies	we use state-of-the-art numerical simulations to explore the observabilityand the expected physical properties of the progenitors of the local groupgalaxies at z=6-8, within 1 billion years of the big bang. we find that themost massive progenitors of the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) at z=6 and 7are predicted to have absolute uv continuum magnitudes between -17 and -18,suggesting that their analogues lie close to the detection limits of thedeepest near-infrared surveys conducted to date (i.e. hst wfc3/ir udf12). thisin turn confirms that the majority of currently known z=6-8 galaxies areexpected to be the seeds of present-day galaxies which are more massive than l*spirals. we also discuss the properties of the local-group progenitors at theseearly epochs, extending down to absolute magnitudes m_uv = -13. the mostmassive mw/m31 progenitors at z=7 have stellar masses of about 10^7.5-8 solarmasses, stellar metallicities between 3 and 6% of the solar value, andpredicted observed uv continuum slopes between -2.4 and -2.5.

1303.0816	studying the emergence of the red sequence through galaxy clustering:  host halo masses at z &gt; 2	we use the ukidss ultra-deep survey, the deepest degree-scale near-infraredsurvey to date, to investigate the clustering of star-forming and passivegalaxies to z ~ 3.5. our new measurements include the first determination ofthe clustering for passive galaxies at z &gt; 2, which we achieve using across-correlation technique. we find that passive galaxies are the moststrongly clustered, typically hosted by massive dark matter halos with m_halo &gt;5 x 10^12 m_sun irrespective of redshift or stellar mass. our findings areconsistent with models in which a critical halo mass determines the transitionfrom star-forming to passive galaxies. star-forming galaxies show no strongcorrelation between stellar mass and halo mass, but passive galaxies showevidence for an anti-correlation; low-mass passive galaxies appear, on average,to be located in the most massive halos. these results can be understood if thetermination of star formation is most efficient for galaxies of low stellarmass in very dense environments.

1312.0950	disentangling a group of lensed submm galaxies at z~2.9	ms$\,$0451.6$-$0305 is a rich galaxy cluster whose strong lensing isparticularly prominent at submm wavelengths. we combine new scuba-2 data withimaging from herschel spire and pacs and hst in order to try to understand thenature of the sources being lensed. in the region of the "giant submm arc," weuncover seven multiply imaged galaxies (up from the previously known three), ofwhich six are found to be at a redshift of $z\sim2.9$, and possibly constitutean interacting system. using a novel forward-modelling approach, we are able tosimultaneously deblend and fit seds to the individual galaxies that contributeto the giant submm arc, constraining their dust temperatures, far infraredluminosities and star formation rates. the submm arc first identified by scubacan now be seen to be composed of at least five distinct sources, four of thesewithin the galaxy group at $z\sim2.9$. the total unlensed luminosity for thisgalaxy group is $(3.1\pm0.3) \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{l}_\odot$, which gives anunlensed star formation rate of $(450\pm50)$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. from theproperties of this system, we see no evidence of evolution towards lowertemperatures in the dust temperature versus far-infrared luminosity relationfor high redshift galaxies.

1312.7834	cold dust in hot regions	we mapped five massive star forming regions with the scuba-2 camera on thejames clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). temperature and column density maps areobtained from the scuba-2 450 and 850 $\mu$m images. most of the dense clumpswe find have central temperatures below 20 k with some as cold as 8 k,suggesting that they have no internal heating due to the presence of embeddedprotostars. this is surprising, because at the high densities inferred fromthese images and at these low temperatures such clumps should be unstable,collapsing to form stars and generating internal heating. the column densitiesat the clump centres exceed 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and the derived peak visualextinction values are from 25-500 mag for $\beta$ = 1.5-2.5, indicating highlyopaque centres. the observed cloud gas masses range from $\sim$ 10 to 10$^{3}$m$_{\odot}$. the outer regions of the clumps follow an $r^{-2.36\pm0.35}$density distribution and this power-law structure is observed outside oftypically 10$^{4}$ au. all these findings suggest that these clumps arehigh-mass starless clumps and most likely contain high-mass starless cores.

1402.0003	the progenitors of local ultra-massive galaxies across cosmic time: from  dusty star-bursting to quiescent stellar populations	using the ultravista catalogs, we investigate the evolution in the 11.4~gyrsince $z=3$ of the progenitors of local ultra-massive galaxies ($\log{(m_{\rmstar}/m_{\odot})}\approx11.8$; umgs), providing a complete and consistentpicture of how the most massive galaxies at $z=0$ have assembled. by selectingthe progenitors with a semi-empirical approach using abundance matching, weinfer a growth in stellar mass of 0.56$^{+0.35}_{-0.25}$ dex,0.45$^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$~dex, and 0.27$^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$ dex from $z=3$, $z=2$,and $z=1$, respectively, to $z=0$. at $z&lt;1$, the progenitors of umgs constitutea homogeneous population of only quiescent galaxies with old stellarpopulations. at $z&gt;1$, the contribution from star-forming galaxiesprogressively increases, with the progenitors at $2&lt;z&lt;3$ being dominated bymassive ($m_{\rm star} \approx 2 \times 10^{11}$m$_{\odot}$), dusty ($a_{\rmv}\sim$1--2.2 mag), star-forming (sfr$\sim$100--400~m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$)galaxies with a large range in stellar ages. at $z=2.75$, $\sim$15\% of theprogenitors are quiescent, with properties typical of post-starburst galaxieswith little dust extinction and strong balmer break, and showing a largescatter in color. our findings indicate that at least half of the stellarcontent of local umgs was assembled at $z&gt;1$, whereas the remaining wasassembled via merging from $z\sim 1$ to the present. most of the quenching ofthe star-forming progenitors happened between $z=2.75$ and $z=1.25$, in goodagreement with the typical formation redshift and scatter in age of $z=0$ umgsas derived from their fossil records. the progenitors of local umgs, includingthe star-forming ones, never lived on the blue cloud since $z=3$. we propose analternative path for the formation of local umgs that refines previouslyproposed pictures and that is fully consistent with our findings.

1405.2335	determining the stellar masses of submillimetre galaxies: the critical  importance of star formation histories	submillimetre (submm) galaxies are among the most rapidly star-forming andmost massive high-redshift galaxies; thus, their properties provide importantconstraints on galaxy evolution models. however, there is still a debate abouttheir stellar masses and their nature in the context of the general galaxypopulation. to test the reliability of their stellar mass determinations, weused a sample of simulated submm galaxies for which we derived stellar massesvia spectral energy distribution (sed) modelling (with grasil, magphys, hyperzand lephare) adopting various star formation histories (sfhs). we found thatthe assumption of sfhs with two independent components leads to the mostaccurate stellar masses. exponentially declining sfhs (tau) lead to lowermasses (albeit still consistent with the true values), while the assumption ofsingle-burst sfhs results in a significant mass underestimation. thus, weconclude that studies based on the higher masses inferred from fitting the sedsof real submm galaxies with double sfhs are most likely to be correct, implyingthat submm galaxies lie on the high-mass end of the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies. this conclusion appears robust to assumptions of whetheror not submm galaxies are driven by major mergers, since the suite of simulatedgalaxies modelled here contains examples of both merging and isolated galaxies.we identified discrepancies between the true and inferred stellar ages (ratherthan the dust attenuation) as the primary determinant of the success/failure ofthe mass recovery. regardless of the choice of sfh, the sed-derived stellarmasses exhibit a factor of ~2 scatter around the true value; this scatter is aninherent limitation of the sed modelling due to simplified assumptions.finally, we found that the contribution of active galactic nuclei does not haveany significant impact on the derived stellar masses.

1408.3416	stellar mass functions of galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;7 from an irac-selected sample  in cosmos/ultravista: limits on the abundance of very massive galaxies	we build a spitzer irac complete catalog of objects, obtained bycomplementing the $k_\mathrm{s}$-band selected ultravista catalog with objectsdetected in irac only. with the aim of identifying massive (i.e.,$\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$) galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;7$, we consider the systematic effectson the measured photometric redshifts from the introduction of an old and dustysed template and from the introduction of a bayesian prior taking into accountthe brightness of the objects, as well as the systematic effects from differentstar formation histories (sfhs) and from nebular emission lines in the recoveryof stellar population parameters. we show that our results are most affected bythe bayesian luminosity prior, while nebular emission lines and sfhs onlyintroduce a small dispersion in the measurements. specifically, the number of$4&lt;z&lt;7$ galaxies ranges from 52 to 382 depending on the adopted configuration.using these results we investigate, for the first time, the evolution of themassive end of the stellar mass functions (smfs) at $4&lt;z&lt;7$. given the rarityof very massive galaxies in the early universe, major contributions to thetotal error budget come from cosmic variance and poisson noise. the smfobtained without the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior does notshow any evolution from $z\sim6.5$ to $z\sim 3.5$, implying that massivegalaxies could already be present when the universe was $\sim0.9$~gyr old.however, the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior reduces the numberof $z&gt;4$ galaxies with best fit masses $\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$ by 83%, implyinga rapid growth of very massive galaxies in the first 1.5 gyr of cosmic history.from the stellar-mass complete sample, we identify one candidate of a verymassive ($\log(m_*/m_\odot)\sim11.5$), quiescent galaxy at $z\sim5.4$, withmips $24\mu$m detection suggesting the presence of a powerful obscured agn.

1411.5038	compact starbursts in z~3-6 submillimeter galaxies revealed by alma	we report the source size distribution, as measured by alma millimetriccontinuum imaging, of a sample of 13 aztec-selected submillimeter galaxies(smgs) at z_photo ~ 3-6. their infrared luminosities and star-formation rates(sfr) are l_ir ~ 2-6 x 10^12 l_sun and ~ 200-600 m_sun yr-1, respectively. thesize of z ~ 3-6 smgs ranges from 0".10 to 0".38 with a median of0".20+0".03-0".05 (fwhm), corresponding to a median circularized effectiveradius (rc,e) of 0.67+0.13-0.14 kpc, comparable to the typical size of thestellar component measured in compact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 (cqgs) --- r~ 1 kpc. the median surface sfr density of our z ~ 3-6 smgs is 100+42-26 m_sunyr-1 kpc-2, comparable to that seen in local merger-driven (u)lirgsrather thanin extended disk galaxies at low and high redshifts. the discovery of compactstarbursts in z &gt;~ 3 smgs strongly supports a massive galaxy formation scenariowherein z ~ 3-6 smgs evolve into the compact stellar components of z ~ 2 cqgs.these cqgs are then thought to evolve into the most massive ellipticals in thelocal universe, mostly via dry mergers. our results thus suggest that z &gt;~ 3smgs are the likely progenitors of massive local ellipticals, via cqgs, meaningthat we can now trace the evolutionary path of the most massive galaxies over aperiod encompassing ~ 90% of the age of the universe.

1502.02024	cosmic reionization and early star-forming galaxies: a joint analysis of  new constraints from planck and hubble space telescope	we discuss new constraints on the epoch of cosmic reionization and test theassumption that most of the ionizing photons responsible arose from highredshift star-forming galaxies. good progress has been made in charting the endof reionization through spectroscopic studies of z~6-8 qsos, gamma-ray burstsand galaxies expected to host lyman-alpha emission. however, the most stringentconstraints on its duration have come from the integrated optical depth, tau,of thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background. using the latest dataon the abundance and luminosity distribution of distant galaxies from hubblespace telescope imaging, we simultaneously match the reduced value tau=0.066+/- 0.012 recently reported by the planck collaboration and the evolvingneutrality of the intergalactic medium with a reionization history within 6 &lt;~z &lt;~ 10, thereby reducing the requirement for a significant population of veryhigh redshift (z&gt;&gt;10) galaxies. our analysis strengthens the conclusion thatstar-forming galaxies dominated the reionization process and has importantimplications for upcoming 21cm experiments and searches for early galaxies withjames webb space telescope.

1508.05950	sxdf-alma 1.5 arcmin^2 deep survey. a compact dusty star-forming galaxy  at z=2.5	we present first results from the sxdf-alma 1.5 arcmin^2 deep survey at 1.1mm using atacama large millimeter array (alma). the map reaches a 1sigma depthof 55 ujy/beam and covers 12 halpha-selected star-forming galaxies at z = 2.19or z=2.53. we have detected continuum emission from three of ourhalpha-selected sample, including one compact star-forming galaxy with highstellar surface density, nb2315-07. they are all red in the rest-frame opticaland have stellar masses of log (m*/msun)&gt;10.9 whereas the other blue,main-sequence galaxies with log(m*/msun)=10.0-10.8 are exceedingly faint, &lt;290ujy (2sigma upper limit). we also find the 1.1 mm-brightest galaxy, nb2315-02,to be associated with a compact (r_e=0.7+-0.1 kpc), dusty star-formingcomponent. given high gas fraction (44^{+20}_{-8}% or 37^{+25}_{-3}%) and highstar formation rate surface density (126^{+27}_{-30} msun yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}), theconcentrated starburst can within less than 50^{+12}_{-11} myr build up astellar surface density matching that of massive compact galaxies at z~2,provided at least 19+-3% of the total gas is converted into stars in the galaxycentre. on the other hand, nb2315-07, which already has such a high stellarsurface density core, shows a gas fraction (23+-8%) and is located in the lowerenvelope of the star formation main-sequence. this compact less star-forminggalaxy is likely to be in an intermediate phase between compact dustystar-forming and quiescent galaxies.

1509.06900	evolution of star formation in the ukidss ultra deep survey field - ii.  star formation as a function of stellar mass between z=1.46 and z=0.63	we present new results on the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate asa function of stellar mass in the sxds-uds field. we make use of narrow-bandselected emission line galaxies in four redshift slices between z = 1.46 and z= 0.63, and compute stellar masses by fitting a series of templates to recreateeach galaxy's star formation history. we determine mass-binned luminosityfunctions in each redshift slice, and derive the star formation rate density(rhosfr) as a function of mass using the [oiii] or [oii] emission lines. wecalculate dust extinction and metallicity as a function of stellar mass, andinvestigate the effect of these corrections on the shape of the overallrhosfr(m). we find that both these corrections are crucial for determining theshape of the rhosfr(m), and its evolution with redshift. the fully correctedrhosfr(m) is a relatively flat distribution, with the normalisation movingtowards lower values of rhosfr with increasing cosmic time/decreasing redshift,and requiring star formation to be truncated across all masses studied here.the peak of rhosfr(m) is found in the 10^10.5&lt;msun&lt;10^11.0 mass bin at z =1.46. in the lower redshift slices the location of the peak is less certain,however low mass galaxies in the range 10^7.0&lt;msun&lt;10^8.0 play an importantpart in the overall rhosfr(m) out to at least z ~ 1.2.

0807.4174	discovery of a giant lya emitter near the reionization epoch	we report the discovery of a giant lya emitter (lae) with a spitzer/iraccounterpart near the reionization epoch at z=6.595. the giant lae is found fromthe extensive 1 deg^2 subaru narrow-band survey for z=6.6 laes in thesubaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field, and subsequently identified by deepspectroscopy of keck/deimos and magellan/imacs. among our 207 lae candidates,this lae is not only the brightest narrow-band object with l(lya) = 3.9+/-0.2 x10^43 erg/s in our survey volume of 10^6 mpc^3, but also a spatially extendedlya nebula with the largest isophotal area whose major axis is at least ~3''.this object is more likely to be a large lya nebula with a size of &gt;~17 kpcthan to be a strongly-lensed galaxy by a foreground object. our keck spectrumwith medium-high spectral and spatial resolutions suggests that the velocitywidth is v(fwhm)=251+/-21 km/s, and that the line-center velocity changes by~60 km/s in a 10-kpc range. the stellar mass and star-formation rate areestimated to be 0.9-5.0 x 10^10 mo and &gt;34 mo/yr, respectively, from thecombination of deep optical to infrared images of subaru, ukidss-ultra deepsurvey, and spitzer/irac. although the nature of this object is not yet clearlyunderstood, this could be an important object for studying cooling cloudsaccreting onto a massive halo, or forming-massive galaxies with significantoutflows contributing to cosmic reionization and metal enrichment ofinter-galactic medium.

astro-ph;0002020	the ages of quasar host galaxies	we present the results of fitting deep off-nuclear optical spectroscopy ofradio-quiet quasars, radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies at z ~ 0.2 withevolutionary synthesis models of galaxy evolution. our aim was to determine theage of the dynamically dominant stellar populations in the hos t galaxies ofthese three classes of powerful agn. some of our spectra display residualnuclear contamination at the shortest wavelengths, but the detailed quality ofthe fits longward of the 4000a break provide unequivocal proof, if furtherproof were needed, that quasars lie in massive galaxies with (at least at z ~0.2) evolved stellar populations. by fitting a two-component model we haveseparated the very blue (starburst and/or agn contamination) from the redderunderlying spectral energy distribution, and find that the hosts of all threeclasses of agn are dominated by old stars of age 8 - 14 gyr. if the bluecomponent is attributed to young stars, we find that, at most, 1% of thebaryonic mass of these galaxies is involved in star-formation activity at theepoch of observation. these results strongly support the conclusion reached bymclure et al. (1999) that the host galaxies of luminous quasars are massiveellipticals which formed prior to the peak epoch of quasar activity at z ~ 2.5.

astro-ph;0004325	the sun, stellar-population models, and the age estimation of  high-redshift galaxies	given sufficiently deep optical spectroscopy, the age estimation ofhigh-redshif t ($z &gt; 1$) galaxies has been claimed to be a relatively robustprocess (e.g. dunlop et al. 1996) due to the fact that, for ages $&lt; 5$gyr, thenear-ultraviolet light of a stellar population is expected to be dominated by`well-understood' main-sequence (ms) stars. recently, however, the reliabilityof this process has been called into question by yi et al (2000), who claim tohave developed models in which the spectrum produced by the main sequencereddens much more rapidly than in the models of jimenez et al (2000a), leadingto much younger age estimates for the reddest known high-redshift ellipticals.in support of their revised age estimates, yi et al cite the fact that theirmodels can reproduce the spectrum of the sun at an age of 5 gyr, whereas thesolar spectrum is not reproduced by the jimenez et al models until $\simeq 10$gyr. here we confirm this discrepancy, but point out that this is in fact a{\it strength} of the jimenez et al models and indicative of some flaw in themodels of yi et al (which, in effect, imply that the sun will turn into a redgiant any minute now). we have also explored the models of worthey (1994)(which are known to differ greatly from those of jimenez et al in the treatmentof post-ms evolution) and find that the main-sequence component of worthey'smodels also cannot reproduce the solar spectrum until an age of 9-10 gyr. weconclude that either the models of yi et al are not as main-sequence dominatedat 4-5 gyr as claimed, or that the stellar evolutionary timescale in thesemodels is in error by a factor possibly as high as two.

astro-ph;0005234	an excess of submm sources near 4c41.17: a candidate proto-cluster at  z=3.8?	biased galaxy-formation theories predict that massive galaxies at highredshifts should act as signposts to high-density environments in the earlyuniverse, which subsequently evolve into the cores of the richest clusters seenat the present day. these regions are characterised by over-densities of younggalaxies, perhaps including a population of dusty, interaction-drivenstarbursts - the progenitors of massive cluster ellipticals. by searching forthis population at submm wavelengths we can therefore test both galaxy- andstructure-formation models. we have undertaken such a search in the field of az=3.8 radio galaxy, 4c41.17, with the scuba submm camera. our extremely deep450- and 850-micron maps reveal an order-of-magnitude over-density of luminoussubmm galaxies compared to typical fields (the likelihood of finding such anover-density in a random field is &lt;2e-3). the scuba galaxies have bolometricluminosities, &gt;10^13 l(solar), which imply star-formation rates consistent withthose required to form a massive galaxy in only a few 10^8 years. we also notethat this field exhibits an over-density of extremely red objects (eros), someof which may be associated with the submm sources, and lyman-break galaxies. wepropose that the over-densities of both submm and ero sources in this fieldrepresent young dusty, starburst galaxies forming within a proto-clustercentered on the radio galaxy at z=3.8, which is also traced by a less-obscuredpopulation of lyman-break galaxies.

astro-ph;0011077	sub-mm clues to elliptical galaxy formation	there is growing evidence that, at the s(850) &lt; 1 mjy level, the sub-mmgalaxy population (and hence a potentially significant fraction of the sub-mmbackground) is associated with the star-forming lyman-break population alreadydetected at optical wavelengths. however, the implied star-formation rates insuch objects (typically 3-30 solar masses per year) fall one or two orders ofmagnitude short of the level of star-forming activity required to produce themost massive elliptical galaxies on a timescale ~ 1 gyr. if a significantfraction of massive ellipticals did form the bulk of their stars in short-livedmassive starbursts at high redshift, then they should presumably be found amongthe brighter, s(850) ~ 10 mjy sub-mm sources which are undoubtedly not part ofthe lyman-break population. a first powerful clue that this is indeed the casecomes from our major scuba survey of radio galaxies, which indicates thatmassive dust-enshrouded star-formation in at least this subset of massiveellipticals is largely confined to z &gt; 2.5, with a mean redshift z = 3.5. whileradio selection raises concerns about bias, i argue that our current knowledgeof the brightest (s(850) ~ 10 mjy) sub-mm sources detected in unbiased scubaimaging surveys indicates that they are also largely confined to this samehigh-z regime. consequently, while the most recent number counts imply suchextreme sources can contribute only 5-10% of the sub-mm background, theircomoving number density (in the redshift band 3 &lt; z &lt; 5) is 1-2 x 10^{-5} percubic megaparsec, sufficient to account for the formation of all ellipticals ofcomparable mass to radio galaxies (~4l-star) in the present-day universe.

astro-ph;0101297	the redshifts of bright sub-mm sources	one of the key goals in observational cosmology over the next few years willbe to establish the redshift distribution of the recently-discovered sub-mmsource population. in this brief review i discuss and summarize the redshiftinformation which has been gleaned to date for the ~ 50 bright sub-mm sourceswhich have been uncovered via the six main classes of survey performed withscuba on the jcmt over the last 2-3 years. despite the biases inherent in someof these surveys, and the crudeness of the redshift information available inothers, i conclude that all current information suggests that only 10-15 % ofluminous sub-mm sources lie at z &lt; 2, and that the median redshift of thispopulation is z ~ 3. i suggest that such a high median redshift is arguably notunexpected given current theories designed to explain the correlation betweenblack-hole mass and spheroid mass found at low redshift. in such scenarios,peak agn emission is expected to correspond to, or even to cause termination ofmajor star-formation activity in the host spheroid. in contrast, maximum dustemission is expected to occur roughly half-way through the star-formationprocess. given that optical emission from bright quasars peaks at z = 2.5,dust-emission from massive ellipticals might be reasonably expected to peak atsome point in the preceding ~ 1 gyr, at z ~ 3. confirmation or refutation ofthis picture requires significantly-improved redshift information on brightsamples of scuba sources.

astro-ph;0103238	the host galaxies of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars	i review our knowledge of the properties of the host galaxies of radio-loudand radio-quiet quasars, both in comparison to each other and in the context ofthe general galaxy population. it is now clear that the hosts of radio-loud andradio-quiet quasars with m_v &lt; -23.5 are virtually all massive ellipticalgalaxies. the masses of these spheroids are as expected given the relationshipbetween black-hole and spheroid mass found for nearby quiescent galaxies, as isthe growing prevalence of disc components in the hosts of progressively fainteragn. there is also now compelling evidence that quasar hosts are practicallyindistinguishable from normal ellipticals, both in their basic structuralparameters and in the old age of their dominant stellar populations; at low zthe nuclear activity is not associated with the formation of a significantfraction of the host galaxy. while the long-held view that quasar radio powermight be a simple function of host morphology is now dead and buried, i arguethat host-galaxy studies may yet play a crucial role in resolving thelong-standing problem of the origin of radio loudness. specifically there isgrowing evidence that radio-loud objects are powered by more massive blackholes accreting at lower efficiency than their radio-quiet couterparts ofcomparable optical output. a black-hole mass &gt; 10^9 solar masses appears to bea necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) condition for the production ofradio jets of sufficient power to produce an frii radio source within a massivegalaxy halo.

astro-ph;0103450	f stars, metallicity, and the ages of red galaxies at z &gt; 1	we explore whether the rest-frame near-uv spectral region, observable inhigh-redshift galaxies via optical spectroscopy, contains sufficientinformation to allow the degeneracy between age and metallicity to be lifted.we do this by testing the ability of evolutionary synthesis models to reclaimthe correct metallicity when fitted to the near-uv spectra of f stars of known(sub-solar and super-solar) metallicity. f stars are of particular interestbecause the rest-frame near-uv spectra of the oldest known elliptical galaxiesat z &gt; 1 appear to be dominated by f stars near to the main-sequence turnoff.  we find that, in the case of the f stars, where the hst ultraviolet spectrahave high signal:noise, model-fitting with metallicity allowed to vary as afree parameter is rather successful at deriving the correct metallicity. as aresult, the estimated turnoff ages of these stars yielded by the model fittingare well constrained. encouraged by this we have fitted these same variable-metallicity models to the deep, optical spectra of the z \simeq 1.5 mjy radiogalaxies 53w091 and 53w069 obtained with the keck telescope. while theage-metallicity degeneracy is not so easily lifted for these galaxies, we findthat even when metallicity is allowed as a free parameter, the best estimatesof their ages are still \geq 3 gyr, with ages younger than 2 gyr now stronglyexcluded. furthermore, we find that a search of the entire parameter space ofmetallicity and star formation history using moped (heavens et al., 2000) leadsto the same conclusion. our results therefore continue to argue stronglyagainst an einstein-de sitter universe, and favour a lambda-dominated universein which star formation in at least these particular elliptical galaxies wascompleted somewhere in the redshift range z = 3 - 5.

astro-ph;0111559	a submillimetre difference between radio galaxies and radio quasars:  evidence for quasar-heated dust and synchronized submillimetre and radio  source activity	we present submillimetre photometry of 11 3cr and 6ce radio quasars ofsimilar 151-mhz radio luminosity and redshifts to the radio galaxies studied at1.3&lt;z&lt;2 by archibald et al. (2001). we detect all bar one quasar at 850microns, and five quasars are confirmed as dusty hyperluminous objects bydetections at shorter wavelengths. our observations reveal a clear differencebetween the submillimetre luminosity distributions of the radio quasars and amatched sample of radio galaxies: the quasars are ~5-times brighter than theradio galaxies and &gt;~2-times brighter accounting for possible synchrotroncontamination. this difference is in quantitative agreement with areceding-torus unified scheme for radio sources in which the torus openingangle depends on quasar optical luminosity, provided that there is a closerelationship between the optical and submillimetre luminosities. theimplication is that quasar-heated dust dominates the submillimetre emission forpowerful radio quasars at z~1.5. we find a significant anti-correlation betweensubmillimetre/far-infrared luminosity l_fir and radio source age in the sensethat hyperluminous quasars tend to be associated with young (&lt;10^7 yr) sources.this suggests that the processes controlling l_fir are synchronized with thejet-triggering event and that l_fir declines on a ~10^7 yr timescale. there isevidence for a small amount of obscuration in the hyperluminous quasars fromreddening and associated or broad absorption lines. we speculate that shortlyafter jet triggering, dust is more widely distributed than at later times andis heated by the quasar nucleus and/or a short-lived synchronized starburst.

astro-ph;0203183	the near-infrared hubble diagram for sub-mm galaxies	determing the nature of the bright sub-mm sources and their role in theprocess of galaxy formation is likely to be a major focus of extra-galacticresearch over the next few years. in particular, we would like to know if thesesources are the progenitors of today's massive elliptical galaxies, oralternatively arise from short-lived, albeit spectacular starbursts withinhaloes of unexceptional mass. this question can be addressed from a number ofdifferent directions, one of which is to compare the masses of sub-mm hostgalaxies with those of other known massive high-redshift objects. here i make afirst attempt to do this by exploring whether the few well-studied sub-mm/mmsources are consistent with the well-established k-z relation for powerfulradio galaxies. out to z = 3 this appears to be the case, providing evidencethat bright sub-mm sources are indeed destined to be massive ellipticals. athigher redshifts there is a suggestion that sub-mm galaxies are signficantlyfainter at k than their radio-selected counterparts, but at present it isunclear whether this indicates a significant difference in stellar mass or theincreasing impact of dust obscuration on the rest-frame light from the sub-mmhosts.

astro-ph;0203184	the masses of agn host galaxies &amp; the origin of radio loudness	we highlight some of the principal results from our recent hubble spacetelescope studies of quasars and radio galaxies. the hosts of these powerfulagn are normal massive ellipticals which lie on the region of the fundamentalplane populated predominantly by massive ellipticals with boxy isophotes anddistinct cores. the hosts of the radio-loud sources are on average 1.5 timesbrighter than their radio-quiet counterparts and appear to lie above a massthreshold of 4 x 10^11 solar masses. this suggests that black holes moremassive than 5 x 10^8 solar masses are required to produce a powerful radiosource. however we show that this apparent threshold appears to be aconsequence of an upper bound on radio output which is a strong function ofblack-hole mass, l_5ghz proportional to m_bh^2.5. this steep mass dependencecan explain why the hosts of the most powerful radio sources are good standardcandles. such objects were certainly fully assembled by z = 1, and appear tohave formed the bulk of their stars prior to z = 3.

astro-ph;0304168	quasar hosts and the black hole-spheroid connection	i review our current understanding of the structures and ages of the hostgalaxies of quasars, and the masses of their central black holes. at lowredshift, due largely to the impact of the hubble space telescope, there is nowcompelling evidence that the hosts of quasars with m_v &lt; -24 mag are virtuallyall massive ellipticals, with basic properties indistinguishable from thosedisplayed by their quiescent counterparts. the masses of these spheroids are asexpected given the relationship between black hole and spheroid mass nowestablished for nearby galaxies, as is the growing prevalence of significantdisk components in the hosts of progressively fainter active nuclei. in fact,from spectroscopic measurements of the velocity of the broad-line region inquasars, it has now proved possible to obtain an independent dynamical estimateof the masses of the black holes that power quasars. i summarize recent resultsfrom this work, which can be used to demonstrate that the black hole-spheroidmass ratio in quasars is the same as that found for quiescent galaxies, namelym_bh = 0.0012 m_sph. these results offer the exciting prospect of usingobservations of quasars and their hosts to extend the study of the blackhole-spheroid mass ratio out to very high redshifts (z &gt; 2). moreover, there isnow good evidence that certain ultraviolet quasar emission lines can providerobust estimates of black hole masses from the observed optical spectra ofquasars out to z &gt; 2, and perhaps even at z &gt; 4. by combining such informationwith deep, high-resolution infrared imaging of high-redshift quasar hosts on8-m class telescopes, there is now a real prospect of clarifying the evolutionof the black hole spheroid connection over cosmological time scales.

astro-ph;0403106	a sample of radio galaxies spanning three decades in radio luminosity -  i. the host-galaxy properties and black-hole masses	the results of analysis of hst i-band imaging of a sample of 41 radiogalaxies spanning three orders of magnitude in radio luminosity at redshiftz~0.5 are presented. the full sample is drawn from four complete, low-frequencyselected radio samples with progressively fainter flux-density limits (3crr,6ce, 7crs and the new texox-1000 sample). modelling of the hst imaging datashows that the host galaxies have surface-brightness distributions consistentwith those expected for classic ellipticals (sersic parameter, beta~0.25), withbeta in the range 0.17&lt;beta&lt;0.30, and a mean of &lt;beta&gt;=0.23\pm0.01. thehost-galaxy luminosities are comparable with those of galaxies drawn from thebright end of the local cluster galaxy luminosity function, spanning the range0.7l^{\star}&lt;l&lt;10l^{\star}, with a mean of 3.2\pm0.3 l^{\star}. in addition,the radio galaxies are shown to follow a kormendy relation indistinguishablefrom that of powerful low-redshift radio galaxies. combining our new resultswith those in the literature it is found that the scalelengths and kormendyrelations of 3c-class radio galaxies do not vary significantly over theredshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.8, providing no evidence for dynamical evolution of thisclass of host galaxy within this redshift interval. converting the host-galaxyluminosities into black-hole mass estimates predicts that the radio galaxiesharbour central black holes with masses in the range 10^{8.1}\msun &lt;m_{bh}&lt;10^{9.5}\msun, with a geometric mean of &lt;m_{bh}&gt;=10^{8.87\pm 0.04}\msun.finally, a significant (~3 sigma) correlation is found between black-hole massand 151-mhz radio luminosity for those objects in the sample with eitherhigh-excitation nuclear spectra or classical double radio structures.(abridged)

astro-ph;0702503	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iv: radio-mm-fir  photometric redshifts	we present the redshift distribution of the shades galaxy population based onthe rest-frame radio-mm-fir colours of 120 robustly detected 850um sources inthe lockman hole east (lh) and subaru xmm-newton deep field (sxdf). theredshift distribution derived from the full sed information is shown to benarrower than that determined from the radio-submm spectral index, as morephotometric bands contribute to a higher redshift accuracy. the redshiftdistribution of sources derived from at least two photometric bands peaks at z~ 2.4 and has a near-gaussian distribution, with 50 per cent (interquartilerange) of sources at z=1.8-3.1. we find a statistically-significant differencebetween the measured redshift distributions in the two fields; the sxdf peakingat a slightly lower redshift (median z ~ 2.2) than the lh (median z ~ 2.7),which we attribute to the noise-properties of the radio observations. wedemonstrate however that there could also be field-to-field variations that areconsistent with the measured differences in the redshift distributions, andhence, that the incomplete area observed by shades with scuba, despite beingthe largest sub-mm survey to date, may still be too small to fully characterizethe bright sub-mm galaxy population. finally we present a brief comparison withthe predicted, or assumed, redshift distributions of sub-mm galaxy formationand evolution models, and we derive the contribution of these shades sourcesand the general sub-mm galaxy population to the star formation-rate density atdifferent epochs.

astro-ph;9802260	continuum observations of the high-redshift universe at sub-millimetre  wavelengths	new bolometer arrays operating on the world's largest sub-mm and mmtelescopes offer a unique view of the high-redshift universe with unprecedentedsensitivity. recent sub-millimetre continuum studies show that the hostgalaxies of many luminous high-redshift agn (radio galaxies and radio-quietquasars) radiate strongly at rest-frame far-infrared wavelengths and thuscontain substantial quantities of dust. in the majority of these high-redshiftagn-hosts, the inferred star formation is proceeding at a rate comparable tothat found in local, interacting ultra-luminous fir galaxies. this level ofactivity is an order of magnitude greater than the more modest star-formationrates apparently displayed by the recently-discovered lyman-limit galaxies at z~ 3, which have been argued to represent the era of spheroid formation(although the degree to which the effects of reddening by dust grains may havebiased the interpretation of these optical/uv studies of high-z galaxies hasyet to be properly determined). however, it is too early to say whether suchbright fir emission is a feature of all massive galaxies at z &gt; 3, or whetherit is in fact confined to the hosts of the most luminous agn.  in this paper we review the current status of cosmological observations atsub-mm and mm wavelengths, highlighting our own recent scuba observations ofhigh-redshift radio galaxies. we also explain how observations over the nextfew years should allow the true level of star-formation activity in the high-zuniverse to be properly quantified, and we provide example predictions for thefirst deep sub-millimetre survey (of the hubble deep field), which we and ourcolleagues are currently undertaking with scuba at the jcmt.
