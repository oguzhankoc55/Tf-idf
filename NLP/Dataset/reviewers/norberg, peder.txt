0706.1350	the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies	we identify satellites of isolated galaxies in sdss and examine their angulardistribution. using mock catalogues generated from cosmological n-bodysimulations, we demonstrate that the selection criteria used to select isolatedgalaxies and their satellites must be very strict in order to correctlyidentify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. thecriteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly groupmembers. we refine a set of selection criteria for which the groupcontamination is estimated to be less than 7% and present a catalogue of theresulting sample. the angular distribution of satellites about their host isbiased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for reddisc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colourof the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than itsmorphology. the similar anisotropy measured in this study as in studies thatwere dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are notresponsible for the angular distribution. satellites that are most likely tohave been recently accreted show a tendancy to lie along the same axis as thesurrounding large scale structure. the orientations of isolated early andintermediate-type galaxies also align with the surrounding large scalestructures. we discuss the origin of the anisotropic satellite distribution andconsider the implications of our results, critically assessing the respectiveroles played by the orientation of the visible galaxy within its dark matterhalo; anisotropic accretion of satellites from the larger scale environment;and the biased nature of satellites as tracers of the underlying dark mattersubhalo population.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

0707.3445	void statistics in large galaxy redshift surveys: does halo occupation  of field galaxies depend on environment?	we use measurements of the projected galaxy correlation function w_p andgalaxy void statistics to test whether the galaxy content of halos of fixedmass is systematically different in low density environments. we present newmeasurements of the void probability function (vpf) and underdensityprobability function (upf) from data release four of the sloan digital skysurvey, as well as new measurements of the vpf from the full data release ofthe two-degree field galaxy redshift survey. we compare these measurements topredictions calculated from models of the halo occupation distribution (hod)that are constrained to match both w_p and the space density of galaxies. thestandard implementation of the hod assumes that galaxy occupation depends onhalo mass only, and is independent of local environment. for luminosity-definedsamples, we find that the standard hod prediction is a good match to theobservations, and the data exclude models in which galaxy formation efficiencyis reduced in low-density environments. more remarkably, we find that the voidstatistics of red and blue galaxies (at l ~ 0.4l_*) are perfectly predicted bystandard hod models matched to the correlation function of these samples,ruling out "assembly bias" models in which galaxy color is correlated withlarge-scale environment at fixed halo mass. we conclude that the luminosity andcolor of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo inwhich they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in whichthe host halo formed. in broader terms, our results show that the sizes andemptiness of voids found in the distribution of l &gt; 0.2l_* galaxies are inexcellent agreement with the predictions of a standard cosmological model witha simple connection between galaxies and dark matter halos.

1009.0615	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): fuv, nuv, ugrizyjhk petrosian, kron and  s\`ersic photometry	in order to generate credible 0.1-2 {\mu}m seds, the gama project requiresmany gigabytes of imaging data from a number of instruments to be re-processedinto a standard format. in this paper we discuss the software infrastructure weuse, and create self-consistent ugrizyjhk photometry for all sources within thegama sample. using ukidss and sdss archive data, we outline the pre-processingnecessary to standardise all images to a common zeropoint, the steps taken tocorrect for seeing bias across the dataset, and the creation of gigapixel-scalemosaics of the three 4x12 deg gama regions in each filter. from these mosaics,we extract source catalogues for the gama regions using elliptical kron andpetrosian matched apertures. we also calculate s\'ersic magnitudes for allgalaxies within the gama sample using sigma, a galaxy component modellingwrapper for galfit 3. we compare the resultant photometry directly, and alsocalculate the r band galaxy lf for all photometric datasets to highlight theuncertainty introduced by the photometric method. we find that (1) changing theobject detection threshold has a minor effect on the best-fitting schechterparameters of the overall population (m* +/- 0.055mag, {\alpha} +/- 0.014,{\phi}* +/- 0.0005 h^3 mpc^{-3}). (2) an offset between datasets that use kronor petrosian photometry regardless of the filter. (3) the decision to usecircular or elliptical apertures causes an offset in m* of 0.20mag. (4) thebest-fitting schechter parameters from total-magnitude photometric systems(such as sdss modelmag or s\'ersic magnitudes) have a steeper faint-end slopethan photometry dependent on kron or petrosian magnitudes. (5) our universe'stotal luminosity density, when calculated using kron or petrosian r-bandphotometry, is underestimated by at least 15%.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1106.5701	statistical analysis of galaxy surveys-iv: an objective way to quantify  the impact of superstructures on galaxy clustering statistics	for galaxy clustering to provide robust constraints on cosmologicalparameters and galaxy formation models, it is essential to make reliableestimates of the errors on clustering measurements. we present a new technique,based on a spatial jackknife (jk) resampling, which provides an objective wayto estimate errors on clustering statistics. our approach allows us to set theappropriate size for the jackknife subsamples. the method also provides a meansto assess the impact of individual regions on the measured clustering, andthereby to establish whether or not a given galaxy catalogue is dominated byone or several large structures, preventing it to be considered as a "fairsample". we apply this methodology to the two- and three-point correlationfunctions measured from a volume limited sample of m* galaxies drawn from datarelease seven of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the frequency ofjackknife subsample outliers in the data is shown to be consistent with thatseen in large n-body simulations of clustering in the cosmological constantplus cold dark matter cosmology. we also present a comparison of thethree-point correlation function in sdss and 2dfgrs using this approach andfind consistent measurements between the two samples.

1108.0635	galaxy and mass assembly: stellar mass estimates	this paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically-derived stellarmass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z &lt; 0.65) galaxies in the galaxy andmass assembly (gama) spectroscopic redshift survey. these masses, as well asthe full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public aspart of gama data release 2. although the gama database does include nirphotometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fitsis significantly poorer when these nir data are included. further, for a largefraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from theoptical-plus-nir photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred fromthe optical data alone. this may indicate problems in our stellar populationlibrary, or nir data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for futureversions of the catalogue. for now, we have chosen to base our stellar massestimates on optical photometry only. in light of our decision to ignore theavailable nir data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained basedon optical data alone. we use generic properties of stellar populationsynthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle avery good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, m*/li. further, we use theobserved relation between restframe (g-i) and m*/li for real gama galaxies toargue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves,(g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate m*/li to an accuracy of &lt; ~0.1dex. this 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-m*/li relation offers a simple andtransparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimaldata, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their resultsto z &lt; ~0.4 measurements from gama.

0710.5473	massive dark matter halos around bright isolated galaxies in the 2dfgrs	we identify a large sample of isolated bright galaxies and their faintersatellites in the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we analyse the dynamicsof ensembles of these galaxies selected according to luminosity andmorphological type by stacking the positions of their satellites and estimatingthe velocity dispersion of the combined set. we test our methodology usingrealistic mock catalogues constructed from cosmological simulations. the methodreturns an unbiased estimate of the velocity dispersion provided that theisolation criterion is strict enough to avoid contamination and that thescatter in halo mass at fixed primary luminosity is small. using a maximumlikelihood estimator that accounts for interlopers, we determine the satellitevelocity dispersion within a projected radius of 175 kpc/h. the dispersionincreases with the luminosity of the primary and is larger for ellipticalgalaxies than for spiral galaxies of similar bj luminosity. calibrating themass-velocity dispersion relation using our mock catalogues, we find adynamical mass within 175 kpc/h of m_175 ~ 4.0^{+2.3}_{-1.5} 10^12 (l_bj/l_*)m_sol/h for elliptical galaxies and m_175 ~ 6.3^{+6.3}_{-3.1} 10^11(l_bj/l_*)^1.6 msol/h for spiral galaxies. finally, we compare our results withrecent studies and investigate their limitations using our mock catalogues.

1206.4049	lightcone mock catalogues from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation  - i. construction and application to the bzk colour selection	we introduce a method for constructing end-to-end mock galaxy cataloguesusing a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, applied to the halo mergertrees extracted from a cosmological n-body simulation. the mocks that weconstruct are lightcone catalogues, in which a galaxy is placed according tothe epoch at which it first enters the past lightcone of the observer, andincorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with cosmic time. we determinethe position between the snapshot outputs at which a galaxy enters theobserver's lightcone by interpolation. as an application, we consider theeffectiveness of the bzk colour selection technique, which was designed toisolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5. the mock catalogue is inreasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all bzk galaxies, aswell as with the observed counts of the subsample of bzks that are star-forminggalaxies. we predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies withk_{ab}&lt;=23, and 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5, are selected by the bzk technique. interlopergalaxies, outside the intended redshift range, are predicted to dominate brightsamples of bzk galaxies (i.e. with k_{ab}&lt;=21). fainter k-band cuts arenecessary to reduce the predicted interloper fraction. we also show thatshallow b-band photometry can lead to confusion in classifying bzk galaxies asbeing star-forming or passively evolving. overall, we conclude that the bzkcolour selection technique is capable of providing a sample of galaxies that isrepresentative of the 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 galaxy population.

1301.3497	how robust are predictions of galaxy clustering?	we use the millennium simulation database to compare how different versionsof the durham and munich semi-analytical galaxy formation models populate darkmatter haloes with galaxies. the models follow the same physical processes butdiffer in how these are implemented. all of the models we consider use themillennium n-body simulation; however, the durham and munich groups useindependent algorithms to construct halo merger histories. we compare thepredicted halo occupation distributions (hods) and correlation functions forgalaxy samples defined by stellar mass, cold gas mass and star formation rate.the predictions for the hod are remarkably similar for samples ranked bystellar mass. the predicted bias averaged over 5-25 mpc/h is consistent betweenmodels to within 10%. at small pair separations there is a difference in thepredicted clustering. this arises because the durham models allow somesatellite galaxies to merge with the central galaxy in a halo when they arestill associated with resolved subhaloes. the agreement between the models isless good for samples defined by cold gas mass or star formation rate, with thesmall scale clustering differing by an order of magnitude, reflecting theuncertainty in the modelling of star formation. the model predictions in thesecases are qualitatively similar, with a markedly shallower slope for thecorrelation function than is found for stellar mass selected samples and withthe hod displaying an asymmetric peak for central galaxies. we provideillustrative parametric fits to the hods predicted by the models. our resultsreveal the current limitations on how well we can predict galaxy bias in afixed cosmology, which has implications for the interpretation of constraintson the physics of galaxy formation from galaxy clustering measurements and theability of future galaxy surveys to measure dark energy.

1312.4736	the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey: the role of galaxy group environment  in the star formation rate versus stellar mass relation and quiescent  fraction out to $z \sim 0.8$	using a large sample of field and group galaxies drawn from the pan-starrs1medium-deep survey, we present the specific star formation rate (ssfr) -stellar mass (m*) relation, as well as the quiescent fraction versus m*relation in different environments. we confirm that the fraction of quiescentgalaxies is strongly dependent on environment at a fixed stellar mass, but thatthe amplitude and the slope of the star-forming sequence is similar between thefield and groups: in other words, the ssfr-density relation at a fixed stellarmass is primarily driven by the change in the star-forming and quiescentfractions between different environments rather than a global suppression inthe star formation rate for the star-forming population. however, when werestrict our sample to the cluster-scale environments ($m&gt;10^{14}m_{solar}$),we find a global reduction in the ssfr of the star forming sequence of $17\%$at 4$\sigma$ confidence as opposed to its field counterpart. after removing thestellar mass dependence of the quiescent fraction seen in field galaxies, theexcess in the quiescent fraction due to the environment quenching in groups andclusters is found to increase with stellar mass. we argue that these resultsare in favor of galaxy mergers to be the primary environment quenchingmechanism operating in galaxy groups whereas strangulation is able to reproducethe observed trend in the environment quenching efficiency and stellar massrelation seen in clusters. our results also suggest that the relativeimportance between mass quenching and environment quenching depends on stellarmass -- the mass quenching plays a dominant role in producing quiescentgalaxies for more massive galaxies, while less massive galaxies are quenchedmostly through the environmental effect, with the transition mass around$1-2\times10^{10}m_{solar}$ in the group/cluster environment.

1406.7181	the co-evolution of black hole growth and star formation from a  cross-correlation analysis between quasars and the cosmic infrared background	we present the first cross-correlation measurement between sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) type 1 quasars and the cosmic infrared background (cib) measuredby herschel. the distribution of the quasars at 0.15&lt;z&lt;3.5 covers the redshiftrange where we expect most of the cib to originate. we detect the sub-mmemission of the quasars, which dominates on small scales, as well as correlatedemission from dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) dominant on larger scales.the mean sub-mm flux densities of the dr7 quasars (median redshift &lt;z&gt;=1.4) is$11.1^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$, $7.1^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$ and $3.6^{+1.4}_{-1.0}$ mjy at 250,350 and 500 microns, respectively, while the mean sub-mm flux densities of thedr9 quasars (&lt;z&gt;=2.5) is $5.7^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$, $5.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ and$1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ mjy. we find that the correlated sub-mm emission includesboth the emission from satellite dsfgs in the same halo as the central quasarand the emission from dsfgs in separate halos (correlated with thequasar-hosting halo). the amplitude of the one-halo term is ~10 times smallerthan the sub-mm emission of the quasars, implying the the satellites have alower star-formation rate than the quasars. the satellite fraction for the dr7quasars is $0.008^{+0.008}_{-0.005}$ and the host halo mass scale for thecentral and satellite quasars is $10^{12.36\pm0.87}$ m$_{\odot}$ and$10^{13.60\pm0.38}$ m$_{\odot}$, respectively. the satellite fraction of thedr9 quasars is $0.065^{+0.021}_{-0.031}$ and the host halo mass scale for thecentral and satellite quasars is $10^{12.29\pm0.62}$ m$_{\odot}$ and$10^{12.82\pm0.39}$ m$_{\odot}$, respectively. thus, the typical haloenvironment of the sdss type 1 quasars is found to be similar to that of dsfgs,which supports the generally accepted view that dusty starburst and quasaractivity are evolutionarily linked.

1407.7555	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): stellar mass functions by hubble type	we present an estimate of the galaxy stellar mass function and its divisionby morphological type in the local (0.025 &lt; z &lt; 0.06) universe. adopting robustmorphological classifications as previously presented (kelvin et al.) for asample of 3,727 galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly survey, wedefine a local volume and stellar mass limited sub-sample of 2,711 galaxies toa lower stellar mass limit of m = 10^9.0 m_sun. we confirm that the galaxystellar mass function is well described by a double schechter function given bym* = 10^10.64 m_sun, {\alpha}1 = -0.43, {\phi}*1 = 4.18 dex^-1 mpc^-3,{\alpha}2 = -1.50 and {\phi}*2 = 0.74 dex^-1 mpc^-3. the constituentmorphological-type stellar mass functions are well sampled above our lowerstellar mass limit, excepting the faint little blue spheroid population ofgalaxies. we find approximately 71+3-4% of the stellar mass in the localuniverse is found within spheroid dominated galaxies; ellipticals and s0-sas.the remaining 29+4-3% falls predominantly within late type disk dominatedsystems, sab-scds and sd-irrs. adopting reasonable bulge-to-total ratiosimplies that approximately half the stellar mass today resides in spheroidalstructures, and half in disk structures. within this local sample, we findapproximate stellar mass proportions for e : s0-sa : sab-scd : sd-irr of 34 :37 : 24 : 5.

1408.5984	galaxy and mass assembly: deconstructing bimodality - i. red ones and  blue ones	we measure the mass functions for generically red and blue galaxies, using az &lt; 0.12 sample of log m* &gt; 8.7 field galaxies from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. our motivation is that, as we show, the dominantuncertainty in existing measurements stems from how 'red' and 'blue' galaxieshave been selected/defined. accordingly, we model our data as two naturallyoverlapping populations, each with their own mass function and colour-massrelation, which enables us characterise the two populations without having tospecify a priori which galaxies are 'red' and 'blue'. our results then providethe means to derive objective operational definitions for the terms 'red' and'blue', which are based on the phenomenology of the colour-mass diagrams.  informed by this descriptive modelling, we show that: 1.) after accountingfor dust, the stellar colours of 'blue' galaxies do not depend strongly onmass; 2.) the tight, flat 'dead sequence' does not extend much below log m* ~10.5; instead, 3.) the stellar colours of 'red' galaxies vary rather stronglywith mass, such that lower mass 'red' galaxies have bluer stellar populations;4.) below log m* ~ 9.3, the 'red' population dissolves into obscurity, and itbecomes problematic to talk about two distinct populations; as a consequence,5.) it is hard to meaningfully constrain the shape, including the possibilityof an upturn, of the 'red' galaxy mass function below log m* ~ 9. points 1-4provide meaningful targets for models of galaxy formation and evolution to aimfor.

1409.4681	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the dependence of the galaxy luminosity  function on environment, redshift and colour	we use 80922 galaxies in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey tomeasure the galaxy luminosity function (lf) in different environments over theredshift range 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.26. the depth and size of gama allows us to definesamples split by colour and redshift to measure the dependence of the lf onenvironment, redshift and colour. we find that the lf varies smoothly withoverdensity, consistent with previous results, with little environmentaldependent evolution over the last 3 gyrs. the modified galform modelpredictions agree remarkably well with our lfs split by environment,particularly in the most overdense environments. the lfs predicted by the modelfor both blue and red galaxies are consistent with gama for the environmentsand luminosities at which such galaxies dominate. discrepancies between themodel and the data seen in the faint end of the lf suggest too many faint redgalaxies are predicted, which is likely to be due to the over-quenching ofsatellite galaxies. the excess of bright blue galaxies predicted in underdenseregions could be due to the implementation of agn feedback not beingsufficiently effective in the lower mass halos.

1411.6355	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mass-size relations of z$&lt;$0.1 galaxies  subdivided by s\'ersic index, colour and morphology	we use data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey in the redshiftrange 0.01$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.1 (8399 galaxies in $g$ to $k_s$ bands) to derive thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations for various divisions of 'early'and 'late'-type samples. we find the choice of division between early and late(i.e., colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical, however, theadopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e., the careful rejection ofoutliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. in particular wenote that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits($&lt;10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$) the s\'ersic index bimodality, evident for highmass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separatorof early- and late-type systems. the final set of stellar mass $-$ half-lightradius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10bands ($ugrizzyjhk_s$) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-zbenchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. exploring the variation of thestellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlierfindings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at asmaller level than previously noted: at $10^{10}\mathcal{m_{\odot}}$ bothspiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13% from $g$ to $k_s$(which is near linear in log wavelength). finally we note that the sizes usedin this work are derived from 2d s\'ersic light profile fitting (usinggalfit3), i.e., elliptical semi-major half light radii, improving on earlierlow-z benchmarks based on circular apertures.

1505.05518	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): trends in galaxy colours, morphology,  and stellar populations with large scale structure, group, and pair  environments	we explore trends in galaxy properties with mpc-scale structures usingcatalogues of environment and large scale structure from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. existing gama catalogues of large scale structure,group and pair membership allow us to construct galaxy stellar mass functionsfor different environmental types. to avoid simply extracting the knownunderlying correlations between galaxy properties and stellar mass, we create amass matched sample of galaxies with stellar masses between $9.5 \leq\log{m_*/h^{-2} m_{\odot}} \leq 11$ for each environmental population. usingthese samples, we show that mass normalised galaxies in different large scaleenvironments have similar energy outputs, $u-r$ colours, luminosities, andmorphologies. extending our analysis to group and pair environments, we showgalaxies that are not in groups or pairs exhibit similar characteristics toeach other regardless of broader environment. for our mass controlled sample,we fail to see a strong dependence of s\'{e}rsic index or galaxy luminosity onhalo mass, but do find that it correlates very strongly with colour. repeatingour analysis for galaxies that have not been mass controlled introduces andamplifies trends in the properties of galaxies in pairs, groups, and largescale structure, indicating that stellar mass is the most important predictorof the galaxy properties we examine, as opposed to environmentalclassifications.

1507.00737	the masses of satellites in gama galaxy groups from 100 square degrees  of kids weak lensing data	we use the first 100 sq. deg. of overlap between the kilo-degree survey(kids) and the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey to determine the galaxyhalo mass of ~10,000 spectroscopically-confirmed satellite galaxies in massive($m &gt; 10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm m}_\odot$) galaxy groups. separating the sample as afunction of projected distance to the group centre, we jointly model thesatellites and their host groups with navarro-frenk-white (nfw) densityprofiles, fully accounting for the data covariance. the probed satellitegalaxies in these groups have total masses $\log m_{\rm sub} /(h^{-1}{\rmm}_\odot) \approx 11.7 - 12.2$ consistent across group-centric distance withinthe errorbars. given their typical stellar masses, $\log m_{\rm\star,sat}/(h^{-2}{\rm m}_\odot) \sim 10.5$, such total masses imply stellarmass fractions of $m_{\rm \star,sat} /m_{\rm sub} \approx 0.04 h^{-1}$ . theaverage subhalo hosting these satellite galaxies has a mass $m_{\rm sub} \sim0.015m_{\rm host}$ independent of host halo mass, in broad agreement with theexpectations of structure formation in a $\lambda$cdm universe.

1509.02159	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): projected galaxy clustering	we measure the projected 2-point correlation function of galaxies in the 180deg$^2$ equatorial regions of the gama ii survey, for four different redshiftslices between z = 0.0 and z=0.5. to do this we further develop the cole (2011)method of producing suitable random catalogues for the calculation ofcorrelation functions. we find that more r-band luminous, more massive andredder galaxies are more clustered. we also find that red galaxies havestronger clustering on scales less than ~3 $h^{-1}$ mpc. we compare to twodifferent versions of the galform galaxy formation model, lacey et al (inprep.) and gonzalez-perez et al. (2014), and find that the models reproduce thetrend of stronger clustering for more massive galaxies. however, the modelsunder predict the clustering of blue galaxies, can incorrectly predict thecorrelation function on small scales and under predict the clustering in oursample of galaxies with ~3$l_r$ . we suggest possible avenues to explore toimprove these cluster- ing predictions. the measurements presented in thispaper can be used to test other galaxy formation models, and we make themeasurements available online to facilitate this.

1511.02034	recovering dark-matter clustering from galaxies with gaussianization	the gaussianization transform has been proposed as a method to remove theissues of scale-dependent galaxy bias and nonlinearity from galaxy clusteringstatistics, but these benefits have yet to be thoroughly tested for realisticgalaxy samples. in this paper, we test the effectiveness of the gaussianizationtransform for different galaxy types by applying it to realistic simulated blueand red galaxy samples. we show that in real space, the shapes of thegaussianized power spectra of both red and blue galaxies agree with that of theunderlying dark matter, with the initial power spectrum, and with each other tosmaller scales than do the statistics of the usual (untransformed) densityfield. however, we find that the agreement in the gaussianized statisticsbreaks down in redshift space. we attribute this to the fact that red and bluegalaxies exhibit very different fingers of god in redshift space. afterapplying a finger-of-god compression, the agreement on small scales between thegaussianized power spectra is restored. we also compare the gaussianizationtransform to the clipped galaxy density field and find that while both methodsare effective in real space, they have more complicated behaviour in redshiftspace. overall, we find that gaussianization can be useful in recovering theshape of the underlying dark matter power spectrum to k ~ 0.5 h/mpc and of theinitial power spectrum to k ~ 0.4 h/mpc in certain cases at z = 0.

astro-ph;0005535	on the formation of massive stars by accretion	(abriged) at present, there are two scenarios for the formation of massivestars: 1) the accretion scenario and 2) the coalescence scenario, which impliesthe merging of intermediate mass stars. we examine here some properties of thefirst one. we calculate three different sets of birthlines, i.e. tracksfollowed by a continuously accreting star. first, three models with a constantaccretion rate ($\dot{m}_{\rm{accr}}$ = $10^{-6}$, $10^{-5}$, $10^{-4}$m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). then several birthlines following the accretion modelsof bernasconi and maeder (\cite{bm96}), which have $\dot{m}_{\rm{accr}}$increasing only slightly with mass. finally we calculate several birthlines forwhich $\dot{m}_{accr} = \dot{m}_{\mathrm{ref}} ({\frac{m}{m_{\odot}}})^{\phi}$, with values of $\phi$ equal to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 and also fordifferent values of $\dot{m}_{\mathrm{ref}}$. the best fit to the observationsof pms stars in the hr diagram is achieved for $\phi$ between 1.0 or 1.5 andfor $\dot{m}_{\mathrm{ref}} \simeq 10^{-5}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.considerations on the lifetimes favour values of $\phi$ equal to 1.5. theseaccretion rates do well correspond to those derived from radio and irobservations of mass outflows. we emphasize the importance of the accretionscenario for shaping the imf, and in particular for determining the upper masslimit of stars. in the accretion scenario, this upper mass limit will be givenby the mass for which the accretion rate is such that the accretion inducedshock luminosity is of the order of the eddington luminosity.

astro-ph;0012429	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: near infrared galaxy luminosity  functions	we combine the 2mass extended source catalogue and the 2dfgrs to produce anir selected galaxy catalogue with 17,173 measured redshifts. we use thisextensive dataset to estimate the j and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. thelfs are fairly well fit by schechter functions with j: m*-5log h=-22.36+/-0.02, alpha= -0.93+/-0.04, phi=0.0104+/-0.0016 h^3/mpc^3 and k:m*-5log h= -23.44+/-0.03, alpha=-0.96+/-0.05, phi=0.0108+/-0.0016 h^3/mpc^3(2mass kron magnitudes). these parameters assume a cosmological model withomega=0.3 and lambda=0.7. with datasets of this size, systematic rather thanrandom errors are the dominant source of uncertainty in the determination ofthe lf. we carry out a careful investigation of possible systematic effects inour data. the surface brightness distribution of the sample shows no evidencethat significant numbers of low surface brightness or compact galaxies aremissed by the survey. we estimate the present-day distributions of b-k and j-kcolours as a function of absolute magnitude and use models of the galaxystellar populations, constrained by the observed optical and infrared colours,to infer the galaxy stellar mass function. integrated over all galaxy masses,this yields a total mass fraction in stars (in units of the critical massdensity) of omega_*.h= (1.6+/-0.24)/10^3 for a kennicutt imf and omega_*.h=(2.9+/-0.43)/10^3 for a salpeter imf. these values agree with those inferredfrom observational estimates of the star formation history of the universeprovided that dust extinction corrections are modest.

astro-ph;0109152	evidence for a non-zero lambda and a low matter density from a combined  analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey and cosmic microwave background  anisotropies	we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the power spectra of the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropiesunder the assumptions that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic, gaussianand well described by power laws with scalar and tensor indices of n_s and n_t.on its own, the 2dfgrs sets tight limits on the parameter combination omega_mh, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density inbaryons omega_b/omega_m. the cmb anisotropy data alone set poor constraints onthe cosmological constant and hubble constant because of a `geometricaldegeneracy' among parameters. furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the cmbdata allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons andcold dark matter. combining the cmb and 2dfgrs data sets helps to break boththe geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. the values of the parametersderived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models ofinflation, with the baryon density derived from primordial nucleosynthesis andwith direct measurements of the hubble parameter. in particular, we find strongevidence for a positive cosmological constant with a pm 2sigma range of 0.65 &lt;omega_lambda &lt; 0.85, completely independently of constraints on omega_\lambdaderived from type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0109167	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: a targeted study of catalogued clusters  of galaxies	we have carried out a study of known clusters within the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) observed areas and have identified 431 abell, 173 apm and 343edcc clusters. precise redshifts, velocity dispersions and new centroids havebeen measured for the majority of these objects, and this information has beenused to study the completeness of these catalogues, the level of contaminationfrom foreground and background structures along the cluster's line of sight,the space density of the clusters as a function of redshift, and their velocitydispersion distributions. we find that the abell and edcc catalogues arecontaminated at the level of about 10%, whereas the apm catalogue suffers only5% contamination. if we use the original catalog centroids, the level ofcontamination rises to approximately 15% for the abell and edcc catalogues,showing that the presence of foreground and background groups may alter therichness of clusters in these catalogues. there is a deficiency of clusters at$z \sim 0.05$ that may correspond to a large underdensity in the southernhemisphere. from the cumulative distribution of velocity dispersions for theseclusters, we derive an upper limit to the space density of $\sigma &gt; 1000 \kms$clusters of $3.6 \times 10^{-6} \hdens$. this result is used to constrainmodels for structure formation; our data favour low-density cosmologies,subject to the usual assumptions concerning the shape and normalization of thepower spectrum.

astro-ph;0112162	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the amplitudes of fluctuations in the  2dfgrs and the cmb, and implications for galaxy biasing	we compare the amplitudes of fluctuations probed by the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey and by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies. by combining the 2dfgrs and cmb data we find the linear-theoryrms mass fluctuations in 8 mpc/h spheres to be sigma_8 = 0.73 +-0.05 (aftermarginalization over the matter density parameter omega_m and three other freeparameters). this normalization is lower than the cobe normalization andprevious estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with somerevised cluster abundance determinations. we also estimate thescale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch l_s = 1.9l_* apm-selectedgalaxies to be b(l_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.15h/mpc. if luminosity segregation operates on these scales, l_* galaxies wouldbe almost un-biased, b(l_*,z=0) = 0.96. these results are derived by assuming aflat lambda-cdm universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters andfixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.we also study the best fit pair (omega_m,b), and the robustness of the resultsto varying n and tau. various modelling corrections can each change theresulting b by 5-15 per cent. the results are compared with other independentmeasurements from the 2dfgrs itself, and from the sdss, cluster abundance andcosmic shear.

astro-ph;0203336	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the environmental dependence of galaxy  star formation rates near clusters	we have measured the equivalent width of the h-alpha emission line for 11006galaxies brighter than m_b=-19 (lcdm) at 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 in the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2df), in the fields of seventeen known galaxy clusters. the limitedredshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, andto residuals from night sky emission lines. we use these measurements to tracemustar, the star formation rate normalized to lstar, as a function of distancefrom the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. we find that thedistribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasingdistance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution atdistances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. a correlation between starformation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independentof cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1galaxy (brighter than m_b=-19) per mpc^2. this characteristic scale correspondsapproximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. the samecorrelation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the clustercentre. we conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are notrestricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the densityexceeds this critical value. the present day abundance of such systems, and thestrong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth ofstructure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average starformation rate. finally, the low star formation rates well beyond thevirialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressurestripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations ingalaxy properties with environment.

astro-ph;0206256	parameter constraints for flat cosmologies from cmb and 2dfgrs power  spectra	we constrain flat cosmological models with a joint likelihood analysis of anew compilation of data from the cosmic microwave background (cmb) and from the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). fitting the cmb alone yields a knowndegeneracy between the hubble constant h and the matter density omega_m, whicharises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular powerspectrum. this `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail andshown to follow a simple relation omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. adding the 2dfgrspower spectrum constrains omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. if tensoranisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the hubbleconstant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and thephysical cdm and baryon densities omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.002 (standard rms errors). including a possible tensor componentcauses very little change to these figures; we set a upper limit to thetensor-to-scalar ratio of r&lt;0.7 at 95% confidence. we then show how these datacan be used to constrain the equation of state of the vacuum, and find w&lt;-0.52at 95% confidence. the preferred cosmological model is thus very wellspecified, and we discuss the precision with which future cmb data can bepredicted, given the model assumptions. the 2dfgrs power-spectrum data andcovariance matrix, and the cmb data compilation used here, are available fromhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/

(2002). the two-point correlation functionfor the local radio population is found to be entirely consistent withestimates obtained for the whole sample of 2dfgrs galaxies. we estimate theparameters of the real-space correlation function xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma},r_0=6.7^{+0.9}_{-1.1} mpc and \gamma=1.6\pm 0.1, where h=0.7 is assumed.different results are instead obtained if we only consider sources that presentsignatures of agn activity in their spectra. these objects are shown to be verystrongly correlated, with r_0=10.9^{+1.0}_{-1.2} mpc and \gamma=2\pm 0.1, asteeper slope than has been claimed in other recent works. no difference isfound in the clustering properties of radio-agns of different radio luminosity.these results show that agn-fuelled sources reside in dark matter halos moremassive than \sim 10^{13.4} m_{\sun}},higher the corresponding figure forradio-quiet qsos. this value can be converted into a minimum black hole massassociated with radio-loud, agn-fuelled objects of m_{bh}^{min}\sim 10^9m_{\sun}. the above results then suggest -at least for relatively faint radioobjects -the existence of a threshold black hole mass associated with the onsetof significant radio activity such as that of radio-loud agns; however, oncethe activity is triggered, there appears to be no evidence for a connectionbetween black hole mass and level of radio output.

astro-ph;0404033	probing dark matter haloes with satellite kinematics	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys we investigate to what extent thekinematics of large samples of satellites galaxies extracted from flux-limitedsurveys can be used to constrain halo masses. previous host-satellite selectioncriteria yield relatively large fractions of interlopers and with a velocitydistribution that, contrary to what has typically been assumed, differsstrongly from uniform. a new adaptive selection criterion is proposed whichyields much larger host-satellite samples and with strongly reduced interloperfractions. we show that satellite weighting, which occurs naturally whenstacking many host-satellite pairs, introduces a bias towards higher velocitydispersions compared to the true, host-averaged mean. a further bias, in thesame direction, is introduced when using flux-limited, rather thanvolume-limited surveys. we apply our adaptive selection criterion to the 2dfgrsand obtain a sample of 12613 satellite galaxies and 8004 host galaxies. thesatellite kinematics are in excellent agreement with predictions based on theconditional luminosity function (clf), providing independent, dynamicalconfirmation of the average mass-to-light ratios predicted by the clfformalism.

astro-ph;0405021	substructure analysis of selected low richness 2dfgrs clusters of  galaxies	complementary one-, two-, and three-dimensional tests for detecting thepresence of substructure in clusters of galaxies are applied to recentlyobtained data from the 2df galaxy redshift survey. the sample of 25 clustersused in this study includes 16 clusters not previously investigated forsubstructure. substructure is detected at or greater than the 99% cl level inat least one test for 21 of the 25 clusters studied here. from the results, itappears that low richness clusters commonly contain subclusters participatingin mergers. about half of the clusters have two or more components within 0.5h^{-1} mpc of the cluster centroid, and at least three clusters (abell 1139,abell 1663, and abell s333) exhibit velocity-position characteristicsconsistent with the presence of possible cluster rotation, shear, or infalldynamics. the geometry of certain features is consistent with influence by thehost supercluster environments. in general, our results support the hypothesisthat low richness clusters relax to structureless equilibrium states on verylong dynamical time scales (if at all).

astro-ph;0406036	cosmic evolution of quasar clustering: implications for the host haloes	we present detailed clustering measurements from the 2df qso redshift survey(2qz) in the redshift range 0.8&lt;z&lt;2.1. using a flux limited sample of ~14,000objects with effective redshift z_eff=1.47, we estimate the quasar projectedcorrelation function for separations 1&lt;r/h^{-1} mpc&lt;20. we find that the2-point correlation function in real space is well approximated by a power lawwith slope gamma=1.5 pm 0.2 and comoving correlation lengthr_0=4.8^{+0.9}_{-1.5} h^{-1} mpc. splitting the sample into three subsets basedon redshift, we find evidence for an increase of the clustering amplitude withlookback time. for a fixed gamma, evolution of r_0 is detected at the 3.6 sigmaconfidence level. the ratio between the quasar correlation function and themass autocorrelation function (derived adopting the concordance cosmologicalmodel) is found to be scale independent. for a linear mass-clustering amplitudesigma_8=0.8, the ``bias parameter'' decreases from b~3.9$ at z_eff=1.89 tob~1.8 at z_eff=1.06. from the observed abundance and clustering, we infer howquasars populate dark-matter haloes of different masses. we find that 2qzquasars sit in haloes with m&gt;10^{12} m_sun and that the mean mass of their hosthaloes is of the order of 10^{13} m_sun. the observed clustering is consistentwith assuming that the locally observed correlation between black-hole mass andhost-galaxy circular velocity is still valid at z&gt;1. from the fraction ofhaloes which contain active quasars, we infer that the characteristic quasarlifetime is t_q ~ a few x 10^7 yr at z~1 and approaches 10^8 yr at higherredshifts.

astro-ph;0406246	the abundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (mgrss) we investigate theabundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies. the mock surveys areconstructed using the conditional luminosity function (clf), and are comparedagainst data from the 2dfgrs. we use monte carlo markov chains to explore thefull posterior distribution of the clf parameter space, and show that theaverage relation between light and mass is tightly constrained. the radialnumber density distribution of satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs reveals apronounced absence of satellites at small projected separations from their hostgalaxies. this is (at least partially) due to the overlap and merging of galaxyimages in the apm catalogue. because of the resulting close-pair incompletenesswe are unfortunately unable to put meaningful constraints on the radialdistribution of satellite galaxies. marginalizing over the full clf parameterspace, we show that in a lcdm concordance cosmology the observed abundances ofhost and satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs indicate a power spectrumnormalization of sigma_8=0.7. the same cosmology but with sigma_8=0.9 is unableto simultanously match the abundances of host and satellite galaxies. thisconfirms our previous conclusions based on the pairwise peculiar velocitydispersions and the group multipliticy function.

astro-ph;0407537	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity functions by density  environment and galaxy type	we use the 2df galaxy redshift survey to measure the dependence of thebj-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined bydensity contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1mpc, and on spectral type, determinedfrom principal component analysis. we find that the galaxy populations at bothextremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. thepopulation in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudesbrighter than m_bj-5log10h &lt;-18.5. in contrast, cluster regions have a relativeexcess of very bright early-type galaxies with m_bj-5log10h &lt; -21. differencesin the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: atm_bj-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparableabundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order ofmagnitude. we find that the luminosity functions measured in all densityenvironments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by schechterfunctions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in afashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. theseobserved variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of theoverall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, mayprove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0408536	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the local e+a galaxy population	we select a sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) e+a galaxies from the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the spectra of these objects are defined by stronghydrogen balmer absorption lines (h-delta, h-gamma, h-beta) combined with alack of [oii] 3727a emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst ofstar formation. the e+a spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the processof evolution. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity function of the e+a galaxies. we find that the environments areconsistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies: low-redshift e+a systems arelocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poorgroups. however, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using threebalmer absorption lines h-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (e/s0)systems. in a small but significant number we find evidence for recent majormergers, such as tidal tails. we infer that major mergers are one importantformation mechanism for e+a galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. at lowredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thusthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usualmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. regarding the selection of e+agalaxies: we find that basing the balmer-line criterion solely on h-deltaabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems withdetectable h-alpha emission. in these objects the [oii] emission is presumablyeither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the(h-gamma, h-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

astro-ph;0508207	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: correlation with the rosat-eso flux  limited x-ray (reflex) galaxy cluster survey	the rosat-eso flux limited x-ray (reflex) galaxy cluster survey and the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) respectively comprise the largest, homogeneousx-ray selected cluster catalogue and completed galaxy redshift survey. in thiswork we combine these two outstanding datasets in order to study the effect ofthe large-scale cluster environment, as traced by x-ray luminosity, on theproperties of the cluster member galaxies. we measure the lx-sigma relationfrom the correlated dataset and find it to be consistent with recent resultsfound in the literature. using a sample of 19 clusters with lx&gt;=0.36*10^44 ergs^-1 in the (0.1-2.4 kev) band, and 49 clusters with lower x-ray luminosity, wefind that the fraction of early spectral type (eta&lt;=-1.4), passively-evolvinggalaxies is significantly higher in the high-lx sample within r200. we extendthe investigation to include composite bj cluster luminosity functions, andfind that the characteristic magnitude of the schechter-function fit to theearly-type luminosity function is fainter for the high-lx sample compared tothe low-lx sample (delta m*=0.58+/-0.14). this seems to be driven by a deficitof such galaxies with m_bj ~ -21. in contrast, we find no significantdifferences between the luminosity functions of star-forming, late-typegalaxies. we believe these results are consistent with a scenario in which thehigh-lx clusters are more dynamically evolved systems than the low-lx clusters.

astro-ph;0603543	on the luminosity dependence of the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion	(abridged) we make predictions for the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd) ofgalaxies with models that are constrained to match the projected correlationfunction and luminosity function of galaxies in the two-degree field galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). we use these data to constrain the halo occupationdistribution (hod), then calculate the pvd by populating the halos of a highresolution n-body simulation. we examine the luminosity and scale dependence ofthe predicted pvd. at r&lt;1 mpc/h and r&gt;3 mpc/h, we find that the pvd decreaseswith increasing galaxy luminosity. this result is mostly driven by the fractionof satellite galaxies f_sat, which is well-constrained by the correlationfunction. we find f_sat~25% for galaxies fainter than l_star, while forbrighter galaxies the satellite fraction rapidly declines, creating thedecrease in the pvd with luminosity. at r=1 mpc/h, the pvd has no dependence onluminosity because satellite galaxies dominate the statistics for all objects.recent measurements of the pvd in fourier space using the "dispersion model"have reported a strong decline in pvd with increasing luminosity at k=1 h/mpc.we test this method with our hod models, finding that there is no consistentcomparison between the pvd at a given k and the true dispersion at a givenvalue of r. this results in a luminosity dependence in k-space that is strongerthan in configuration space. the luminosity dependence of the hod results infourier space are consistent with those measured at k=1 h/mpc; thus the recentmeasurements of the pvd are fully explainable in the context of halo occupationmodels. the normalization of the pvd is lower than predicted by our fiducialmodel, and reproducing it requires a lower value of omega_m (~0.2 instead of0.3), a lower value of sigma_8 (~0.7 instead of 0.9), or strong velocity bias.

astro-ph;0607348	luminosity and redshift dependent quasar clustering	we present detailed clustering measurements for a flux limited sample of14,000 quasars extracted from the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz) in the redshiftrange 0.8&lt;z&lt;2.1. after splitting the sample into three redshift bins and eachof them into six luminosity intervals, we estimate the quasar projected autoand cross-correlation functions at a given redshift for separations 3 &lt;r/(mpc/h) &lt; 20. fitting the data with a biased cdm model and using afrequentist analysis (the f-test), we find that models with luminositydependent clustering are statistically favoured at the 95 per cent confidencelevel for z&gt;1.3. on the other hand, a number of tests based on informationtheory and bayesian statistics show only marginal evidence for luminositydependent clustering. anyway, the quality of the data is not good enough toaccurately quantify how quasar biasing depends on luminosity. we criticallydiscuss the limitations of our dataset and show that a much larger sample isneeded to rule out current models for luminosity segregation. studying theevolution of the clustering amplitude with redshift, we detect an increase ofthe quasar correlation length with lookback time at the 99.3 per centconfidence level. adopting the concordance cosmological model, we discuss theevolution of quasar biasing with cosmic epoch and show that quasars aretypically hosted by dark matter haloes with mass ~10^{13} m_sol.

astro-ph;0611313	statistical analysis of galaxy surveys - iii: the non-linear clustering  of red and blue galaxies in the 2dfgrs	we present measurements of the higher-order clustering of red and bluegalaxies as a function of scale and luminosity made from the two-degree fieldgalaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we use a counts-in-cells analysis to estimatethe volume averaged correlation functions, xi_p, as a function of scale up toorder p=5, and also the reduced void probability function. hierarchicalamplitudes are constructed using the estimates of the correlation functions:s_p=(xi_p/xi_2)^(p-1). we find that: 1) red galaxies display strongerclustering than blue galaxies at all orders measured. 2) red galaxies showvalues of s_p that are strongly dependent on luminosity, whereas blue galaxiesshow no segregation in s_p within the errors; this is remarkable given thesegregation in the variance. 3) the linear relative bias shows the oppositetrend to the hierarchical amplitudes, with little segregation for the redsequence and some segregation for the blue. 4) faint red galaxies deviatesignificantly from the "universal" negative binomial reduced void probabilitiesfollowed by all other galaxy populations. our results show that thecharacteristic colour of a galaxy population reveals a unique signature in itsspatial distribution. such signatures will hopefully further elucidate thephysics responsible for shaping the cosmological evolution of galaxies.

0810.1885	statistical analysis of galaxy surveys - i. robust error estimation for  2-point clustering statistics	we present a test of different error estimators for 2-point clusteringstatistics, appropriate for present and future large galaxy redshift surveys.using an ensemble of very large dark matter lambdacdm n-body simulations, wecompare internal error estimators (jackknife and bootstrap) to external ones(monte-carlo realizations). for 3-dimensional clustering statistics, we findthat none of the internal error methods investigated are able to reproduceneither accurately nor robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to 25mpc/h scales. the standard bootstrap overestimates the variance of xi(s) by~40% on all scales probed, but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principaleigenvectors of the underlying covariance matrix. the jackknife returns thecorrect variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smallerscales. this scale dependence in the jackknife affects the recoveredeigenvectors, which tend to disagree on small scales with the externalestimates. our results have important implications for the use of galaxyclustering in placing constraints on cosmological parameters. for example, in a2-parameter fit to the projected correlation function, we find that thestandard bootstrap systematically overestimates the 95% confidence interval,while the jackknife method remains biased, but to a lesser extent. the scatterwe find between realizations, for gaussian statistics, implies that a 2-sigmaconfidence interval, as inferred from an internal estimator, could correspondin practice to anything from 1-sigma to 3-sigma. finally, by an oversampling ofsub-volumes, it is possible to obtain bootstrap variances and confidenceintervals that agree with external error estimates, but it is not clear if thisprescription will work for a general case.
