1001.0026	detection of solar-like oscillations from kepler photometry of the open  cluster ngc 6819	asteroseismology of stars in clusters has been a long-sought goal because theassumption of a common age, distance and initial chemical composition allowsstrong tests of the theory of stellar evolution. we report results from thefirst 34 days of science data from the kepler mission for the open cluster ngc6819 -- one of four clusters in the field of view. we obtain the first cleardetections of solar-like oscillations in the cluster red giants and are able tomeasure the large frequency separation and the frequency of maximum oscillationpower. we find that the asteroseismic parameters allow us to testcluster-membership of the stars, and even with the limited seismic data inhand, we can already identify four possible non-members despite their having abetter than 80% membership probability from radial velocity measurements. weare also able to determine the oscillation amplitudes for stars that span abouttwo orders of magnitude in luminosity and find good agreement with theprediction that oscillation amplitudes scale as the luminosity to the power of0.7. these early results demonstrate the unique potential of asteroseismologyof the stellar clusters observed by kepler.

1001.0216	instrument performance in kepler's first months	the kepler mission relies on precise differential photometry to detect the 80parts per million (ppm) signal from an earth-sun equivalent transit. suchprecision requires superb instrument stability on time scales up to ~2 days andsystematic error removal to better than 20 ppm. to this end, the spacecraft andphotometer underwent 67 days of commissioning, which included several data setstaken to characterize the photometer performance. because kepler has noshutter, we took a series of dark images prior to the dust cover ejection, fromwhich we measured the bias levels, dark current, and read noise. these basicdetector properties are essentially unchanged from ground-based tests,indicating that the photometer is working as expected. several image artifactshave proven more complex than when observed during ground testing, as a resultof their interactions with starlight and the greater thermal stability inflight, which causes the temperature-dependent artifact variations to be on thetimescales of transits. because of kepler's unprecedented sensitivity andstability, we have also seen several unexpected systematics that affectphotometric precision. we are using the first 43 days of science data tocharacterize these effects and to develop detection and mitigation methods thatwill be implemented in the calibration pipeline. based on early testing, weexpect to attain kepler's planned photometric precision over 80%-90% of thefield of view.

1001.0256	initial characteristics of kepler long cadence data for detecting  transiting planets	the kepler mission seeks to detect earth-size planets transiting solar-likestars in its ~115 deg^2 field of view over the course of its 3.5 year primarymission by monitoring the brightness of each of ~156,000 long cadence stellartargets with a time resolution of 29.4 minutes. we discuss the photometricprecision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for dataobtained in the 33.5-day long quarter 1 (q1) observations that ended 2009 june15. the lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at varioustimescales is consistent with expected random noise sources, indicating thatkepler has the capability to fulfill its mission. the kepler light curvesexhibit high precision over a large dynamic range, which will surely permittheir use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding andcharacterizing planets. we discuss the temporal characteristics of both the rawflux time series and the systematic error-corrected flux time series producedby the kepler science pipeline, and give examples illustrating kepler's largedynamic range and the variety of light curves obtained from the q1observations.

1001.0258	overview of the kepler science processing pipeline	the kepler mission science operations center (soc) performs several criticalfunctions including managing the ~156,000 target stars, associated targettables, science data compression tables and parameters, as well as processingthe raw photometric data downlinked from the spacecraft each month. the rawdata are first calibrated at the pixel level to correct for bias, smear inducedby a shutterless readout, and other detector and electronic effects. abackground sky flux is estimated from ~4500 pixels on each of the 84 ccdreadout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimalaperture for each star. ancillary engineering data and diagnostic informationextracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in theflux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching forsignatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter.stars with signatures exceeding 7.1 sigma are subjected to a suite ofstatistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion toreject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. physicalparameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature,and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residuallight curve. the pipeline is operational, finding planetary signatures andproviding robust eliminations of false positives.

1001.0331	the kepler pixel response function	kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of earth-size exoplanetsorbiting solar-like stars. such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm.the high photometric precision demanded by kepler requires detailed knowledgeof how the kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation.this information is provided by the kepler pixel response function (prf),defined as the composite of kepler's optical point spread function, integratedspacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematiceffects. to provide sub-pixel resolution, the prf is represented as apiecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. this continuousrepresentation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel giventhe star's pixel position. the advantages and difficulties of this polynomialrepresentation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variationin the prf and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomialpatches. on-orbit super-resolution measurements of the prf across the keplerfield of view are described. two uses of the prf are presented: the selectionof pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal to noise ratiofor that star, and prf-fitted centroids which provide robust and accuratestellar positions on the ccd, primarily used for attitude and plate scaletracking. good knowledge of the prf has been a critical component for thesuccessful collection of high-precision photometry by kepler.

1001.0414	photometric variability in kepler target stars: the sun among stars -- a  first look	the kepler mission provides an exciting opportunity to study the lightcurvesof stars with unprecedented precision and continuity of coverage. this is thefirst look at a large sample of stars with photometric data of a quality thathas heretofore been only available for our sun. it provides the firstopportunity to compare the irradiance variations of our sun to a large cohortof stars ranging from vary similar to rather different stellar properties, at awide variety of ages. although kepler data is in an early phase of maturity,and we only analyze the first month of coverage, it is sufficient to garner thefirst meaningful measurements of our sun's variability in the context of alarge cohort of main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood. we find thatnearly half of the full sample is more active than the active sun, althoughmost of them are not more than twice as active. the active fraction is closerto a third for the stars most similar to the sun, and rises to well more thanhalf for stars cooler than mid k spectral types.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1008.0853	white-light flares on cool stars in the kepler quarter 1 data	we present the results of a search for white light flares on the ~23,000 cooldwarfs in the kepler quarter 1 long cadence data. we have identified 373flaring stars, some of which flare multiple times during the observationperiod. we calculate relative flare energies, flare rates and durations, andcompare these with the quiescent photometric variability of our sample. we findthat m dwarfs tend to flare more frequently but for shorter durations than kdwarfs, and that they emit more energy relative to their quiescent luminosityin a given flare than k dwarfs. stars that are more photometrically variable inquiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variabilityis only weakly correlated with flare frequency. we estimate distances for oursample of flare stars and find that the flaring fraction agrees well with otherobservations of flare statistics for stars within 300 pc above the galacticplane. these observations provide a more rounded view of stellar flares bysampling stars that have not been pre-selected by their activity, and areinformative for understanding the influence of these flares on planetaryhabitability.

1008.1092	photometric variability in kepler target stars. ii. an overview of  amplitude, periodicity, and rotation in first quarter data	we provide an overview of stellar variability in the first quarter of datafrom the kepler mission. the intent of this paper is to examine the entiresample of over 150,000 target stars for periodic behavior in their lightcurves,and relate this to stellar characteristics. these data constitute anunprecedented study of stellar variability given its great precision andcomplete time coverage (with a half hour cadence). because the full keplerpipeline is not currently suitable for a study of stellar variability of thissort, we describe our procedures for treating the "raw" pipeline data. abouthalf of the total sample exhibits convincing periodic variability up to twoweeks, with amplitudes ranging from differential intensity changes less than10^{-4} up to more than 10 percent. k and m dwarfs have a greater fraction ofperiod behavior than g dwarfs. the giants in the sample have distinctivequasi-periodic behavior, but are not periodic in the way we define it. not allperiodicities are due to rotation, and the most significant period is notnecessarily the rotation period. we discuss properties of the lightcurves, andin particular look at a sample of very clearly periodic g dwarfs. it is clearthat a large number of them do vary because of rotation and starspots, but itwill take further analysis to fully exploit this.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1102.0543	architecture and dynamics of kepler's candidate multiple transiting  planet systems	about one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in thefirst four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems. thereare 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8with four, and one each with five and six. we characterize the dynamicalproperties of these candidate multi-planet systems. the distribution ofobserved period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs areneither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. nonetheless, there aresmall but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both inresonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularlynear the 2:1 resonance. we find that virtually all candidate systems arestable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radiusrelationship. several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority ofthese multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. using the observedmultiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systemsthat matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number ofsingly-transiting systems. we provide constraints on the true multiplicity andmutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing apopulation of systems with multiple super-earth-size and neptune-size planetswith low to moderate mutual inclinations.

1102.0544	transit timing observations from kepler: i. statistical analysis of the  first four months	the architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraintson models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation oforbital eccentricities and inclinations. nasa's kepler mission has identified1235 transiting planet candidates (borcuki et al 2011). the method of transittiming variations (ttvs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetarysystems (holman et al. 2010; lissauer et al. 2011a). we perform a transittiming analysis of the kepler planet candidates. we find that at least ~12% ofplanet candidates currently suitable for ttv analysis show evidence suggestiveof ttvs, representing at least ~65 ttv candidates. in all cases, the time spanof observations must increase for ttvs to provide strong constraints on planetmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multipletransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). wefind that the fraction of planet candidates showing ttvs in this data set doesnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates perstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with asingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. weanticipate that kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems withmultiple transiting planet candidates via ttvs. thus, ttvs will provide apowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbitaldynamics of low-mass planets. if kepler observations were extended to at leastsix years, then ttvs would provide much more precise constraints on thedynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitiveto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-typestars.

1102.0547	the distribution of transit durations for kepler planet candidates and  implications for their orbital eccentricities	doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits witha wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planetformation. the discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by nasa's keplermission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution ofsmall exoplanets. measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is onlypractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to studythe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transitdurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). weanalyze the transit duration distribution of kepler planet candidates. we findthat for host stars with t_eff &gt; 5100 k we cannot invert this to infer theeccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possiblesystematics in the host star densities. with this limitation in mind, wecompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule outextreme distributions. if we assume a rayleigh eccentricity distribution forkepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of0.1-0.25 for host stars with t_eff &lt; 5100 k. we compare the transit durationdistribution for different subsets of kepler planet candidates and discusstentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. high-precisionspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will berequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results ofsystematic errors in stellar radii. finally, we identify planet candidates thatmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1105.5143	the high albedo of the hot jupiter kepler-7b	hot jupiters are expected to be dark from both observations (albedo upperlimits) and theory (alkali metals and/or tio and vo absorption). however, onlya handful of hot jupiters have been observed with high enough photometricprecision at visible wavelengths to investigate these expectations. the nasakepler mission provides a means to widen the sample and to assess the extent towhich hot jupiter albedos are low. we present a global analysis of kepler-7bbased on q0-q4 data, published radial velocities, and asteroseismologyconstraints. we measure an occultation depth in the kepler bandpass of 44+-5ppm. if directly related to the albedo, this translates to a kepler geometricalbedo of 0.32+-0.03, the most precise value measured so far for an exoplanet.we also characterize the planetary orbital phase lightcurve with an amplitudeof 42+-4 ppm. using atmospheric models, we find it unlikely that the highalbedo is due to a dominant thermal component and propose two solutions toexplain the observed planetary flux. firstly, we interpret the kepler-7b albedoas resulting from an excess reflection over what can be explained solely byrayleigh scattering, along with a nominal thermal component. this excessreflection might indicate the presence of a cloud or haze layer in theatmosphere, motivating new modeling and observational efforts. alternatively,the albedo can be explained by rayleigh scattering alone if na and k aredepleted in the atmosphere by a factor of 10-100 below solar abundances.

1107.2596	the first kepler mission planet confirmed with the hobby-eberly  telescope: kepler-15b, a hot jupiter enriched in heavy elements	we report the discovery of kepler-15b, a new transiting exoplanet detected bynasa's kepler mission. the transit signal with a period of 4.94 days wasdetected in the quarter 1 (q1) kepler photometry. for the first time, we haveused the high-resolution-spectrograph (hrs) at the hobby-eberly telescope (het)to determine the mass of a kepler planet via precise radial velocity (rv)measurements. the 24 het/hrs radial velocities (rv) and 6 additionalmeasurements from the fies spectrograph at the nordic optical telescope (not)reveal a doppler signal with the same period and phase as the transitephemeris. we used one het/hrs spectrum of kepler-15 taken without the iodinecell to determine accurate stellar parameters. the host star is a metal-rich([fe/h]=0.36+/-0.07) g-type main sequence star with t_eff=5515+/-124 k. theamplitude of the rv-orbit yields a mass of the planet of 0.66+/-0.1 m_jup. theplanet has a radius of 0.96+/-0.06 r_jup and a mean bulk density of 0.9+/-0.2g/cm^3. the planetary radius resides on the lower envelope for transitingplanets with similar mass and irradiation level. this suggests significantenrichment of the planet with heavy elements. we estimate a heavy element massof 30-40 m_earth within kepler-15b.

1107.5207	kepler mission stellar and instrument noise properties	kepler mission results are rapidly contributing to fundamentally newdiscoveries in both the exoplanet and asteroseismology fields. the datareturned from kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed,precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extentof high duty cycle observations. as the first mission to provide extensive timeseries measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a levelhitherto possible only for the sun, the results from kepler will vastlyincrease our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. herewe report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of mostinterest for detection of exoplanets via transits. by design the data frommoderately bright kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levelsof noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamentallimitations such as poisson statistics and any instrument noise. the noiselevels attained by kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50% the target levels forsolar-type, quiet stars. we provide a decomposition of observed noise for anensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (poisson andreadout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to thestars. the largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise followsfrom intrinsic stellar noise. we show that using stellar parameters fromgalactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation,activity and hence noise levels reproduces the primary intrinsic stellar noisefeatures.

1107.5750	the hot-jupiter kepler-17b: discovery, obliquity from stroboscopic  starspots, and atmospheric characterization	this paper reports the discovery and characterization of the transiting hotgiant exoplanet kepler-17b. the planet has an orbital period of 1.486 days, andradial velocity measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het) show adoppler signal of 420+/-15 m.s-1. from a transit-based estimate of the hoststar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effectivetemperature t_eff=5630+/-100 k from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellarhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 m_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 r_jup.we estimate the planet mass and radius to be mp=2.450+/-0.114 m_jup andrp=1.312+/-0.018 r_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. the host star isactive, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. thecontinuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89days, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio producesstroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. the temporal pattern of thesespot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star'sobliquity is smaller than 15 deg. we detected planetary occultations ofkepler-17b with both the kepler and spitzer space telescopes. we use theseobservations to constrain the eccentricity, e, and find that it is consistentwith a circular orbit (e&lt;0.0011). the brightness temperatures of the planet theinfrared bandpasses are t_3.6um=1880+/-100 k and t4.5um=1770+/-150 k. wemeasure the optical geometric albedo a_g in the kepler bandpass and find a_g =0.10+/-0.02. the observations are best described by atmospheric models forwhich most of the incident energy is re-radiated away from the day side.

1109.1561	the kepler-19 system: a transiting 2.2 r_earth planet and a second  planet detected via transit timing variations	we present the discovery of the kepler-19 planetary system, which we firstidentified from a 9.3-day periodic transit signal in the kepler photometry.from high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effectivetemperature teff=5541 \pm 60 k, a metallicity [fe/h]=-0.13 \pm 0.06, and asurface gravity log(g)=4.59 \pm 0.10. we combine the estimate of teff and[fe/h] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometriclight curve to deduce a stellar mass of m_star = 0.936 \pm 0.040 m_sun and astellar radius of r_star = 0.850 \pm 0.018 r_sun. we rule out the possibilitythat the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by firstidentifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape ofthe light curve. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more than threeorders of magnitude more likely than a blend. the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure atransit depth with spitzer at 4.5 {\mu}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent withthe depth measured in the kepler optical bandpass of 567\pm6 ppm. we determinea physical radius of the planet kepler-19b of r_p = 2.209 \pm 0.048 r_earth.from radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on theplanet mass of 20.3 m_earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 gcm^-3. we report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from apredicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additionalperturbing body in the system. we cannot uniquely determine the orbitalparameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match theamplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the hoststar's radial velocity limits. however, the perturber in these mechanisms hasperiod &lt;160 days and mass &lt;6 m_jup, confirming its planetary nature askepler-19c.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1112.1640	kepler-22b: a 2.4 earth-radius planet in the habitable zone of a  sun-like star	a search of the time-series photometry from nasa's kepler spacecraft revealsa transiting planet candidate orbiting the 11th magnitude g5 dwarf kic 10593626with a period of 290 days. the characteristics of the host star are wellconstrained by high-resolution spectroscopy combined with an asteroseismicanalysis of the kepler photometry, leading to an estimated mass and radius of0.970 +/- 0.060 msun and 0.979 +/- 0.020 rsun. the depth of 492 +/- 10ppm forthe three observed transits yields a radius of 2.38 +/- 0.13 rearth for theplanet. the system passes a battery of tests for false positives, includingreconnaissance spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and centroid motion. afull blender analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretationby showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarelymimic the observed shape of the transits. the final validation of the planet isprovided by 16 radial velocities obtained with hires on keck 1 over a one yearspan. although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and massdetermination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{\sigma} upper limitof 124 mearth, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning thedesignation kepler-22b. the radiative equilibrium temperature is 262k for aplanet in kepler-22b's orbit. although there is no evidence that kepler-22b isa rocky planet, it is the first confirmed planet with a measured radius toorbit in the habitable zone of any star other than the sun.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.1892	transit timing observations from kepler: vi. transit timing variation  candidates in the first seventeen months from polynomial models	transit timing variations provide a powerful tool for confirming andcharacterizing transiting planets, as well as detecting non-transiting planets.we report the results an updated ttv analysis for 1481 planet candidates(borucki et al. 2011; batalha et al. 2012) based on transit times measuredduring the first sixteen months of kepler observations. we present 39 strongttv candidates based on long-term trends (2.8% of suitable data sets). wepresent another 136 weaker ttv candidates (9.8% of suitable data sets) based onexcess scatter of ttv measurements about a linear ephemeris. we anticipate thatseveral of these planet candidates could be confirmed and perhaps characterizedwith more detailed ttv analyses using publicly available kepler observations.for many others, kepler has observed a long-term ttv trend, but an extendedkepler mission will be required to characterize the system via ttvs. we findthat the occurrence rate of planet candidates that show ttvs is significantlyincreased (~68%) for planet candidates transiting stars with multipletransiting planet candidate when compared to planet candidates transiting starswith a single transiting planet candidate.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5415	transit timing observations from kepler: iv. confirmation of 4 multiple  planet systems by simple physical models	eighty planetary systems of two or more planets are known to orbit starsother than the sun. for most, the data can be sufficiently explained bynon-interacting keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of thesesystems have not been observed. here we present 4 sets of lightcurves from thekepler spacecraft, which each show multiple planets transiting the same star.departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates theplanets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match theforcing frequency of the other planet. this confirms that these objects are inthe same system. next we limit their masses to the planetary regime byrequiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. finally, wereport dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for theplanets' masses and eccentricities. as the timespan of timing data increases,dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,even in cases for which high-precision doppler follow-up is impractical.

1401.4195	masses, radii, and orbits of small kepler planets: the transition from  gaseous to rocky planets	we report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 keplerstars. there are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detectedthrough transits and 7 revealed by precise doppler measurements of the hoststars. based on an analysis of the kepler brightness measurements, along withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities for allof the transiting planets (41 of 42 have a false-positive probability under1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. most of the transiting planetsare smaller than 3x the size of earth. for 16 planets, the doppler signal wassecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. for theother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limitsto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rockycomposition. we identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting amostly rocky interior for them. indeed, the only planets that are compatiblewith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 r_earth. larger planetsevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (h, he, and h2o).

1402.6352	validation of kepler's multiple planet candidates. ii: refined  statistical framework and descriptions of systems of special interest	we extend the statistical analysis of lissauer et al. (2012, apj 750, 112),which demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of kepler candidate multipletransiting systems (multis) represent true transiting planets, and developtherefrom a procedure to validate large numbers of planet candidates in multisas bona fide exoplanets. we show that this statistical framework correctlyestimates the abundance of false positives already identified around keplertargets with multiple sets of transit-like signatures based on their abundancearound targets with single sets of transit-like signatures. we estimate thenumber of multis that represent split systems of one or more planets orbitingeach component of a binary star system. we use the high reliability rate formultis to validate more than one dozen particularly interesting multi-planetsystems are validated in a companion paper by rowe et al. (2014, apj, thisissue). we note that few very short period (p &lt; 1.6 days) planets orbit withinmultiple transiting planet systems and discuss possible reasons for theirabsence. there also appears to be a shortage of planets with periods exceedinga few months in multis.

1402.6534	validation of kepler's multiple planet candidates. iii: light curve  analysis &amp; announcement of hundreds of new multi-planet systems	the kepler mission has discovered over 2500 exoplanet candidates in the firsttwo years of spacecraft data, with approximately 40% of them in candidatemulti-planet systems. the high rate of multiplicity combined with the low rateof identified false-positives indicates that the multiplanet systems containvery few false-positive signals due to other systems not gravitationally boundto the target star (lissauer, j. j., et al., 2012, apj 750, 131). falsepositives in the multi- planet systems are identified and removed, leavingbehind a residual population of candidate multi-planet transiting systemsexpected to have a false-positive rate less than 1%. we present a sample of 340planetary systems that contain 851 planets that are validated to substantiallybetter than the 99% confidence level; the vast majority of these have not beenpreviously verified as planets. we expect ~2 unidentified false-positivesmaking our sample of planet very reliable. we present fundamental planetaryproperties of our sample based on a comprehensive analysis of kepler lightcurves and ground-based spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging. since we donot require spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging for validation, some of ourderived parameters for a planetary system may be systematically incorrect dueto dilution from light due to additional stars in the photometric aperture.none the less, our result nearly doubles the number of verified exoplanets.

1409.1605	kic 9632895 - the 10th kepler transiting circumbinary planet	we present the discovery of kic 9632895b, a 6.2 earth-radius planet in alow-eccentricity, 240.5-day orbit about an eclipsing binary. the binary itselfconsists of a 0.93 and 0.194 solar mass pair of stars with an orbital period of27.3 days. the plane of the planet's orbit is rapidly precessing, and itsinclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in thelatter portion of the kepler data. thus three transits are present in thelatter half of the light curve, but none of the three conjunctions thatoccurred during the first half of the light curve produced transits. theprecession period is ~103 years, and during that cycle, transits are visibleonly ~8% of the time. this has the important implication that for every systemlike kic 9632895 that we detect, there are ~12 circumbinary systems that existbut are not currently exhibiting transits. the planet's mass is too small tonoticeably perturb the binary, consequently its mass is not measurable withthese data; but our photodynamical model places a 1-sigma upper limit of 16earth masses. with a period 8.8 times that of the binary, the planet is welloutside the dynamical instability zone. it does, however, lie within thehabitable zone of the binary, and making it the third of ten keplercircumbinary planets to do so.

1501.01101	validation of twelve small kepler transiting planets in the habitable  zone	we present an investigation of twelve candidate transiting planets fromkepler with orbital periods ranging from 34 to 207 days, selected from initialindications that they are small and potentially in the habitable zone (hz) oftheir parent stars. few of these objects are known. the expected dopplersignals are too small to confirm them by demonstrating that their masses are inthe planetary regime. here we verify their planetary nature by validating themstatistically using the blender technique, which simulates large numbers offalse positives and compares the resulting light curves with the keplerphotometry. this analysis was supplemented with new follow-up observations(high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, adaptive opticsimaging, and speckle interferometry), as well as an analysis of the fluxcentroids. for eleven of them (koi-0571.05, 1422.04, 1422.05, 2529.02, 3255.01,3284.01, 4005.01, 4087.01, 4622.01, 4742.01, and 4745.01) we show that thelikelihood they are true planets is far greater than that of a false positive,to a confidence level of 99.73% (3 sigma) or higher. for koi-4427.01 theconfidence level is about 99.2% (2.6 sigma). with our accurate characterizationof the gkm host stars, the derived planetary radii range from 1.1 to 2.7r_earth. all twelve objects are confirmed to be in the hz, and nine are smallenough to be rocky. excluding three of them that have been previously validatedby others, our study doubles the number of known rocky planets in the hz.koi-3284.01 (kepler-438b) and koi-4742.01 (kepler-442b) are the planets mostsimilar to the earth discovered to date when considering their size andincident flux jointly.

1501.07286	planetary candidates observed by kepler v: planet sample from q1-q12 (36  months)	the kepler mission discovered 2842 exoplanet candidates with 2 years of data.we provide updates to the kepler planet candidate sample based upon 3 years(q1-q12) of data. through a series of tests to exclude false-positives,primarily caused by eclipsing binary stars and instrumental systematics, 855additional planetary candidates have been discovered, bringing the total numberknown to 3697. we provide revised transit parameters and accompanying posteriordistributions based on a markov chain monte carlo algorithm for the cumulativecatalogue of kepler objects of interest. there are now 130 candidates in thecumulative catalogue that receive less than twice the flux the earth receivesand more than 1100 have a radius less than 1.5 rearth. there are now a dozencandidates meeting both criteria, roughly doubling the number of candidateearth analogs. a majority of planetary candidates have a high probability ofbeing bonafide planets, however, there are populations of likelyfalse-positives. we discuss and suggest additional cuts that can be easilyapplied to the catalogue to produce a set of planetary candidates with goodfidelity. the full catalogue is publicly available at the nasa exoplanetarchive.

1503.03173	low false-positive rate of kepler candidates estimated from a  combination of spitzer and follow-up observations	(abridged) nasa's kepler mission has provided several thousand transitingplanet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fractionof bona fide planets. estimating the rate of false positives of the overallkepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. we present theresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with thespitzer telescope during the the kepler mission. these observations arededicated to estimating the false positive rate (fpr) amongst the keplercandidates. we select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges instellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transitswith spitzer at 4.5 microns. we use these observations to measures thecandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. a bandpass-dependent depthalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the sourceof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. for most of the candidates(85%), the transit depths measured with kepler are consistent with the depthsmeasured with spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that themost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars thatdilute the photometry. the spitzer constraints on their own yield fprs between5-40%, depending on the kois. by considering the population of the kepler fieldstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, wefind that the overall fpr of our sample is low. the measured upper limit on thefpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. this observationalresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that isnot investigated by the kepler observations, provides an independent indicationthat kepler's false positive rate is low.

1506.04175	terrestrial planet occurrence rates for the kepler gk dwarf sample	we measure planet occurrence rates using the planet candidates discovered bythe q1-q16 kepler pipeline search. this study examines planet occurrence ratesfor the kepler gk dwarf target sample for planet radii, 0.75&lt;rp&lt;2.5 rearth, andorbital periods, 50&lt;porb&lt;300 days, with an emphasis on a thorough explorationand identification of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties.integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of f=0.77planets per star, with an allowed range of 0.3&lt;f&lt;1.9. the allowed range takesinto account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of fbeyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis.we generally find higher planet occurrence rates and a steeper increase inplanet occurrence rates towards small planets than previous studies of thekepler gk dwarf sample. through extrapolation, we find that the one yearorbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate, zeta_1=0.1, with an allowedrange of 0.01&lt;zeta_1&lt;2, where zeta_1 is defined as the number of planets perstar within 20% of the rp and porb of earth. for g dwarf hosts, the zeta_1parameter space is a subset of the larger eta_earth parameter space, thuszeta_1 places a lower limit on eta_earth for g dwarf hosts. from our analysis,we identify the leading sources of systematics impacting kepler occurrence ratedeterminations as: reliability of the planet candidate sample, planet radii,pipeline completeness, and stellar parameters.

1507.06723	discovery and validation of kepler-452b: a 1.6-re super earth exoplanet  in the habitable zone of a g2 star	we report on the discovery and validation of kepler-452b, a transiting planetidentified by a search through the 4 years of data collected by nasa's keplermission. this possibly rocky 1.63$^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ r$_\oplus$ planet orbitsits g2 host star every 384.843$^{+0.007}_{0.012}$ days, the longest orbitalperiod for a small (r$_p$ &lt; 2 r$_\oplus$) transiting exoplanet to date. thelikelihood that this planet has a rocky composition lies between 49% and 62%.the star has an effective temperature of 5757$\pm$85 k and a log g of4.32$\pm$0.09. at a mean orbital separation of 1.046$^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ au,this small planet is well within the optimistic habitable zone of its star(recent venus/early mars), experiencing only 10% more flux than earth receivesfrom the sun today, and slightly outside the conservative habitable zone(runaway greenhouse/maximum greenhouse). the star is slightly larger and olderthan the sun, with a present radius of 1.11$^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$ r$_\odot$ and anestimated age of 6 gyr. thus, kepler-452b has likely always been in thehabitable zone and should remain there for another 3 gyr.
