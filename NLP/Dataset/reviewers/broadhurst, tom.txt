0902.3971	new multiply-lensed galaxies identified in acs/nic3 observations of  cl0024+1654 using an improved mass model	we present an improved strong-lensing analysis of cl0024+1654 ($z$=0.39)using deep hst/acs/nic3 images, based on 33 multiply-lensed images of 11background galaxies. these are found with a model that assumes massapproximately traces light, with a low order expansion to allow for flexibilityon large scales. the model is constrained initially by the well known 5-imagesystem ($z$=1.675) and refined as new multiply-lensed systems are identifiedusing the model. photometric redshifts of these new systems are then used toconstrain better the mass profile by adopting the standard cosmologicalrelation between redshift and lensing distance. our model requires only 6 freeparameters to describe well all positional and redshift data. the resultinginner mass profile has a slope of $d\log m/d\log r\simeq -0.55$, consistentwith new weak-lensing measurements where the data overlap, at $r\simeq200$kpc/$h_{70}$. the combined profile is well fitted by a high concentration nfwmass profile, $c_{\rm vir}\sim 8.6\pm1.6$, similar to other well studiedclusters, but larger than predicted with standard $\lambda$cdm. a well definedradial critical curve is generated by the model and is clearly observed at $r\simeq 12\arcsec$, outlined by elongated images pointing towards the centre ofmass. the relative fluxes of the multiply-lensed images are found to agree wellwith the modelled magnifications, providing an independent consistency check.

0906.4791	detailed cluster mass and light profiles of a1703, a370 and rxj1347-11  from deep subaru imaging	weak lensing work can be badly compromised by unlensed foreground and clustermembers which dilute the true lensing signal. we show how the lensing amplitudein multi-colour space can be harnessed to securely separate cluster membersfrom the foreground and background populations for three massive clusters,a1703 (z=0.258), a370 (z=0.375) and rxj1347-11 (z=0.451) imaged with subaru.the luminosity functions of these clusters when corrected for dilution, showsimilar faint-end slopes, \alpha ~= -1.0, with no marked faint-end upturn toour limit of m_r ~= -15.0, and only a mild radial gradient. in each case, theradial profile of the m/l ratio peaks at intermediate radius, ~=0.2r_{vir}, ata level of 300-500(m/l_r)_\odot, and then falls steadily towards~100(m/l_r)_{\odot} at the virial radius, similar to the mean field level. thisbehaviour is likely due to the relative paucity of central late-type galaxies,whereas for the e/s0-sequence only a mild radial decline in m/l is found foreach cluster. we discuss this behaviour in the context of detailed simulationswhere predictions for tidal stripping may now be tested accurately withobservations.

0906.5079	discovery of the largest known lensed images formed by a critically  convergent lensing cluster	we identify the largest known lensed images of a single spiral galaxy, lyingclose to the centre of the distant cluster macs j1149.5+2223 ($z=0.544$). theseimages cover a total area of $\simeq 150 \box\arcsec$ and are magnified $\simeq200$ times. unusually, there is very little image distortion implying thecentral mass distribution is almost uniform over a wide area ($r\simeq200 kpc$)with a surface density equal to the critical density for lensing, correspondingto maximal lens magnification. many fainter multiply-lensed galaxies are alsouncovered by our model, outlining a very large tangential critical curve, ofradius $r\simeq 170 kpc$, posing a potential challenge for the standardlcdm-cosmology. because of the uniform central mass distribution a particularlyclean measurement of the mass of the brightest cluster galaxy is possible here,for which we infer stars contribute most of the mass within a limiting radiusof $\simeq 30 kpc$, with a mass-to-light ratio of $m/l_{b}\simeq4.5(m/l)_{\odot}$. this cluster with its uniform and central mass distributionacts analogously to a regular magnifying glass, converging light withoutdistorting the images, resulting in the most powerful lens yet discovered foraccessing the faint high-$z$ universe.

0907.4232	the largest gravitational lens: macs j0717.5+3745 (z=0.546)	we identify 13 sets of multiply-lensed galaxies around macs j0717.5+3745($z=0.546$), outlining a very large tangential critical curve of major axis$\sim2.8\arcmin$, filling the field of hst/acs. the equivalent circulareinstein radius is $\theta_{e}= 55 \pm 3\arcsec$ (at an estimated sourceredshift of $z_{s}\sim2.5$), corresponding to $r_e\simeq 350\pm 20 kpc$ at thecluster redshift, nearly three times greater than that of a1689 ($r_e\simeq 140kpc$ for $z_{s}=2.5$). the mass enclosed by this critical curve is very large,$7.4\pm 0.5 \times 10^{14}m_{\odot}$ and only weakly model dependent, with arelatively shallow mass profile within $r&lt;250 kpc$, reflecting the unrelaxedappearance of this cluster. this shallow profile generates a much higher levelof magnification than the well known relaxed lensing clusters of higherconcentration, so that the area of sky exceeding a magnification of$&gt;10\times$, is $\simeq 3.5\sq\arcmin$ for sources with $z\simeq 8$, makingmacs j0717.5+3745 a compelling target for accessing faint objects at highredshift. we calculate that only one such cluster, with $\theta_{e}\ge55\arcsec$, is predicted within $\sim 10^7$ universes with $z\ge 0.55$,corresponding to a virial mass $\ge 3\times 10^{15} m_{\odot}$, for thestandard $\lambda cdm$ (wmap5 parameters with $2\sigma$ uncertainties).

0908.0069	the mass structure of the galaxy cluster cl0024+1654 from a full lensing  analysis of joint subaru and acs/nic3 observations	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the rich galaxy clustercl0024+1654 (z=0.395) based on deep subaru br_{c}z' imaging and our recentcomprehensive strong lensing analysis of hst/acs/nic3 observations. we obtainthe weak lensing distortion and magnification of undilted samples of red andblue background galaxies by carefully combining all color and positionalinformation. unlike previous work, the weak and strong lensing are in excellentagreement where the data overlap. the joint mass profile continuously steepensout to the virial radius with only a minor contribution \sim 10% in the massfrom known subcluster at a projected distance of \sim 700kpc/h. the projectedmass distribution for the entire cluster is well fitted with a singlenavarro-frenk-white model with a virial mass, m_{vir} = (1.2 \pm 0.2) \times10^{15} m_{sun}/h, and a concentration, c_{vir} = 9.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}. this modelfit is fully consistent with the depletion of the red background counts,providing independent confirmation. careful examination and interpretation ofx-ray and dynamical data strongly suggest that this cluster system is in a postcollision state, which we show is consistent with our well-defined mass profilefor a major merger occurring along the line of sight, viewed approximately2-3gyr after impact when the gravitational potential has had time to relax inthe center, before the gas has recovered and before the outskirts are fullyvirialized. finally, our full lensing analysis provides a model-independentconstraint of m_{2d}(&lt;r_{vir}) = (1.4 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h for theprojected mass of the whole system, including any currently unbound materialbeyond the virial radius, which can constrain the sum of the two pre-mergercluster masses when designing simulations to explore this system.

1002.0521	strong-lensing analysis of a complete sample of 12 macs clusters at  z&gt;0.5: mass models and einstein radii	we present the results of a strong-lensing analysis of a complete sample of12 very luminous x-ray clusters at $z&gt;0.5$ using hst/acs images. our modellingtechnique has uncovered some of the largest known critical curves outlined bymany accurately-predicted sets of multiple images. the distribution of einsteinradii has a median value of $\simeq28\arcsec$ (for a source redshift of$z_{s}\sim2$), twice as large as other lower-$z$ samples, and extends to$55\arcsec$ for macs j0717.5+3745, with an impressive enclosed einstein mass of$7.4\times10^{14} m_{\odot}$. we find that 9 clusters cover a very large area($&gt;2.5 \sq \arcmin$) of high magnification ($\mu &gt; \times10$) for a sourceredshift of $z_{s}\sim8$, providing primary targets for accessing the firststars and galaxies. we compare our results with theoretical predictions of thestandard $\lambda$cdm model which we show systematically fall short of ourmeasured einstein radii by a factor of $\simeq1.4$, after accounting for theeffect of lensing projection. nevertheless, a revised analysis once arcredshifts become available, and similar analyses of larger samples, are neededin order to establish more precisely the level of discrepancy with $\lambda$cdmpredictions.

1002.3368	finding high-redshift dark stars with the james webb space telescope	the first stars in the history of the universe are likely to form in thedense central regions of 10^5-10^6 msolar cold dark matter halos at z=10-50.the annihilation of dark matter particles in these environments may lead to theformation of so-called dark stars, which are predicted to be cooler, larger,more massive and potentially more long-lived than conventional population iiistars. here, we investigate the prospects of detecting high-redshift dark starswith the upcoming james webb space telescope (jwst). we find that dark stars atz&gt;6 are intrinsically too faint to be detected by jwst. however, by exploitingforeground galaxy clusters as gravitational telescopes, certain varieties ofcool (teff &lt; 30000 k) dark stars should be within reach at redshifts up toz=10. if the lifetimes of dark stars are sufficiently long, many such objectsmay also congregate inside the first galaxies. we demonstrate that this couldgive rise to peculiar features in the integrated spectra of galaxies at highredshifts, provided that dark stars make up at least 1 percent of the totalstellar mass in such objects.

1004.0331	a wide area survey for high-redshift massive galaxies. ii. near-infrared  spectroscopy of bzk-selected massive star-forming galaxies	results are presented from nir spectroscopy of a sample of bzk-selected,massive star-forming galaxies (sbzks) at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.3 that were obtained withohs/cisco at subaru and with sinfoni at vlt. among the 28 sbzks observed, haemission was detected in 14 objects, and for 11 of them the [nii]6583 was alsomeasured. multiwavelength photometry was also used to derive stellar masses andextinction parameters, whereas ha and [nii] have allowed us to estimate sfr,metallicities, ionization mechanisms, and dynamical masses. in order to enforceagreement between sfrs from ha with those derived from rest-frame uv and mir,additional obscuration for the emission lines (that originate in hii regions)was required compared to the extinction derived from the slope of the uvcontinuum. we have also derived the stellar mass-metallicity relation, as wellas the relation between stellar mass and specific sfr, and compared them to theresults in other studies. at a given stellar mass, the sbzks appear to havebeen already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star-forminggalaxies of similar mass. the sbzks presented here tend to have highermetallicities compared to those of uv-selected galaxies, indicating that nirselected galaxies tend to be a chemically more evolved population. the sbzksshow specific sfrs that are systematically higher, by up to ~2 orders ofmagnitude, compared to those of local galaxies of the same mass. the empiricalcorrelations between stellar mass and metallicity, and stellar mass andspecific sfr are then compared with those of population synthesis modelsconstructed either with the simple closed-box assumption, or within an infallscenario. within the assumptions that are built-in such models, it appears thata short timescale for the star-formation (~100 myr) and large initial gas massappear to be required if one wants to reproduce both relations simultaneously.

1004.4660	full lensing analysis of abell 1703: comparison of independent  lens-modelling techniques	the inner mass-profile of the relaxed cluster abell 1703 is analysed by twovery different strong-lensing techniques applied to deep acs and wfc3 imaging.our parametric method has the accuracy required to reproduce the many sets ofmultiple images, based on the assumption that mass approximately traces light.we test this assumption with a fully non-parametric, adaptive grid method, withno knowledge of the galaxy distribution. differences between the methods areseen on fine scales due to member galaxies which must be included in modelsdesigned to search for lensed images, but on the larger scale the generaldistribution of dark matter is in good agreement, with very similar radial massprofiles. we add undiluted weak-lensing measurements from deep multi-coloursubaru imaging to obtain a fully model-independent mass profile out to thevirial radius and beyond. consistency is found in the region of overlap betweenthe weak and strong lensing, and the full mass profile is well-described by annfw model of a concentration parameter, $c_{\rm vir}\simeq 7.15\pm0.5$ (and$m_{vir}\simeq 1.22\pm0.15 \times 10^{15}m_{\odot}/h$). abell 1703 lies abovethe standard $c$--$m$ relation predicted for the standard $\lambda$cdm model,similar to other massive relaxed clusters with accurately determinedlensing-based profiles.

1005.0398	the highest resolution mass map of galaxy cluster substructure to date  without assuming light traces mass: lensperfect analysis of abell 1689	we present a strong lensing mass model of abell 1689 which resolvessubstructures ~25 kpc across (including about ten individual galaxy subhalos)within the central ~400 kpc diameter. we achieve this resolution by perfectlyreproducing the observed (strongly lensed) input positions of 168 multipleimages of 55 knots residing within 135 images of 42 galaxies. our model makesno assumptions about light tracing mass, yet we reproduce the brightest visiblestructures with some slight deviations. a1689 remains one of the strongestknown lenses on the sky, with an einstein radius of re = 47.0" +/- 1.2" (143+3/-4 kpc) for a lensed source at zs = 2. we find a single nfw or sersic proleyields a good fit simultaneously (with only slight tension) to both our stronglensing (sl) mass model and published weak lensing (wl) measurements at largerradius (out to the virial radius). according to this nfw fit, a1689 has a massof mvir = 2.0 +0.5/-0.3 x 10^15 msun / h70 (m200 = 1.8 +0.4/-0.3 x 10^15 msun /h70) within the virial radius rvir = 3.0 +/- 0.2 mpc / h70 (r200 = 2.4+0.1/-0.2 mpc / h70), and a central concentration cvir = 11.5 +1.5/-1.4 (c200 =9.2 +/- 1.2). our sl model prefers slightly higher concentrations than previoussl models, bringing our sl+wl constraints in line with other recentderivations. our results support those of previous studies which find a1689 haseither an anomalously large concentration or significant extra mass along theline of sight (perhaps in part due to triaxiality). if clusters are generallyfound to have higher concentrations than realized in simulations, this couldindicate they formed earlier, perhaps as a result of early dark energy.

1008.2758	quantifying the collisionless nature of dark matter and galaxies in  a1689	we use extensive measurements of the cluster a1689 to assess the expectedsimilarity in the dynamics of galaxies and dark matter (dm) in their motion ascollisionless `particles' in the cluster gravitational potential. to do so wederive the radial profile of the specific kinetic energy of the clustergalaxies from the jeans equation and observational data. assuming that thespecific kinetic energies of galaxies and dm are roughly equal, we obtain themean value of the dm velocity anisotropy parameter, and the dm density profile.since this deduced profile has a scale radius that is higher than inferred fromlensing observations, we tested the validity of the assumption by repeating theanalysis using results of simulations for the profile of the dm velocityanisotropy. results of both analyses indicate a significant difference betweenthe kinematics of galaxies and dm within $r \lesssim 0.3r_{\rm vir}$. thisfinding is reflected also in the shape of the galaxy number density profile,which flattens markedly with respect to the steadily rising dm profile at smallradii. thus, $r \sim 0.3r_{\rm vir}$ seems to be a transition region interiorto which collisional effects significantly modify the dynamical properties ofthe galaxy population with respect to those of dm in a1689

1009.3936	strong-lensing analysis of ms 1358.4+6245: new multiple images and  implications for the well-resolved z=4.92 galaxy	we present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster ms 1358.4+6245($z=0.33$), in deep 6-band acs/hst imaging. in addition to the well-studiedsystem at $z=4.92$, our modelling method uncovers 19 new multiply-lensed imagesso that a total of 23 images and their redshifts are used to accuratelyconstrain the inner mass distribution. we derive a relatively shallow innermass profile, $d\log \sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.33 \pm0.05$ ($r&lt;200$ kpc), with amuch higher magnification than estimated previously by models constrained onlyby the $z=4.92$ system. using these many new images we can apply anon-parametric adaptive-grid method, which also yields a shallow mass profilewithout prior assumptions, strengthening our conclusions. the totalmagnification of the $z_s=4.92$ galaxy is high, about a $\sim100\times$ overits four images, so that the inferred source size, luminosity andstar-formation rate are about $\sim5\times$ smaller than previous estimates,corresponding to a dwarf-sized galaxy of radius $\simeq1$ kpc. a detailed imageof the interior morphology of the source is generated with a high effectiveresolution of only $\simeq$50 pc, thanks to the high magnification and to thedeclining angular diameter distance above $z\sim1.5$ for the standardcosmology, so that this image apparently represents the best resolved objectknown at high redshift.

1011.3044	cluster mass profiles from a bayesian analysis of weak lensing  distortion and magnification measurements: applications to subaru data	we directly construct model-independent mass profiles of galaxy clusters fromcombined weak-lensing distortion and magnification measurements within abayesian statistical framework,which allows for a full parameter-spaceextraction of the underlying signal. this method applies to the full range ofradius outside the einstein radius, and recovers the absolute massnormalization. we apply our method to deep subaru imaging of five high-mass(&gt;10^{15}m_{sun}) clusters, a1689, a1703, a370, cl0024+17, and rxj1347-11, toobtain accurate profiles to beyond the virial radius (r_{vir}). for eachcluster the lens distortion and magnification data are shown to be consistentwith each other, and the total signal-to-noise ratio of the combinedmeasurements ranges from 13 to 24 per cluster. we form a model-independent massprofile from stacking the clusters, which is detected at 37{\sigma} out to r ~1.7r_{vir}. the projected logarithmic slope steepens from -1.01 \pm 0.09 at r ~0.1r_{vir} to -1.92 \pm 0.51 at r ~ 0.9r_{vir}. we also derive for each clusterinner strong-lensing based mass profiles from deep hst/acs observations, whichwe show overlap well with the outer subaru-based profiles and together are welldescribed by a generalized form of the navarro-frenk-white profile, except forthe ongoing merger rxj1347-11, with modest variations in the central cusp slope(-dln{\rho}/dlnr &lt; 0.9). the improvement here from adding the magnificationmeasurements is significant, ~30% in terms of cluster mass profilemeasurements, compared with the lensing distortion signal.

1103.0202	triaxiality and non-thermal gas pressure in abell 1689	clusters of galaxies are uniquely important cosmological probes of theevolution of the large scale structure, whose diagnostic power depends quitesignificantly on the ability to reliably determine their masses. clusters aretypically modeled as spherical systems whose intracluster gas is in stricthydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium gas pressure is providedentirely by thermal pressure), with the gravitational field dominated by darkmatter, assumptions that are only rough approximations. in fact, numericalsimulations indicate that galaxy clusters are typically triaxial, rather thanspherical, and that turbulent gas motions (induced during hierarchical mergerevents) provide an appreciable pressure component. extending our previous work,we present results of a joint analysis of x-ray, weak and strong lensingmeasurements of abell 1689. the quality of the data allows us to determine boththe triaxial shape of the cluster and the level of non-thermal pressure that isrequired if the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium. we find thatthe dark matter axis ratios are 1.24 +/- 0.13 and 2.02 +/- 0.01 on the plane ofthe sky and along the line of sight, respectively, and that about 20% of thepressure is non-thermal. our treatment demonstrates that the dynamicalproperties of clusters can be determined in a (mostly) bias-free way, enhancingthe use of clusters as more precise cosmological probes.

1105.0444	a precise cluster mass profile averaged from the highest-quality lensing  data	we outline our methods for obtaining high precision mass profiles, combiningindependent weak-lensing distortion, magnification, and strong-lensingmeasurements. for massive clusters the strong and weak lensing regimescontribute equal logarithmic coverage of the radial profile. the utility ofhigh-quality data is limited by the cosmic noise from large scale structurealong the line of sight. this noise is overcome when stacking clusters, as tooare the effects of cluster asphericity and substructure, permitting a stringenttest of theoretical models. we derive a mean radial mass profile of foursimilar mass clusters of high-quality hst and subaru images, in the ranger=40kpc/h to 2800kpc/h, where the inner radial boundary is sufficiently largeto avoid smoothing from miscentering effects. the stacked mass profile isdetected at 58-sigma significance over the entire radial range, with thecontribution from the cosmic noise included. we show that the projected massprofile has a continuously steepening gradient out to beyond the virial radius,in remarkably good agreement with the standard navarro-frenk-white formpredicted for the family of cdm-dominated halos in gravitational equilibrium.the central slope is constrained to lie in the range,-dln{\rho}/dln{r}=0.89^{+0.27}_{-0.39}. the mean concentration isc_{vir}=7.68^{+0.42}_{-0.40} (at a mean virial mass 1.54^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\times10^{15} m_{sun}/h), which is high for relaxed, high-mass clusters, butconsistent with lcdm when a sizable projection bias estimated from n-bodysimulations is considered. this possible tension will be more definitivelyexplored with new cluster surveys, such as clash, locuss, subaru hsc, andxxm-xxl, to construct the c-m relation over a wider mass range.

1105.2295	the universal einstein radius distribution from 10,000 sdss clusters	we present results from strong-lens modelling of 10,000 sdss clusters, toestablish the universal distribution of einstein radii. detailed lensinganalyses have shown that the inner mass distribution of clusters can beaccurately modelled by assuming light traces mass, successfully uncoveringlarge numbers of multiple-images. approximate critical curves and the effectiveeinstein radius of each cluster can therefore be readily calculated, from thedistribution of member galaxies and scaled by their luminosities. we use asubsample of 10 well-studied clusters covered by both sdss and hst to calibrateand test this method, and show that an accurate determination of the einsteinradius and mass can be achieved by this approach "blindly", in an automatedway, and without requiring multiple images as input. we present the results ofthe first 10,000 clusters analysed in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.55$, and compare themto theoretical expectations. we find that for this all-sky representativesample the einstein radius distribution is log-normal in shape, with $&lt;log(\theta_{e}\arcsec)&gt;=0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$,$\sigma=0.316^{+0.004}_{-0.002}$, and with higher abundance of large$\theta_{e}$ clusters than predicted by $\lambda$cdm. we visually inspect eachof the clusters with $\theta_{e}&gt;40 \arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) and find that$\sim20%$ are boosted by various projection effects detailed here, remainingwith $\sim40$ real giant-lens candidates, with a maximum of $\theta_{e}=69\pm12\arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) for the most massive candidate, in agreement withsemi-analytic calculations. the results of this work should be verified furtherwhen an extended calibration sample is available.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1204.3630	clash: mass distribution in and around macs j1206.2-0847 from a full  cluster lensing analysis	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the galaxy cluster macsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.439) from a combined weak-lensing distortion, magnification,and strong-lensing analysis of wide-field subaru bvriz' imaging and our recent16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) program. we find goodagreement in the regions of overlap between several weak and strong lensingmass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuringconsistency. the subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large scalestructure with the major axis running approximately north-west south-east(nw-se), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showingelongation with a \sim 2:1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. our full-lensingmass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln\sigma/dlnr\sim -1 at clusteroutskirts (r&gt;1mpc/h), whereas the mass distribution excluding the nw-se excessregions steepens further out, well described by the navarro-frenk-white form.assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass m_{vir}=(1.1\pm 0.2\pm0.1)\times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h and a halo concentration c_{vir} = 6.9\pm 1.0\pm1.2 (\sim 5.7 when the central 50kpc/h is excluded), which falls in the range4&lt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;7 of average c(m,z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent lambdacold dark matter simulations. our full lensing results are found to be inagreement with x-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and whencombined with chandra gas mass measurements, yield a cumulative gas massfraction of 13.7^{+4.5}_{-3.0}% at 0.7mpc/h (\approx 1.7r_{2500}), a typicalvalue observed for high mass clusters.

1205.2795	spatially-resolved hst grism spectroscopy of a lensed emission line  galaxy at z~1	we take advantage of gravitational lensing amplification by abell 1689(z=0.187) to undertake the first space-based census of emission line galaxies(elgs) in the field of a massive lensing cluster. forty-three elgs areidentified to a flux of i_775=27.3 via slitless grism spectroscopy. one elg (atz=0.7895) is very bright owing to lensing magnification by a factor of ~4.5.several balmer emission lines detected from ground-based follow-up spectroscopysignal the onset of a major starburst for this low-mass galaxy (m_* = 2 x 10^9solar masses) with a high specific star formation rate (~20 /gyr). from theblue emission lines we measure a gas-phase oxygen abundance consistent withsolar (12+log(o/h)=8.8 +/- 0.2). we break the continuous line-emitting regionof this giant arc into seven ~1kpc bins (intrinsic size) and measure a varietyof metallicity dependent line ratios. a weak trend of increasing metal fractionis seen toward the dynamical center of the galaxy. interestingly, the metalline ratios in a region offset from the center by ~1kpc have a placement on theblue hii region excitation diagram with f([oiii])/f(hbeta) andf([neiii])/f(hbeta) that can be fit by an agn. this asymmetrical agn-likebehavior is interpreted as a product of shocks in the direction of the galaxy'sextended tail, possibly instigated by a recent galaxy interaction.

1205.3839	a brightest cluster galaxy with an extremely large flat core	hubble space telescope images of the galaxy cluster abell 2261, obtained aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble, show that thebrightest galaxy in the cluster, a2261-bcg, has the largest core yet detectedin any galaxy. the cusp radius of a2261-bcg is 3.2 kpc, twice as big as thenext largest core known, and ~3x bigger than those typically seen in the mostluminous bcgs. the morphology of the core in a2261-bcg is also unusual, havinga flat or even slightly-depressed interior surface brightness profile, ratherthan the typical shallow cusp. this implies that the galaxy has a core withconstant or even centrally decreasing stellar density. interpretation of thecore as an end product of the "scouring" action of a binary supermassive blackhole implies a total black hole mass ~1e+10 m_sun from the extrapolation ofmost relationships between core structure and black hole mass. the core falls1-sigma above the cusp-radius versus galaxy luminosity relation. its large sizein real terms, and the extremely large black hole mass required to generate it,raise the possibility that the core has been enlarged by additional processes,such as the ejection of the black holes that originally generated the core. theflat central stellar density profile is consistent with this hypothesis. thecore is also displaced by 0.7 kpc from the center of the surrounding envelope,consistent with a local dynamical perturbation of the core.

1205.4028	probing ionizing radiation of l&lt;~0.1l* star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~3  with strong lensing	we show the effectiveness of strong lensing in the characterisation of lymancontinuum emission from faint l&lt;~0.1l* star-forming galaxies at redshift &gt;~ 3.past observations of l&gt;~l* galaxies at redshift &gt;~3 have provided upper limitsof the average escape fraction of ionising radiation of fesc~5%. galaxies withrelatively high fesc (&gt;10%) seem to be particularly rare at these luminosities,there is therefore the need to explore fainter limits. before the advent ofgiant ground based telescopes, one viable way to probe fesc down to 0.05-0.15l*is to exploit strong lensing magnification. this is investigated with montecarlo simulations that take into account the current observationalcapabilities. adopting a lensing cross-section of 10 arcmin^2 within which themagnification is higher than 1 (achievable with about 4-5 galaxy clusters),with a u-band survey depth of 30(30.5) (ab, 1-sigma), it is possible toconstrain fesc for z~3 star-forming galaxies down to 15(10)% at 3-sigma forl&lt;0.15l* luminosities. this is particularly interesting if fesc increases atfainter luminosities, as predicted from various hi reionization scenarios andradiation transfer modelling. ongoing observational programs on galaxy clustersare discussed and offer positive prospects for the future, even though fromspace the hst/wfc3 instrument represents the only option we have to investigatedetails of the spatial distribution of the lyman continuum emission arisingfrom z~2-4 galaxies.

1208.1766	miscentring in galaxy clusters: dark matter to brightest cluster galaxy  offsets in 10,000 sdss clusters	we characterise the typical offset between the dark matter (dm) projectedcentre and the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in 10,000 sdss clusters. to placeconstraints on the centre of dm, we use an automated strong-lensing analysis,mass-modelling technique which is based on the well-tested assumption thatlight traces mass. the cluster galaxies are modelled with a steep power-law,and the dm component is obtained by smoothing the galaxy distribution fitting alow-order 2d polynomial (via spline interpolation), while probing a whole rangeof polynomial degrees and galaxy power laws. we find that the offsets betweenthe bcg and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the dm, \delta, aredistributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are welldescribed by a log-normal distribution with &lt;log_{10}(\delta [h^{-1}mpc])&gt;=-1.895^{+0.003}_{-0.004}, and \sigma=0.501\pm0.004 (95% confidencelevels), or &lt;log_{10}(\delta [\arcsec])&gt;=0.564\pm0.005, and\sigma=0.475\pm0.007. some of the offsets originate in prior misidentificationsof the bcg or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm,whose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that ~10% of theclusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributingto higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. our resultsconstitute the first statistically-significant high-resolution distributions ofdm-to-bcg offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly showthat there exists such a typical non-zero offset in the probed catalogue. theoffsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higherseparations are generally found for higher-z clusters in agreement with thehierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could help characterise themerger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters, in future studies.[abridged]

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

0712.3441	combining lens distortion and depletion to map the mass distribution of  a1689	[abridged] we derive a projected 2d mass map of the well studied galaxycluster a1689 based on an entropy-regularized maximum-likelihood combination ofthe lens magnification and distortion of red background galaxies registered indeep subaru images. the known strong lensing information is also readilyincorporated in this approach, represented as a central pixel with a meansurface density close to the critical value. we also utilize the distortionmeasurements to locally downweight the intrinsic clustering noise, whichotherwise perturbs the depletion signal. the projected mass profilecontinuously steepens with radius and is well fitted by the nfw model, but witha surprising large concentration c_vir=13.4^{+5.3}_{-3.3}, lying far from thepredicted value of c_vir ~ 5, corresponding to the measured virial mass,m_vir=(2.1\pm 0.2)\times 10^15m_{\odot}, posing a challenge to the standardassumptions defining the lcdm model. we examine the consistency of our resultswith estimates derived with the standard weak lensing estimators and bycomparison with the inner mass profile obtained from strong lensing. all thereconstructions tested here imply a virial mass in the range,m_vir=(1.5-2.1)\times 10^15m_{\odot}, and the combined acs and subaru-2d massreconstruction yields a tight constraint on the concentration parameter,c_vir=12.7 \pm 1(stat.) \pm 2.8(systematic) (c_200 ~ 10), improving upon thestatistical accuracy of our earlier 1d analysis. importantly, our best fittingprofile properly reproduces the observed einstein radius of 45 arcsec (z_s=1),in contrast to other weak lensing work, reporting lower concentration profiles,which underestimate the observed einstein radius.

1303.6588	cluster lensing profiles derived from a redshift enhancement of  magnified boss-survey galaxies	we report the first detection of a redshift-depth enhancement of backgroundgalaxies magnified by foreground clusters. using 300,000 boss-survey galaxieswith accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we measure their mean redshift depthbehind four large samples of optically selected clusters from the sdss surveys,totalling 5,000-15,000 clusters. a clear trend of increasing mean redshifttowards the cluster centers is found, averaged over each of the four clustersamples. in addition we find similar but noisier behaviour for an independentx-ray sample of 158 clusters lying in the foreground of the current boss skyarea. by adopting the mass-richness relationships appropriate for each surveywe compare our results with theoretical predictions for each of the four sdsscluster catalogs. the radial form of this redshift enhancement is well fittedby a richness-to-mass weighted composite navarro-frenk-white profile with aneffective mass ranging between m_200 ~ 1.4-1.8 10^14 m_sun for the opticallydetected cluster samples, and m_200 ~ 5.0 10^14 m_sun for the x-ray sample.this lensing detection helps to establish the credibility of these sdss clustersurveys, and provides a normalization for their respective mass-richnessrelations. in the context of the upcoming bigboss, subaru-pfs, and euclid-nispspectroscopic surveys, this method represents an independent means of derivingthe masses of cluster samples for examining the cosmological evolution, andprovides a relatively clean consistency check of weak-lensing measurements,free from the systematic limitations of shear calibration.

1304.2393	enabling non-parametric strong lensing models to derive reliable cluster  mass distributions. wslap+	in the strong lensing regime non-parametric lens models struggle to achievesufficient angular resolution for a meaningful derivation of the centralcluster mass distribution. the problem lies mainly with cluster members whichperturb lensed images and generate additional images, requiring high resolutionmodeling, even though we mainly wish to understand the relatively smoothcluster component. the required resolution is not achievable because theseparation between lensed images is several times larger than the deflectionangles by member galaxies, even for the deepest data. here we bypass thislimitation by incorporating a simple physical prior for member galaxies, usingtheir observed positions and their luminosity scaled masses. this galaxycontribution is added to a relatively coarse gaussian pixel grid for modelingthe cluster mass distribution, extending our established wslap code (diego etal. 2007). we test this new code with a simulation based on a1689, using thepixels belonging to multiply-lensed images and the observed member galaxies.dealing with the cluster members this way leads to convergent solutions,without resorting to regularization, reproducing well the input cluster andsubstructures. we highlight the ability of this method to recover darksub-components of the cluster, unrelated to member galaxies. such anomalies canprovide clues to the nature of invisible dark matter, but are hard to discoverusing parametrized models where substructures are defined by the visible data.with our increased resolution and stability we show, for the first time, thatnon-parametric models can be made sufficiently precise to locatemultiply-lensed systems, thereby achieving fully self-consistent solutionswithout reliance on input systems from less objective means.

0801.1875	large einstein radii: a problem for lambdacdm	the einstein radius of a cluster provides a relatively model-independentmeasure of the mass density of a cluster within a projected radius of ~ 150kpc, large enough to be relatively unaffected by gas physics. we show that theobserved einstein radii of four well-studied massive clusters, for whichreliable virial masses are measured, lie well beyond the predicted distributionof einstein radii in the standard lambdacdm model. based on large samples ofnumerically simulated cluster-sized objects with virial masses ~ 1e15 solar,the predicted einstein radii are only 15-25'', a factor of two below theobserved einstein radii of these four clusters. this is because the predictedmass profile is too shallow to exceed the critical surface density for lensingat a sizable projected radius. after carefully accounting for measurementerrors as well as the biases inherent in the selection of clusters and theprojection of mass measured by lensing, we find that the theoreticalpredictions are excluded at a 4-sigma significance. since most of the freeparameters of the lambdacdm model now rest on firm empirical ground, thisdiscrepancy may point to an additional mechanism that promotes the collapse ofclusters at an earlier time thereby enhancing their central mass density.

1307.0982	tangential velocity of the dark matter in the bullet cluster from  precise lensed image redshifts	we show that the fast moving component of the "bullet cluster" (1e0657-56)can induce potentially resolvable redshift differences between multiply-lensedimages of background galaxies. the moving cluster effect can be expressed asthe scalar product of the lensing deflection angle with the tangential velocityof the mass components, and it is maximal for clusters colliding in the planeof the sky with velocities boosted by their mutual gravity. the bullet clusteris likely to be the best candidate for the first measurement of this effect dueto the large collision velocity and because the lensing deflection and thecluster fields can be calculated in advance. we derive the deflection fieldusing multiply-lensed background galaxies detected with the hubble spacetelescope. the velocity field is modeled using self-consistentn-body/hydrodynamical simulations constrained by the observed x-ray andgravitational lensing features of this system. we predict that thetriply-lensed images of systems "g" and "h" straddling the critical curve ofthe bullet component will show the largest frequency shifts up to ~0.5 km/sec.this is within the range of the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array(alma) for molecular emission, and is near the resolution limit of the newgeneration high-throughput optical-ir spectrographs. a detection of this effectmeasures the tangential motion of the subclusters directly, thereby clarifyingthe tension with lcdm, which is inferred from gas motion less directly. thismethod may be extended to smaller redshift differences using the ly-alphaforest towards qsos lensed by more typical clusters of galaxies. moregenerally, the tangential component of the peculiar velocities of clustersderived by our method complements the radial component determined by thekinematic sz effect, providing a full 3-dimensional description of velocities.

1311.5224	consistent use of type ia supernovae highly magnified by galaxy clusters  to constrain the cosmological parameters	we discuss how type ia supernovae (sne) strongly magnified by foregroundgalaxy clusters should be self-consistently treated when used in samples fittedfor the cosmological parameters. while the cluster lens magnification of a sncan be well constrained from sets of multiple images of various backgroundgalaxies with measured redshifts, its value is typically dependent on thefiducial set of cosmological parameters used to construct the mass model tobegin with. in such cases, one should not naively demagnify the observed snluminosity by the model magnification into the expected hubble diagram, whichwould then create a bias, but take into account the cosmological parametersa-priori chosen to construct the mass model. we quantify the effect and findthat a systematic error of typically a few percent, up to a few-dozen percent,per magnified sn, may be propagated onto a cosmological parameter fit, unlessthe cosmology assumed for the mass model is taken into account (the bias can beeven larger if the sn is lying very near the critical curves). we also simulatehow such a bias propagates onto the cosmological parameter fit using theunion2.1 sample, supplemented with strongly magnified sne. the resulting biason the deduced cosmological parameters is generally at the few percent level,if only few biased sne are included, and increasing with the number of lensedsne and their redshift. samples containing magnified type ia sne, e.g. fromongoing cluster surveys, should readily account for this possible bias.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1404.1375	clash: weak-lensing shear-and-magnification analysis of 20 galaxy  clusters	we present a joint shear-and-magnification weak-lensing analysis of a sampleof 16 x-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters at 0.19&lt;z&lt;0.69selected from the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). ouranalysis uses wide-field multi-color imaging, taken primarily with suprime-camon the subaru telescope. from a stacked shear-only analysis of thex-ray-selected subsample, we detect the ensemble-averaged lensing signal with atotal signal-to-noise ratio of ~25 in the radial range of 200 to 3500kpc/h. thestacked tangential-shear signal is well described by a family of standarddensity profiles predicted for dark-matter-dominated halos in gravitationalequilibrium, namely the navarro-frenk-white (nfw), truncated variants of nfw,and einasto models. for the nfw model, we measure a mean concentration of$c_{200c}=4.01^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ at $m_{200c}=1.34^{+0.10}_{-0.09}10^{15}m_{\odot}$. we show this is in excellent agreement with lambdacold-dark-matter (lcdm) predictions when the clash x-ray selection function andprojection effects are taken into account. the best-fit einasto shape parameteris $\alpha_e=0.191^{+0.071}_{-0.068}$, which is consistent with thenfw-equivalent einasto parameter of $\sim 0.18$. we reconstruct projected massdensity profiles of all clash clusters from a joint likelihood analysis ofshear-and-magnification data, and measure cluster masses at severalcharacteristic radii. we also derive an ensemble-averaged total projected massprofile of the x-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual massprofiles. the stacked total mass profile, constrained by theshear+magnification data, is shown to be consistent with our shear-basedhalo-model predictions including the effects of surrounding large-scalestructure as a two-halo term, establishing further consistency in the contextof the lcdm model.

1405.2617	a hydrodynamical solution for the "twin-tailed" colliding galaxy cluster  "el gordo"	the distinctive cometary x-ray morphology of the recently discovered massivegalaxy cluster "el gordo" (act-ct j0102-4915; z=0.87) indicates that anunusually high-speed collision is ongoing between two massive galaxy clusters.a bright x-ray "bullet" leads a "twin-tailed" wake, with the sz centroid at theend of the northern tail. we show how the physical properties of this systemcan be determined using our flash-based, n-body/hydrodynamic model, constrainedby detailed x-ray, sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz), and hubble lensing and dynamicaldata. the x-ray morphology and the location of the two dark matter componentsand the sz peak are accurately described by a simple binary collision viewedabout 480 million years after the first core passage. we derive an impactparameter of ~300 kpc, and a relative initial infall velocity of ~2250 km/secwhen separated by the sum of the two virial radii assuming an initial totalmass of 2.15x10^(15) msun and a mass ratio of 1.9. our model demonstrates thattidally stretched gas accounts for the northern x-ray tail along the collisionaxis between the mass peaks, and that the southern tail lies off axis,comprising compressed and shock heated gas generated as the massive componentplunges through the main cluster. the challenge for lcdm will be to find out ifthis physically extreme event can be plausibly accommodated when combined withthe similarly massive, high infall velocity case of the "bullet cluster" andother such cases being uncovered in the new sz based surveys.

1405.7876	clash-x: a comparison of lensing and x-ray techniques for measuring the  mass profiles of galaxy clusters	we present profiles of temperature (tx), gas mass, and hydrostatic massestimated from new and archival x-ray observations of clash clusters. wecompare measurements derived from xmm and chandra observations with one anotherand compare both to gravitational lensing mass profiles derived with clash hstand ground-based lensing data. radial profiles of chandra and xmm electrondensity and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differencesin hydrostatic masses inferred from x-ray observations arise from differencesin tx measurements. encouragingly, cluster txs are consistent with one anotherat ~100-200 kpc radii but xmm tx systematically decline relative to chandra txat larger radii. the angular dependence of the discrepancy suggests additionalinvestigation on systematics such as the xmm point spread function correction,vignetting and off-axis responses. we present the clash-x mass-profilecomparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independentcircular-velocity profiles. ratios of chandra hse mass profiles to clashlensing profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 mpc range.however, the mean mass biases inferred from the wl and sawlens data aredifferent. e.g., the weighted-mean value at 0.5 mpc is &lt;b&gt; = 0.12 for the wlcomparison and &lt;b&gt; = -0.11 for the sawlens comparison. the ratios of xmm hsemass profiles to clash lensing profiles show a pronounced radial dependence inthe 0.3-1.0 mpc range, with a weighted mean mass bias of value rising to&lt;b&gt;~0.3 at ~1 mpc for the wl comparison and &lt;b&gt; of 0.25 for sawlens comparison.the enclosed gas mass profiles from both chandra and xmm rise to a value 1/8times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at 0.5 mpc and remainconstant outside of that radius, suggesting that [8xmgas] profiles may be anexcellent proxy for total-mass profiles at &gt;0.5 mpc in massive galaxy clusters.

1406.6586	cosmic structure as the quantum interference of a coherent dark wave	the conventional cold, particle interpretation of dark matter (cdm) stilllacks laboratory support and struggles with the basic properties of commondwarf galaxies, which have surprisingly uniform central masses and shallowdensity profiles. in contrast, galaxies predicted by cdm extend to much lowermasses, with steeper, singular profiles. this tension motivates cold, wavelikedark matter ($\psi$dm) composed of a non-relativistic bose-einstein condensate,so the uncertainty principle counters gravity below a jeans scale. here weachieve the first cosmological simulations of this quantum state atunprecedentedly high resolution capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, with onlyone free parameter, $\bf{m_b}$, the boson mass. we demonstrate the large scalestructure of this $\psi$dm simulation is indistinguishable from cdm, asdesired, but differs radically inside galaxies. connected filaments andcollapsed haloes form a large interference network, with gravitationallyself-bound solitonic cores inside every galaxy surrounded by extended haloes offluctuating density granules. these results allow us to determine$\bf{m_b=(8.1^{+1.6}_{-1.7})\times 10^{-23}~ev}$ using stellar phase-spacedistributions in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. denser, more massive solitons arepredicted for milky way sized galaxies, providing a substantial seed to helpexplain early spheroid formation. suppression of small structures means theonset of galaxy formation for $\psi$dm is substantially delayed relative tocdm, appearing at $\bf{z\lesssim 13}$ in our simulations.

1407.7762	understanding the core-halo relation of quantum wave dark matter,  $\psi$dm, from 3d simulations	we examine the nonlinear structure of gravitationally collapsed objects thatform in our simulations of wavelike cold dark matter ($\psi$dm), described bythe schr\"{o}dinger-poisson (sp) equation with a particle mass $\sim 10^{-22}{\rm ev}$. a distinct gravitationally self-bound solitonic core is found at thecenter of every halo, with a profile quite different from cores modeled in thewarm or self-interacting dark matter scenarios. furthermore, we show that eachsolitonic core is surrounded by an extended halo composed of large fluctuatingdark matter granules which modulate the halo density on a scale comparable tothe diameter of the solitonic core. the scaling symmetry of the sp equation andthe uncertainty principle tightly relate the core mass to the halo specificenergy, which, in the context of cosmological structure formation, leads to asimple scaling between core mass ($m_c$) and halo mass ($m_h$), $m_c \proptoa^{-1/2} m_h^{1/3}$, where $a$ is the cosmic scale factor. we verify thisscaling relation by (i) examining the internal structure of a statisticalsample of virialized halos that form in our 3d cosmological simulations, and by(ii) merging multiple solitons to create individual virialized objects.sufficient simulation resolution is achieved by adaptive mesh refinement andgraphic processing units acceleration. from this scaling relation, presentdwarf satellite galaxies are predicted to have kpc sized cores and a minimummass of $\sim 10^8 {m_\odot}$, capable of solving the small-scale controversiesin the cold dark matter model. moreover, galaxies of $2\times10^{12} {m_\odot}$at $z=8$ should have massive solitonic cores of $\sim 2\times10^9 {m_\odot}$within $\sim 60 {\rm pc}$. such cores can provide a favorable local environmentfor funneling the gas that leads to the prompt formation of early stellarspheroids and quasars.

1410.6050	comparing gravitational redshifts of sdss galaxy clusters with the  magnification redshift enhancement of background boss galaxies	a clean measurement of the evolution of the galaxy cluster mass function cansignificantly improve our understanding of cosmology from the rapid growth ofcluster masses below z &lt; 0.5. here we examine the consistency of clustercatalogues selected from the sdss by applying two independent gravity-basedmethods using all available spectroscopic redshifts from the dr10 release.first, we detect a gravitational redshift related signal for 20,119 and 13,128clusters with spectroscopic redshifts contained in the gmbcg and redmappercatalogues, respectively, at a level of $\sim - 10$ km s$^{-1}$. this we showis consistent with the magnitude expected using the richness-mass relationsprovided by the literature and after applying recently clarified relativisticand flux bias corrections. this signal is also consistent with the richestclusters in the larger catalogue of wen et al. (2012), corresponding to$m_{200m} \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{m}_\odot\,h^{-1}$, however we findno significant detection of gravitational redshift signal for less richedclusters, which may be related to bulk motions from substructure and spuriouscluster detections. second, we find all three catalogues generatemass-dependent levels of lensing magnification bias, which enhances the meanredshift of flux-selected background galaxies from the boss survey. themagnitude of this lensing effect is generally consistent with the correspondingrichness-mass relations advocated for the surveys. we conclude that allcatalogues comprise a high proportion of reliable clusters, and that the gmbcgand redmapper cluster finder algorithms favor more relaxed clusters with ameaningful gravitational redshift signal, as anticipated by the red-sequencecolour selection of the gmbcg and redmapper samples.

1412.7909	clash: extreme emission line galaxies and their implication on selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we utilize the clash (cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble)observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies(eelgs). the selections are carried out in two central bands: f105w (y105) andf125w (j125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by thepresence of [o iii] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79,respectively. the multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalentwidths of emission lines. thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame[o iii] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. our samples includea number of eelgs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, andthe extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies.these eelgs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshiftgalaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxieswhen the s/n ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. we predictthat the fraction of eelgs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannotbe neglected.

astro-ph;0004289	the influence of galactic outflows on the formation of nearby dwarf  galaxies	we show that the gas in growing density perturbations is vulnerable to theinfluence of winds outflowing from nearby collapsed galaxies that have alreadyformed stars. this suggests that the formation of nearby galaxies with massesless than 10^9 solar masses is likely to be suppressed, irrespective of thedetails of galaxy formation. an impinging wind may shock heat the gas of anearby perturbation to above the virial temperature, thereby mechanicallyevaporating the gas, or the baryons may be stripped from the perturbationentirely if they are accelerated to above the escape velocity. we show thatbaryonic stripping is the most effective of these two processes, becauseshock-heated clouds that are too large to be stripped are able to radiativelycool within a sound-crossing time, limiting evaporation. the intergalacticmedium temperatures and star-formation rates required for outflows to have asignificant influence on the formation of low-mass galaxies are consistent withcurrent observations, but may soon be examined directly via associateddistortions in the cosmic microwave background, and with near-infraredobservations from the next generation space telescope, which may detect thesupernovae from early-forming stars.

0808.0921	observations of the gas reservoir around a star forming galaxy in the  early universe	we present a high signal-to-noise spectrum of a bright galaxy at z = 4.9 in14 h of integration on vlt fors2. this galaxy is extremely bright, i_850 =23.10 +/- 0.01, and is strongly-lensed by the foreground massive galaxy clusterabell 1689 (z=0.18). stellar continuum is seen longward of the ly-alphaemission line at ~7100 \aa, while intergalactic h i produces strong absorptionshortward of ly-alpha. two transmission spikes at ~6800 angstroms (a) and ~7040a are also visible, along with other structures at shorter wavelengths.although fainter than a qso, the absence of a strong central ultraviolet fluxsource in this star forming galaxy enables a measurement of the h i fluxtransmission in the intergalactic medium (igm) in the vicinity of a highredshift object. we find that the effective h i optical depth of the igm isremarkably high within a large 14 mpc (physical) region surrounding the galaxycompared to that seen towards qsos at similar redshifts. evidently, thishigh-redshift galaxy is located in a region of space where the amount of h i ismuch larger than that seen at similar epochs in the diffuse igm. we argue thatobservations of high-redshift galaxies like this one provide unique insights onthe nascent stages of baryonic large-scale structures that evolve into thefilamentary cosmic web of galaxies and clusters of galaxies observed in thepresent universe.

astro-ph;0012152	linking the metallicity distribution of galactic halo stars to the  enrichment history of the universe	we compare the metallicity distribution of galactic halo stars with 3drealizations of hierarchical galaxy formation. outflows from dwarf galaxiesenrich the intergalactic medium inhomogeneously, at a rate depending on thelocal galaxy density. consequently, the first stars created in smallearly-forming galaxies are less metal-rich that the first stars formed in moremassive galaxies which typically form later. as most halo stars are likely tooriginate in accreted dwarfs, while disk stars formed out of outflow-enrichedgas, this scenario naturally generates a ``metallicity floor'' for old diskstars, which we find to be roughly coincident with the higher end of ourpredicted metallicity distribution of halo stars, in agreement withobservations. the broad and centrally peaked distribution of halo starmetallicities is well reproduced in our models, with a natural dispersiondepending on the exact accretion history. our modeling includes the important``baryonic stripping'' effect of early outflows, which brush away the tenuouslyheld gas in neighboring pre-virialized density perturbations. this strippingprocess does not significantly modify the predicted shape of the halo starmetal distribution but inhibits star-formation and hence the number of accretedstars, helping to reproduce the observed total galactic halo luminosity andalso the lack of low-luminosity local dwarf galaxies relative to n-bodypredictions.

astro-ph;0304547	cloning dropouts: implications for galaxy evolution at high redshift	the evolution of high redshift galaxies in the two hubble deep fields, hdf-nand hdf-s, is investigated using a cloning technique that replicates z~ 2-3 udropouts to higher redshifts, allowing a comparison with the observed b and vdropouts at higher redshifts (z ~ 4-5). we treat each galaxy selected forreplication as a set of pixels that are k-corrected to higher redshift,accounting for resampling, shot-noise, surface-brightness dimming, and thecosmological model. we find evidence for size evolution (a 1.7x increase) fromz ~ 5 to z ~ 2.7 for flat geometries (omega_m+omega_lambda=1.0). simple scalinglaws for this cosmology predict that size evolution goes as (1+z)^{-1},consistent with our result. the uv luminosity density shows a similar increase(1.85x) from z ~ 5 to z ~ 2.7, with minimal evolution in the distribution ofintrinsic colors for the dropout population. in general, these results indicateless evolution than was previously reported, and therefore a higher luminositydensity at z ~ 4-5 (~ 50% higher) than other estimates. we argue the presenttechnique is the preferred way to understand evolution across samples withdiffering selection functions, the most relevant differences here being thecolor cuts and surface brightness thresholds (e.g., due to the (1+z)^4 cosmicsurface brightness dimming effect).

astro-ph;0410288	probing halos of galaxies at very large radii using background qsos	(abridged) gaseous halos of nine nearby galaxies (with redshifts cz &lt; 6000km/s) were probed at large galactocentric radii using background quasarsobserved with hst ghrs and stis. the projected quasar-galaxy separations rangefrom 55 to 387 h^{-1}_{75} kpc. ly\alpha absorption lines were successfullydetected in the spectra of five quasars, at impact parameters of up to 170h^{-1}_{75} kpc from the center of the nearby galaxy, and in each case atwavelengths consistent with the galaxy's redshift. our observations include thelowest redshift ly\alpha lines detected to date. hi velocity fields wereobtained at the vla for three of the galaxies in our sample (and in one casewas available from the literature), to derive their rotation curves. whencomparing the inner rotation curves of the galaxies with the velocity at largeradius provided by the ly\alpha line it is apparent that it is very difficultto explain the observed ly\alpha velocity as due to gas in an extended rotatingdisk. in most cases one would need to invoke large warps in the outer gas disksand also thick gas disks in order to reconcile the observed velocities with thepredicted ones. in light of these results we conclude that in a typical galaxythere is no longer detectable atomic gas corotating in an extended disk atradii &gt; 35 \alpha ^{-1}, where \alpha^{-1} is the stellar disk exponentialscale-length. the cosmic web is the most likely origin for the detectedly\alpha lines.

astro-ph;0505452	can the steep mass profile of a1689 be explained by a triaxial dark  halo?	the steep mass profile of a1689 derived from recent detailed lensingobservations is not readily reconciled with the low concentration halospredicted by the standard cdm model. however, halo triaxiality may act to biasthe profile constraints derived assuming a spherically symmetric massdistribution, since lensing relates only to the projected mass distribution. adegree of halo triaxiality is inherent to the cdm structure formation, arisingfrom the collision-less nature of the dark matter. here we compare thecdm-based model predictions of triaxial halo with the precise lensingmeasurements of a1689 based on the acs/hst and subaru data, over a wide rangeof 10kpc&lt;r&lt;2mpc. the model lensing profiles cover the intrinsic spread of halomass and shape, and are projected over all inclinations when comparing with thedata. we show that the model parameters are only weakly constrained andstrongly degenerate mainly because of the lack of information along the line ofsight. in particular, the limits on the concentration parameter become lessrestrictive with increasing triaxiality. yet, by comparing the obtainedconstraints with expected probability distributions for the axis ratio andconcentration parameters computed from numerical simulations, we find that ~6%of cluster-size halos in the cdm model can match the a1689 lensing observationsat the 2-sigma level, corresponding to cases where the major-axis of the halois aligned with the line of sight. thus halo triaxiality could reduce theapparent discrepancy between theory and observation. this hypothesis needs tobe further explored by a statistical lensing study for other clusters as wellas by complementary three-dimensional information derived using x-ray,kinematics, and sz effect observations.

astro-ph;0608499	using weak lensing dilution to improve measurements of the luminous and  dark matter in a1689	the e/so sequence of a cluster defines a boundary redward of which a reliableweak lensing signal can be obtained from background galaxies, uncontaminated bycluster members. for bluer colors, both background and cluster members arepresent, reducing the distortion signal by the proportion of unlensed clustermembers. in deep subaru and hst/acs images of a1689 the tangential distortionof galaxies with bluer colors falls rapidly toward the cluster center relativeto the lensing signal of the red background. we use this dilution effect toderive the cluster light profile and luminosity function to large radius, withthe advantage that no subtraction of far-field background counts is required.the light profile declines smoothly to the limit of the data, r&lt;2mpc/h, with aconstant slope, dlog(l)/dlog(r)=-1.12+-0.06, unlike the lensing mass profilewhich steepens continuously with radius, so that m/l peaks at an intermediateradius, ~100kpc/h. a flatter behavior is found for the more physicallymeaningful ratio of dark-matter to stellar-matter, when accounting for thecolor-mass relation of cluster members. the cluster luminosity function has aflat slope, alpha=-1.05+-0.07, independent of radius and with no faint upturnto m_i'&lt;-12. we establish that the very bluest objects are negligiblycontaminated by the cluster v-i'&lt;0.2, because their distortion profile risestowards the center following the red background, but offset higher by ~20%.this larger amplitude is consistent with the greater estimated depth of thefaint blue galaxies, z~=2.0 compared to z~=0.85 for the red background, apurely geometric effect related to cosmological parameters. finally, we improveupon our earlier mass profile by combining both the red and blue backgroundpopulations, clearly excluding low concentration cdm profiles.

astro-ph;9411005	a method for weak lensing observations	we develop and test a method for measuring the gravitational lensing induceddistortion of faint background galaxies. we first describe how we locate thegalaxies and measure a 2-component `polarisation' or ellipticity statistic$e_\alpha$ whose expectation value should be proportional to the gravitationalshear $\gamma_\alpha$. we then show that an anisotropic instrumental psfperturbs the polarisation by $\delta e_\alpha = p^s_{\alpha\beta} p_\beta$,where $p_\alpha$ is a measure of the psf anisotropy and $p^s_{\alpha\beta}$ isthe `linearised smear polarisability tensor'. by estimating $p^s_{\alpha\beta}$for each object we can determine $p_\alpha$ from the foreground stars and applya correction $-p^s_{\alpha\beta}p_\beta$ to the galaxies. we test thisprocedure using deep high-resolution images from hst which are smeared with ananisotropic psf and then have noise added to simulate ground-basedobservations. we find that the procedure works very well. a similar analysisyields a linear shear polarisability tensor $p^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}$ whichdescribes the response to a gravitational shear. this calibrates thepolarisation-shear relation, but only for galaxies which are well resolved. toempirically calibrate the effect of seeing on the smaller galaxies weartificially stretch hst images to simulate lensing and then degrade them asbefore. these experiments provide a rigorous and exacting test of the methodunder realistic conditions. they show that it is possible to remove the effectof instrumental psf anisotropy, and that the method provides an efficient andquantitative measurement of the gravitational shear.

astro-ph;9411029	recent developments in weak lensing	measurement of the gravitational distortion of images of distant galaxies israpidly becoming established as a powerful probe of the dark mass distributionin clusters of galaxies. with the advent of large mosaics of ccd's thesemethods should provide a composite total mass profile for galaxy haloes andalso measure the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on supercluster scales. wedescribe how hst observations have been used to place the observationalmeasurement of the shear on a quantitative footing. by artifically stretchingand then degrading wfpc2 images to simulate ground based observing it is nowpossible to directly calibrate the effect of atmospheric seeing. similarexperiments show that one can remove the effect of artificial image anisotropyarising in the atmosphere or telescope. there have also been important advancesin the interpretation of the shear: reconstruction techniques have beenextended to encompass the strong distortion regime of giant arcs etc., progresshas been made in removing a bias present in earlier reconstruction techniques,and we describe new techniques for `aperture densitometry'. we present some newresults on clusters of galaxies, and discuss the intimate connections betweenweak lensing and deep spectroscopy.

astro-ph;9505013	a gravitational lens solution for iras f10214+4724	we show that the high redshift iras source f10214 is highly magnified by thegravitational field of an intervening elliptical galaxy, accounting for itsmany anomalous properties. detailed radio and near-ir images identify the irassource with a symmetric arc, centered on a red object, or lensing galaxy. toexplain the observed structures, the center of the source must much more highlymagnified than its outer regions. lensing predicts a small counterimage to thearc, which we find adjacent to the lensing galaxy. a red component in theobserved spectrum suggests a lens redshift of unity, and the lens model yieldsa mass estimate of $m(r&lt;3kpc)\approx10^{11}{m_solar}$, consistent with anordinary elliptical galaxy. we present new high-resolution optical images whichshow a thin arc of emission, implying an intrinsically small source ($&lt;0.5kpc$)which is highly magnified ($\sim20\times$). since the optical is stronglypolarized with a seyfert~ii spectrum, we propose that the optical arc ismagnified image of the inner region of an obscured agn. the obscuring ``torus''will be similarly magnified, naturally accounting for the large ir flux. weshow that finding objects like f10214+4724 in redshift surveys is probable,given the level of magnification bias expected for compact luminous irassources. such cases represent the obscured agn counterparts to the lensed qsopopulation and, because of their extended sizes, are useful in determining themass distribution in the lensing galaxies.

astro-ph;9511150	gravitational `convergence' and cluster masses	two colour photometry of the cluster a1689 reveals a `relativemagnification-bias' between lensed blue and red background galaxies, arisingfrom a dependence of the faint galaxy count-slope on colour. the colourdistribution is skewed blueward of the far field, allowing us to measure thecluster magnification and to understand the notorious blueness of large arcs.we show that the magnification information can be combined with the usual imagedistortion measurements to isolate the local `convergence' component of lensingand hence derive the projected mass. this is achieved through a simple localrelation between the convergence and the observables, which can be appliedgenerally over the surface a cluster. in the weak lensing limit, theconvergence reduces to a dependence on the magnification alone, so that in theoutskirts of clusters the surface-density of matter is obtained directly fromthe surface-density of background galaxies. hence, useful lensing work requirescolour information but not necessarily good seeing. interestingly, convergencevaries slowly at high redshift, saturating at a level depending on the horizondistance, allowing a useful model-independent measurement of the globalgeometry.

(ii) early-type spirals show modest evolution, characterised bya gradual steepening of the faint end of their lf with redshift. (iii) out to z~ 0.5, the overall evolution of the galaxy population is dominated by changesseen in late-type spirals. the characteristic luminosity (l^*) of thesegalaxies appears to brighten with redshift and there are signs of strongdensity evolution (a rapid increase in \phi^*). these effects appear to beluminosity dependent so that the lf steepens at higher redshift. these trendsare accompanied by a steep increase in the median [oii] equivalent width,implying a rapid increase in the star-formation rate with redshift at fixedluminosity---a given star-formation rate is found at higher redshift ingalaxies of higher luminosity. we find that these conclusions are robust withrespect to spectral classification errors and the luminosity functionestimator.

astro-ph;9812205	detection of evolved high-redshift galaxies in deep nicmos/vlt images	a substantial population of high redshift early-type galaxies is detected invery deep ubvrijhk images towards the hdf-south. four elliptical profilegalaxies are identified in the redshift range z=1-2, all with very red seds,implying ages of &gt;2 gyrs for standard passive evolution. we also find latertype ir-luminous galaxies at similarly high redshift, (10 objects with z&gt;1,h&lt;25), whose weak uv emission implies single burst ages of &gt;1 gyr. the numberand luminosity-densities of these galaxies are comparable with the locale/so-sbc populations for \omega_m&gt;0.2, and in the absence of a significantcosmological constant, we infer that the major fraction of luminoushubble-sequence galaxies have evolved little since z~2. a highly completephotometric redshift distribution is constructed to h=25 (69 galaxies) showinga broad spread of redshift, peaking at z~1.5, in reasonable agreement with someanalyses of the hdf. five `dropout' galaxies are detected at z~3.8, which arecompact in the ir, ~0.5 kpc/h at rest 3500\aa. no example of a blue ir luminouselliptical is found, restricting the star-formation epoch of ellipticals toz&gt;10 for a standard imf and modest extinction.

astro-ph;9812218	deep imaging of axj2019+112: the luminosity of a ``dark cluster''	we detect a distant cluster of galaxies centered on the qso lens and luminousx-ray source axj2019+112, a.k.a. ``the dark cluster'' (hattori et al 1997).using deep v,i keck images and wide-field k_s imaging from the ntt, a tight redsequence of galaxies is identified within a radius of 0.2 h^{-1} mpc of theknown z=1.01 elliptical lensing galaxy. the sequence, which includes thecentral elliptical galaxy, has a slope in good agreement with the modelpredictions of kodama et al (1998) for z~1. we estimate the integratedrest-frame luminosity of the cluster to be l_v &gt; 3.2 x 10^{11}h^{-2}l_{\sun}(after accounting for significant extinction at the low latitude of thisfield), more than an order of magnitude higher than previous estimates. thecentral region of the cluster is deconvolved using the technique of magain,courbin &amp; sohy (1998), revealing a thick central arc coincident with anextended radio source. all the observed lensing features are readily explainedby differential magnification of a radio loud agn by a shallow ellipticalpotential. the qso must lie just outside the diamond caustic, producing twoimages, and the arc is a highly magnified image formed from a region close tothe center of the host galaxy, projecting inside the caustic. themass--to--light ratio within an aperture of 0.4 h ^{-1} mpc is m_x/l_v=224^{+112}_{-78}h(m/l_v)_{\sun}, using the x-ray temperature. the strong lensmodel yields a compatible value, m/l_v= 372^{+94}_{-94}h(m/l_v)_{\sun}, whereasan independent weak lensing analysis sets an upper limit of m/l_v &lt;520h(m/l_v)_{\sun}, typical of massive clusters.

astro-ph;9903009	young red spheroidal galaxies in the hubble deep fields: evidence for a  truncated imf at ~2m_solar and a constant space density to z~2	the optical-ir images of the northern and southern hubble deep fields areused to measure the spectral and density evolution of early-type galaxies. themean optical sed is found to evolve passively towards a mid f-star dominatedspectrum by z ~ 2. we demonstrate with realistic simulations that hotterellipticals would be readily visible if evolution progressed blueward andbrightward at z &gt; 2, following a standard imf. the colour distributions arebest fitted by a `red' imf, deficient above ~2 m_solar and with a spread offormation in the range 1.5 &lt; z_f &lt; 2.5. traditional age dating is spurious inthis context, a distant elliptical can be young but appear red, with anapparent age &gt;3 gyrs independent of its formation redshift. regarding densityevolution, we demonstrate that the sharp decline in numbers claimed at z &gt; 1results from a selection bias against distant red galaxies in the optical,where the flux is too weak for morphological classification, but is remediedwith relatively modest ir exposures revealing a roughly constant space densityto z ~ 2. we point out that the lack of high mass star-formation inferred hereand the requirement of metals implicates cooling-flows of pre-enriched gas inthe creation of the stellar content of spheroidal galaxies. deep-field x-rayimages will be very helpful to examine this possibility.

astro-ph;9904348	using the comoving maximum of the galaxy power spectrum to measure  cosmological curvature	the large-scale maximum at k~0.05 identified in the power-spectrum of galaxyfluctuations provides a co-moving scale for measuring cosmological curvature.in shallow 3d surveys the peak is broad, but appears to be well resolved in 1d,at ~130 mpc (k=0.048), comprising evenly spaced peaks and troughs. surprisinglysimilar behaviour is evident at z=3 in the distribution of lyman-breakgalaxies, for which we find a 5 sigma excess of pairs separated by deltaz=0.22pm0.02, equivalent to 85mpc for omega=1, increasing to 170 mpc foromega=0, with a number density contrast of 30% averaged over 5 independentfields. the combination, 3.2\omega_m -\omega_{\lambda}=0.7, matches the localscale of 130 mpc, i.e. omega=0.2\pm0.1 or omega_{m}=0.4\pm0.1 for thematter-dominated and flat models respectively, with an uncertainty given by thewidth of the excess correlation. the consistency here of the flat model withsnia based claims is encouraging, but overshadowed by the high degree ofcoherence observed in 1d compared with conventional gaussian models ofstructure formation. the appearance of this scale at high redshift and itslocal prominence in the distribution of abell clusters lends support to claimsthat the high-z `spikes' represent young clusters. finally we show that a spikein the primordial power spectrum of delta\rho/\rho=0.3 at k=0.05 has littleeffect on the cmb, except to exaggerate the first doppler peak in flatmatter-dominated models, consistent with recent observations. \\effect on thecmb, except to exaggerate the first doppler peak in flat matter-dominatedmodels, consistent with recent observations.

astro-ph;9906171	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift  surveys---iii. field elliptical galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0	surface photometry has been performed on a sample of 46 field ellipticalgalaxies. these galaxies are described well by a devaucouleurs r^{1/4} profile.the sample was selected from the combined canada-france and ldss redshiftsurveys and spans the range 0.20 &lt; z &lt; 1.00. the relationship between galaxyhalf-light radius and luminosity evolves such that a galaxy of a given size ismore luminous by delta m_b=-0.97 \pm 0.14 mag at z=0.92 and the mean rest-framecolor shifts blueward by delta (u-v) =-0.68 \pm 0.11 at z=0.92 relative to thelocal cluster relations. approximately 1/3 of these elliptical galaxies exhibit[oii] 3727 emission lines with equivalent widths &gt; 15 angstroms indicatingongoing star formation. estimated star-formation rates imply that \le 5% of thestellar mass in the elliptical galaxy population has been formed since z=1. wesee no evidence for a decline in the space density of early-type galaxies withlook-back time. the &lt;v/v_{max}&gt; statistics and a comparison with localluminosity functions are both consistent with the view that the population ofmassive early-type galaxies was largely in place by z~1. this implies thatmerging is not required since that time to produce the present-day spacedensity of elliptical galaxies.

0810.0969	mass and hot baryons in massive galaxy clusters from subaru weak lensing  and amiba sze observations	we present a multiwavelength analysis of a sample of four hot (t_x&gt;8kev)x-ray galaxy clusters (a1689, a2261, a2142, and a2390) using joint amibasunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) and subaru weak lensing observations, combinedwith published x-ray temperatures, to examine the distribution of mass and theintracluster medium (icm) in massive cluster environments. our observationsshow that a2261 is very similar to a1689 in terms of lensing properties. manytangential arcs are visible around a2261, with an effective einstein radius\sim 40 arcsec (at z \sim 1.5), which when combined with our weak lensingmeasurements implies a mass profile well fitted by an nfw model with a highconcentration c_{vir} \sim 10, similar to a1689 and to other massive clusters.the cluster a2142 shows complex mass substructure, and displays a shallowerprofile (c_{vir} \sim 5), consistent with detailed x-ray observations whichimply recent interaction. the amiba map of a2142 exhibits an sze featureassociated with mass substructure lying ahead of the sharp north-west edge ofthe x-ray core suggesting a pressure increase in the icm. for a2390 we obtainhighly elliptical mass and icm distributions at all radii, consistent withother x-ray and strong lensing work. our cluster gas fraction measurements,free from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, are overall in good agreementwith published x-ray and sze observations, with the sample-averaged gasfraction of &lt;f_{gas}&gt; = 0.133 \pm 0.027, for our sample &lt;m_{vir}&gt; = (1.2 \pm0.1) \times 10^{15} m_{sun} h^{-1}. when compared to the cosmic baryon fractionf_b = \omega_b/\omega_m constrained by the wmap 5-year data, this indicates&lt;f_{gas}&gt;/f_b = 0.78 \pm 0.16, i.e., (22 \pm 16)% of the baryons are missingfrom the hot phase of clusters.

0810.3129	dynamical study of a1689 from wide-field vlt/vimos spectroscopy: mass  profile, concentration parameter, and velocity anisotropy	we examine the dynamics structure of the rich cluster a1689, combiningvlt/vimos spectroscopy with subaru/suprime-cam imaging. the radial velocitydistribution of $\sim 500$ cluster members is bounded by a pair of clearlydefined velocity caustics, with a maximum amplitude of $\sim|4000|$ km/s at$\simeq$ 300 h$^{-1}$ kpc, beyond which the amplitude steadily declines,approaching zero velocity at a limiting radius of $\sim$ 2 h$^{-1}$ mpc. wederive the 3d velocity anisotropy and galaxy number density profiles using amodel-independent method to solve the jeans equation, simultaneouslyincorporating the observed velocity dispersion profile, the galaxy counts fromdeep subaru imaging, and our previously derived cluster mass profile from ajoint lensing and x-ray analysis. the velocity anisotropy is found to bepredominantly radial at large radius, becoming increasingly tangential towardsthe center, in accord with expectations. we also analyze the galaxy dataindependently of our previous analysis using two different methods: the firstis based on a solution of the jeans equation assuming an nfw form for the massdistribution, whereas in the second method the caustic amplitude is used todetermine the escape velocity. the cluster virial mass derived by both of thesedynamical methods is in good agreement with results from our earlier lensingand x-ray analysis. we also confirm the high nfw concentration parameter, withresults from both methods combined to yield $c_{\rm vir}&gt;13$ (1$\sigma$). theinferred virial radius is consistent with the limiting radius where thecaustics approach zero velocity and where the counts of cluster members dropoff, suggesting that infall onto a1689 is currently not significant.
