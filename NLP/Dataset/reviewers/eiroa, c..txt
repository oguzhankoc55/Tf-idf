1002.1875	a scenario of planet erosion by coronal radiation	context: according to theory, high-energy emission from the coronae of coolstars can severely erode the atmospheres of orbiting planets. no observationaltests of the long term effects of erosion have yet been made. aims: to analyzethe current distribution of planetary mass with x-ray irradiation of theatmospheres in order to make an observational assessment of the effects oferosion by coronal radiation. methods: we study a large sample ofplanet-hosting stars with xmm-newton, chandra and rosat; make a carefulidentification of x-ray counterparts; and fit their spectra to make accuratelymeasurements of the stellar x-ray flux. results: the distribution of theplanetary masses with x-ray flux suggests that erosion has taken place: mostsurviving massive planets, (m_p sin i &gt;1.5 m_j), have been exposed to loweraccumulated irradiation. heavy erosion during the initial stages of stellarevolution is followed by a phase of much weaker erosion. a line dividing thesetwo phases could be present, showing a strong dependence on planet mass.although a larger sample will be required to establish a well-defined erosionline, the distribution found is very suggestive. conclusions: the distributionof planetary mass with x-ray flux is consistent with a scenario in which planetatmospheres have suffered the effects of erosion by coronal x-ray and euvemission. the erosion line is an observational constraint to models ofatmospheric erosion.

1002.4391	chromospheric activity and rotation of fgk stars in the solar vicinity.  an estimation of the radial velocity jitter	context: chromospheric activity produces both photometric and spectroscopicvariations that can be mistaken as planets. large spots crossing the stellardisc can produce planet-like periodic variations in the light curve of a star.these spots clearly affect the spectral line profiles and their perturbationsalter the line centroids creating a radial velocity jitter that mightcontaminate" the variations induced by a planet. precise chromospheric activitymeasurements are needed to estimate the activity-induced noise that should beexpected for a given star. aims: we obtain precise chromospheric activitymeasurements and projected rotational velocities for nearby (d &lt; 25 pc) cool(spectral types f to k) stars, to estimate their expected activity-relatedjitter. as a complementary objective, we attempt to obtain relationshipsbetween fluxes in different activity indicator lines, that permit atransformation of traditional activity indicators, i.e, caii h &amp; k lines, toothers that hold noteworthy advantages. methods: we used high resolution(~50000) echelle optical spectra. to determine the chromospheric emission ofthe stars in the sample, we used the spectral subtraction technique. rotationalvelocities were determined using the cross-correlation technique. to inferactivity-related radial velocity (rv) jitter, we used empirical relationshipsbetween this jitter and the r'_hk index. results: we measured chromosphericactivity, as given by different indicators throughout the optical spectra, andprojected rotational velocities for 371 nearby cool stars. we have builtempirical relationships among the most important chromospheric emission lines.finally, we used the measured chromospheric activity to estimate the expectedrv jitter for the active stars in the sample.

1007.1132	a spectroscopy study of nearby late-type stars, possible members of  stellar kinematic groups	nearby late-type stars are excellent targets for seeking young objects instellar associations and moving groups. the origin of these structures is stillmisunderstood, and lists of moving group members often change with time andalso from author to author. most members of these groups have been identifiedby means of kinematic criteria, leading to an important contamination ofprevious lists by old field stars. we attempt to identify unambiguous movinggroup members among a sample of nearby-late type stars by studying theirkinematics, lithium abundance, chromospheric activity, and other age-relatedproperties. high-resolution echelle spectra ($r \sim 57000$) of a sample ofnearby late-type stars are used to derive accurate radial velocities that arecombined with the precise hipparcos parallaxes and proper motions to computegalactic-spatial velocity components. stars are classified as possible membersof the classical moving groups according to their kinematics. the spectra arealso used to study several age-related properties for young late-type stars,i.e., the equivalent width of the lithium li~{\sc i} \space 6707.8 \space \aa\space line or the $r'_{\rm hk}$ index. additional information like x-rayfluxes from the rosat all-sky survey or the presence of debris discs is alsotaken into account. the different age estimators are compared and the movinggroup membership of the kinematically selected candidates are discussed. from atotal list of 405 nearby stars, 102 have been classified as moving groupcandidates according to their kinematics. i.e., only $\sim$ 25.2 \% of thesample. the number reduces when age estimates are considered, and only 26moving group candidates (25.5\% of the 102 candidates) have ages in agreementwith the star having the same age as an mg member

1105.0550	estimation of the xuv radiation onto close planets and their evaporation	context: the current distribution of planet mass vs. incident stellar x-rayflux supports the idea that photoevaporation of the atmosphere may take placein close-in planets. integrated effects have to be accounted for. a propercalculation of the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation requires to estimatethe total irradiation from the whole xuv range. aims: the purpose of this paperis to extend the analysis of the photoevaporation in planetary atmospheres fromthe accessible x-rays to the mostly unobserved euv range by using the coronalmodels of stars to calculate the euv contribution to the stellar spectra. themass evolution of planets can be traced assuming that thermal losses dominatethe mass loss of their atmospheres. methods: we determine coronal models for 82stars with exoplanets that have x-ray observations available. then a syntheticspectrum is produced for the whole xuv range (~1-912 {\aa}). the determinationof the euv stellar flux, calibrated with real euv data, allows us to calculatethe accumulated effects of the xuv irradiation on the planet atmosphere withtime, as well as the mass evolution for planets with known density. results: wecalibrate for the first time a relation of the euv luminosity with stellar agevalid for late-type stars. in a sample of 109 exoplanets, few planets withmasses larger than ~1.5 mj receive high xuv flux, suggesting that intensephotoevaporation takes place in a short period of time, as previously found inx-rays. the scenario is also consistent with the observed distribution ofplanet masses with density. the accumulated effects of photoevaporation overtime indicate that hd 209458b may have lost 0.2 mj since an age of 20 myr.conclusions: coronal radiation produces rapid photoevaporation of theatmospheres of planets close to young late-type stars. more complex models areneeded to explain fully the observations.

1202.5884	metallicity of solar-type stars with debris discs and planets	around 16% of the solar-like stars in our neighbourhood show ir-excesses dueto debris discs and a fraction of them are known to host planets. we aim todetermine in a homogeneous way the metallicity of a sample of stars with knowndebris discs and planets. our analysis includes the calculation of thefundamental stellar parameters by applying the iron ionisation equilibriumconditions to several isolated fe i and fe ii lines. the metallicitydistributions of the different stellar samples suggest that there is atransition toward higher metallicities from stars with neither debris discs norplanets to stars hosting giant planets. stars with debris discs and stars withneither debris nor planets follow a similar metallicity distribution, althoughthe distribution of the first ones might be shifted towards highermetallicities. stars with debris discs and planets have the same metallicitybehaviour as stars hosting planets, irrespective of whether the planets arelow-mass or gas giants. in the case of debris discs and giant planets, theplanets are usually cool, -semimajor axis larger than 0.1 au. the data alsosuggest that stars with debris discs and cool giant planets tend to have a lowdust luminosity, and are among the less luminous debris discs known. we alsofind evidence of an anticorrelation between the luminosity of the dust and theplanet eccentricity. our data show that the presence of planets, not the debrisdisc, correlates with the stellar metallicity. the results confirm thatcore-accretion models represent suitable scenarios for debris disc and planetformation. dynamical instabilities produced by eccentric giant planets couldexplain the suggested dust luminosity trends observed for stars with debrisdiscs and planets.

1205.4734	accretion-related properties of herbig ae/be stars. comparison with t  tauris	we look for trends relating the mass accretion rate (macc) and the stellarages (t), spectral energy distributions (seds), and disk masses (mdisk) for asample of 38 haebe stars, comparing them to analogous correlations found forclassical t tauri stars. our goal is to shed light on the timescale andphysical processes that drive evolution of intermediate-mass pre-main sequenceobjects.  macc shows a dissipation timescale \tau = 1.3^{+1.0}_{-0.5} myr from anexponential law fit, while a power law yields macc(t) \propto t^{-\eta}, with\eta = 1.8^{+1.4}_{-0.7}. this result is based on our whole haebe sample (1-6msun), but the accretion rate decline most probably depends on smaller stellarmass bins. the near-ir excess is higher and starts at shorter wavelengths (jand h bands) for the strongest accretors. active and passive disks are roughlydivided by 2 x 10^{-7} msun/yr. the mid-ir excess and the sed shape from themeeus et al. classification are not correlated with macc. we find macc \proptomdisk^{1.1 +- 0.3}. most stars in our sample with signs of inner dustdissipation typically show accretion rates ten times lower and disk massesthree times smaller than the remaining objects.  the trends relating macc with the near-ir excess and mdisk extend those for ttauri stars, and are consistent with viscous disk models. the differences inthe inner gas dissipation timescale, and the relative position of the starswith signs of inner dust clearing in the macc-mdisk plane, could be suggestinga slightly faster evolution, and that a different process - such asphotoevaporation - plays a more relevant role in dissipating disks in the haeberegime compared to t tauri stars. our conclusions must consider the mismatchbetween the disk mass estimates from mm fluxes and the disk mass estimates fromaccretion, which we also find in haebe stars.

1205.5722	a search for pre-substellar cores and proto-brown dwarf candidates in  taurus: multiwavelength analysis in the b213-l1495 clouds	in an attempt to study whether the formation of brown dwarfs (bds) takesplace as a scaled-down version of low-mass stars, we conducted iram30m/mambo-iiobservations at 1.2 mm in a sample of 12 proto-bd candidates selected fromspitzer/irac data in the b213-l1495 clouds in taurus. subsequent observationswith the cso at 350 micron, vla at 3.6 and 6 cm, and iram30m/emir in the12co(1-0), 13co(1-0), and n2h+(1-0) transitions were carried out toward the twomost promising spitzer/irac source(s), j042118 and j041757. j042118 isassociated with a compact (&lt;10 arcsec or &lt;1400 au) and faint source at 350micron, while j041757 is associated with a partially resolved (~16 arcsec or~2000 au) and stronger source emitting at centimetre wavelengths with a flatspectral index. the corresponding masses of the dust condensations are ~1 and~5 mjup for j042118 and j041757, respectively. in addition, about 40 arcsec tothe northeast of j041757 we detect a strong and extended submillimetre source,j041757-ne, which is not associated with nir/fir emission down to our detectionlimits, but is clearly detected in 13co and n2h+ at ~7 km/s, and for which weestimated a total mass of ~100 mjup, close to the mass required to begravitationally bound. in summary, our observational strategy has allowed us tofind in b213-l1495 two proto-bd candidates and one pre-substellar corecandidate, whose properties seem to be consistent with a scaled-down version oflow-mass stars.

1206.6358	herschel pacs observations and modeling of debris disks in the  tucana-horologium association	we present herschel pacs photometry of seventeen b- to m-type stars in the 30myr-old tucana-horologium association. this work is part of the herschel opentime key programme "gas in protoplanetary systems" (gasps). six of theseventeen targets were found to have infrared excesses significantly greaterthan the expected stellar ir fluxes, including a previously unknown disk aroundhd30051. these six debris disks were fitted with single-temperature blackbodymodels to estimate the temperatures and abundances of the dust in the systems.for the five stars that show excess emission in the herschel pacs photometryand also have spitzer irs spectra, we fit the data with models of opticallythin debris disks with realistic grain properties in order to better estimatethe disk parameters. the model is determined by a set of six parameters:surface density index, grain size distribution index, minimum and maximum grainsizes, and the inner and outer radii of the disk. the best fitting parametersgive us constraints on the geometry of the dust in these systems, as well aslower limits to the total dust masses. the hd105 disk was further constrainedby fitting marginally resolved pacs 70 micron imaging.

1303.3418	the metallicity signature of evolved stars with planets	we determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity and individual abundancesof a large sample of evolved stars, with and without known planetarycompanions. our methodology is based on the analysis of high-resolution echellespectra. the metallicity distributions show that giant stars hosting planetsare not preferentially metal-rich having similar abundance patterns to giantstars without known planetary companions. we have found, however, a very strongrelation between the metallicity distribution and the stellar mass within thissample. we show that the less massive giant stars with planets (m &lt; 1.5 msun)are not metal rich, but, the metallicity of the sample of massive (m &gt; 1.5msun), young (age &lt; 2 gyr) giant stars with planets is higher than that of asimilar sample of stars without planets. regarding other chemical elements,giant stars with and without planets in the mass domain m &lt; 1.5 msun showsimilar abundance patterns. however, planet and non-planet hosts with masses m&gt; 1.5 msun show differences in the abundances of some elements, specially na,co, and ni. in addition, we find the sample of subgiant stars with planets tobe metal rich showing similar metallicities to main-sequence planet hosts. thefact that giant planet hosts in the mass domain m &lt; 1.5 msun do not showmetal-enrichment is difficult to explain. given that these stars have similarstellar parameters to subgiants and main-sequence planet hosts, the lack of themetal-rich signature in low-mass giants could be explained if originated from apollution scenario in the main sequence that gets erased as the star becomefully convective. however, there is no physical reason why it should play arole for giants with masses m &lt; 1.5 msun but is not observed for giants with m&gt; 1.5 msun.

1305.2894	herschel observations of gas and dust in the unusual 49 ceti debris disk	we present far-ir/sub-mm imaging and spectroscopy of 49 ceti, an unusualcircumstellar disk around a nearby young a1v star. the system is famous forshowing the dust properties of a debris disk, but the gas properties of alow-mass protoplanetary disk. the data were acquired with the herschel spaceobservatory pacs and spire instruments, largely as part of the "gas inprotoplanetary systems" (gasps) open time key programme. disk dust emission isdetected in images at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 \mu m; 49 cet is significantlyextended in the 70 \mu m image, spatially resolving the outer dust disk for thefirst time. spectra covering small wavelength ranges centered on eight atomicand molecular emission lines were obtained, including [oi] 63 \mu m and [cii]158 \mu m. the cii line was detected at the 5\sigma\ level - the firstdetection of atomic emission from the disk. no other emission lines were seen,despite the fact that the oi line is the brightest one observed in herschelprotoplanetary disk spectra (meeus et al. 2012; dent et al. 2013). we presentan estimate of the amount of circumstellar atomic gas implied by the ciiemission. the new far-ir/sub-mm data fills in a large gap in the previousspectral energy distribution (sed) of 49 cet. a simple model of the new sedconfirms the two-component structure of the disk: warm inner dust and coldouter dust that produces most of the observed excess. finally, we discusspreliminary thermochemical modeling of the 49 cet gas/dust disk and ourattempts to match several observational results simultaneously. although we arenot yet successful in doing so, our investigations shed light on theevolutionary status of the 49 cet gas, which might not be primordial gas butrather secondary gas coming from comets.

1306.2855	herschel's "cold debris disks": background galaxies or quiescent rims of  planetary systems?	(abridged) infrared excesses associated with debris disk host stars detectedso far peak at wavelengths around ~100{\mu}m or shorter. however, six out of 31excess sources in the herschel otkp dunes have been seen to show significant -and in some cases extended - excess emission at 160{\mu}m, which is larger thanthe 100{\mu}m excess. this excess emission has been suggested to stem fromdebris disks colder than those known previously. using several methods, were-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated withunrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highlyunlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. fortrue disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the seds and the diskradii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as ablackbody. this requires the grains to be larger than ~100{\mu}m, regardless oftheir material composition. to explain the dearth of small grains, we exploreseveral conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of lowdynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. ourqualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two ofthese scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. we show that suchdisks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial sizedistribution. they should be composed of macroscopic solids larger thanmillimeters, but smaller than kilometers in size. thus planetesimal formation,at least in the outer regions of the systems, has stopped before "cometary" or"asteroidal" sizes were reached.

1312.5146	can eccentric debris disks be long-lived? a first numerical  investigation and application to $\zeta^2$ reticuli	imaging of debris disks has found evidence for both eccentric and offsetdisks. one hypothesis is that these provide evidence for massive perturbersthat sculpt the observed structures. one such disk was recently observed in thefar-ir by the herschel space observatory around $\zeta^2$ ret. in contrast withpreviously reported systems, the disk is significantly eccentric, and thesystem is gyr-old. we aim to investigate the long-term evolution of eccentricstructures in debris disks caused by a perturber on an eccentric orbit. bothanalytical predictions and numerical n-body simulations are used to investigatethe observable structures that could be produced by eccentric perturbers. thelong-term evolution of the disk geometry is examined, with particularapplication to the $\zeta^2$ ret system. in addition, synthetic images of thedisk are produced for comparison with herschel observations. we show that aneccentric companion can produce both the observed offsets and eccentric disks.such effects are not immediate and we characterise the timescale required forthe disk to develop to an eccentric state. for the case of $\zeta^2$ ret, weplace limits on the mass and orbit of the companion required to produce theobservations. synthetic images show that the pattern observed around $\zeta^2$ret can be produced by an eccentric disk seen close to edge-on, and allow us tobring additional constraints on the disk parameters of our model (disk flux,extent). we determine that eccentric planets or stellar companions can inducelong-lived eccentric structures in debris disks. observations of such eccentricstructures provide potential evidence of the presence of such a companion in aplanetary system. we consider the example of $\zeta^2$ ret, whose observedeccentric disk can be explained by a distant companion at tens of au, on aneccentric orbit ($e_p\gtrsim 0.3$).

1404.6144	collisional modelling of the debris disc around hip 17439	we present an analysis of the debris disc around the nearby k2 v star hip17439. in the context of the herschel dunes key programme the disc was observedand spatially resolved in the far-ir with the herschel pacs and spireinstruments. in a first model, ertel et al. (2014) assumed the size and radialdistribution of the circumstellar dust to be independent power laws. there, byexploring a very broad range of possible model parameters several scenarioscapable of explaining the observations were suggested. in this paper, weperform a follow-up in-depth collisional modelling of these scenarios trying tofurther distinguish between them. in our models we consider collisions, directradiation pressure, and drag forces, i.e. the actual physical processesoperating in debris discs. we find that all scenarios discussed in ertel et al.are physically sensible and can reproduce the observed sed along with the pacssurface brightness profiles reasonably well. in one model, the dust is producedbeyond 120au in a narrow planetesimal belt and is transported inwards bypoynting-robertson and stellar wind drag. a good agreement with the observedradial profiles would require stellar winds by about an order of magnitudestronger than the solar value, which is not supported, although not ruled out,by observations. another model consists of two spatially separated planetesimalbelts, a warm inner and a cold outer one. this scenario would probably implythe presence of planets clearing the gap between the two components. finally,we show qualitatively that the observations can be explained by assuming thedust is produced in a single, but broad planetesimal disc with a surfacedensity of solids rising outwards, as expected for an extended disc thatexperiences a natural inside-out collisional depletion. prospects ofdiscriminating between the competing scenarios by future observations arediscussed.

0803.1294	q1 eri: a solar-type star with a planet and a dust belt	only very few solar-type stars exhibiting an infrared excess and harbouringplanets are known to date. indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disksystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.consequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poorstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or thephysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias andselection effects. finding more examples would be very significant. theselected target, q1 eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess aplanet, q1 eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at iras wavelengths, but hadremained undetected in the millimeter regime. therefore, submm flux densitieswould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of theplanetary disk. consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1eri. the detected dust toward q1 eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable factthat the entire sed, from the ir to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a singletemperature blackbody function (60 k). this would imply that the emittingregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much largerthan the orbital distance of q1 eri b, and that the emitting particles areconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. however, the 870 micron source isextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 au. therefore, aphysically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 k),located at 300 au from the star and about 60 au wide. the minimum mass of 0.04mearth (3 mmoon) of 1 mm-size icy ring-particles is considerable, given thestellar age of about 1 gyr. these big grains form an inner edge at about 25 au,which may suggest the presence of an unseen outer planet (q1 eri c).

1408.5649	interpreting the extended emission around three nearby debris disc host  stars	cool debris discs are a relic of the planetesimal formation process aroundtheir host star, analogous to the solar system's edgeworth-kuiper belt. assuch, they can be used as a proxy to probe the origin and formation ofplanetary systems like our own. the herschel open time key programmes "dustaround nearby stars" (dunes) and "disc emission via a bias-free reconnaissancein the infrared/submillimetre" (debris) observed many nearby, sun-like stars atfar-infrared wavelengths seeking to detect and characterize the emission fromtheir circumstellar dust. excess emission attributable to the presence of dustwas identified from around $\sim$ 20% of stars. herschel's high angularresolution ($\sim$ 7" fwhm at 100 $\mu$m) provided the capacity for resolvingdebris belts around nearby stars with radial extents comparable to the solarsystem (50 to 100 au). as part of the dunes and debris surveys, we obtainedobservations of three debris disc stars, hip 22263 (hd 30495), hip 62207 (hd110897), and hip 72848 (hd 131511), at far-infrared wavelengths with theherschel pacs instrument. combining these new images and photometry withancilliary data from the literature, we undertook simultaneous multi-wavelengthmodelling of the discs' radial profiles and spectral energy distributions usingthree different methodologies: single annulus, modified black body, and aradiative transfer code. we present the first far-infrared spatially resolvedimages of these discs and new single-component debris disc models. wecharacterize the capacity of the models to reproduce the disc parameters basedon marginally resolved emission through analysis of two sets of simulatedsystems (based on the hip 22263 and hip 62207 data) with the noise levelstypical of the herschel images. we find that the input parameter values arerecovered well at noise levels attained in the observations presented here.

1411.7823	herschel -pacs observations of [oi] and h2o in cha ii	gas plays a major role in the dynamical evolution of protoplanetary discs.its coupling with the dust is the key to our understanding planetary formation.studying the gas content is therefore a crucial step towards understandingprotoplanetary discs evolution. such a study can be made through spectroscopicobservations of emission lines in the far-infrared, where some of the mostimportant gas coolants emit, such as the [oi] 3p1-3 p2 transition at 63.18microns. we aim at characterising the gas content of protoplanetary discs inthe intermediate-aged chamaeleon ii (cha ii) star forming region. we also aimat characterising the gaseous detection fractions within this age range, whichis an essential step tracing gas evolution with age in different star formingregions. we obtained herschel-pacs line scan spectroscopic observations at 63microns of 19 cha ii class i and ii stars. the observations were used to trace[oi] and o-h2o at 63 microns. the analysis of the spatial distribution of [oi],when extended, can be used to understand the origin of the emission. we havedetected [oi] emission toward seven out of the nineteen systems observed, ando-h2o emission at 63.32 microns in just one of them, sz 61. cha ii members showa correlation between [oi] line fluxes and the continuum at 70 microns, similarto what is observed in taurus. we analyse the extended [oi] emission towardsthe star dk cha and study its dynamical footprints in the pacs integral fieldunit (ifu). we conclude that there is a high velocity component from a jetcombined with a low velocity component with an origin that may be a combinationof disc, envelope and wind emission. the stacking of spectra of objects notdetected individually in [oi] leads to a marginal 2.6sigma detection that mayindicate the presence of gas just below our detection limits for some, if notall, of them.

1412.3923	alma observations of alpha centauri: first detection of main-sequence  stars at 3mm wavelength	the precise mechanisms that provide the non-radiative energy for heating thechromosphere and the corona of the sun and those of other stars constitute anactive field of research. by studying stellar chromospheres one aims atidentifying the relevant physical processes. defining the permittable extent ofthe parameter space can also serve as a template for the sun-as-a-star. earlierobservations with herschel and apex have revealed the temperature minimum ofalpha cen, but these were unable to spatially resolve the binary intoindividual components. with the data reported here, we aim at remedying thisshortcoming. furthermore, these earlier data were limited to the wavelengthregion between 100 and 870mu. in the present context, we intend to extend thespectral mapping to longer wavelengths, where the contrast between stellarphotospheric and chromospheric emission becomes increasingly evident. alma isparticularly suited to point sources, such as unresolved stars. alma providesthe means to achieve our objectives with both its high sensitivity of thecollecting area for the detection of weak signals and the high spatialresolving power of its adaptable interferometer for imaging close multiplestars. this is the first detection of main-sequence stars at a wavelength of3mm. furthermore, the individual components of the binary alpha cenab areclearly detected and spatially well resolved at all alma wavelengths. the highs/n of these data permit accurate determination of their relative flux ratios.the previously obtained flux ratio of 0.44, which was based on measurements inthe optical and at 70mu, is consistent with the present alma results, albeitwith a large error bar. given the distinct difference in their cyclic activity,the similarity of their submm seds appears surprising.

1501.03813	does the presence of planets affect the frequency and properties of  extrasolar kuiper belts? results from the herschel debris and dunes surveys	the study of the planet-debris disk connection can shed light on theformation and evolution of planetary systems, and may help predict the presenceof planets around stars with certain disk characteristics. in preliminaryanalyses of the herschel debris and dunes surveys, wyatt et al. (2012) andmarshall et al. (2014) identified a tentative correlation between debris andlow-mass planets. here we use the cleanest possible sample out these surveys toassess the presence of such a correlation, discarding stars without known ages,with ages &lt; 1 gyr and with binary companions &lt;100 au, to rule out possiblecorrelations due to effects other than planet presence. in our sample of 204fgk stars, we do not find evidence that debris disks are more common or moredusty around stars harboring high-mass or low-mass planets compared to acontrol sample without identified planets, nor that debris disks are more orless common (or more or less dusty) around stars harboring multiple planetscompared to single-planet systems. diverse dynamical histories may account forthe lack of correlations. the data show the correlation between the presence ofhigh-mass planets and stellar metallicity, but no correlation between thepresence of low-mass planets or debris and stellar metallicity. comparing theobserved cumulative distribution of fractional luminosity to those expectedfrom a gaussian distribution, we find that a distribution centered on the solarsystem's value fits well the data, while one centered at 10 times this valuecan be rejected. this is of interest in the context of future terrestrialplanet characterization because it indicates that there are good prospects forfinding a large number of debris disk systems (i.e. with evidence of harboringthe building blocks of planets) with exozodiacal emission low enough to beappropriate targets for an atlast-type mission to search for biosignatures.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1502.07100	searching for signatures of planet formation in stars with circumstellar  debris discs	(abridged) tentative correlations between the presence of dusty debris discsand low-mass planets have been presented. in parallel, detailed chemicalabundance studies have reported different trends between samples of planet andnon-planet hosts. we determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity, andabundances of a sample of 251 stars including stars with known debris discs,with debris discs and planets, and only with planets. stars with debris discsand planets have the same [fe/h] behaviour as stars hosting planets, and theyalso show a similar &lt;[x/fe]&gt;-tc trend. different behaviour in the &lt;[x/fe]&gt;-tctrend is found between the samples of stars without planets and the samples ofplanet hosts. in particular, when considering only refractory elements,negative slopes are shown in cool giant planet hosts, whilst positive ones areshown in stars hosting low-mass planets. stars hosting exclusively close-ingiant planets show higher metallicities and positive &lt;[x/fe]&gt;-tc slope. asearch for correlations between the &lt;[x/fe]&gt;-tc slopes and the stellarproperties reveals a moderate but significant correlation with the stellarradius and as well as a weak correlation with the stellar age. the fact thatstars with debris discs and stars with low-mass planets do not show neithermetal enhancement nor a different &lt;[x/fe]&gt;-tc trend might indicate acorrelation between the presence of debris discs and the presence of low-massplanets. we extend results from previous works which reported differences inthe &lt;[x/fe]&gt;-tc trends between planet hosts and non hosts. however, thesedifferences tend to be present only when the star hosts a cool distant planetand not in stars hosting exclusively low-mass planets.

(2012), we select the early stages of their run i, before stellarfeedback is initiated, with similar total mass and physical size as the serpenscore. we derive temperature and column density maps also from the simulations.the observed distribution of column densities of the filaments has beenanalysed first including and then masking the cores. the same analysis has beenperformed on the simulations as well. a radial network of filaments has beendetected in the serpens core. the analysed simulation shows a strikingmorphological resemblance to the observed structures. the column densitydistribution of simulated filaments without cores shows only a log-normaldistribution, while the observed filaments show a power-law tail. the power-lawtail becomes evident in the simulation if one focuses just on the columndensity distribution of the cores. in contrast, the observed cores show a flatdistribution. even though the simulated and observed filaments are subjectivelysimilar-looking, we find that they behave in very different ways. the simulatedfilaments are turbulence-dominated regions, the observed filaments are insteadself-gravitating structures that will probably fragment into cores.

astro-ph;0208322	a dynamical study of the circumstellar gas in ux orionis	we present the results of a high spectral resolution study of thecircumstellar (cs) gas around the intermediate mass, pre-main sequence star uxori. the results are based on a set of 10 echelle spectra, monitoring the staron time scales of months, days and hours. a large number of transientblueshifted and redshifted absorption features are detected in the balmer andin many metallic lines. a multigaussian fit is applied to determine for eachtransient absorption the velocity, v, dispersion velocity, delta v, and theparameter r, which provides a measure of the absorption strength of the cs gas.the time evolution of those parameters is presented and discussed. a comparisonof intensity ratios among the transient absorptions suggests a solar-likecomposition of the cs gas. this confirms previous results and excludes a verymetal-rich environment as the cause of the transient features in ux ori. thefeatures can be grouped by their similar velocities into 24 groups, of which 17are redshifted and 7 blueshifted. an analysis of the velocity of the groupsallows us to identify them as signatures of the dynamical evolution of 7 clumpsof gas, of which 4 represent accretion events and 3 outflow events. most of theevents decelerate at a rate of tenths of ms-2, while 2 events accelerate atapproximately the same rate; one event is seen experiencing both anacceleration and a deceleration phase and lasts for a period of few days. thistime scale seems to be the typical duration of outflowing and infalling eventsin ux ori. the dispersion velocity and the relative aborption strength of thefeatures do not show drastic changes during the lifetime of the events, whichsuggests they are gaseous blobs preserving their geometrical and physicalidentity.

astro-ph;0302178	isocam-cvf spectroscopy of the circumstellar environment of young  stellar objects	we present the results of a mid-infrared imaging spectroscopy survey of youngstellar objects (ysos) and their surrounding environment in four low-mass starformation regions: rcra, rho ophiuchi, serpens and chamaeleon i. this surveywas performed using isocam and its circular variable filters (cvf) and observed42 yso candidates. a number of spectral features were measured, most notablythe 9.7um silicate feature, the bending modes of both water and co2 ices at 6.0and 15.2um respectively and the well-known unidentified feature at 6.8um. thestrength of the unidentified feature was observed to correlate very well withthat of the water ice bending mode and far less strongly with the co2 icebending mode. this suggests, in a manner consistent with previous observations,that the carrier of the unidentified feature is a strongly polar ice.absorption profiles of the bending mode of co2 ice are observed to show asignificant long wavelength wing, which suggests that a significant fraction ofthe co2 ice observed exists in a polar (h2o-rich) phase. the sources observedin rcra, rho oph and serpens show similar spectral characteristics, whilst thesources observed in cha i are somewhat anomalous. however this is consistentwith previous studies of this region of the cha i cloud, which contains anunusual cluster of ysos. we detect an apparent under-abundance of water icetowards the sources in rho oph. this may be indicative of differences inchemical composition between the different clouds, or may be due toevaporation. finally the co2:h2o ice ratios observed towards the sources in rhooph show significantly greater scatter than in the other regions, possibly dueto varying local conditions around the ysos in rho oph.
