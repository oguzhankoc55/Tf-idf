0901.2127	protostellar disks formed from rigidly rotating cores	abridged: we use three-dimensional sph simulations to investigate thecollapse of low-mass prestellar cores and the formation and early evolution ofprotostellar discs. the initial conditions are slightly supercriticalbonnor-ebert spheres in rigid rotation. the core mass and initial radius areheld fixed at m_o=6.1 m_sun and r_o=17,000 au, and the only parameter that wevary is the initial angular speed \omega_o. protostellar discs forming fromcores with \omega_o&lt;1.35 10d-13 1/s have radii between 100 and 300 au and arequite centrally concentrated; due to heating by gas infall onto the disc andaccretion onto the central object, they are also quite warm, t&gt;100 k, andtherefore stable against gravitational fragmentation. in contrast, more rapidlyrotating cores form discs which are less concentrated and cooler, and haveradii between 400 and 1000 au; as a consequence they are prone to gravitationalfragmentation and the formation of multiple systems. we derive a criterion thatpredicts whether a rigidly rotating core having given m_o, r_o and \omega_owill produce a protostellar disc which fragments whilst material is stillinfalling from the core envelope. we then apply this criterion to core samplesfor which m_o, r_o and \omega_o have been estimated observationally. weconclude that the observed cores are stable against fragmentation at thisstage, due to their low angular speeds and the heat delivered at the accretionshock where the infalling material hits the disc.

0902.4701	the sins survey: modeling the dynamics of z~2 galaxies and the high-z  tully-fisher relation	we present the modeling of sinfoni integral field dynamics of 18 star forminggalaxies at z ~ 2 from halpha line emission. the galaxies are selected from thelarger sample of the sins survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotationalmotions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. the quality ofthe data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated byrotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitableexponential disk models. we obtain a good correlation between the dynamicalmass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions mgas~m*) arerequired to explain the difference between the two quantities. we use thederived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity vmax from the modeling toconstruct for the first time the stellar mass tully-fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.the relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lowerredshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. we find that at z ~ 2.2there is an offset in log(m*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11with respect to the local universe. this result is consistent with thepredictions of the latest n-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formationand evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filamentsand cooling flows. this scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidencefrom sins, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce theobserved properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.

0905.0351	magnetic field structure due to the global velocity field in spiral  galaxies	we present a set of global, self-consistent n-body/sph simulations of thedynamic evolution of galactic discs with gas and including magnetic fields. wehave implemented a description to follow the evolution of magnetic fields withthe ideal induction equation in the sph part of the vine code. results from adirect implementation of the field equations are compared to a representationby euler potentials, which pose a div(b)-free description, an constraint notfulfilled for the direct implementation. all simulations are compared to animplementation of magnetic fields in the gadget code which includes alsocleaning methods for div(b).  starting with a homogeneous seed field we find that by differential rotationand spiral structure formation of the disc the field is amplified by one orderof magnitude within five rotation periods of the disc. the amplification isstronger for higher numerical resolution. moreover, we find a tight connectionof the magnetic field structure to the density pattern of the galaxy in oursimulations, with the magnetic field lines being aligned with the developingspiral pattern of the gas. our simulations clearly show the importance ofnon-axisymmetry for the evolution of the magnetic field.

0907.4777	high-redshift star-forming galaxies: angular momentum and baryon  fraction, turbulent pressure effects and the origin of turbulence	the structure of a sample of high-redshift (z=2), rotating galaxies with highstar formation rates and turbulent gas velocities of sigma=40-80 km/s isinvestigated. fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with amo, mao, white (1998) (mmw) model requires unusually large disk spin parameterslambda_d&gt;0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmicbaryon fraction. the galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with1&lt;vmax/sigma&lt;3, maximum rotational velocities vmax&lt;200 km/s and disk half-lightradii rd=1-3 kpc and rotation-dominated systems with vmax&gt;200 km/s,vmax/sigma&gt;3 and rd=4-8 kpc. for the dispersion-dominated sample, radialpressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing therotational velocities. including this pressure effect in the mmw model,dispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lflambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and withlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05. these values are in good agreement withcosmological expectations. for the rotation-dominated sample however pressureeffects are small and better agreement with theoretically expected disk spinparameters can only be achieved if the dark halo mass contribution in thevisible disk regime (2-3*rd) is smaller than predicted by the mmw model. weargue that these galaxies can still be embedded in standard cold dark matterhalos if the halos did not contract adiabatically in response to diskformation. it is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of thegalaxies are consistent with a toomre instability parameter q=1 which is equalto the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be themajor driver of turbulence. the dominant energy source of turbulence is thenthe potential energy of the gas in the disk.

0908.2599	substructures formation induced by gravitational tides?	physics lectures always refer to the tides as a disruptive effect. however,tides can also be compressive. when the potential of two galaxies overlap, ashappens during a merger, fully compressive tides can develop and have a strongimpact on the dynamics of substructures such as star clusters or tidal dwarfgalaxies. using n-body simulations of a large set of mergers, we noticed theimportance of these tidal modes at cluster scale. with a model of the antennaegalaxies, we conclude that the positions and timescales of these tidal modesmatch the actual distribution of young clusters. a detailed study of thestatistics of the compressive tides shows a stunning correlation between thispurely gravitational effect and the observed properties of the star clusters.in this contribution, we introduce the concept of compressive tide and show itsrelevance in the special case of the antennae galaxies. we extend ourconclusions to a broad range of parameters and discuss their implications onseveral critical points such as the infant mortality, multiple star formationepochs in clusters or the age distribution.

0911.3327	simulating magnetic fields in the antennae galaxies	we present self-consistent high-resolution simulations of ngc4038/4039 (the"antennae galaxies") including star formation, supernova feedback and magneticfields performed with the n-body/sph code gadget, in which magnetohydrodynamicsare followed with the sph method. we vary the initial magnetic field in theprogenitor disks from 1 ng to 100 mug. at the time of the best match with thecentral region of the antennae system the magnetic field has been amplified bycompression and shear flows to an equilibrium field of approximately 10 mug,independent of the initial seed field. these simulations are a proof of theprinciple that galaxy mergers are efficient drivers for the cosmic evolution ofmagnetic fields. we present a detailed analysis of the magnetic field structurein the central overlap region. simulated radio and polarization maps are ingood morphological and quantitative agreement with the observations. inparticular, the two cores with the highest synchrotron intensity and ridges ofregular magnetic fields between the cores and at the root of the southern tidalarm develop naturally in our simulations. this indicates that the simulationsare capable of realistically following the evolution of the magnetic fields ina highly non-linear environment. we also discuss the relevance of theamplification effect for present day magnetic fields in the context ofhierarchical structure formation.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1004.4003	formation of slowly rotating early-type galaxies via major mergers: a  resolution study	we study resolution effects in numerical simulations of gas-rich and gas-poormajor mergers, and show that the formation of slowly-rotating ellipticalgalaxies often requires a resolution that is beyond the present-day standardsto be properly modelled. our sample of equal-mass merger models encompassesvarious masses and spatial resolutions, ranging from about 200pc and 10^5particles per component, typical of some recently published major mergersimulations, to up to 32pc and 10^3 m_sun in simulations using 2.4 x 10^7collisionless particles and 1.2 x 10^7 gas particles, among the highestresolutions reached so far for gas-rich major merger of massive disc galaxies.we find that the formation of fast-rotating early-type galaxies, that areflattened by a significant residual rotation, is overall correctly reproducedat all such resolutions. however, the formation of slow-rotating early-typegalaxies, which have a low residual angular momentum and are supported mostlyby anisotropic velocity dispersions, is strongly resolution-dependent. theevacuation of angular momentum from the main stellar body is largely missed atstandard resolution, and systems that should be slow rotators are then found tobe fast rotators. the effect is most important for gas-rich mergers, but isalso witnessed in mergers with an absent or modest gas component. the effect isrobust with respect to our initial conditions and interaction orbits, andoriginates in the physical treatment of the relaxation process during thecoalescence of the galaxies. our findings show that a high-enough resolution isrequired to accurately model the global properties of merger remnants and theevolution of their angular momentum. the role of gas-rich mergers of spiralgalaxies in the formation of slow-rotating ellipticals may therefore have beenunderestimated.

1005.2100	on the evolution of the intrinsic scatter in black hole versus galaxy  mass relations	we present results on the evolution of the intrinsic scatter of black holemasses considering different implementations of a model in which black holesonly grow via mergers. we demonstrate how merger driven growth affects thecorrelations between black hole mass and host bulge mass. the simple case of aninitially log-normal distributed scatter in black hole and bulge massescombined with random merging within the galaxy population results in adecreasing scatter with merging generation/number as predicted by thecentral-limit theorem. in general we find that the decrease in scatter {\sigma}is well approximated by {\sigma}merg(m) = {\sigma}ini \times (m + 1)^(-a/2)with a = 0.42 for a range of mean number of mergers m &lt; 50. for a large meannumber of mergers (m &gt; 100) we find a convergence to a = 0.61. this is validfor a wide range of different initial distributions, refill-scenarios or mergermass-ratios. growth scenarios based on halo merger trees of a (100 mpc)^3 darkmatter lambdacdm-simulation show a similar behaviour with a scatter decrease ofa = 0.30 with typical number of mergers m &lt; 50 consistent with random merging(best matching model: a = 0.34). assuming a present day scatter of 0.3 dex inblack hole mass and a mean number of mergers not exceeding m = 50 our resultsimply a scatter of 0.6 dex at z = 3 and thus a possible scenario in whichovermassive (and undermassive) black holes at high redshift are a consequenceof a larger intrinsic scatter in black hole mass. a simple toy model connectingthe growth of black holes to the growth of lambdacdm dark matter halos viamergers, neglecting any contribution from accretion, yields a consistent m\cdot-mbulge relation at z = 0 - if we assume the correct initial relation.

0708.2205	axisymmetric orbit models of n-body merger remnants: a dependency of  reconstructed mass on viewing angle	we model mock observations of collisionless n-body disc-disc mergers with anaxisymmetric orbit superposition program that has been used to model comaellipticals. the remnants sample representatively the shapes of disc-discmergers including prolate, triaxial and oblate objects. the aim is to betterunderstand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed massesand stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric,whether it leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised inmodels of real galaxies. the mass recovery at the half-light radius depends onviewing-angle and intrinsic shape: edge-on views allow to reconstruct totalmasses with an accuracy between 20% (triaxial/prolate remnants) and 3% (oblateremnant). masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by upto 50%. deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants arestrongly triaxial or prolate. luminous m/l are sensitive to box orbits in theremnants. box orbits cause the central kinematics to vary with viewing-angle.reconstructed luminous m/l and central masses follow this variation. luminousm/l are always underestimated (up to a factor of 2.5). respective dark halos inthe models can be overestimated by about the same amount, depending again onviewing angle. reconstructed velocity anisotropies depend on viewing angle andon the orbital composition of the remnant. we construct n-body realisations ofthe schwarzschild models to discuss chaotic orbits and the virial equilibriumin our models. apparently flattened, rotating ellipticals of intermediate massare likely close to both, axial symmetry and edge-on orientation. our resultsimply that schwarzschild models allow a reconstruction of their masses andstellar anisotropies with high accuracy.

1009.6005	the effects of x-ray and uv background radiation on the low-mass slope  of the galaxy mass function	even though the dark-matter power spectrum in the absence of biasing predictsa number density of halos n(m) ~ m^-2 (i.e. a schechter alpha value of -2) atthe low-mass end (m &lt; 10^10 m_solar), hydrodynamic simulations have typicallyproduced values for stellar systems in good agreement with the observed valuealpha ~ -1. we explain this with a simple physical argument and show that anefficient external gas-heating mechanism (such as the uv background included inall hydro codes) will produce a critical halo mass below which halos cannotretain their gas and form stars. we test this conclusion with gadget-2-basedsimulations using various uv backgrounds, and for the first time we alsoinvestigate the effect of an x-ray background. we show that at the presentepoch alpha is depends primarily on the mean gas temperature at thestar-formation epoch for low-mass systems (z &lt;~ 3): with no background we findalpha ~ -1.5, with uv only alpha ~ -1.0, and with uv and x-rays alpha ~ -0.75.we find the critical final halo mass for star formation to be ~4x10^8 m_solarwith a uv background and ~7x10^8 m_solar with uv and x-rays.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

1011.5735	galactic m\'enage \`a trois: simulating magnetic fields in colliding  galaxies	we present high resolution simulations of a multiple merger of three diskgalaxies including the evolution of magnetic fields performed with then-body/sph code gadget. for the first time, we embed the galaxies in amagnetized, low-density medium, thus modeling an ambient igm. the simulationsinclude radiative cooling and a model for star formation and supernovafeedback. the progenitor disks have initial magnetic seed fields in the rangeof 10e-9 to 10e-6 g and the igm has initial fields of 10e-12 to 10e-9 g. thesimulations are compared to a run excluding magnetic fields. we show that thepropagation of interaction-driven shocks depends significantly on the initialmagnetic field strength. the shocks propagate faster in simulations withstronger initial field, suggesting that the shocks are supported by magneticpressure. the mach numbers of the shocks range from approximately m=1.5 for thenon-magnetized case up to m=6 for the highest initial magnetization, resultingin higher temperatures of the shock heated igm gas. the magnetic field in thesystem saturates rapidly after the mergers at ~ 10e-6 g within the galaxies and~ 10e-8 g in the igm independent of the initial value. these field strengthsagree with observed values and correspond to the equipartition value of themagnetic pressure with the turbulent pressure in the system. we also presentsynthetic radio and polarization maps for different phases of the evolutionshowing that shocks driven by the interaction produce a high amount ofpolarized emission. these idealized simulations indicate that magnetic fieldsplay an important role for the hydrodynamics of the igm during galacticinteractions. we also show that even weak seed fields are efficientlystrengthened during multiple galactic mergers. this interaction drivenamplification might have been a key process for the magnetization of theuniverse.

1102.0911	investigating the merger origin of early-type galaxies using ultra-deep  optical images	the mass assembly of galaxies leaves various imprints on their surroundings,such as shells, streams and tidal tails. the frequency and properties of thesefine structures depend on the mechanism driving the mass assembly: e.g. amonolithic collapse, rapid cold-gas accretion followed by violent diskinstabilities, minor mergers or major dry / wet mergers. therefore, by studyingthe outskirts of galaxies, one can learn about their main formation mechanism.i present here our on-going work to characterize the outskirts of early-typegalaxies (etgs), which are powerful probes at low redshift of the hierarchicalmass assembly of galaxies. this work relies on ultra-deep optical imagesobtained at cfht with the wide-field of view megacam camera of field andcluster etgs obtained as part of the atlas-3d and ngvs projects. state of theart numerical simulations are used to interpret the data. the images reveal awealth of unknown faint structures at levels as faint as 29 mag arcsec-2 in theg-band. initial results for two galaxies are presented here.

1102.1922	molecular gas and star formation in local early-type galaxies	the molecular gas content of local early-type galaxies is constrained anddiscussed in relation to their evolution. first, as part of the atlas3d survey,we present the first complete, large (260 objects), volume-limited single-dishsurvey of co in normal local early-type galaxies. we find a surprisingly highdetection rate of 22%, independent of luminosity and at best weakly dependenton environment. second, the extent of the molecular gas is constrained with cosynthesis imaging, and a variety of morphologies is revealed. the kinematics ofthe molecular gas and stars are often misaligned, implying an external gasorigin in over a third of the systems, although this behaviour is drasticallydiffferent between field and cluster environments. third, many objects appearto be in the process of forming regular kpc-size decoupled disks, and a starformation sequence can be sketched by piecing together multi-wavelengthinformation on the molecular gas, current star formation, and young stars.last, early-type galaxies do not seem to systematically obey all our usualprejudices regarding star formation, following the standard schmidt-kennicuttlaw but not the far infrared-radio correlation. this may suggest a greaterdiversity in star formation processes than observed in disk galaxies. usingmultiple molecular tracers, we are thus starting to probe the physicalconditions of the cold gas in early-types.

1104.1626	galaxy formation in semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic  zoom simulations	we present a detailed comparison between numerical cosmological hydrodynamiczoom simulations and semi-analytic models (sams) run within merger treesextracted from the simulations. the high-resolution simulations represent 48individual halos with virial masses in the range 2.4*10^11m_sun &lt; m_halo &lt;3.3*10^13m_sun. they include radiative h &amp; he cooling, photo-ionization, starformation and thermal sn feedback. we compare with different sam versionsincluding only this complement of physical processes, and also ones includingsupernova driven winds, metal cooling, and feedback from agn. our analysis isfocused on the cosmic evolution of the baryon content in galaxies and itsdivision into various components (stars, cold gas, and hot gas). both the samsand simulations are compared with observational relations between halo mass andstellar mass, and between stellar mass and star formation rate, at low and highredshift. the simulations turn out to have much higher star formationefficiencies (by about a factor of ten) than the sams. therefore the cold gasis consumed much more rapidly in the simulations and stars form much earlier.also, simulations show a transition between stellar mass growth that isdominated by in situ formation of stars to growth that is predominantly throughaccretion of stars formed in external galaxies. in sams, stellar growth isalways dominated by in situ star formation. in addition, sams overpredict theoverall gas accretion rates relative to the simulations, and overestimate thefraction of "hot" relative to "cold" accretion. we discuss the reasons forthese discrepancies, and identify several physical processes that are missingin our sam. we also highlight physical processes that are neglected in thesimulations studied here, but which appear to be crucial in order to understandthe properties of real galaxies.

1106.2098	the metallicity dependence of the co {\rightarrow} h_2 conversion factor  in z&gt;1 star forming galaxies	we use the first systematic samples of co millimeter emission in z&gt;1'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (sfgs) to study the metallicitydependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}co, from co line luminosity tomolecular gas mass. the molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio ofthe star formation rate (sfr) to co luminosity, is ~1 gyr-1 for near-solarmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above m_s~1e11 m_sun. in this regimethe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as afunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. belowm_s the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. we arguethat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physicalparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamentalmetallicity-sfr-stellar mass relation. a more probable explanation is that theconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in'co-dark' gas. the trend is also expected theoretically from the effect ofenhanced photodissociation of co by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.from the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of thelog({\alpha}co) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairlyinsensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formationactivity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas massesestimated from co luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward forgalaxies below m_s.

1204.0465	testing a simple recipe for estimating galaxy masses from minimal  observational data	the accuracy and robustness of a simple method to estimate the total massprofile of a galaxy is tested using a sample of 65 cosmologicalzoom-simulations of individual galaxies. the method only requires informationon the optical surface brightness and the projected velocity dispersionprofiles and therefore can be applied even in case of poor observational data.in the simulated sample massive galaxies ($\sigma \simeq 200-400$ $\kms$) atredshift $z=0$ have almost isothermal rotation curves for broad range of radii(rms $\simeq 5%$ for the circular speed deviations from a constant value over$0.5r_{\rm eff} &lt; r &lt; 3r_{\rm eff}$). for such galaxies the method recovers theunbiased value of the circular speed. the sample averaged deviation from thetrue circular speed is less than $\sim 1%$ with the scatter of $\simeq 5-8%$(rms) up to $r \simeq 5r_{\rm eff}$. circular speed estimates of massivenon-rotating simulated galaxies at higher redshifts ($z=1$ and $z=2$) are alsoalmost unbiased and with the same scatter. for the least massive galaxies inthe sample ($\sigma &lt; 150$ $\kms$) at $z=0$ the rms deviation is $\simeq 7-9%$and the mean deviation is biased low by about $1-2%$. we also derive thecircular velocity profile from the hydrostatic equilibrium (he) equation forhot gas in the simulated galaxies. the accuracy of this estimate is about rms$\simeq 4-5%$ for massive objects ($m &gt; 6.5\times 10^{12} m_\odot$) and the heestimate is biased low by $\simeq 3-4%$, which can be traced to the presence ofgas motions. this implies that the simple mass estimate can be used todetermine the mass of observed massive elliptical galaxies to an accuracy of$5-8 %$ and can be very useful for galaxy surveys.

1301.0628	towards a resolved kennicutt-schmidt law at high redshift	massive galaxies in the distant universe form stars at much higher rates thantoday. although direct resolution of the star forming regions of these galaxiesis still a challenge, recent molecular gas observations at the iram plateau debure interferometer enable us to study the star formation efficiency onsubgalactic scales around redshift z = 1.2. we present a method for obtainingthe gas and star formation rate (sfr) surface densities of ensembles of clumpscomposing galaxies at this redshift, even though the corresponding scales arenot resolved. this method is based on identifying these structures inposition-velocity diagrams corresponding to slices within the galaxies. we useunique iram observations of the co(3-2) rotational line and deep2 spectra offour massive star forming distant galaxies - egs13003805, egs13004291,egs12007881, and egs13019128 in the aegis terminology - to determine the gasand sfr surface densities of the identifiable ensembles of clumps thatconstitute them. the integrated co line luminosity is assumed to be directlyproportional to the total gas mass, and the sfr is deduced from the [oii] line.we identify the ensembles of clumps with the angular resolution available inboth co and [oii] spectroscopy; i.e., 1-1.5". sfr and gas surface densities areaveraged in areas of this size, which is also the thickness of the deep2 slitsand of the extracted iram slices, and we derive a spatially resolvedkennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on a scale of ~8 kpc. the data generallyindicates an average depletion time of 1.9 gyr, but with significant variationsfrom point to point within the galaxies.

1305.0828	constrained simulations of the antennae galaxies: comparison with  herschel-pacs observations	we present a set of hydro-dynamical numerical simulations of the antennaegalaxies in order to understand the origin of the central overlap starburst.our dynamical model provides a good match to the observed nuclear and overlapstar formation, especially when using a range of rather inefficient stellarfeedback efficiencies (0.01 &lt; q_eos &lt; 0.1). in this case a simple conversion oflocal star formation to molecular hydrogen surface density motivated byobservations accounts well for the observed distribution of co. using radiativetransfer post-processing we model synthetic far-infrared spectral energydistributions (seds) and two-dimensional emission maps for direct comparisonwith herschel-pacs observations. for a gas-to-dust ratio of 62:1 and the bestmatching range of stellar feedback efficiencies the synthetic far-infrared sedsof the central star forming region peak at values of ~65 - 81 jy at 99 - 116um, similar to a three-component modified black body fit to infraredobservations. also the spatial distribution of the far-infrared emission at 70um, 100 um, and 160 um compares well with the observations: &gt;50% (&gt; 35%) of theemission in each band is concentrated in the overlap region while only &lt; 30% (&lt;15%) is distributed to the combined emission from the two galactic nuclei inthe simulations (observations). as a proof of principle we show that parametervariations in the feedback model result in unambiguous changes both in theglobal and in the spatially resolved observable far-infrared properties ofantennae galaxy models. our results strengthen the importance of direct,spatially resolved comparative studies of matched galaxy merger simulations asa valuable tool to constrain the fundamental star formation and feedbackphysics.

0801.1232	the milky way's circular velocity curve to 60 kpc and an estimate of the  dark matter halo mass from kinematics of ~2400 sdss blue horizontal branch  stars	we derive new constraints on the mass of the milky way's dark matter halo,based on a set of halo stars from sdss as kinematic tracers. our samplecomprises 2401 rigorously selected blue horizontal-branch (bhb) halo starsdrawn from sdss dr-6. to interpret these distributions, we compare them tomatched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxyformation simulations designed to resemble the milky way, which we presume tohave an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. we then determine whichvalue of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$ brings the observed distribution into agreement withthe corresponding distributions from the simulations. this procedure results inan estimate of the milky way's circular velocity curve to $\sim 60$ kpc, whichis found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of $\rm 220 km s^{-1}$at the sun's location, and implies m$(&lt;60 \rm kpc) = 4.0\pm 0.7\times10^{11}$m$_\odot$. the radial dependence of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$, derived instatistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectationsfrom an nfw dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components atits center. if we assume an nfw halo profile of characteristic concentrationholds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the milkyway's dark matter halo, m$_{\rm vir}=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times10^{12}$m$_\odot$, which is lower than many previous estimates. this estimateimplies that nearly 40% of the baryons within the virial radius of the milkyway's dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our galaxy. a valuefor m$_{\rm vir}$ of only $\sim 1\times10^{12}$m$_\odot$ also (re-)opens thequestion of whether all of the milky way's satellite galaxies are on boundorbits.

1306.6676	nebular excitation in z~2 star-forming galaxies from the sins and luci  surveys: the influence of shocks and agn	based on high-resolution, spatially resolved data of 10 z~2 star-forminggalaxies from the sins/zc-sinf survey and luci data for 12 additional galaxies,we probe the excitation properties of high-z galaxies and the impact of activegalactic nuclei (agn), shocks and photoionization. we explore how thesespatially-resolved line ratios can inform our interpretation of integratedemission line ratios obtained at high redshift. many of our galaxies fall inthe `composite' region of the z~0 [nii]/ha versus [oiii]/hb diagnostic (bpt)diagram, between star-forming galaxies and those with agn. based on ourresolved measurements, we find that some of these galaxies likely host an agn,while others appear to be affected by the presence of shocks possibly caused byan outflow or from enhanced ionization parameter as compared with hii regionsin normal local star-forming galaxies. we find that the mass-excitation (mex)diagnostic, which separates purely star-forming and agn hosting local galaxiesin the [oiii]/hb versus stellar mass plane, does not properly separate z~2galaxies classified according to the bpt diagram. however, if we shift thegalaxies based on the offset between the local and z~2 mass-metallicityrelation (i.e. to the mass they would have at z~0 with the same metallicity),we find better agreement between the mex and bpt diagnostics. finally, we findthat metallicity calibrations based on [nii]/ha are more biased by shocks andagn at high-z than the [oiii]/hb/[nii]/ha calibration.

1311.0284	the atlas$^{\rm{3d}}$ project - xxv: two-dimensional kinematic analysis  of simulated galaxies and the cosmological origin of fast and slow rotators	we present a detailed two-dimensional stellar dynamical analysis of a sampleof 44 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of individual central galaxiesand their satellites. kinematic maps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity,velocity dispersion, and higher-order gauss-hermite moments $h_3$ and $h_4$ areconstructed for each central galaxy and for the most massive satellites. theamount of rotation is quantified using the $\lambda_{\mathrm{r}}$-parameter.the velocity, velocity dispersion, $h_3$, and $h_4$ fields of the simulatedgalaxies show a diversity similar to observed kinematic maps of early-typegalaxies in the atlas$^{\rm{3d}}$ survey. this includes fast (regular), slow,and misaligned rotation, hot spheroids with embedded cold disk components aswell as galaxies with counter-rotating cores or central depressions in thevelocity dispersion. we link the present day kinematic properties to theindividual cosmological formation histories of the galaxies. in general, majorgalaxy mergers have a significant influence on the rotation propertiesresulting in both a spin-down as well as a spin-up of the merger remnant. lowermass galaxies with significant in-situ formation of stars, or with additionalgas-rich major mergers - resulting in a spin-up - in their formation history,form elongated fast rotators with a clear anti-correlation of $h_3$ and$v/\sigma$. an additional formation path for fast rotators includes gas poormajor mergers leading to a spin-up of the remnants. this formation path doesnot result in anti-correlated $h_3$ and $v/\sigma$. the galaxies mostconsistent with the rare class of non-rotating round early-type galaxies growby gas-poor minor mergers alone. in general, more massive galaxies have lessin-situ star formation since $z \sim 2$, rotate slower and have older stellarpopulations.

1311.2596	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for powerful  agn-driven nuclear outflows in massive star-forming galaxies	we report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive (&gt;10^11 msun) z~2 star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which are plausibly driven by anactive galactic nucleus (agn). the sample consists of the eight most massivesfgs from our sins/zc-sinf survey of galaxy kinematics with the imagingspectrometer sinfoni, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptiveoptics (ao) assisted observations. all of the objects are disks hosting asignificant stellar bulge. the spectra in their central regions exhibit a broadcomponent in halpha and forbidden [nii] and [sii] line emission, with typicalvelocity fwhm ~ 1500 km/s, [nii]/halpha ratio ~ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2- 3 kpc. these properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflowsassociated with type 2 agn, the presence of which is confirmed via independentdiagnostics in half the galaxies. the data imply a median ionized gas massoutflow rate of ~ 60 msun/yr and mass loading of ~ 3. at larger radii, a weakerbroad component is detected but with lower fwhm ~ 485 km/s and [nii]/halpha ~0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in thelower-mass sins/zc-sinf galaxies. the high inferred mass outflow rates andfrequent occurrence suggest the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out ofthe centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles, and may thus contribute tothe process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. larger samples athigh masses will be crucial to confirm the importance and energetics of thenuclear outflow phenomenon, and its connection to agn activity and bulgegrowth.

0802.0879	kinemetry of sins high-redshift star-forming galaxies: distinguishing  rotating disks from major mergers	we present a simple set of kinematic criteria that can distinguish betweengalaxies dominated by ordered rotational motion and those involved in majormerger events. our criteria are based on the dynamics of the warm ionized gas(as traced by h-alpha) within galaxies, making this analysis accessible tohigh-redshift systems, whose kinematics are primarily traceable throughemission features. using the method of kinemetry (developed by krajnovic andco-workers), we quantify asymmetries in both the velocity and velocitydispersion maps of the warm gas, and the resulting criteria enable us toempirically differentiate between non-merging and merging systems at highredshift. we apply these criteria to 11 of our best-studied rest-frameuv/optical-selected z~2 galaxies for which we have near infrared integral fieldspectroscopic data from sinfoni on the vlt. of these 11 systems, we find that&gt;50% have kinematics consistent with a single rotating disk interpretation,while the remaining systems are more likely undergoing major mergers. thisresult, combined with the short formation timescales of these systems, providesevidence that rapid, smooth accretion of gas plays a significant role in galaxyformation at high redshift.

1312.6318	the atlas3d project -- xxvii. cold gas and the colours and ages of  early-type galaxies	we present a study of the cold gas contents of the atlas3d early-typegalaxies, in the context of their optical colours, near-uv colours, and h\beta\absorption line strengths. early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies arenot as gas-poor as previously thought, and at least 40% of local early-typegalaxies are now known to contain molecular and/or atomic gas. this cold gasoffers the opportunity to study recent galaxy evolution through the processesof cold gas acquisition, consumption (star formation), and removal. molecularand atomic gas detection rates range from 10% to 34% in red sequence early-typegalaxies, depending on how the red sequence is defined, and from 50% to 70% inblue early-type galaxies. notably, massive red sequence early-type galaxies(stellar masses &gt; 5e10 msun, derived from dynamical models) are found to havehi masses up to m(hi)/mstar ~ 0.06 and h_2 masses up to m(h$_2$)/mstar ~ 0.01.some 20% of all massive early-type galaxies may have retained atomic and/ormolecular gas through their transition to the red sequence. however, kinematicand metallicity signatures of external gas accretion (either from satellitegalaxies or the intergalactic medium) are also common, particularly at stellarmasses &lt;= 5e10 msun, where such signatures are found in ~ 50% of h$_2$-richearly-type galaxies. our data are thus consistent with a scenario in which fastrotator early-type galaxies are quenched former spiral galaxies which haveundergone some bulge growth processes, and in addition, some of them alsoexperience cold gas accretion which can initiate a period of modest starformation activity. we discuss implications for the interpretation ofcolour-magnitude diagrams.

1406.0183	evidence for wide-spread agn driven outflows in the most massive z~1-2  star forming galaxies	in this paper we follow up on our previous detection of nuclear ionizedoutflows in the most massive (log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) z~1-3 star-forming galaxies(forster schreiber et al.), by increasing the sample size by a factor of six(to 44 galaxies above log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) from a combination of thesins/zc-sinf, luci, gnirs, and kmos^3d spectroscopic surveys. we find a fairlysharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (fwhm in the ha, [nii],and [sii] lines ~ 450-5300 km/s), with large [nii]/ha ratios, abovelog(m*/msun) ~ 10.9, with about two thirds of the galaxies in this mass rangeexhibiting this component. broad nuclear components near and above theschechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, and at z~1 and ~2. the line ratios of the nuclearcomponent are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (agn), or by acombination of shocks and photoionization. the incidence of the most massivegalaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of agnsidentified by x-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. the mass loading ofthe nuclear outflows is near unity. our findings provide compelling evidencefor powerful, high-duty cycle, agn-driven outflows near the schechter mass, andacting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

1409.1171	combined co &amp; dust scaling relations of depletion time and molecular gas  fractions with cosmic time, specific star formation rate and stellar mass	we combine molecular gas masses inferred from co emission in 500 star forminggalaxies (sfgs) between z=0 and 3, from the iram-coldgass, phibss1/2 and othersurveys, with gas masses derived from herschel far-ir dust measurements in 512galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. we constrain thescaling relations of molecular gas depletion time scale (tdepl) and gas tostellar mass ratio (mmolgas/m*) of sfgs near the star formation main-sequencewith redshift, specific star formation rate (ssfr) and stellar mass (m*). theco- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. this suggests thatthe co-h2 mass conversion factor varies little within 0.6dex of the mainsequence (ssfr(ms,z,m*)), and less than 0.3dex throughout this redshift range.this study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. we find thattdepl scales as (1+z)^-0.3 *(ssfr/ssfr(ms,z,m*))^-0.5, with little dependenceon m*. the resulting steep redshift dependence of mmolgas/m* ~(1+z)^3 mirrorsthat of the ssfr and probably reflects the gas supply rate. the decreasing gasfractions at high m* are driven by the flattening of the sfr-m* relation.throughout the redshift range probed a larger ssfr at constant m* is due to acombination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale. as a result galaxy integrated samples of the mmolgas-sfr rate relationexhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of ssfr. withthese new relations it is now possible to determine mmolgas with an accuracy of0.1dex in relative terms, and 0.2dex including systematic uncertainties.

1410.0011	the energy and momentum input of supernova explosions in structured and  ionised molecular clouds	we investigate the early impact of single and binary supernova (sn)explosions on dense gas clouds with three-dimensional, high-resolution,hydrodynamic simulations. the effect of cloud structure, radiative cooling, andionising radiation from the progenitor stars on the net input of kineticenergy, f_kin=e_kin/e_sn, thermal energy, f_therm=e_therm/e_sn, and gasmomentum f_p=p/p_sn to the interstellar medium (ism) is tested. for clouds withn=100 cm^{-3}, the momentum generating sedov and pressure-driven snowploughphases are terminated early (~ 0.01 myr) and radiative cooling limits thecoupling to f_therm ~ 0.01, f_kin ~ 0.05, and f_p ~ 9, significantly lower thanfor the case without cooling. for pre-ionised clouds these numbers are onlyincreased by ~ 50%, independent of the cloud structure. this only suffices toaccelerate ~ 5% of the cloud to radial velocities &gt;30km/s. a second sn mightfurther enhance the coupling efficiencies if delayed past the sedov phase ofthe first explosion. such very low coupling efficiencies cast doubts on manygalaxy-scale sub-resolution models for supernova feedback, most of which arevalidated a posteriori by qualitative agreement of galaxy properties withobservations. ionising radiation appears not to significantly enhance theimmediate coupling of sne to the surrounding gas as it drives the ism intoinert dense shells and cold clumps, a process which is unresolved in galaxyscale simulations. our results support previous conclusions that supernovaemight only drive a wind if a significant fraction explodes in low-densityenvironments or if they are supported by processes other than ionisingradiation.

1411.0009	modelling the supernova-driven ism in different environments	we use hydrodynamical simulations in a $(256\;{\rm pc})^3$ periodic box tomodel the impact of supernova (sn) explosions on the multi-phase interstellarmedium (ism) for initial densities $n = 0.5-30$ cm$^{-3}$ and sn rates $1-720$myr$^{-1}$. we include radiative cooling, diffuse heating, and the formation ofmolecular gas using a chemical network. the sne explode either at randompositions, at density peaks, or both. we further present a model combiningthermal energy for resolved and momentum input for unresolved sne. randomdriving at high sn rates results in hot gas ($t\gtrsim 10^6$ k) filling $&gt; 90$%of the volume. this gas reaches high pressures ($10^4 &lt; p/k_\mathrm{b} &lt; 10^7$k cm$^{-3}$) due to the combination of sn explosions in the hot, low densitymedium and confinement in the periodic box. these pressures move the gas from atwo-phase equilibrium to the single-phase, cold branch of the cooling curve.the molecular hydrogen dominates the mass ($&gt;50$%), residing in small, denseclumps. such a model might resemble the dense ism in high-redshift galaxies.peak driving results in huge radiative losses, producing a filamentary ism withvirtually no hot gas, and a small molecular hydrogen mass fraction ($\ll 1$%).varying the ratio of peak to random sne yields ism properties in between thetwo extremes, with a sharp transition for equal contributions. the velocitydispersion in hi remains $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ in all cases. for peakdriving the velocity dispersion in h$_\alpha$ can be as high as $70$ kms$^{-1}$ due to the contribution from young, embedded sn remnants.

1504.03724	comparison of simple mass estimators for slowly rotating elliptical  galaxies	we compare the performance of mass estimators for elliptical galaxies thatrely on the directly observable surface brightness and velocity dispersionprofiles, without invoking computationally expensive detailed modeling. thesemethods recover the mass at a specific radius where the mass estimate isexpected to be least sensitive to the anisotropy of stellar orbits. one method(wolf et al. 2010) uses the total luminosity-weighted velocity dispersion andevaluates the mass at a 3d half-light radius $r_{1/2}$, i.e., it depends on theglobal galaxy properties. another approach (churazov et al. 2010) estimates themass from the velocity dispersion at a radius $r_2$ where the surfacebrightness declines as $r^{-2}$, i.e., it depends on the local properties. weevaluate the accuracy of the two methods for analytical models, simulatedgalaxies and real elliptical galaxies that have already been modeled by theschwarzschild's orbit-superposition technique. both estimators recover analmost unbiased circular speed estimate with a modest rms scatter ($\lesssim 10\%$). tests on analytical models and simulated galaxies indicate that the localestimator has a smaller rms scatter than the global one. we show by examinationof simulated galaxies that the projected velocity dispersion at $r_2$ couldserve as a good proxy for the virial galaxy mass. for simulated galaxies thetotal halo mass scales with $\sigma_p(r_2)$ as $m_{vir}\left[m_{\odot}h^{-1}\right] \approx 6\cdot 10^{12} \left(\frac{\sigma_p(r_2)}{200\, \rm km\, s^{-1}} \right)^{4}$ with rms scatter$\approx 40 \%$.

0808.0194	mergers and mass accretion rates in galaxy assembly: the millennium  simulation compared to observations of z~2 galaxies	recent observations of uv-/optically selected, massive star forming galaxiesat z~2 indicate that the baryonic mass assembly and star formation history isdominated by continuous rapid accretion of gas and internal secular evolution,rather than by major mergers. we use the millennium simulation to build newhalo merger trees, and extract halo merger fractions and mass accretion rates.we find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretionrates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation ratesobserved in z~2 disks. on the other hand, the fraction of major mergers in themillennium simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts ofsubmillimeter galaxies (smgs), in support of observational evidence that theseare major mergers. when following the fate of these two populations in themillennium simulation to z=0, we find that subsequent mergers are not frequentenough to convert all z~2 turbulent disks into elliptical galaxies at z=0.similarly, mergers cannot transform the compact smgs/red sequence galaxies atz~2 into observed massive cluster ellipticals at z=0. we argue therefore, thatsecular and internal evolution must play an important role in the evolution ofa significant fraction of z~2 uv-/optically and submillimeter selected galaxypopulations.

astro-ph;0009132	the kinematics of 3:1-merger remnants and the formation of  low-luminosity elliptical galaxies	we test the formation of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies throughcollisionless mergers of unequal-mass disk galaxies. the kinematic propertiesof a small survey of simulated merger end-products with initial disk massratios of 3:1 is compared to a sample of seven low-luminosity galaxies observedby rix et al. that were chosen photometrically to be "ellipticals". in thispaper, we go beyond a comparison in terms of global properties (using onenumber to characterize a model or a galaxy e.g. &lt;a4&gt;, ellipticity at some fixedradius or central velocity dispersion) and examine the detailed kinematics asfunction of galactocentric distance. the merger remnants are ``observed''through a slit along the major and minor axis, using a pixel binning and slitwidth similar to the one used during the spectroscopic observations. we comparethe rotational support (v/sigma) of the merger remnants, the normalizedrotation on the minor axis and the major axis gauss-hermite moments h3, to thatof the observed galaxies. the n-body remnants are very flattened when viewededge-on (&lt;epsilon&gt; = 0.6) and should be inclined before making a faircomparison with the rix et al. data set (which has &lt;epsilon&gt; = 0.3). when themerger remnants are appropriately inclined, their v/sigma profiles rise slowerthan the observed ones. note that even when the remnants are viewed edge-on,the v/sigma profiles do not match the observations. the detailed comparison ofthe observations with purely collisionless 3:1-merger remnants suggests thatthis kind of dissipationless merger is not likely to be the dominant formationchannel for low-luminosity elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0501418	orbital structure of collisionless merger remnants: on the origin of  photometric and kinematic properties of elliptical and s0 galaxies	we present a detailed investigation of the relation between the orbitalcontent of merger remnants and observable properties of elliptical and s0galaxies. our analysis is based on the statistical sample of collisionlessmergers of disk galaxies with different mass ratios and orbital parameters,published by naab &amp; burkert. we use the spectral method by carpintero &amp; aguilarto determine the orbital content of every remnant and correlate it with itsintrinsic shape, and its projected kinematic and photometric properties. wediscuss the influence of the bulge component and varying pericenter distances.the two most abundant orbit classes are the minor axis tubes and the boxorbits. their ratio seems to determine the basic properties of a remnant. onaverage, the fraction of minor axis tubes increases by a factor of two from amerger mass ratio of 1:1 to 4:1, whereas the fraction of box orbits decreasesby 10%. at a given mass the central velocity dispersion of a remnant scaleswith the ratio of minor axis tubes to box orbits. interestingly, the divisionline between rotational supported systems and pressure supported objects,$(v_{maj}/\sigma_0)^*=0.7$, turns out to coincide with a box to minor axis tuberatio of unity. the observed $h_3$-$v/\sigma$ anti-correlation for ellipticalscan not be reproduced by collisionless merger remnants. we propose that thiscan only be reconciled by an additional physical process that significantlyreduces the box orbit content. remnants which are dominated by minor axis tubeorbits have predominantly disky projections. boxy remnants have always a box tominor axis tube ratio larger than one. this study will enable to identifyobserved ellipticals that could have formed, in the collisionless limit, bygas-poor disk mergers.

astro-ph;0509707	evolution of local ultraluminous mergers from nir spectroscopy	we present results from our vlt large program to study the dynamicalevolution of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). we have so far obtainednear-infrared high-resolution isaac spectra of 53 local ulirgs at severalmerger timescales and 12 palomar-green qsos (more than half of which areir-bright sources). we have extracted the stellar velocity dispersion androtational velocity along our slits to derive the kinematics of the merginggalaxies. these quantities enable us to answer the following questions aboutthe evolution of ulirgs: 1) what are the progenitor mass ratios?, 2) how do thestellar kinematics evolve?, and, 3) is there a connection between ulirgs andqsos? we find that the ultraluminous phase is mainly triggered by mergers ofapproximately equal mass galaxies, however, less violent minor mergers (ofprogenitor mass ratio ~3:1) also exist in our sample. dynamical heating of themerging hosts is observed as the stellar systematic rotation decreases withtime in favour of the increase of random motions. the merger remnants, beingdispersion-dominated systems with non-negligible rotation, resemble ellipticalgalaxies. placing ulirgs on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies showsthat they resemble intermediate-mass ellipticals. after the nuclearcoalescence, the black hole masses of ulirgs, calculated from their relation tothe host dispersions, are of the order 10^7-10^8 m_sun. to investigate whetherulirgs go through a qso phase during their evolution, we perform a similar(preliminary) analysis of the ir-bright-qso kinematics. we find that theaverage dispersion of the ir-bright qsos is similar to that of the ulirgremnants, indicating that evolutionary links between the two populations mayexist.

0809.0897	ivine - ionization in the parallel tree/sph code vine: first results on  the observed age-spread around o-stars	we present a three-dimensional, fully parallelized, efficient implementationof ionizing uv radiation for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) includingself-gravity. our method is based on the sph/tree code vine. we therefore callit ivine (for ionization + vine). this approach allows detailed high-resolutionstudies of the effects of ionizing radiation from e.g. young massive stars ontheir turbulent parental molecular clouds. in this paper we describe theconcept and the numerical implementation of the radiative transfer for aplain-parallel geometry and we discuss several test cases demonstrating theefficiency and accuracy of the new method. as a first application, we study theradiatively driven implosion of marginally stable molecular clouds at variousdistances of a strong uv source and show that they are driven intogravitational collapse. the resulting cores are very compact and dense exactlyas it is observed in clustered environments. our simulations indicate that thetime of triggered collapse depends on the distance of the core from the uvsource. clouds closer to the source collapse several $10^5$ years earlier thanmore distant clouds. this effect can explain the observed age spread in obassociations where stars closer to the source are found to be younger. wediscuss possible uncertainties in the observational derivation of shock frontvelocities due to early stripping of proto-stellar envelopes by ionizingradiation.

astro-ph;0510670	dynamical properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies i: mass ratio  conditions for ulirg activity in interacting pairs	we present first results from our very large telescope large program to studythe dynamical evolution of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), which arethe products of mergers of gas-rich galaxies. the full data set consists ofhigh resolution, long-slit, h- and k-band spectra of 38 ulirgs and 12 qsos(between 0.042&lt;z&lt;0.268). in this paper, we present the sources that have notfully coalesced, and therefore have two distinct nuclei. this sub-sampleconsists of 21 ulirgs, the nuclear separation of which varies between 1.6 and23.3 kpc. from the co bandheads that appear in our spectra, we extract thestellar velocity dispersion, sigma, and the rotational velocity, v_rot. thestellar dispersion equals 142 km/s on average, while v_rot is often of the sameorder. we combine our spectroscopic results with high-resolution infrared (ir)imaging data to study the conditions for ulirg activity in interacting pairs.we find that the majority of ulirgs are triggered by almost equal-mass majormergers of 1.5:1 average ratio. less frequently, 3:1 encounters are alsoobserved in our sample. however, less violent mergers of mass ratio &gt;3:1typically do not force enough gas into the center to generate ulirgluminosities.

astro-ph;0512055	probing for evolutionary links between local ulirgs and qsos from nir  spectroscopy	we present a study of the dynamical evolution of ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs), merging galaxies of infrared luminosity &gt;10^12 l_sun. duringour very large telescope large program, we have obtained isaac near-infrared,high-resolution spectra of 54 ulirgs (at several merger phases) and 12 localpalomar-green qsos to investigate whether ulirgs go through a qso phase duringtheir evolution. one possible evolutionary scenario is that after nuclearcoalescence, the black hole radiates close to eddington to produce qsoluminosities. the mean stellar velocity dispersion that we measure from ourspectra is similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ulirgs and 7 ir-brightqsos. the black holes in both populations have masses of order 10^7-10^8 m_sun(calculated from the relation to the host dispersion) and accrete at rates &gt;0.5eddington. placing ulirgs and ir-bright qsos on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies shows that they are located on a similar region (that ofmoderate-mass ellipticals), in contrast to giant ellipticals and radio-loudqsos. while this preliminary comparison of the ulirg and qso host kinematicalproperties indicates that (some) ulirgs may undergo a qso phase in theirevolutionary history before they settle down as ellipticals, further data onnon-ir excess qsos are necessary to test this scenario.

astro-ph;0607468	dynamical properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. ii. traces of  dynamical evolution and end products of local ultraluminous mergers	we present results from our very large telescope large program to study thedynamical evolution of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos.this paper is the second in a series presenting the stellar kinematics of 54ulirgs, derived from high resolution, long-slit h- and k-band spectroscopy. thedata presented here, including observations of 17 new targets, are mainlyfocused on sources that have coalesced into a single nucleus. the stellarkinematics, extracted from the co ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,indicate that ulirg remnants are dynamically heated systems with a meandispersion of 161 km/s. the combination of kinematic, structural, andphotometric properties of the remnants indicate that they mostly originate frommajor mergers and that they result in the formation of systems supported byrandom motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. the peak of the velocitydispersion distribution and the locus of ulirgs on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies indicate that the end products of ultraluminous mergers aretypically moderate-mass ellipticals (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 m_sun).converting the host dispersion into black hole mass with the aid of them_bh-sigma relation yields black hole mass estimates of the order 10^7 - 10^8m_sun and high accretion rates with eddington efficiencies often &gt;0.5.

astro-ph;0609709	triggered star formation in the environment of young massive stars	recent observations with the spitzer space telescope show clear evidence thatstar formation takes place in the surrounding of young massive o-type stars,which are shaping their environment due to their powerful radiation and stellarwinds. in this work we investigate the effect of ionising radiation of massivestars on the ambient interstellar medium (ism): in particular we want toexamine whether the uv-radiation of o-type stars can lead to the observedpillar-like structures and can trigger star formation. we developed a newimplementation, based on a parallel smooth particle hydrodynamics code (calledivine), that allows an efficient treatment of the effect of ionising radiationfrom massive stars on their turbulent gaseous environment. here we presentfirst results at very high resolution. we show that ionising radiation cantrigger the collapse of an otherwise stable molecular cloud. the arisingstructures resemble observed structures (e.g. the pillars of creation in theeagle nebula (m16) or the horsehead nebula b33). including the effect ofgravitation we find small regions that can be identified as formation places ofindividual stars. we conclude that ionising radiation from massive stars alonecan trigger substantial star formation in molecular clouds.

0809.2927	star cluster survival and compressive tides in antennae-like mergers	gravitational tides are widely understood to strip and destroy galacticsubstructures. in the course of a galaxy merger, however, transient totallycompressive tides may develop and prevent star forming regions from dissolving,after they condensed to form clusters of stars. we study the statistics of suchcompressive modes in an n-body model of the galaxy merger ngc 4038/39 (theantennae) and show that ~15% of the disc material undergoes compressive tidesat pericentre. the spatial distribution of observed young clusters in theoverlap and nuclear regions of the antennae matches surprisingly well thelocation of compressive tides obtained from simulation data. furthermore, thestatistics of time intervals spent by individual particles embedded in acompressive tide yields a log-normal distribution of characteristic time ~10myr, comparable to star cluster formation timescales. we argue that thisgeneric process is operative in galaxy mergers at all redshifts and possiblyenhances the formation of star clusters. we show with a model calculation thatthis process will prevent the dissolution of a star cluster during theformation phase, even for a star formation efficiency as low as ~10%. thetransient nature of compressive tides implies that clusters may dissolverapidly once the tidal field switches to the usual disruptive mode.

0811.2130	the flattening and the orbital structure of early-type galaxies and  collisionless n-body binary disk mergers	we use oblate axisymmetric dynamical models including dark halos to determinethe orbital structure of intermediate mass to massive coma early-type galaxies.we find a large variety of orbital compositions. averaged over all samplegalaxies the unordered stellar kinetic energy in the azimuthal and the radialdirection are of the same order, but they can differ by up to 40 percent inindividual systems. in contrast, both for rotating and non-rotating galaxiesthe vertical kinetic energy is on average smaller than in the other twodirections. this implies that even most of the rotating ellipticals areflattened by an anisotropy in the stellar velocity dispersions. usingthree-integral axisymmetric toy models we show that flattening by stellaranisotropy maximises the entropy for a given density distribution.collisionless disk merger remnants are radially anisotropic. the apparent lackof strong radial anisotropy in observed early-type galaxies implies that theymay not have formed from mergers of disks unless the influence of dissipationalprocesses was significant.

0812.3154	the halo merger rate in the millennium simulation and implications for  observed galaxy merger fractions	we developed a new method to extract halo merger rates from the millenniumsimulation. first, by removing superfluous mergers that are artifacts of thefof halo finder, we find a lower merger rate compared to previous work. thereductions are more significant at lower redshifts, lower halo masses, andminor mergers. our approach agrees better with predictions from the eps model.second, we find that the fof halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to50% for halos that are about to merge, which leads to an additional ~20%overestimate of the merger rate. therefore, we define halo masses by includingonly gravitationally bound particles. we provide new best-fitting parametersfor a global formula to account for these improvements. in addition, we extractthe merger rate per progenitor halo, as well as per descendant halo. the formeris the quantity that is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when theyare measured via pair counting. at low mass/redshift the merger rate increaseswith mass and redshift. at high mass/redshift (for halos with masses a fewtimes the "knee" of the mass function) these trends break down, and the mergerrate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately withredshift. defining the merger rate per progenitor halo also allows us toquantify the rate at which halos are being accreted onto larger halos. weprovide an analytic formula to convert given merger rates per descendant halointo merger rates per progenitor halo. finally, we perform a comparison betweenobserved merger fractions and the fraction of halos that have undergone a majormerger during the recent dynamical friction time, and find a fair agreement,within the large uncertainties of the observations. our new halo merger treesare available at http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/millenniummergertrees/.
