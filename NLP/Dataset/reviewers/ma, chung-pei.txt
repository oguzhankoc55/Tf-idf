0901.4111	the effects of gas on morphological transformation in mergers:  implications for bulge and disk demographics	transformation of disks into spheroids via mergers is a well-accepted elementof galaxy formation models. however, recent simulations have shown that bulgeformation is suppressed in increasingly gas-rich mergers. we investigate theglobal implications of these results in a cosmological framework, usingindependent approaches: empirical halo-occupation models (where galaxies arepopulated in halos according to observations) and semi-analytic models. inboth, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the over-production ofspheroids: low and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to bebulge-dominated (b/t~0.5 at &lt;10^10 m_sun), with almost no bulgeless systems),even if they have avoided major mergers. including the different physicalbehavior of gas in mergers immediately leads to a dramatic change: bulgeformation is suppressed in low-mass galaxies, observed to be gas-rich (givingb/t~0.1 at &lt;10^10 m_sun, with a number of bulgeless galaxies in good agreementwith observations). simulations and analytic models which neglect thesimilarity-breaking behavior of gas have difficulty reproducing the strongobserved morphology-mass relation. however, the observed dependence of gasfractions on mass, combined with suppression of bulge formation in gas-richmergers, naturally leads to the observed trends. discrepancies betweenobservations and models that ignore the role of gas increase with redshift; inmodels that treat gas properly, galaxies are predicted to be lessbulge-dominated at high redshifts, in agreement with the observations. wediscuss implications for the global bulge mass density and future observationaltests.

0902.3659	mass accretion rates and histories of dark matter haloes	we use the extensive catalog of dark matter haloes from the millenniumsimulation to investigate the statistics of the mass accretion histories (mahs)and accretion rates of ~500,000 haloes from redshift z=0 to 6. we find onlyabout 25% of the haloes to have mahs that are well described by a 1-parameterexponential form. for the rest of the haloes, between 20% (milky-way mass) to50% (cluster mass) experience late-time growth that is steeper than anexponential, whereas the remaining haloes show plateau-ed late-time growth thatis shallower than an exponential. the haloes with slower late-time growth tendto reside in denser environments, suggesting that either tidal stripping or the"hotter" dynamics are suppressing the accretion rate of dark matter onto thesehaloes. these deviations from exponential growth are well fit by introducing asecond parameter: m(z) \propto (1+z)^beta exp(-gamma z). the full distributionof beta and gamma as a function of halo mass is provided. from the analyticform of m(z), we obtain a simple formula for the mean accretion rate of darkmatter, dm/dt, as a function of redshift and mass. at z=0, this rate is 42msun/yr for 1e12 msun haloes, which corresponds to a mean baryon accretion rateof dmbaryon/dt=7 msun/yr. this mean rate increases approximately as (1+z)^1.5at low z and (1+z)^2.5 at high z, reaching dmbaryon/dt = 27, 69, and 140msun/yr at z=1, 2, and 3. the specific rate depends on halo mass weakly:dlogm/dt \propto m^0.127. results for the broad distributions about the meanrates are also discussed.

0903.2479	compact high-redshift galaxies are the cores of the most massive  present-day spheroids	observations suggest that effective radii of high-z massive spheroids are asmuch as a factor ~6 smaller than low-z galaxies of comparable mass. given theapparent absence of low-z counterparts, this has often been interpreted asindicating that the high density, compact red galaxies must be 'puffed up' bysome mechanism. we compare the ensemble of high-z observations with largesamples of well-observed low-z ellipticals. at the same physical radii, thestellar surface mass densities of low and high-z systems are comparable.moreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift iscomparable to or larger than that observed at z&gt;1-2, consistent with thecontinuous buildup of spheroids over this time. the entire population ofcompact, high-z red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density coresof present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density fromz=2 to z=0. the primary difference between low and high-z systems is thus theobserved low-density material at large radii in low-z spheroids (rather thanthe high-density material in high-z spheroids). such low-density material mayeither (1) assemble at z&lt;2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z&gt;2.mock observations of low-z massive systems show that the high-z observations donot yet probe sufficiently low surface brightness material to detect the lowsurface density 'wings' (if present). thus, if the high-z galaxies resemble themost massive systems today, their inferred effective radii could beunder-estimated by factors ~2-4. this difference arises because massive systemsat low redshift are not well-fit by single sersic profiles. we discussimplications of our results for physical models of galaxy evolution.

0906.1196	dark matter halo growth ii: diffuse accretion and its environmental  dependence	dark matter haloes in lambda cdm simulations grow by mergers with otherhaloes as well as accretion of "diffuse" non-halo material. we quantify themass growth rates via these two processes, dm_mer/dt and dm_dif/dt, and theirdependence on halo environment using the ~500,000 haloes in the millenniumsimulation. adopting a local mass density parameter as a measure of haloenvironment, we find the two rates show strong but opposite environmentaldependence, with mergers playing an increasingly important role for halogrowths in overdense regions and diffuse accretion dominating growth in voids.this behaviour is independent of the mass cuts used to define haloes vsnon-haloes. for galaxy-scale haloes, these two opposite correlations largelycancel out, but a weak environmental dependence remains that results in aslightly lower mean total growth rate, and hence an earlier mean formationredshift, for haloes in denser regions. the mean formation redshift of the~5000 cluster-mass haloes, on the other hand, appears to have no correlationwith halo environment. the origin of the positive correlation of dm_mer/dt withlocal density can be traced to the surrounding mass reservoir outside thehaloes, where more progenitor haloes are available in denser regions. thenegative correlation of dm_dif/dt with density, however, is not explained bythe available diffuse mass in the reservoir, which is in fact larger in denserregions. the non-halo component may therefore be partially comprised of trulydiffuse dark matter particles that are dynamically hotter and are accreted at asuppressed rate in denser regions. we also discuss the implications of theseresults for how to modify the extended press-schechter model of halo growth,which in its original form does not predict environmental dependence.

0907.3144	is the radial profile of the phase-space density of dark matter halos a  power-law?	the latest cosmological n-body simulations find two intriguing properties fordark matter haloes: (1) their radial density profile, rho, is better fit by aform that flattens to a constant at the halo center (the einasto profile) thanthe widely-used nfw form; (2) the radial profile of the pseudo-phase-spacedensity, rho/sigma3, on the other hand, continues to be well fit by a powerlaw, as seen in earlier lower-resolution simulations. in this paper we use thejeans equation to argue that (1) and (2) cannot both be true at all radii. weexamine the implied radial dependence of rho/sigma3 over 12 orders of magnitudein radius by solving the jeans equation for a broad range of input rho andvelocity anisotropy beta. independent of beta, we find that rho/sigma3 isapproximately a power law only over the limited range of halo radius resolvableby current simulations (down to ~0.1% of the virial radius), and rho/sigma3deviates significantly from a power-law below this scale for both the einastoand nfw rho. the same conclusion also applies to a more generaldensity-velocity relation rho/sigma_d^epsilon. conversely, when we enforcerho/sigma^3 r^{-eta} as an input, none of the physically allowed rho (occurringfor the narrow range 1.8&lt;eta&lt;1.9444) follows the einasto form. we expect thenext generation simulations with better spatial resolution to settle thedebate: either the einasto profile will continue to hold and rho/sigma3 willdeviate from a power law, or rho/sigma3 will continue as a power law and rhowill deviate from its current parameterizations.

0909.2872	self-regulated black hole growth via momentum deposition in galaxy  merger simulations	we perform hydrodynamical simulations of major galaxy mergers using newmethods for calculating the growth of massive black holes (bh) in galacticnuclei and their impact on the surrounding galaxy. we model bh growth byincluding a subgrid model for accretion produced by angular momentum transporton unresolved scales. the impact of the bhs radiation on surrounding gas isapproximated by depositing momentum into the ambient gas, which produces anoutward force away from the bh. we argue that these phenomenological models forbh growth and feedback better approximate the interaction between the bh anddense gas in galaxies than previous models. we show that this physics leads toself-regulated black hole growth: during the peak of activity, the accretionrate onto the bh is largely determined by the physics of bh feedback, not thesubgrid accretion model. the bh significantly modifies the gas dynamics in thegalactic nucleus (&lt; 300 pc), but does not generate large-scale galacticoutflows. integrated over an entire galaxy merger, bh feedback has littleeffect on the total number of stars formed, but is crucial for setting the bhsmass.

0909.3306	when should we treat galaxies as isolated?	traditionally, secular evolution is defined as evolution of systems where theinternal growth of structure and instabilities dominates the growth viaexternal drivers (e.g. accretion/mergers). most study has focused on 'isolated'galaxies, where seed asymmetries may represent realistic cosmologicalsubstructure, but subsequent evolution ignores galaxy growth. large-scale modesin the disk then grow on a timescale of order a disk rotation period (0.1-1gyr). if, however, galaxies evolve cosmologically on a shorter timescale, thenit may not be appropriate to consider them 'isolated.' we outline simplescalings to ask whether the timescale for secular evolution is shorter than thetimescale for cosmological accretion and mergers. this is the case in a narrow,but important range of perturbation amplitudes corresponding to substructure ormode/bar fractional amplitudes 0.01-0.1, a range of interest for observedstrong bars and pseudobulges. at smaller amplitudes &lt;&lt;0.1, systems are notisolated: typical disks will grow by accretion at a comparable level over evena single dynamical time. at larger amplitudes &gt;&gt;0.1, the evolution is no longersecular; direct gravitational evolution of the seed swamps the internal diskresponse. we derive criteria for when disks can be well-approximated as'isolated' as a function of mass, redshift, and disk stability. the relevantparameter space shrinks at higher mass, higher disk stability, and higher-z asaccretion rates increase. cosmological rates of galaxy evolution also define amaximum bar/mode lifetime of practical interest, of ~0.1/h(z). longer-livedmodes will de-couple from their drivers (if driven) and encounter cosmologicaleffects.

0909.3840	the gas consumption history to z ~ 4	using the observations of the star formation rate and hi densities to z ~ 4,with measurements of the molecular gas depletion rate (mgdr) and local densityof h_2 at z = 0, we derive the history of the gas consumption by star formationto z ~ 4. we find that closed-box models in which h_2 is not replenished by hirequire improbably large increases in rho(h_2) and a decrease in the mgdr withlookback time that is inconsistent with observations. allowing the h_2 used instar formation to be replenished by hi does not alleviate the problem becauseobservations show that there is very little evolution of rho(hi) from z = 0 toz = 4. we show that to be consistent with observational constraints, starformation on cosmic timescales must be fueled by intergalactic ionized gas,which may come from either accretion of gas through cold (but ionized) flows orfrom ionized gas associated with accretion of dark matter halos. we constrainthe rate at which the extraglactic ionized gas must be converted into hi andultimately into h_2. the ionized gas inflow rate roughly traces the sfrd: about1 - 2 x 10^8 m_sun gyr^-1 mpc^-3 from z ~ 1 - 4, decreasing by about an orderof magnitude from z=1 to z=0 with details depending largely on mgdr(t). allmodels considered require the volume averaged density of rho(h_2) to increaseby a factor of 1.5 - 10 to z ~ 1.5 over the currently measured value. becausethe molecular gas must reside in galaxies, it implies that galaxies at high zmust, on average, be more molecule rich than they are at the present epoch,which is consistent with observations. these quantitative results, derivedsolely from observations, agree well with cosmological simulations.

0707.2960	dynamical friction and galaxy merging timescales	the timescale for galaxies within merging dark matter halos to merge witheach other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. accurateestimates of merging timescales are required for predictions of astrophysicalquantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar massin central galaxies, and the statistical properties of satellite galaxieswithin dark matter halos. in this paper, we study the merging timescales ofextended dark matter halos using n-body simulations. we compare these resultsto standard estimates based on the chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction.we find that these standard predictions for merging timescales, which are oftenused in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter thanthose found in simulations. the discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7for $m_sat/m_host \approx 0.1$ and becomes larger for more disparatesatellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of $\sim 3.3$ for$m_sat/m_host\approx 0.01$. based on our simulations, we propose a new, easilyimplementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the timescale for anextended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to thehalo's center for a wide range of $m_sat/m_host$ and orbits. including acentral bulge in each galaxy changes the merging timescale by $\la 10%$. tohighlight one concrete application of our results, we show that mergingtimescales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar massby satellite accretion by $\approx 40 %$, with the extra mass gained in lowmass ratio mergers.

1001.2304	the merger rates and mass assembly histories of dark matter haloes in  the two millennium simulations	we construct merger trees of dark matter haloes and quantify their mergerrates and mass growth rates using the joint dataset from the millennium andmillennium-ii simulations. the finer resolution of the millennium-ii simulationhas allowed us to extend our earlier analysis of halo merger statistics to anunprecedentedly wide range of descendant halo mass (10^10 &lt; m0 &lt; 10^15 msun),progenitor mass ratio (10^-5 &lt; xi &lt; 1), and redshift (0 &lt; z &lt; 15). we updateour earlier fitting form for the mean merger rate per halo as a function ofm_0, xi, and z. the overall behavior of this quantity is unchanged: the rateper unit redshift is nearly independent of z out to z~15; the dependence onhalo mass is weak (m0^0.13); and it is nearly a power law in the progenitormass ratio (xi^-2). we also present a simple and accurate fitting formula forthe mean mass growth rate of haloes as a function of mass and redshift. thismean rate is 46 msun/yr for 10^12 msun haloes at z=0, and it increases withmass as m^{1.1} and with redshift as (1+z)^2.5 (for z &gt; 1). when the fit forthe mean mass growth rate is integrated over a halo's history, we findexcellent match to the mean mass assembly histories of the simulated haloes. bycombining merger rates and mass assembly histories, we present results for thenumber of mergers over a halo's history and the statistics of the redshift ofthe last major merger.

1004.2708	mergers in lambda-cdm: uncertainties in theoretical predictions and  interpretations of the merger rate	different methodologies lead to order-of-magnitude variations in predictedgalaxy merger rates. we examine and quantify the dominant uncertainties.different halo merger rates and subhalo 'destruction' rates agree to within afactor ~2 given proper care in definitions. if however (sub)halo masses are notappropriately defined or are under-resolved, the major merger rate can bedramatically suppressed. the dominant differences in galaxy merger rates owe tobaryonic physics. hydrodynamic simulations without feedback and older modelsthat do not agree with the observed galaxy mass function propagate factor ~5bias in the resulting merger rates. however, if the model matches the galaxymass function, properties of central galaxies are sufficiently converged togive small differences in merger rates. but variations in baryonic physics ofsatellites also have dramatic effects. the known problem of satellite'over-quenching' in most semi-analytic models (sams), whereby sam satellitesare too efficiently stripped of gas, could lead to order-of-magnitudeunder-estimates of merger rates for low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. fixing thesatellite properties to observations tends to predict higher merger rates, butwith factor ~2 empirical uncertainties. choice of mass ratio definitionmatters: at low masses, most true major mergers (in baryonic/dynamical galaxymass) will appear to be minor mergers in their stellar or luminosity massratio. observations and models using these criteria may underestimate majormerger rates by factors ~5. orbital parameters and gas fractions also introducefactor ~3 differences in amount of bulge formed by mergers, even for fixed massratio encounters.

1006.3312	the growth of massive black holes in galaxy merger simulations with  feedback by radiation pressure	we study the growth of massive black holes (bh) in galaxies using smoothedparticle hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers with newimplementations of bh accretion and feedback. the effect of bh accretion on gasin its host galaxy is modeled by depositing momentum at a rate ~ tau l/c intothe ambient gas, where l is the luminosity produced by accretion onto the bhand tau is the wavelength-averaged optical depth of the galactic nucleus to theagn's radiation (a free parameter of our model). the accretion rate onto the bhis relatively independent of our subgrid accretion model and is insteaddetermined by the bh's dynamical impact on its host galaxy: bh accretion isthus self-regulated rather than `supply limited.' we show that the final bhmass and total stellar mass formed during a merger are more robust predictionsof the simulations than the time dependence of the star formation rate or bhaccretion rate. in particular, the latter depend on the assumed interstellarmedium physics, which determines when and where the gas fragments to form starclusters; this in turn affects the fuel available for further star formationand bh growth. simulations over a factor of ~ 30 in galaxy mass are consistentwith the observed m_bh-sigma relation for a mean optical depth of tau ~ 25.this requires that most bh growth occur when the galactic nucleus is opticallythick to far-infrared radiation, consistent with the hypothesized connectionbetween ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and quasars. we find tentativeevidence for a shallower m_bh-sigma relation in the lowest mass galaxies, sigma&lt; 100 km/s. our results demonstrate that feedback-regulated bh growth andconsistency with the observed m_bh-sigma relation do not require that bhfeedback terminate star formation in massive galaxies or unbind largequantities of cold gas.

1007.4201	the bias and mass function of dark matter halos in non-markovian  extension of the excursion set theory	the excursion set theory based on spherical or ellipsoidal gravitationalcollapse provides an elegant analytic framework for calculating the massfunction and the large-scale bias of dark matter haloes. this theory assumesthat the perturbed density field evolves stochastically with the smoothingscale and exhibits markovian random walks in the presence of a density barrier.here we derive an analytic expression for the halo bias in a new theoreticalmodel that incorporates non-markovian extension of the excursion set theorywith a stochastic barrier. this model allows us to handle non-markovian randomwalks and to calculate perturbativly these corrections to the standardmarkovian predictions for the halo mass function and halo bias. our modelcontains only two parameters: kappa, which parameterizes the degree ofnon-markovianity and whose exact value depends on the shape of the filterfunction used to smooth the density field, and a, which parameterizes thedegree of stochasticity of the barrier. appropriate choices of kappa and a inour new model can lead to a closer match to both the halo mass function andhalo bias in the latest n-body simulations than the standard excursion settheory.

1107.5579	galaxy-scale outflows driven by active galactic nuclei	we present hydrodynamical simulations of major mergers of galaxies and studythe effects of winds produced by active galactic nuclei (agn) on interstellargas in the agn's host galaxy. we consider winds with initial velocities ~10,000 km/s and an initial momentum (energy) flux of ~ tau_w l/c (~ 0.01 tau_wl), with tau_w ~ 1-10. the agn wind sweeps up and shock heats the surroundinginterstellar gas, leading to a galaxy-scale outflow with velocities ~ 1000km/s, peak mass outflow rates comparable to the star formation rate, and atotal ejected gas mass ~ 3 x 10^9 m_sun. large momentum fluxes, tau_w &gt; 3, arerequired for the agn-driven galactic outflow to suppress star formation andaccretion in the black hole's host galaxy. less powerful agn winds (tau_w &lt; 3)still produce a modest galaxy-scale outflow, but the outflow has little globaleffect on the ambient interstellar gas. we argue that this mechanism of agnfeedback can plausibly produce the high velocity outflows observed inpost-starburst galaxies and the massive molecular and atomic outflows observedin local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. moreover, the outflows from localultra-luminous infrared galaxies are inferred to have tau_w ~ 10, comparable towhat we find is required for agn winds to regulate the growth of black holesand set the m_bh-sigma relation. we conclude by discussing theoreticalmechanisms that can lead to agn wind mass-loading and momentum/energy fluxeslarge enough to have a significant impact on galaxy formation.

1112.1078	two ten-billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of giant  elliptical galaxies	observational work conducted over the last few decades indicates that allmassive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres. although theluminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early universesuggest that some are powered by black holes with masses greater than 10billion solar masses, the remnants of these objects have not been found in thenearby universe. the giant elliptical galaxy messier 87 hosts the hitherto mostmassive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses. here wereport that ngc 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance fromearth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billionsolar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present inngc 4889, the brightest galaxy in the coma cluster (at a distance of 103megaparsecs). these two black holes are significantly more massive thanpredicted by linearly extrapolating the widely-used correlations between blackhole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the hostgalaxy. although these correlations remain useful for predicting black holemasses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest thatdifferent evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxiesand their black holes.

1205.4262	galaxies in x-ray groups. ii. a weak lensing study of halo centering	locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding themass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massivegalaxies that they host. the task is observationally challenging because wecannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or x-rayemission from hot plasma are imperfect. in this paper we quantify theconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129x-ray selected galaxy groups in the cosmos field with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 and halomasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 m_sun. by measuring the stacked lensingsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest membergalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the x-ray centroid), wedetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. in thissample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the x-ray centroids tracethe center of mass to &lt;~75 kpc, while the x-ray position and centroids based onthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to thestatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiplebright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles thatare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.we find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is notaddressed.

1211.2816	revisiting the scaling relations of black hole masses and host galaxy  properties	new kinematic data and modeling efforts in the past few years havesubstantially expanded and revised dynamical measurements of black hole masses(mbh) at the centers of nearby galaxies. here we compile an updated sample of72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relationsbetween mbh and stellar velocity dispersion (sigma), v-band luminosity (l), andbulge stellar mass (mbulge), for different galaxy subsamples. our best-fittingpower law relations for the full galaxy sample are log(mbh) = 8.32 +5.64*log(sigma/200 kms), log(mbh) = 9.23 + 1.11*log(l/10^{11} lsun), andlog(mbh) = 8.46 + 1.05*log(mbulge/10^{11} msun). a log-quadratic fit to thembh-sigma relation with an additional term of beta_2*[log(sigma/200 kms)]^2gives beta_2 = 1.68 +/- 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter inmbh. when the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtainsimilar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the mbh-sigma relation but significantlydifferent intercepts -- mbh in early-type galaxies are about 2 times higherthan in late types at a given sigma. within early-type galaxies, our fits tombh(sigma) give mbh that is about 2 times higher in galaxies with central coreprofiles than those with central power-law profiles. our mbh-l and mbh-mbulgerelations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earliercompilations. when the conventional quadrature method is used to determine theintrinsic scatter in mbh, our dataset shows weak evidence for increased scatterat mbulge &lt; 10^{11} msun or l_v &lt; 10^{10.3} lsun, while the scatter staysconstant for 10^{11} &lt; mbulge &lt; 10^{12.3} msun and 10^{10.3} &lt; l_v &lt; 10^{11.5}lsun. a bayesian analysis indicates a larger sample of mbh measurements wouldbe needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter withgalaxy properties.

1302.6620	galaxies in x-ray groups. iii. satellite color and morphology  transformations	while the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies have long beenknown to correlate with their local environment, the process by which thesecorrelations are generated is not well understood. galaxy groups are thought toplay an important role in shaping the physical properties of galaxies beforeentering massive clusters at low redshift, and transformations of satellitegalaxies likely dominate the buildup of local environmental correlations. toilluminate the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution in denseenvironments, we study a sample of 116 x-ray selected galaxy groups at z=0.2-1with halo masses of 10^13-10^14 m_sun and centroids determined with weaklensing. we analyze morphologies based on hst imaging and colors determinedfrom 31 photometric bands for a stellar mass-limited population of 923satellite galaxies and a comparison sample of 16644 field galaxies. controllingfor variations in stellar mass across environments, we find significant trendsin the colors and morphologies of satellite galaxies with group-centricdistance and across cosmic time. specifically at low stellar mass(log(m_stellar/m_sun) = 9.8-10.3), the fraction of disk-dominated star-forminggalaxies declines from &gt;50% among field galaxies to &lt;20% among satellites nearthe centers of groups. this decline is accompanied by a rise in quenchedgalaxies with intermediate bulge+disk morphologies, and only a weak increase inred bulge-dominated systems. these results show that both color and morphologyare influenced by a galaxy's location within a group halo. we suggest thatstrangulation and disk fading alone are insufficient to explain the observedmorphological dependence on environment, and that galaxy mergers or close tidalencounters must play a role in building up the population of quenched galaxieswith bulges seen in dense environments at low redshift.

1303.4393	the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio on black  hole mass measurements	we have tested the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio(y) on measurements of black hole masses (mbh) derived from stellar orbitsuperposition models. such models construct a static gravitational potentialfor a galaxy and its central black hole, but typically assume spatially uniformy. we have modeled three giant elliptical galaxies with gradients alpha = d(logy)/d(log r) from -0.2 to +0.1. color and line strength gradients suggest mildlynegative alpha in these galaxies. introducing a negative (positive) gradient iny increases (decreases) the enclosed stellar mass near the center of the galaxyand leads to systematically smaller (larger) mbh measurements. for models withalpha = -0.2, the best-fit values of mbh are 28%, 27%, and 17% lower than theconstant-y case, in ngc 3842, ngc 6086, and ngc 7768, respectively. for alpha =+0.1, mbh are 14%, 22%, and 17% higher than the constant-y case for the threerespective galaxies. for ngc 3842 and ngc 6086, this bias is comparable to thestatistical errors from individual modeling trials. at larger radii, negative(positive) gradients in y cause the total stellar mass to decrease (increase)and the dark matter fraction within one effective radius to increase(decrease).

0801.1670	metallicities and physical conditions in star-forming galaxies at  z~1.0-1.5	we present a study of the mass-metallicity (m-z) relation and h ii regionphysical conditions in a sample of 20 star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.5 drawnfrom the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. our analysis indicates that the zeropoint of the m-z relationship evolves with redshift, in the sense that galaxiesat fixed stellar mass become more metal-rich at lower redshift. measurements of[o iii]/h-beta and [n ii]/h-alpha emission-line ratios show that, on average,objects in the deep2 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.5 sample are significantly offset from theexcitation sequence observed in nearby h ii regions and sdss emission-linegalaxies. in order to fully understand the causes of this offset, which is alsoobserved in z~2 star-forming galaxies, we examine in detail the small fractionof sdss galaxies that have similar diagnostic ratios to those of the deep2sample. some of these galaxies indicate evidence for agn and/or shock activity,which may give rise to their unusual line ratios, and contribute to balmeremission lines at the level of ~20%. others indicate no evidence for agn orshock excitation, yet are characterized by higher electron densities andtemperatures, and therefore, interstellar gas pressures, than typical sdssstar-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass. these anomalous objects alsohave higher concentrations and star-formation rate surface densities, which aredirectly connected to higher interstellar pressure. higher star-formation ratesurface densities, interstellar pressures, and hii region ionization parametersmay also be common at high-redshift. these effects must be taken into accountwhen using strong-line indicators to understand the evolution of heavy elementsin galaxies. when such effects are included, the inferred evolution of the m-zrelation out to z~2 is more significant than previous estimates.

1312.0358	dark matter halo assembly bias: environmental dependence in the  non-markovian excursion set theory	in the standard excursion set model for the growth of structure, thestatistical properties of halos are governed by the halo mass and areindependent of the larger scale environment in which the halos reside.numerical simulations, however, have found the spatial distributions of halosto depend not only on their mass but also on the details of their assemblyhistory and environment. here we present a theoretical framework forincorporating this "assembly bias" into the excursion set model. ourderivations are based on modifications of the path integral approach ofmaggiore &amp; riotto (2010) that models halo formation as a non-markovian randomwalk process. the perturbed density field is assumed to evolve stochasticallywith the smoothing scale and exhibits correlated walks in the presence of adensity barrier. we write down conditional probabilities for multiple barriercrossings, and derive from them analytic expressions for descendant andprogenitor halo mass functions and halo merger rates as a function of both halomass and the linear overdensity of the larger-scale environment of the halo.our results predict a higher halo merger rate and higher progenitor halo massfunction in regions of higher overdensity, consistent with the behavior seen inn-body simulations.

1406.0784	two paths of cluster evolution: global expansion versus core collapse	all gravitationally bound clusters expand, due to both gas loss from theirmost massive members and binary heating. all are eventually disrupted tidally,either by passing molecular clouds or the gravitational potential of their hostgalaxies. however, their interior evolution can follow two very differentpaths. only clusters of sufficiently large initial population and size undergothe combined interior contraction and exterior expansion that leads eventuallyto core collapse. in all other systems, core collapse is frustrated by binaryheating. these clusters globally expand for their entire lives, up to the pointof tidal disruption.  using a suite of direct n-body calculations, we trace the "collapse line" inr_v-n space that separates these two paths. here, r_v and n are the cluster'sinitial virial radius and population, respectively. for realistic startingradii, the dividing n-value is from 10^4 to over 10^5. we also show that thereexists a minimum population, n_min, for core collapse. clusters with n &lt; n_mintidally disrupt before core collapse occurs. at the sun's galactocentricradius, r_g = 8.5 kpc, we find n_min &gt;~ 300. the minimum population scales withgalactocentric radius as r_g^{-9/8}.  the position of an observed cluster relative to the collapse line can be usedto predict its future evolution. using a small sample of open clusters, we findthat most lie below the collapse line, and thus will never undergo corecollapse. most globular clusters, on the other hand, lie well above the line.in such a case, the cluster may or may not go through core collapse, dependingon its initial size. we show how an accurate age determination can help settlethis issue.

1407.1054	the massive survey - i. a volume-limited integral-field spectroscopic  study of the most massive early-type galaxies within 108 mpc	massive early-type galaxies represent the modern-day remnants of the earliestmajor star formation episodes in the history of the universe. these galaxiesare central to our understanding of the evolution of cosmic structure, stellarpopulations, and supermassive black holes, but the details of their complexformation histories remain uncertain. to address this situation, we haveinitiated the massive survey, a volume-limited, multi-wavelength,integral-field spectroscopic (ifs) and photometric survey of the structure anddynamics of the ~100 most massive early-type galaxies within a distance of 108mpc. this survey probes a stellar mass range m* &gt; 10^{11.5} msun and diversegalaxy environments that have not been systematically studied to date. ourwide-field ifs data cover about two effective radii of individual galaxies, andfor a subset of them, we are acquiring additional ifs observations onsub-arcsecond scales with adaptive optics. we are also acquiring deep k-bandimaging to trace the extended halos of the galaxies and measure accurate totalmagnitudes. dynamical orbit modeling of the combined data will allow us tosimultaneously determine the stellar, black hole, and dark matter halo masses.the primary goals of the project are to constrain the black hole scalingrelations at high masses, investigate systematically the stellar initial massfunction and dark matter distribution in massive galaxies, and probe thelate-time assembly of ellipticals through stellar population and kinematicalgradients. in this paper, we describe the massive sample selection, discuss thedistinct demographics and structural and environmental properties of theselected galaxies, and provide an overview of our basic observational program,science goals and early survey results.

1411.0667	the formation of massive, compact galaxies at z=2 in the illustris  simulation	massive, quiescent galaxies at high redshift have been found to beconsiderably more compact than galaxies of similar mass in the local universe.how these compact galaxies formed has yet to be determined, though severalprogenitor populations have been proposed. here we investigate the formationprocesses and quantify the assembly histories of such galaxies in illustris, asuite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations encompassing a sufficientlylarge volume to include rare objects, while simultaneously resolving theinternal structure of galaxies. we select massive (~10^11 solar masses) andcompact (stellar half-mass radius &lt; 2 kpc) galaxies from the simulation at z=2.within the illustris suite, we find that these quantities are not perfectlyconverged, but are reasonably reliable for our purposes. the resultingpopulation is composed primarily of quiescent galaxies, but we also findseveral star-forming compact galaxies. the simulated compact galaxies aresimilar to observed galaxies in star formation activity and appearance. wefollow their evolution at high redshift in the simulation and find that thereare multiple pathways to form these compact galaxies, dominated by twomechanisms: (i) intense, centrally concentrated starbursts generally triggeredby gas-rich major mergers between z~2-4, reducing the galaxies' half-mass radiiby a factor of a few to below 2 kpc, and (ii) assembly at very early times whenthe universe was much denser; the galaxies formed compact and remained so untilz~2.

1502.01339	the merger rate of galaxies in the illustris simulation: a comparison  with observations and semi-empirical models	we have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the illustris simulation bydirectly tracking the baryonic content of subhalos. these merger trees are usedto calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellarmass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. we demonstrate that the mostappropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists intaking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reachesits maximum stellar mass. additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned'galaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding adescendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall'moment. adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions forthe galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which arequalitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: astrong correlation with redshift that evolves as $\sim (1+z)^{2.4-2.8}$, apower law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence ondescendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellarmasses greater than $\sim 2 \times 10^{11} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$. these trendsare consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies($m_{\ast} \gtrsim 10^{10} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$), but in tension with somerecent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies ($m_{\ast}\gtrsim 10^{11} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$), which report a nearly constant ordecreasing evolution with redshift. finally, we provide a fitting function forthe galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellarmasses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.

1504.02483	the massive survey ii: stellar population trends out to large radius in  massive early type galaxies	we examine stellar population gradients in ~100 massive early type galaxiesspanning 180 &lt; sigma* &lt; 370 km/s and m_k of -22.5 to -26.5 mag, observed aspart of the massive survey (ma et al. 2014). using integral-field spectroscopyfrom the mitchell spectrograph on the 2.7m telescope at mcdonald observatory,we create stacked spectra as a function of radius for galaxies binned by theirstellar velocity dispersion, stellar mass, and group richness. with excellentsampling at the highest stellar mass, we examine radial trends in stellarpopulation properties extending to beyond twice the effective radius (~2.5r_e). specifically, we examine trends in age, metallicity, and abundance ratiosof mg, c, n, and ca, and discuss the implications for star formation historiesand elemental yields. at a fixed physical radius of 3-6 kpc (the likely size ofthe galaxy cores formed at high redshift) stellar age and [alpha/fe] increasewith increasing sigma* and depend only weakly on stellar mass, as we mightexpect if denser galaxies form their central cores earlier and faster. if weinstead focus on 1-1.5 r_e, the trends in abundance and abundance ratio arewashed out, as might be expected if the stars at large radius were accreted bysmaller galaxies. finally, we show that when controlling for \sigmastar, thereare only very subtle differences in stellar population properties or gradientsas a function of group richness; even at large radius internal propertiesmatter more than environment in determining star formation history.

0805.1230	how to grow a healthy merger tree	we investigate seven monte carlo algorithms -- four old and three new -- forconstructing merger histories of dark matter halos using the extendedpress-schechter (eps) formalism based on both the spherical and ellipsoidalcollapse models. we compare, side-by-side, the algorithms' abilities atreproducing the analytic eps conditional (or progenitor) mass function over abroad range of mass and redshift (z=0 to 15). among the four old algorithms(lacey &amp; cole 1993, kauffmann &amp; white 1993, somerville &amp; kolatt 1999, cole etal 2000), we find that only kw93 produces a progenitor mass function that isconsistent with the eps prediction for all look-back redshifts. the origins ofthe discrepancies in the other three algorithms are discussed. our three newalgorithms are designed to generate the correct progenitor mass function ateach timestep. we show that this is a necessary and sufficient condition forconsistency with eps at any look-back time. we illustrate the differences amongthe three new algorithms and kw93 by investigating two other conditionalstatistics: the mass function of the i_{th} most massive progenitors and themass function for descendants with n_p progenitors.

1507.01942	an analysis of the evolving comoving number density of galaxies in  hydrodynamical simulations	the cumulative comoving number-density of galaxies as a function of stellarmass or central velocity dispersion is commonly used to link galaxy populationsacross different epochs. by assuming that galaxies preserve theirnumber-density in time, one can infer the evolution of their properties, suchas masses, sizes, and morphologies. however, this assumption does not hold inthe presence of galaxy mergers or when rank ordering is broken owing tovariable stellar growth rates. we present an analysis of the evolving comovingnumber density of galaxy populations found in the illustris cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulation focused on the redshift range $0\leq z \leq 3$. ourprimary results are as follows: 1) the inferred average stellar mass evolutionobtained via a constant comoving number density assumption is systematicallybiased compared to the merger tree results at the factor of $\sim$2(4) levelwhen tracking galaxies from redshift $z=0$ out to redshift $z=2(3)$; 2) themedian number density evolution for galaxy populations tracked forward in timeis shallower than for galaxy populations tracked backward in time; 3) a similarevolution in the median number density of tracked galaxy populations is foundregardless of whether number density is assigned via stellar mass, stellarvelocity dispersion, or dark matter halo mass; 4) explicit tracking reveals alarge diversity in galaxies' assembly histories that cannot be captured byconstant number-density analyses; 5) the significant scatter in galaxy linkingmethods is only marginally reduced by considering a number of additionalphysical and observable galaxy properties as realized in our simulation. weprovide fits for the forward and backward median evolution in stellar mass andnumber density and discuss implications of our analysis for interpretingmulti-epoch galaxy property observations.

1507.02291	the diverse evolutionary paths of simulated high-z massive, compact  galaxies to z=0	massive quiescent galaxies have much smaller physical sizes at high redshiftthan today. the strong evolution of galaxy size may be caused by progenitorbias, major and minor mergers, adiabatic expansion, and/or renewed starformation, but it is difficult to test these theories observationally. herein,we select a sample of 35 massive, compact galaxies ($m_* = 1-3 \times 10^{11}$m$_\odot$, $m_*/r^{1.5} &gt; 10^{10.5}$ m$_\odot$/kpc$^{1.5}$) at $z=2$ in thecosmological hydrodynamical simulation illustris and trace them forward to$z=0$ to uncover their evolution and identify their descendants. by $z=0$, theoriginal factor of 3 difference in stellar mass spreads to a factor of 20. thedark matter halo masses similarly spread from a factor of 5 to 40. thegalaxies' evolutionary paths are diverse: about half acquire an ex-situenvelope and are the core of a more massive descendant, a third surviveundisturbed and gain very little mass, 15% are consumed in a merger with a moremassive galaxy, and a small remainder are thoroughly mixed by major mergers.the galaxies grow in size as well as mass, and only $\sim$10% remain compact by$z=0$. the majority of the size growth is driven by the acquisition of ex-situmass. the most massive galaxies at $z=0$ are the most likely to have compactprogenitors, but this trend possesses significant dispersion which precludes adirect linkage to compact galaxies at $z=2$. the compact galaxies' merger ratesare influenced by their $z=2$ environments, so that isolated or satellitecompact galaxies (which are protected from mergers) are the most likely tosurvive to the present day.

1510.00729	the massive survey - iii. molecular gas and a broken tully-fisher  relation in the most massive early-type galaxies	in this work we present co(1-0) and co(2-1) observations of a pilot sample of15 early-type galaxies (etgs) drawn from the massive galaxy survey, avolume-limited integral-field spectroscopic study of the most massive etgs($m_* &gt;10^{11.5}m_\odot$) within 108 mpc. these objects were selected becausethey showed signs of an interstellar medium and/or star formation. a largeamount of gas ($&gt;$2$\times$10$^8$ m$_{\odot}$) is present in 10 out of 15objects, and these galaxies have gas fractions higher than expected based onextrapolation from lower mass samples. we tentatively interpret this asevidence that stellar mass loss and hot halo cooling may be starting to play arole in fuelling the most massive galaxies. these massive etgs seem to havelower star-formation efficiencies (sfe=sfr/m$_{\rm h2}$) than spiral galaxies,but the sfes derived are consistent with being drawn from the same distributionfound in other lower mass etg samples. this suggests that the sfe is not simplya function of stellar mass, but that local, internal processes are moreimportant for regulating star formation. finally we used the co line profilesto investigate the high-mass end of the tully-fisher relation (tfr). we findthat there is a break in the slope of the tfr for etgs at high masses(consistent with previous studies). the strength of this break correlates withthe stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, suggesting it is causedby additional baryonic mass being present in the centre of massive etgs. wespeculate on the root cause of this change and its implications for galaxyformation theories.

1511.08804	the stellar mass assembly of galaxies in the illustris simulation:  growth by mergers and the spatial distribution of accreted stars	we use the illustris simulation to study the relative contributions of insitu star formation and stellar accretion to the build-up of galaxies over anunprecedentedly wide range of masses ($m_{\ast} = 10^9-10^{12} \, {\rmm_{\odot}}$), galaxy types, environments, and assembly histories. we find thatthe `two-phase' picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a goodapproximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation -- namely,the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times $10^{11} \, {\rmm_{\odot}}$ is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts, whilegalaxies above this mass at $z \lesssim 1$ grow primarily by accretion of starsvia mergers. the fraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at $z=0$contributed by accreted stars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass,ranging from about 10% for milky way-sized galaxies to over 80% for $m_{\ast}\approx 10^{12} \, {\rm m_{\odot}}$ objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxyvariation. at a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at thecentres of younger haloes exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars thandisc-like galaxies and those formed in older haloes. on average, $\sim$50% ofthe ex situ stellar mass comes from major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\mu &gt;1/4$), $\sim$20% from minor mergers ($1/10 &lt; \mu &lt; 1/4$), $\sim$20% from veryminor mergers ($\mu &lt; 1/10$), and $\sim$10% from stars that were stripped fromsurviving galaxies (e.g. flybys or ongoing mergers). these components arespatially segregated, with in situ stars dominating the innermost regions ofgalaxies, and ex situ stars being deposited at larger galactocentric distancesin order of decreasing merger mass ratio. the `transition' radius where ex situstars begin to dominate over the in situ class decreases for more massivegalaxies and correlates strongly with the total ex situ fraction.

astro-ph;0003343	deriving the nonlinear cosmological power spectrum and bispectrum from  analytic dark matter halo profiles and mass functions	we present an analytic model for the fully nonlinear power spectrum p andbispectrum q of the cosmological mass density field. the model is based onphysical properties of dark matter halos, with the three main model inputsbeing analytic halo density profiles, halo mass functions, and halo-halospatial correlations, each of which has been well studied in the literature. wedemonstrate that this new model can reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrumcomputed from cosmological simulations of both an n=-2 scale-free model and alow-density cold dark matter model. to enhance the dynamic range of these largesimulations, we use the synthetic halo replacement technique of ma &amp; fry(2000a), where the original halos with numerically softened cores are replacedby synthetic halos of realistic density profiles. at high wavenumbers, ourmodel predicts a slope for the nonlinear power spectrum different from theoften-used fitting formulas in the literature based on the stable clusteringassumption. our model also predicts a three-point amplitude q that is scaledependent, in contrast to the popular hierarchical clustering assumption. thismodel provides a rapid way to compute the mass power spectrum and bispectrumover all length scales where the input halo properties are valid. it alsoprovides a physical interpretation of the clustering properties of matter inthe universe.

astro-ph;0005095	lyman-alpha forest constraints on the mass of warm dark matter and the  shape of the linear power spectrum	high resolution n-body simulations of cold dark matter (cdm) models predictthat galaxies and clusters have cuspy halos with excessive substructure.observations reveal smooth halos with central density cores. one possibleresolution of this conflict is that the dark matter is warm (wdm); this willsuppress the power spectrum on small scales. the lyman-alpha forest is apowerful probe of the linear power spectrum on these scales. we usecollisionless n-body simulations to follow the evolution of structure in wdmmodels, and analyze artificial lyman-alpha forest spectra extracted from them.by requiring that there is enough small-scale power in the linear powerspectrum to reproduce the observed properties of the lyman-alpha forest inquasar spectra, we derive a lower limit to the mass of the wdm particle of 750ev. this limit is robust to reasonable uncertainties in our assumption aboutthe temperature of the mean density gas (t0) at z=3. we argue that any modelthat suppresses the cdm linear theory power spectrum more severely than a 750ev wdm particle cannot produce the lyman-alpha forest.

astro-ph;0309243	major mergers of galaxy haloes: cuspy or cored inner density profile?	we present the results from a series of collisionless n-body simulations ofmajor mergers of galaxy dark matter haloes with density profiles having eitherinner cusps or cores. our simulations range from 2x10^5 to 10^7 particles,allowing us to probe the phase-space distribution of dark matter particles inthe innermost regions (less than 0.005 virial radii) of cold dark matterhaloes, a subject of much recent debate. we find that a major merger of twocored haloes yields a cored halo and does not result in a cuspy profile seen inmany cosmological simulations. this result is unchanged if we consider mergerswith parent mass ratios of 3:1 instead of 1:1. mergers of a cuspy halo witheither a cored halo or a second cuspy halo of equal mass, on the other hand,produce cuspy haloes with a slightly reduced inner logarithmic slope. cuspyhaloes, once formed, therefore appear resilient to major mergers. we find thevelocity structure of the remnants to be mildly anisotropic, with a maxwellianvelocity distribution near the centre but not in the outer portions of thefinal haloes. violent relaxation is effective only during the early phase ofmergers, with phase mixing likely to be the dominant relaxation process at latetimes.

astro-ph;0311049	a cosmological kinetic theory for the evolution of cold dark matter  halos with substructure: quasi-linear theory	we present a kinetic theory for the evolution of the phase-space distributionof dark matter particles in galaxy halos in the presence of a cosmologicalspectrum of fluctuations. this theory introduces a new way to model theformation and evolution of halos, which traditionally have been investigated byanalytic gravitational infall models or numerical n-body methods. unlike thecollisionless boltzmann equation, our kinetic equation contains nonzero termson the right-hand side arising from stochastic fluctuations in thegravitational potential due to substructures in the dark matter massdistribution. using statistics for constrained gaussian random fields instandard cosmological models, we show that our kinetic equation to second-orderin perturbation theory is of the fokker-planck form, with one scattering termrepresenting drift and the other representing diffusion in velocity-space. thedrift is radial, and the drift and diffusion coefficients depend only onpositions and not velocities; our relaxation process in the quasilinear regimeis therefore different from the standard two-body relaxation. we provideexplicit expressions relating these coefficients to the linear power spectrumof mass fluctuation and present results for the currently favored cold darkmatter model with a nonzero cosmological constant. solutions to this kineticequation will provide a complete description of the cold dark matter spatialand velocity distributions for the average halo during the early phases ofgalaxy halo formation.

astro-ph;0405040	effects of ellipticity and shear on gravitational lens statistics	we study the effects of ellipticity in lens galaxies and external tidal shearfrom neighboring objects on the statistics of strong gravitational lenses. forisothermal lens galaxies normalized so that the einstein radius is independentof ellipticity and shear, ellipticity {\it reduces} the lensing cross sectionslightly, and shear leaves it unchanged. ellipticity and shear cansignificantly enhance the magnification bias, but only if the luminosityfunction of background sources is steep. realistic distributions of ellipticityand shear {\it lower} the total optical depth by a few percent for most sourceluminosity functions, and increase the optical depth only for steep luminosityfunctions. the boost in the optical depth is noticeable (&gt;5%) only for surveyslimited to the brightest quasars (l/l_* &gt; 10). ellipticity and shear broadenthe distribution of lens image separations but do not affect the mean.ellipticity and shear naturally increase the abundance of quadruple lensesrelative to double lenses, especially for steep source luminosity functions,but the effect is not enough (by itself) to explain the observedquadruple-to-double ratio. with such small changes to the optical depth andimage separation distribution, ellipticity and shear have a small effect oncosmological constraints from lens statistics: neglecting the two leads tobiases of just delta omega_m = 0.00 \pm 0.01 and delta omega_lambda = -0.02 \pm0.01 (where the errorbars represent statistical uncertainties in ourcalculations).

astro-ph;0407488	core formation in galactic nuclei due to recoiling black holes	anisotropic gravitational radiation from a coalescing black hole binary canimpart a recoil velocity of up to several hundred km/s to the remnant blackhole. we examine the effects of recoiling massive black holes on their hoststellar bulges, both for holes that escape their host and those that return tothe galactic center via dynamical friction. we show that removal of a blackhole via radiation recoil generally results in a rapidly-formed central core inthe stellar system, with the effect being largest when the hole stays bound tothe bulge and the recoil velocity is comparable to the bulge velocitydispersion. black hole recoil therefore provides a mechanism for producingcores in some early type galaxies, but it is expected to be most efficient infaint ellipticals that are known to have steep density profiles. we argue thatthese results may hint at a significant role for gas in facilitating thecoalescence of binary black holes in faint (power-law) early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0502495	dissipationless mergers of elliptical galaxies and the evolution of the  fundamental plane	we carry out numerical simulations of dissipationless major mergers ofelliptical galaxies using initial galaxy models that consist of a dark matterhalo and a stellar bulge with properties consistent with the observedfundamental plane. by varying the density profile of the dark matter halo(standard nfw versus adiabatically contracted nfw), the global stellar to darkmatter mass ratio, and the orbit of the merging galaxies, we are able to assessthe impact of each of these factors on the structure of the merger remnant. ourresults indicate that the properties of the remnant bulge depend primarily onthe angular momentum and energy of the orbit; for a cosmologically motivatedorbit, the effective radius and velocity dispersion of the remnant bulge remainapproximately on the fundamental plane. this indicates that the observedproperties of elliptical galaxies are consistent with significant growth vialate dissipationless mergers. we also find that the dark matter fraction withinthe effective radius of our remnants increases after the merger, consistentwith the hypothesis that the tilt of the fundamental plane from the virialtheorem is due to a varying dark matter fraction as a function of galaxy mass.

astro-ph;0504557	impact of dark matter substructure on the matter and weak lensing power  spectra	we explore the effect of substructure in dark matter halos on the powerspectrum and bispectrum of matter fluctuations and weak lensing shear. byexperimenting with substructure in a cosmological n = 512^3 simulation, we findthat when a larger fraction of the host halo mass is in subhalos, the resultingpower spectrum has less power at 1 &lt; k &lt; 100 h mpc^{-1} and more power at k &gt;100 h mpc^{-1}. we explain this effect using an analytic halo model includingsubhalos, which shows that the 1 &lt; k &lt; 100 h mpc^{-1} regime dependssensitively on the radial distribution of subhalo centers while the interiorstructure of subhalos is important at k &gt; 100 h mpc^{-1}. the correspondingeffect due to substructures on the weak lensing power spectrum is up to about11% at angular scale l &lt; 10^4. predicting the nonlinear power spectrum to a fewpercent accuracy for future surveys would therefore require large cosmologicalsimulations that also have exquisite numerical resolution to model accuratelythe survivals of dark matter subhalos in the tidal fields of their hosts.

astro-ph;0601400	red mergers and the assembly of massive elliptical galaxies: the  fundamental plane and its projections	several recent observations suggest that gas-poor (dissipationless) mergersof elliptical galaxies contribute significantly to the build-up of the massiveend of the red sequence. we perform a series of major merger simulations toinvestigate the spatial and velocity structure of the remnants of such mergers.regardless of orbital energy or angular momentum, we find that the stellarremnants lie on the fundamental plane defined by their progenitors, a result ofvirial equilibrium with a small tilt due to an increasing central dark matterfraction. however, the locations of merger remnants in the projections of thefundamental plane -- the faber-jackson and r_e-m_* relations -- depend stronglyon the merger orbit, and the relations steepen significantly from the canonicalscalings (l sigma^4 and r_e m_*^0.6) for mergers on radial orbits. our resultsimply that the projections of the fundamental plane -- but not necessarily theplane itself -- provide a powerful way of investigating the assembly history ofmassive elliptical galaxies, including the brightest cluster galaxies at ornear the centers of galaxy clusters. we argue that most massive ellipticals areformed by anisotropic merging and that their fundamental plane projectionsshould thus differ noticeably from those of lower mass ellipticals even thoughthey should lie on the same fundamental plane. current observations areconsistent with this conclusion. the steepening in the l-sigma relation forluminous ellipticals may also be reflected in a corresponding steepening in them_bh-sigma relation for massive black holes.

astro-ph;0608122	satellite accretion onto massive galaxies with central black holes	minor mergers of galaxies are expected to be common in a hierarchicalcosmology such as $\lambda$cdm and have the potential to significantly affectgalactic structure. in this paper we dissect the case-by-case outcome from aset of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accretingonto a massive elliptical galaxy. we take care to explore cosmologicallyrelevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models thatinclude all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter halos, stellarbulges, and central massive black holes. the effects of several differentparameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum,satellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, andpresence of a black hole at the center of the host. black holes play a crucialrole in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellitesmerging onto a host with a central black hole are more strongly disrupted thanthose merging onto hosts without black holes. orbital parameters play animportant role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on lessbound or more eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on morebound or more circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentricpassages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidalstripping. in addition, satellites with densities typical of faint ellipticalgalaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survivemuch better in the tidal field of the host. over the range of parametersexplored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxycan result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surfacebrightness profile and color of the central part of an elliptical galaxy.

astro-ph;0608474	luminosity dependence in the fundamental plane projections of elliptical  galaxies	we analyze the fundamental plane projections of elliptical galaxies as afunction of luminosity, using a sample of approximately 80,000 galaxies drawnfrom data release 4 (dr4) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we separatebrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) from our main sample and reanalyze theirphotometry due to a problem with the default pipeline sky subtraction for bcgs.the observables we consider are effective radius (r_e), velocity dispersion(sigma), dynamical mass (m_dyn ~ r_e sigma2), effective density (sigma2/r_e2),and effective surface brightness (mu_e). with the exception of the l-m_dyncorrelation, we find evidence of variations in the slope (i.e. the power-lawindex) of the fundamental plane projections with luminosity for our normalelliptical galaxy population. in particular, the radius-luminosity andfaber-jackson relations are steeper at high luminosity relative to lowluminosity, and the more luminous ellipticals become progressively less denseand have lower surface brightnesses than lower luminosity ellipticals. thesevariations can be understood as arising from differing formation histories,with more luminous galaxies having less dissipation. data from the literatureand our reanalysis of bcgs show that bcgs have radius-luminosity andfaber-jackson relations steeper than the brightest non-bcg ellipticals in oursample, consistent with significant growth of bcgs via dissipationless mergers.the variations in slope we find in the faber-jackson relation of non-bcgs arequalitatively similar to that reported in the black hole mass-velocitydispersion (m_bh-sigma) correlation. this similarity is consistent with aroughly constant value of m_bh/m_star over a wide range of early type galaxies,where m_star is the stellar mass.

astro-ph;9901194	galaxy clustering and large-scale structure from z = 0.2 to z = 0.5 in  two norris redshift surveys	(abridged) we present a study of the nature and evolution of large-scalestructure based on two independent redshift surveys of faint field galaxiesconducted with the 176-fiber norris spectrograph on the palomar 200-inchtelescope. the two surveys together sparsely cover ~20 sq. degrees and contain835 r &lt; 21 mag galaxies with redshifts 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. both surveys have amedian redshift of z = 0.30. in order to obtain a rough estimate of the cosmicvariance, we analyze the two surveys independently. we measure the comovingcorrelation length to be 3.70 +/- 0.13 h^-1 mpc at z = 0.30 with a power-lawslope gamma = 1.77 +/- 0.05. dividing the sample into low (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.3) andhigh (0.32 &lt; z &lt; 0.5) redshift intervals, we see no evidence for a change inthe comoving correlation length over the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. similarto the well-established results in the local universe, we find thatintrinsically bright galaxies are more strongly clustered than intrinsicallyfaint galaxies and that galaxies with little ongoing star formation, as judgedfrom the rest-frame equivalent width of the [oii]3727, are more stronglyclustered than galaxies with significant ongoing star formation. the rest-framepairwise velocity dispersion of the sample is 326^+67_-52 km s^-1, ~25% lowerthan typical values measured locally. the appearance of the galaxydistribution, particularly in the more densely sampled abell 104 field, isquite striking. the pattern of sheets and voids which has been observed locallycontinues at least to z ~ 0.5. a friends-of-friends analysis of the galaxydistribution supports the visual impression that &gt; 90% of all galaxies at z &lt;0.5 are part of larger structures with overdensities of &gt; 5.
