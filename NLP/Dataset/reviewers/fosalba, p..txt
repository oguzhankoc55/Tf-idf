1006.3226	tracing the sound horizon scale with photometric redshift surveys	we propose a new method for cosmological parameters extraction using thebaryon acoustic oscillation scale as a standard ruler in deep galaxy surveyswith photometric determination of redshifts. the method consists in a simpleempirical parametric fit to the angular 2-point correlation function w(theta).it is parametrized as a power law to describe the continuum plus a gaussian todescribe the bao bump. the location of the gaussian is used as the basis forthe measurement of the sound horizon scale. this method, although simple,actually provides a robust estimation, since the inclusion of the power law andthe use of the gaussian removes the shifts which affect the local maximum. wediscuss the effects of projection bias, non-linearities, redshift spacedistortions and photo-z precision, and apply our method to a mock catalog ofthe dark energy survey, built upon a large n-body simulation provided by themice collaboration. we discuss the main systematic errors associated to ourmethod and show that they are dominated by the photo-z uncertainty.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2024	planck early results viii: the all-sky early sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  sample	we present the first all-sky sample of galaxy clusters detected blindly bythe planck satellite through the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect from its sixhighest frequencies. this early sz (esz) sample is comprised of 189 candidates,which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. its highreliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validationprocess based on planck internal quality assessments and by externalcross-identification and follow-up observations. planck provides the firstmeasured sz signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known esz clusters.planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meetthe esz signal-to-noise selection criterion. at the submission date, twelve ofthe 20 esz candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmedusing xmm-newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbedmorphologies and low luminosities. the esz clusters are mostly at moderateredshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to therarest and most massive clusters with masses above 10^15 msol.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2039	planck early results: first assessment of the high frequency instrument  in-flight performance	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) is designed to measure thetemperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgroundand galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545and 857 ghz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 ghz), 7' (143 ghz), and 5'(217 ghz and higher). hfi has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 may2009. the bolometers cooled to 100 mk as planned. the settings of the readoutelectronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize hfi's noiseperformance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during groundtesting. observations of mars, jupiter, and saturn verified both the opticalsystem and the time response of the detection chains. the optical beams areclose to predictions from physical optics modeling. the time response of thedetection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. the detectors suffer froman unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. due tothe redundancy of planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percentof data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.the cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation onperiods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of allbolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. only thehigh energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is aprobable source of low frequency noise.

1106.1376	planck early results xxvi: detection with planck and confirmation by  xmm-newton of plck g266.6-27.3, an exceptionally x-ray luminous and massive  galaxy cluster at z~1	we present first results on plck g266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the planck all sky survey. anxmm-newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. with these x-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be m_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. plck g266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of l_x(0.5-2.0 kev)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z &gt; 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, plck g266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. this observationconfirms planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

1109.4852	cross-correlation of spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys:  cosmology from lensing and redshift distortions	cosmological galaxy surveys aim at mapping the largest volumes to test modelswith techniques such as cluster abundance, cosmic shear correlations or baryonacoustic oscillations (bao), which are designed to be independent of galaxybias. here we explore an alternative route to constrain cosmology: samplingmore moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric andspectroscopic surveys. we consider the angular galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation innarrow redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weakgravitational lensing (wl) and redshift space distortions (rsd). including thecross-correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraintson both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history,parametrized by \gamma. the additional information comes from using many narrowredshift bins and from galaxy bias, which is measured both with wl probes andrsd, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately.we show forecasts for a joint w(z) and \gamma figure of merit using linearscales over a deep (i&lt;24) photometric survey and a brighter (i&lt;22.5)spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3%) photometric redshift survey.magnification or shear in the photometric sample produce fom that are of thesame order of magnitude of those of rsd or bao over the spectroscopic sample.however, the cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a fomthat is up to a factor 100 times larger. magnification alone, without shapemeasurements, can also be used for these cross-correlations and can producebetter results than using shear alone. for a spectroscopic follow-up surveystrategy, measuring the spectra of the foreground lenses to perform thiscross-correlation provides 5 times better fom than targeting the higherredshift tail of the galaxy distribution to study bao over a 2.5 times largervolume.

0711.1540	the onion universe: all sky lightcone simulations in spherical shells	galaxy surveys provide a large-scale view of the universe that typically hasa limited line-of-sight or redshift resolution. the lack of radial accuracy inthese surveys can be modelled by picturing the universe as a set of concentricradial shells of finite width around the observer, i.e, an onion-likestructure. we present a new n-body simulation with 2048^3 particles developedat the marenostrum supercomputer with the gadget-2 code. using the lightconeoutput we build a set of angular maps that mimic this onion-like representationof the universe. the onion maps are a highly compressed version of the raw data(i.e. a factor &gt;1000 smaller size for arcminute resolution maps) and theyprovide a new and powerful tool to exploit large scale structure observations.we introduce two basic applications of these maps that are especially usefulfor constraning dark energy properties: the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao)in the galaxy power spectrum and all-sky maps of the weak lensing distortion.using the weak lensing maps, we measure the convergence power spectra andcompare it to halo fit predictions. as a further application, we compute thevariance and higher-order moments of the maps. we show that sampling varianceon scales of few degrees is quite large, resulting in a significant (25% at 10arminute scales) bias in the variance. we caution that current lensing surveyssuch as the cosmos hst should take into account this bias and extra samplingerror in their clustering analyses and inferred cosmological parameterconstraints. finally, we test the importance of projection effects in the weaklensing mass reconstruction. on the mean, the mass calibration works well butit exhibits a large non-gaussian scatter what could induce a large bias in therecovered mass function.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1305.1505	an accurate tool for the fast generation of dark matter halo catalogs	we present a new parallel implementation of the pinpointing orbitcrossing-collapsed hierarchical objects (pinocchio) algorithm, a quick tool,based on lagrangian perturbation theory, for the hierarchical build-up of darkmatter halos in cosmological volumes. to assess its ability to predict halocorrelations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an n-bodysimulation of a 3 gpc/h box sampled with 2048^3 particles taken from the micesuite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. thanks to the fftwlibraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scalingproperties. the cpu time required by pinocchio is a tiny fraction (~1/2000) ofthat required by the mice simulation. varying some of pinocchio numericalparameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in therange allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the mice massfunction of fof halos in the high mass tail. we compare the matter-halo and thehalo-halo power spectra with those of the mice simulation and find that these2-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. in particular, whencatalogs are matched in number density, agreement within ten per cent isachieved for the halo power spectrum. at scales k&gt;0.1 h/mpc, the inaccuracy ofthe zel'dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimateof the power spectrum that can be modeled as a gaussian factor with a dampingscale of d=3 mpc/h at z=0, decreasing at higher redshift. finally, a remarkablematch is obtained for the reduced halo bispectrum, showing a good descriptionof nonlinear halo bias. our results demonstrate the potential of pinocchio asan accurate and flexible tool for generating large ensembles of mock galaxysurveys, with interesting applications for the analysis of large galaxyredshift surveys.

1312.2947	the mice grand challenge lightcone simulation iii: galaxy lensing mocks  from all-sky lensing maps	in paper i of this series (fosalba et al. 2013), we presented a new n-bodylightcone simulation from the mice collaboration, the mice grand challenge(mice-gc), containing about 70 billion dark-matter particles in a (3 gpc)^3comoving volume, from which we built halo and galaxy catalogues using a halooccupation distribution and halo abundance matching technique, as presented inthe companion paper ii (crocce et al. 2013). given its large volume and finemass resolution, the mice-gc simulation also allows an accurate modeling of thelensing observables from upcoming wide and deep galaxy surveys. in the lastpaper of this series (paper iii), we describe the construction of all-skylensing maps, following the "onion universe" approach (fosalba et al. 2008),and discuss their properties in the lightcone up to z=1.4 with sub-arcminspatial resolution. by comparing the convergence power spectrum in the mice-gcto lower mass-resolution (i.e., particle mass ~ 10^11 msun) simulations, wefind that resolution effects are at the 5 % level for multipoles l ~ 10^3 and20 % for l ~ 10^4. resolution effects have a much lower impact on oursimulation, as shown by comparing the mice-gc to recent numerical fits bytakahashi et al 2012. we use the all-sky lensing maps to model galaxy lensingproperties, such as the convergence, shear, and lensed magnitudes andpositions, and validate them thoroughly using galaxy shear auto andcross-correlations in harmonic and configuration space. our results show thatthe galaxy lensing mocks here presented can be used to accurately model lensingobservables down to arcminute scales.

1411.3286	an algorithm to build mock galaxy catalogues using mice simulations	we present a method to build mock galaxy catalogues starting from a halocatalogue that uses halo occupation distribution (hod) recipes as well as thesubhalo abundance matching (sham) technique. combining both prescriptions weare able to push the absolute magnitude of the resulting catalogue to fainterluminosities than using just the sham technique and can interpret our resultsin terms of the hod modelling. we optimize the method by populating withgalaxies friends-of-friends dark matter haloes extracted from the marenostruminstitut de ci\`{e}ncies de l'espai (mice) dark matter simulations andcomparing them to observational constraints. our resulting mock galaxycatalogues manage to reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity functionand the colour-magnitude distribution as observed by the sloan digital skysurvey. they also reproduce the observed galaxy clustering properties as afunction of luminosity and colour. in order to achieve that, the algorithm alsoincludes scatter in the halo mass - galaxy luminosity relation derived fromdirect sham and a modified nfw mass density profile to place satellite galaxiesin their host dark matter haloes. improving on general usage of the hod thatfits the clustering for given magnitude limited samples, our catalogues areconstructed to fit observations at all luminosities considered and thereforefor any luminosity subsample. overall, our algorithm is an economic procedureof obtaining galaxy mock catalogues down to faint magnitudes that are necessaryto understand and interpret galaxy surveys.

1504.03002	wide-field lensing mass maps from des science verification data:  methodology and detailed analysis	weak gravitational lensing allows one to reconstruct the spatial distributionof the projected mass density across the sky. these "mass maps" provide apowerful tool for studying cosmology as they probe both luminous and darkmatter. in this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed fromshear measurements in a 139 sq. deg area from the dark energy survey (des)science verification (sv) data. we compare the distribution of mass with thatof the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. the overdensities inthe reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of opticallydetected clusters. we demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids alongthe line of sight can be identified, exploiting the tight scatter of thecluster photometric redshifts. we cross-correlate the mass map with aforeground magnitude-limited galaxy sample from the same data. our measurementgives results consistent with mock catalogs from n-body simulations thatinclude the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy,lensing, and photo-z catalogs. the statistical significance of thecross-correlation is at the 6.8-sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. amajor goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from avariety of sources, including psf and photo-z uncertainties. we make mapsderived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find theprincipal components. we find that the contribution of systematics to thelensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. in this work,we analyze less than 3% of the final area that will be mapped by the des; thetools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied toforthcoming larger datasets from the survey.

1507.05090	weak lensing by galaxy troughs in des science verification data	we measure the weak lensing shear around galaxy troughs, i.e. the radialalignment of background galaxies relative to underdensities in projections ofthe foreground galaxy field over a wide range of redshift in scienceverification data from the dark energy survey. our detection of the shearsignal is highly significant (10 to 15$\sigma$ for the smallest angular scales)for troughs with the redshift range z in [0.2,0.5] of the projected galaxyfield and angular diameters of 10 arcmin...1{\deg}. these measurements probethe connection between the galaxy, matter density, and convergence fields. byassuming galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density with poissoniannoise, we find agreement of our measurements with predictions in a fiduciallambda cold dark matter model. the prediction for the lensing signal on largetrough scales is virtually independent of the details of the underlying modelfor the connection of galaxies and matter. our comparison of the shear aroundtroughs with that around cylinders with large galaxy counts is consistent witha symmetry between galaxy and matter over- and underdensities. in addition, wemeasure the two-point angular correlation of troughs with galaxies which, incontrast to the lensing signal, is sensitive to galaxy bias on all scales. thelensing signal of troughs and their clustering with galaxies is therefore apromising probe of the statistical properties of matter underdensities andtheir connection to the galaxy field.

1507.05353	joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering:  methodology and forecasts for des	the joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering is apromising method for inferring the growth function of large scale structure.this analysis will be carried out on data from the dark energy survey (des),with its measurements of both the distribution of galaxies and the tangentialshears of background galaxies induced by these foreground lenses. we develop apractical approach to modeling the assumptions and systematic effects affectingsmall scale lensing, which provides halo masses, and large scale galaxyclustering. introducing parameters that characterize the halo occupationdistribution (hod), photometric redshift uncertainties, and shear measurementerrors, we study how external priors on different subsets of these parametersaffect our growth constraints. degeneracies within the hod model, as well asbetween the hod and the growth function, are identified as the dominant sourceof complication, with other systematic effects sub-dominant. the impact of hodparameters and their degeneracies necessitate the detailed joint modeling ofthe galaxy sample that we employ. we conclude that des data will providepowerful constraints on the evolution of structure growth in the universe,conservatively/optimistically constraining the growth function to 7.9\%/4.8\%with its first-year data that covered over 1000 square degrees, and to3.9\%/2.3\% with its full five-year data that will survey 5000 square degrees,including both statistical and systematic uncertainties.

1507.05360	galaxy clustering, photometric redshifts and diagnosis of systematics in  the des science verification data	we study the clustering of galaxies detected at $i&lt;22.5$ in the scienceverification observations of the dark energy survey (des). two-pointcorrelation functions are measured using $2.3\times 10^6$ galaxies over acontiguous 116 deg$^2$ region in five bins of photometric redshift width$\delta z = 0.2$ in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2.$ the impact of photometricredshift errors are assessed by comparing results using a template-basedphoto-$z$ algorithm (bpz) to a machine-learning algorithm (tpz). a companionpaper (leistedt et al 2015) presents maps of several observational variables(e.g. seeing, sky brightness) which could modulate the galaxy density. here wecharacterize and mitigate systematic errors on the measured clustering whicharise from these observational variables, in addition to others such asgalactic dust and stellar contamination. after correcting for systematiceffects we measure galaxy bias over a broad range of linear scales relative tomass clustering predicted from the planck $\lambda$cdm model, finding agreementwith cfhtls measurements with $\chi^2$ of 4.0 (8.7) with 5 degrees of freedomfor the tpz (bpz) redshifts. we test a "linear bias" model, in which the galaxyclustering is a fixed multiple of the predicted non-linear dark-matterclustering. the precision of the data allow us to determine that the linearbias model describes the observed galaxy clustering to $2.5\%$ accuracy down toscales at least $4$ to $10$ times smaller than those on which linear theory isexpected to be sufficient.

1507.05552	cosmology from cosmic shear with des science verification data	we present the first constraints on cosmology from the dark energy survey(des), using weak lensing measurements from the preliminary scienceverification (sv) data. we use 139 square degrees of sv data, which is lessthan 3\% of the full des survey area. using cosmic shear 2-point measurementsover three redshift bins we find $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.81\pm 0.06$ (68\% confidence), after marginalising over 7 systematics parametersand 3 other cosmological parameters. we examine the robustness of our resultsto the choice of data vector and systematics assumed, and find them to bestable. about $20$\% of our error bar comes from marginalising over shear andphotometric redshift calibration uncertainties. the current state-of-the-artcosmic shear measurements from cfhtlens are mildly discrepant with thecosmological constraints from planck cmb data; our results are consistent withboth datasets. our uncertainties are $\sim$30\% larger than those from cfhtlenswhen we carry out a comparable analysis of the two datasets, which we attributelargely to the lower number density of our shear catalogue. we investigateconstraints on dark energy and find that, with this small fraction of the fullsurvey, the des sv constraints make negligible impact on the planckconstraints. the moderate disagreement between the cfhtlens and planck valuesof $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ is present regardless of the value of$w$.

1507.05647	mapping and simulating systematics due to spatially-varying observing  conditions in des science verification data	spatially-varying depth and characteristics of observing conditions, such asseeing, airmass, or sky background, are major sources of systematicuncertainties in modern galaxy survey analyses, in particular in deepmulti-epoch surveys. we present a framework to extract and project thesesources of systematics onto the sky, and apply it to the dark energy survey(des) to map the observing conditions of the science verification (sv) data.the resulting distributions and maps of sources of systematics are used inseveral analyses of des sv to perform detailed null tests with the data, andalso to incorporate systematics in survey simulations. we illustrate thecomplementarity of these two approaches by comparing the sv data with thebcc-ufig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the dessv images. we analyse the bcc-ufig simulation to construct galaxy samplesmimicking those used in sv galaxy clustering studies. we show that thespatially-varying survey depth imprinted in the observed galaxy densities andthe redshift distributions of the sv data are successfully reproduced by thesimulation and well-captured by the maps of observing conditions. the combineduse of the maps, the sv data and the bcc-ufig simulation allows us to quantifythe impact of spatial systematics on $n(z)$, the redshift distributionsinferred using photometric redshifts. we conclude that spatial systematics inthe sv data are mainly due to seeing fluctuations and are under control incurrent clustering and weak lensing analyses. the framework presented here isrelevant to all multi-epoch surveys, and will be essential for exploitingfuture surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst), which willrequire detailed null-tests and realistic end-to-end image simulations tocorrectly interpret the deep, high-cadence observations of the sky.

1512.04535	cross-correlation of gravitational lensing from des science verification  data with spt and planck lensing	we measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb). the effects of gravitational lensing ondifferent sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same massfluctuations. we use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the darkenergy survey (des) science verification data and overlapping cmb lensing fromthe south pole telescope (spt) and planck. the des source galaxies have amedian redshift of $z_{\rm med} {\sim} 0.7$, while the cmb lensing kernel isbroad and peaks at $z{\sim}2$. the resulting cross-correlation is maximallysensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\sim}0.44$. assuming the planck 2015best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the des$\times$spt cross-power is found tobe $a = 0.88 \pm 0.30$ and that from des$\times$planck to be $a = 0.86 \pm0.39$, where $a=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. these areconsistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9\sigma$ and $2.2 \sigma$ respectively. we demonstrate that our results arerobust to a number of important systematic effects including the shearmeasurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and cmblensing systematics. significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes wouldincrease the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate avalue of $a = 1.08 \pm 0.36$ for des$\times$spt when we correct theobservations with a simple ia model. with three measurements of thiscross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliableevidence for any deviation from the expected lcdm level of cross-correlation,given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact ofsystematic errors, particularly ias. we provide forecasts for the expectedsignal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year des survey and spt-3g.

0807.0535	measuring baryon acoustic oscillations along the line of sight with  photometric redshifs: the pau survey	baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) provide a standard ruler of known physicallength, making it a promising probe of the nature of dark energy. the detectionof bao requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. "transversal"(angular distance) bao measure the angular size of this scale, while"line-of-sight" (or "radial") bao require precise redshifts, but provide adirect measurement of the hubble parameter at different redshifts, a moresensitive probe of dark energy. the main goal of this paper is to show that aprecision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure bao in the radialdirection. this precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using afilter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 a, from ~4000 a to ~ 8000 a, supplemented by two broad-band filters. we describe apractical implementation, a new galaxy survey, pau, to be carried out with atelescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years. we expect to measure positions andredshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with l &gt; l* and i_ab &lt;22.5 in the interval 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, with sigma_z &lt; 0.003(1 + z). thispopulation has a number density n &gt; 10^-3 mpc^-3 h^3 within the 9 (gpc/h)^3volume of the survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the baoscale is not limited by shot-noise. by itself, such a survey will deliverprecisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, ifassumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined withfuture cmb measurements. in addition, pau will yield high-quality redshift andlow-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies.

astro-ph;0107523	2-point moments in cosmological large scale structure: i. theory and  comparison with simulations	we present new perturbation theory (pt) predictions in the spherical collapse(sc) model for the 2-point moments of the large-scale distribution of darkmatter density in the universe. we assume that these fluctuations grow undergravity from small gaussian initial conditions. these predictions are comparedwith numerical simulations and with previous pt results to assess their domainof validity. we find that the sc model provides in practice a more accuratedescription of 2-point moments than previous tree-level pt calculations. theagreement with simulations is excellent for a wide range of scales (5-50 mpc/h)and fluctuations amplitudes (0.02-2 variance). when normalized to unit variancethese results are independent of the cosmological parameters and of the initialamplitude of fluctuations. the 2-point moments provide a convenient tool tostudy the statistical properties of gravitational clustering for fairlynon-linear scales and complicated survey geometries, such as those probing theclustering of the ly-alpha forest. in this context, the perturbative scpredictions presented here, provide a simple and novel way to test thegravitational instability paradigm.

astro-ph;0210306	cosmological constraints from archeops	we analyze the cosmological constraints that archeops places on adiabaticcold dark matter models with passive power-law initial fluctuations. becauseits angular power spectrum has small bins in l and large l coverage down tocobe scales, archeops provides a precise determination of the first acousticpeak in terms of position at multipole l_peak=220 +- 6, height and width. ananalysis of archeops data in combination with other cmb datasets constrains thebaryon content of the universe, omega(b)h^2 = 0.022 (+0.003,-0.004), compatiblewith big-bang nucleosynthesis and with a similar accuracy. using cosmologicalpriors obtainedfrom recent non-cmb data leads to yet tighter constraints on thetotal density, e.g. omega(tot)=1.00 (+0.03,-0.02) using the hst determinationof the hubble constant. an excellent absolute calibration consistency is foundbetween archeops and other cmb experiments, as well as with the previouslyquoted best fit model.the spectral index n is measured to be 1.04 (+0.10,-0.12)when the optical depth to reionization, tau, is allowed to vary as a freeparameter, and 0.96 (+0.03,-0.04) when tau is fixed to zero, both in goodagreement with inflation.

astro-ph;0306222	first detection of polarization of the submillimetre diffuse galactic  dust emission by archeops	we present the first determination of the galactic polarized emission at 353ghz by archeops. the data were taken during the arctic night of february 7,2002 after the balloon--borne instrument was launched by cnes from the swedishesrange base near kiruna. in addition to the 143 ghz and 217 ghz frequencybands dedicated to cmb studies, archeops had one 545 ghz and six 353 ghzbolometers mounted in three polarization sensitive pairs that were used forgalactic foreground studies. we present maps of the i, q, u stokes parametersover 17% of the sky and with a 13 arcmin resolution at 353 ghz (850 microns).they show a significant galactic large scale polarized emission coherent on thelongitude ranges [100, 120] and [180, 200] deg. with a degree of polarizationat the level of 4-5%, in agreement with expectations from starlightpolarization measurements. some regions in the galactic plane (gem ob1,cassiopeia) show an even stronger degree of polarization in the range 10-20%.those findings provide strong evidence for a powerful grain alignment mechanismthroughout the interstellar medium and a coherent magnetic field coplanar tothe galactic plane. this magnetic field pervades even some dense clouds.extrapolated to high galactic latitude, these results indicate thatinterstellar dust polarized emission is the major foreground for planck-hfi cmbpolarization measurement.

astro-ph;0501427	temperature and polarization angular power spectra of galactic dust  radiation at 353 ghz as measured by archeops	we present the first measurement of temperature and polarization angularpower spectra of the diffuse emission of galactic dust at 353 ghz as seen byarcheops on 20% of the sky. the temperature angular power spectrum iscompatible with that provided by the extrapolation to 353 ghz of iras and dirbemaps using \cite{fds} model number 8. for galactic latitudes $|b| \geq 5$ degwe report a 4 sigma detection of large scale ($3\leq \ell \leq 8$)temperature-polarization cross-correlation $(\ell+1)c_\ell^{te}/2\pi = 76\pm 21\mu\rm{k_{rj}}^2$ and set upper limits to the $e$ and $b$ modes at $11\mu\rm{k_{rj}}^2$. for galactic latitudes $|b| \geq 10$ deg, on the sameangular scales, we report a 2 sigma detection of temperature-polarizationcross-correlation $(\ell+1)c_\ell^{te}/2\pi = 24\pm 13 \mu\rm{k_{rj}}^2$. theseresults are then extrapolated to 100 ghz to estimate the contamination in cmbmeasurements by polarized diffuse galactic dust emission. the $te$ signal isthen $1.7\pm0.5$ and $0.5\pm0.3 \mu\rm{k^2_{cmb}}$ for $|b| \geq 5$ and 10 deg.respectively. the upper limit on $e$ and $b$ becomes $0.2 \mu\rm{k^2_{cmb}}(2\sigma)$. if polarized dust emission at higher galactic latitude cuts issimilar to the one we report here, then dust polarized radiation will be amajor foreground for determining the polarization power spectra of the cmb athigh frequencies above 100 ghz.

astro-ph;9705116	non-gaussian bounds in the variance from small scale cmb observations	we compare the latest results from cmb experiments at scales around $l_e \sim150$ over different parts of the sky to test the hypothesis that they are drawnfrom a gaussian distribution, as is usually assumed. using both the diagonaland the full covariance $\chi^2$ test, we compare the data with different setsof strategies and find in all cases incompatibility with the gaussianhypothesis above the one-sigma level. we next show how to include a genericnon-gaussian signal in the data analysis. results from cmb observations can bemade compatible with each other by assuming a non-gaussian distribution for thesignal, with a kurtosis at a level $b_4 = &lt;{\delta_t^4}&gt;_c/{&lt;{\delta_t^2}&gt;_c}^2 \simeq 90$. a possible interpretation for this result isthat the initial fluctuations at the surface of last scattering are stronglynon-gaussian. another interpretation is that the systematic errors have beenunderstimated in all observations by a factor of two. other explanationsinclude foreground contamination, non-linear effects or a combination of them.

astro-ph;9712095	cosmological perturbation theory and the spherical collapse model - i.  gaussian initial conditions	we present a simple and intuitive approximation for solving perturbationtheory (pt) of small cosmic fluctuations. we consider only the sphericallysymmetric or monopole contribution to the pt integrals, which yields the exactresult for tree-graphs (i.e. at leading order). we find that the non-linearevolution in lagrangian space is then given by a simple {\it local}transformation over the initial conditions, although it is not local in eulerspace. this transformation is found to be described the spherical collapse (sc)dynamics, as it is the exact solution in the shearless (and therefore local)approximation in lagrangian space. taking advantage of this property, it isstraightforward to derive the one-point cumulants, $\xi_j$, for both theunsmoothed and smoothed density fields to {\it arbitrary} order in theperturbative regime. to leading order this reproduces, and provides with asimple explanation for, the exact results obtained by bernardeau (1992, 1994).we then show that the sc model leads to accurate estimates for the nextcorrective terms when compared to the results derived in the exact perturbationtheory making use of the loop calculations (scoccimarro &amp; frieman 1996). theagreement is within a few per cent for the hierarchical ratios $s_j=\xi_j/\xi_2^{j-1}$. we compare our analytic results to n-body simulations,which turn out to be in very good agreement up to scales where $\sigma \approx1$. a similar treatment is presented to estimate higher order corrections inthe zel'dovich approximation. these results represent a powerful and readilyusable tool to produce analytical predictions to describe the gravitationalclustering of large scale structure in the weakly non-linear regime.

astro-ph;9802165	cosmological perturbation theory and the spherical collapse model - iii.  the velocity divergence field and the $\omega$ dependence	cosmological perturbation theory (pt) is a useful tool to study the cumulantsof the density and velocity fields in the large scale structure of theuniverse. in papers i &amp; ii of this series we saw that the spherical collapse(sc) model provides with the exact solution to pt at tree-level and gives agood approximation to the loop corrections (next to leading orders), indicatingnegligible tidal effects. here, we derive predictions for the (smoothed)cumulants of the velocity divergence field $\theta \equiv \nabla\cdot\vv$ foran irrotational fluid in the sc model. by comparing with the exact analyticresults by scoccimarro &amp; frieman (1996), it is shown that, at least for theunsmoothed case, the loop corrections to the cumulants of $\theta$ aredominated by tidal effects. however, most of the tidal contribution seems tocancel out when computing the hierarchical ratios, $t_j = {&lt;\theta^j&gt;  / &lt;\theta^2&gt;^{j-1}}$. we also extend the work presented in papers i &amp; ii togive predictions for the cumulants of the density and velocity divergencefields in non-flat spaces. in particular, we show the equivalence between thespherically symmetric solution to the equations of motion in the sc model(given in terms of the density) and that of the lagrangian pt approach (interms of the displacement field). it is shown that the $\omega$-dependence isvery weak for both cosmic fields even at one-loop (a 10% effect at most),except for the overall factor $f(\omega)$ that couples to the velocitydivergence.

astro-ph;9906296	gravitational evolution of the large-scale probability density  distribution: the edgeworth &amp; gamma expansions	the gravitational evolution of the cosmic one-point probability distributionfunction (pdf) has been estimated using an analytic approximation that combinesgravitational perturbation theory with the edgeworth expansion around agaussian pdf. despite the remarkable success of the edgeworth expansion inmodeling the weakly non-linear growth of fluctuations around the peak of thecosmic pdf, it fails to reproduce the expected behaviour in the tails of thedistribution. besides, this expansion is ill-defined as it predicts negativedensities and negative probabilities for the cosmic fields. this is a naturalconsequence of using an expansion around the gaussian distribution, which isnot rigorously well-defined when describing a positive variate, such as thedensity field. here we present an alternative to the edgeworth series based onan expansion around the gamma pdf. the gamma expansion is designed to convergewhen the pdf exhibits exponential tails. the proposed expansion is bettersuited for describing a real pdf as it always yields positive densities and thepdf is effectively positive-definite. we compare the performance of theedgeworth and the gamma expansions for a wide dynamical range making use ofcosmological n-body simulations and assess their range of validity. in general,the gamma expansion provides an interesting and simple alternative to theedgeworth series and it should be useful for modeling non-gaussian pdfs inother contexts, such as in the cosmic microwave background.

0811.3915	cmbpol mission concept study: prospects for polarized foreground removal	in this report we discuss the impact of polarized foregrounds on a futurecmbpol satellite mission. we review our current knowledge of galactic polarizedemission at microwave frequencies, including synchrotron and thermal dustemission. we use existing data and our understanding of the physical behaviorof the sources of foreground emission to generate sky templates, and start toassess how well primordial gravitational wave signals can be separated fromforeground contaminants for a cmbpol mission. at the estimated foregroundminimum of ~100 ghz, the polarized foregrounds are expected to be lower than aprimordial polarization signal with tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.01, in a smallpatch (~1%) of the sky known to have low galactic emission. over 75% of the skywe expect the foreground amplitude to exceed the primordial signal by about afactor of eight at the foreground minimum and on scales of two degrees. only onthe largest scales does the polarized foreground amplitude exceed theprimordial signal by a larger factor of about 20. the prospects for detectingan r=0.01 signal including degree-scale measurements appear promising, with 5sigma_r ~0.003 forecast from multiple methods. a mission that observes a rangeof scales offers better prospects from the foregrounds perspective than onetargeting only the lowest few multipoles. we begin to explore how optimizingthe composition of frequency channels in the focal plane can maximize ourability to perform component separation, with a range of typically 40 &lt; nu &lt;300 ghz preferred for ten channels. foreground cleaning methods are already inplace to tackle a cmbpol mission data set, and further investigation of theoptimization and detectability of the primordial signal will be useful formission design.
