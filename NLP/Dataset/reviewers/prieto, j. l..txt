0706.4088	a study of the type ia/iin supernova 2005gj from x-ray to the infrared:  paper i	we present extensive ugrizyhjk photometry and optical spectroscopy of sn2005gj obtained by the sdss-ii and csp supernova projects, which give excellentcoverage during the first 150 days after the time of explosion. these data showthat sn 2005gj is the second clear case, after sn 2002ic, of a thermonuclearexplosion in a dense circumstellar environment. both the presence of singly anddoubly ionized iron-peak elements (feiii and weak sii, siii) near maximum lightas well as the spectral evolution show that sn 2002ic-like events are type iaexplosions. independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosityof sn 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium isstronger than in sn 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the balmeremission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higherclose to maximum light. the velocity evolution of the halpha components suggestthat the csm around sn 2005gj is clumpy and it has a flatter densitydistribution compared with the steady wind solution, in agreement with sn2002ic. an early x-ray observation with chandra gives an upper-limit on themass loss rate from the companion of &lt; 2x10^{-4} msun/yr.

0908.1990	discovery of the extremely energetic supernova 2008fz	we report on the discovery and initial observations of the energetic type iinsupernova (sn), 2008fz. the optical energy emitted by sn 2008fz (based on thelight curve over a 88 day period), is possibly the most ever observed for asupernova (1.4 x 10^51 erg). the event was more luminous than the type iin sn2006gy, but exhibited same smooth, slowly evolving light curve. as ischaracteristic of type iin sn, the early spectra of 2008fz initially exhibitednarrow balmer lines which were replaced by a broader component at later times.the spectra also show a blue continuum with no signs of ca or na absorption,suggesting that there is little extinction due to intragalatic dust in the hostor circumstellar material. no host galaxy is identified in prior coadded imagesreaching r ~ 22. from the supernova's redshift, z=0.133, we place an upperlimit on the host of m_r=-17. the presence of the sn within such a faint hostfollows the majority of recently discovered highly luminous sn. a possiblereason for this occurrence is the very high star formation rate occurring inlow-mass galaxies in combination with the low metallicity environment, whichmakes the production of very massive stars possible. we determine the peakabsolute magnitude of the event to be m_v = -22.3 from the initial photometryand the redshift distance, placing it among the most luminous supernovaediscovered.

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

1001.3681	census of self-obscured massive stars in nearby galaxies with spitzer:  implications for understanding the progenitors of sn 2008s-like transients	a new link in the causal mapping between massive stars and potentially fatalexplosive transients opened with the 2008 discovery of the dust-obscuredprogenitors of the luminous outbursts in ngc 6946 and ngc 300. here we carryout a systematic mid-ir photometric search for massive, luminous, self-obscuredstars in four nearby galaxies: m33, ngc 300, m81, and ngc 6946. for detection,we use only the 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron irac bands, as these can still beused for multi-epoch spitzer surveys of nearby galaxies (=&lt;10 mpc). we combinefamiliar psf and aperture-photometry with an innovative application of imagesubtraction to catalog the self-obscured massive stars in these galaxies. inparticular, we verify that stars analogous to the progenitors of the ngc 6946(sn 2008s) and ngc 300 transients are truly rare in all four galaxies: theirnumber may be as low as ~1 per galaxy at any given moment. this resultempirically supports the idea that the dust-enshrouded phase is a veryshort-lived phenomenon in the lives of many massive stars and that theseobjects constitute a natural extension of the agb sequence. we also providemid-ir catalogs of sources in ngc 300, m81, and ngc 6946.

1006.4162	sdwfs-mt-1: a self-obscured luminous supernova at z~0.2	we report the discovery of a six-month-long mid-infrared transient,sdwfs-mt-1 (aka sn 2007va), in the spitzer deep, wide-field survey of the noaodeep wide-field survey bootes field. the transient, located in a z=0.19 lowluminosity (m_[4.5]~-18.6 mag, l/l_milkyway~0.01) metal-poor (12+log(o/h)~7.8)irregular galaxy, peaked at a mid-infrared absolute magnitude of m_[4.5]~-24.2in the 4.5 micron spitzer/irac band and emitted a total energy of at least10^51 ergs. the optical emission was likely fainter than the mid-infrared,although our constraints on the optical emission are poor because the transientpeaked when the source was "behind" the sun. the spitzer data are consistentwith emission by a modified black body with a temperature of ~1350 k. we ruleout a number of scenarios for the origin of the transient such as a galacticstar, agn activity, grb, tidal disruption of a star by a black hole andgravitational lensing. the most plausible scenario is a supernova explodinginside a massive, optically thick circumstellar medium, composed of multipleshells of previously ejected material. if the proposed scenario is correct,then a significant fraction (~10%) of the most luminous supernova may beself-enshrouded by dust not only before but also after the supernova occurs.the spectral energy distribution of the progenitor of such a supernova would bea slightly cooler version of eta carina, peaking at 20-30 microns.

1007.0011	the sn 2008s progenitor star: gone or again self-obscured?	we obtained late-time optical and near-ir imaging of sn 2008s with the largebinocular telescope (lbt). we find that (1) it is again invisible at optical(ubvr) wavelengths to magnitude limits of approximately 25 mag, and (2) whiledetected in the near-ir (hk) at approximately 20 mag, it is fading rapidly. thenear-ir detections in march and may 2010 are consistent with dust emission at ablackbody temperature of t ~ 900 k and a total luminosity of l ~ 40000 lsun,comparable to the luminosity of the obscured progenitor star. if it is asupernova, the near-ir emission is likely due to shock heated dust since theelapsed time from peak is too long to support a near-ir dust echo and thedecline in luminosity is shallower than the 56co slope. if it is reprocessedemission from a surviving progenitor, a dust photosphere must havereestablished itself closer to the star than before the transient (~40 aurather than 150 au), unless there is a second, cooler dust component thatdominates at mid-ir wavelengths. the continued rapid fading at roughly constanttemperature favors transient emission, but the sed peaks in the mid-ir andfuture spitzer observations will be needed to close the case.

0709.2376	lbt discovery of a yellow supergiant eclipsing binary in the dwarf  galaxy holmberg ix	in a variability survey of m81 using the large binocular telescope we havediscovered a peculiar eclipsing binary (mv ~ -7.1) in the field of the dwarfgalaxy holmberg ix. it has a period of 272 days and the light curve is well-fitby an overcontact model in which both stars are overflowing their roche lobes.it is composed by two yellow supergiants (v-i ~ 1 mag, t_eff = 4800 k), ratherthan the far more common red or blue supergiants. such systems must be rare.while we failed to find any similar systems in the literature, we did, howevernote a second example. the smc f0 supergiant r47 is a bright (mv ~ -7.5)periodic variable whose all sky automated survey (asas) light curve is well-fitas a contact binary with a 181 day period. we propose that these systems arethe progenitors of supernovae like sn 2004et and sn 2006ov, which appeared tohave yellow progenitors. the binary interactions (mass transfer, mass loss)limit the size of the supergiant to give it a higher surface temperature thanan isolated star at the same core evolutionary stage. we also discuss thepossibility of this variable being a long-period cepheid.

1106.3071	super-chandrasekhar sne ia strongly prefer metal-poor environments	we discuss the emerging trend that super-chandrasekhar type ia supernovae(scsne) with progenitor mass estimates significantly exceeding 1.4 m_sun tendto explode in metal-poor environments. while taubenberger et al. 2011 notedthat some of the scsne host galaxies are relatively metal-poor, we focusquantitatively on their locations in the hosts to point out that in three outof four cases, the scsne explosions occurred in the outer edge of the disks oftheir hosts. it is therefore very likely that their progenitors had far lowermetallicities than those implied by the metallicity of their hosts' centralregions. in two cases (sn 2003fg and sn 2009dc) the explosion sites wereoutside 99% of the host's light, and in one case (sn 2006gz) the host's radialmetallicity slope indicates that the explosion site is in a metal-poor region.the fourth case (sn 2007if) has the lowest spectroscopically measured sn iahost metallicity (childress et al. 2011. it may be possible to explain each ofthese unusually bright events through some progenitor scenario specific to thatcase, but a much simpler and straightforward conclusion would be to ascribe thecontrolling factor to the only physical aspect they have in common --- metalpoor environments.

1112.2210	light echoes reveal an unexpectedly cool eta carinae during its  19th-century great eruption	eta carinae (eta car) is one of the most massive binary stars in the milkyway. it became the second-brightest star in the sky during its mid-19th century"great eruption," but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates ofbrightness). its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in thatit exceeded the eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. because it is only 2.3kpc away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejectedmass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, eta carejected more than 10 m_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of atypical core-collapse supernova without destroying the star. here we report thediscovery of light echoes of eta carinae which appear to be from the 1838-1858great eruption. spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, whichare blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansionspeeds. the light-echo spectra correlate best with those of g2-g5 supergiantspectra, which have effective temperatures of ~5000 k. in contrast to the classof extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogs of eta car's great eruption,the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly cooler than allowedby standard opaque wind models. this indicates that other physical mechanismslike an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.

1208.3455	sn 2007bg: the complex circumstellar environment around one of the most  radio-luminous broad-lined type ic supernovae	in this paper we present the results of the radio light curve and x-rayobservations of broad-lined type ic sn 2007bg. the light curve shows threedistinct phases of spectral and temporal evolution, implying that the sne shocklikely encountered at least 3 different circumstellar medium regimes. weinterpret this as the progenitor of sn 2007bg having at least two distinctmass-loss episodes (i.e., phases 1 and 3) during its final stages of evolution,yielding a highly-stratified circumstellar medium. modelling the phase 1 lightcurve as a freely-expanding, synchrotron-emitting shell, self-absorbed by itsown radiating electrons, requires a progenitor mass-loss rate of\dot{m}~1.9x10^{-6}(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) solar masses per year for the lastt~20(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) yr before explosion, and a total energy of the radioemitting ejecta of e\sim1x10^{48} erg after 10 days from explosion. this placessn 2007bg among the most energetic type ib/c events. we interpret the secondphase as a sparser "gap" region between the two winds stages. phase 3 shows asecond absorption turn-on before rising to a peak luminosity 2.6 times higherthan in phase 1. assuming this luminosity jump is due to a circumstellar mediumdensity enhancement from a faster previous mass-loss episode, we estimate thatthe phase 3 mass-loss rate could be as high as \dot{m}&lt;~4.3x10^{-4}(v_{w}/1000km s^{-1}) solar masses per year. the phase 3 wind would have transitioneddirectly into the phase 1 wind for a wind speed difference of ~2. in summary,the radio light curve provides robust evidence for dramatic global changes inat least some ic-bl progenitors just prior (~10-1000 yr) to explosion. theobserved luminosity of this sn is the highest observed for anon-gamma-ray-burst broad-lined type ic sn, reaching l_{8.46 ghz}~1x10^{29} erghz^{-1} s^{-1}, ~567 days after explosion.

0712.2239	go long, go deep: finding optical jet breaks for swift-era grbs with the  lbt	using the 8.4m large binocular telescope, we observed six grb afterglows from2.8 hours to 30.8 days after the burst triggers to systematically probe thelate time behaviors of afterglows including jet breaks, flares, and supernovabumps. we detected five afterglows with sloan r' magnitudes ranging from23.0-26.3 mag. the depth of our observations allows us to extend the temporalbaseline for measuring jet breaks by another decade in time scale. we detectedtwo jet breaks and a third candidate, all of which are not detectable withoutdeep, late time optical observations. in the other three cases, we do notdetect the jet breaks either because of contamination from the host galaxylight, the presence of a supernova bump, or the intrinsic faintness of theoptical afterglow.  this suggests that the basic picture that grbs are collimated is still validand that the apparent lack of swift jet breaks is due to poorly sampledafterglow light curves, particularly at late times.

1301.6168	evidence for a milky way tidal stream reaching beyond 100 kpc	we present the analysis of 1,207 rr lyrae found in photometry taken by thecatalina survey's mount lemmon telescope. by combining accurate distances forthese stars with measurements for ~14,000 type-ab rr lyrae from the catalinaschmid telescope, we reveal an extended association that reaches galactocentricdistances beyond 100 kpc and overlaps the sagittarius streams system. thisresult confirms earlier evidence for the existence of an outer halo tidalstream resulting from a disrupted stellar system. by comparing the rr lyraesource density with that expected based on halo models, we find the detectionhas ~8 sigma significance. we investigate the distances, radial velocities,metallicities, and period-amplitude distribution of the rr lyrae. we find thatboth radial velocities and distances are inconsistent with current models ofthe sagittarius stream. we also find tentative evidence for a division insource metallicities for the most distant sources. following prior analyses, wecompare the locations and distances of the rr lyrae with photometricallyselected candidate horizontal branch stars and find supporting evidence thatthis structure spans at least 60 deg of the sky. we investigate the prospectsof an association between the stream and unusual globular cluster ngc 2419.

0801.3297	a measurement of the rate of type-ia supernovae at redshift $z\approx$  0.1 from the first season of the sdss-ii supernova survey	we present a measurement of the rate of type ia supernovae (sne ia) from thefirst of three seasons of data from the sdss-ii supernova survey. for thismeasurement, we include 17 sne ia at redshift $z\le0.12$. assuming a flatcosmology with $\omega_m = 0.3=1-\omega_\lambda$, we find a volumetric sn iarate of $[2.93^{+0.17}_{-0.04}({\rm systematic})^{+0.90}_{-0.71}({\rmstatistical})] \times 10^{-5} {\rm sne} {\rm mpc}^{-3} h_{70}^3 {\rmyear}^{-1}$, at a volume-weighted mean redshift of 0.09. this result isconsistent with previous measurements of the sn ia rate in a similar redshiftrange. the systematic errors are well controlled, resulting in the most precisemeasurement of the sn ia rate in this redshift range. we use a maximumlikelihood method to fit sn rate models to the sdss-ii supernova survey data incombination with other rate measurements, thereby constraining models for theredshift-evolution of the sn ia rate. fitting the combined data to a simplepower-law evolution of the volumetric sn ia rate, $r_v \propto (1+z)^{\beta}$,we obtain a value of $\beta = 1.5 \pm 0.6$, i.e. the sn ia rate is determinedto be an increasing function of redshift at the $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ level.fitting the results to a model in which the volumetric sn rate,$r_v=a\rho(t)+b\dot \rho(t)$, where $\rho(t)$ is the stellar mass density and$\dot \rho(t)$ is the star formation rate, we find $a = (2.8 \pm 1.2) \times10^{-14} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1} \mathrm{year}^{-1}$, $b =(9.3^{+3.4}_{-3.1})\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1}$.

1309.6320	identification of red supergiants in nearby galaxies with mid-ir  photometry	the role of episodic mass loss in massive star evolution is one of the mostimportant open questions of current stellar evolution theory. episodic massloss produces dust and therefore causes evolved massive stars to be veryluminous in the mid-infrared and dim at optical wavelengths. we aim to increasethe number of investigated luminous mid-ir sources to shed light on the latestages of these objects. to achieve this we employed mid-ir selection criteriato identity dusty evolved massive stars in two nearby galaxies. the method isbased on mid-ir colors, using 3.6 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m photometry fromarchival spitzer space telescope images of nearby galaxies and j-bandphotometry from 2mass. we applied our criteria to two nearby star-forming dwarfirregular galaxies, sextans a and ic 1613, selecting eight targets, which wefollowed up with spectroscopy. our spectral classification and analysis yieldedthe discovery of two m-type supergiants in ic 1613, three k-type supergiantsand one candidate f-type giant in sextans a, and two foreground m giants. weshow that the proposed criteria provide an independent way for identifyingdusty evolved massive stars, that can be extended to all nearby galaxies withavailable spitzer/irac images at 3.6 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m.

0802.0456	a survey about nothing: monitoring a million supergiants for failed  supernovae	extragalactic transient searches have historically been limited to lookingfor the appearance of new sources such as supernovae. it is now possible tocarry out a new kind of survey that will do the opposite, that is, search forthe disappearance of massive stars. this will entail the systematic observationof galaxies within a distance of 10 mpc in order to watch ~10^6 supergiants.reaching this critical number ensures that something will occur yearly, sincethese massive stars must end their lives with a core collapse within ~10^6years. using deep imaging and image subtraction it is possible to determine thefates of these stars whether they end with a bang (supernova) or a whimper(fall out of sight). such a survey would place completely new limits on thetotal rate of all core collapses, which is critical for determining thevalidity of supernova models. it would also determine the properties ofsupernova progenitors, better characterize poorly understood opticaltransients, such as eta carina-like mass ejections, find and characterize largenumbers of cepheids, luminous blue variables and eclipsing binaries, and allowthe discovery of any new phenomena that inhabit this relatively unexploredparameter space.

1311.6610	vortex pinning vs superconducting wire network: origin of periodic  oscillations induced by applied magnetic fields in superconducting films with  arrays of nanomagnets	hybrid magnetic arrays embedded in superconducting films are ideal systems tostudy the competition between different physical (such as the coherence length)and structural length scales such as available in artificially producedstructures. this interplay leads to oscillation in many magnetically dependentsuperconducting properties such as the critical currents, resistivity andmagnetization. these effects are generally analyzed using two distinct modelsbased on vortex pinning or wire network. in this work, we show that formagnetic dot arrays, as opposed to antidot (i.e holes) arrays, vortex pinningis the main mechanism for field induced oscillations in resistance r(h),critical current ic(h), magnetization m(h) and ac-susceptibility xac(h) in abroad temperature range. due to the coherence length divergence at tc, acrossover to wire network behavior is experimentally found. while pinningoccurs in a wide temperature range up to tc, wire network behavior is onlypresent in a very narrow temperature window close to tc. in this temperatureinterval, contributions from both mechanisms are operational but can beexperimentally distinguished.

1401.4064	improved cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the sdss-ii  and snls supernova samples	we present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type iasupernova (sn ia) observations obtained by the sdss-ii and snls collaborations.the data set includes several low-redshift samples (z&lt;0.1), all 3 seasons fromthe sdss-ii (0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.4), and 3 years from snls (0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1) and totals\ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae with high quality lightcurves. we have followed the methods and assumptions of the snls 3-year dataanalysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition ofthe full sdss-ii spectroscopically-confirmed sn ia sample in both the trainingof the salt2 light curve model and in the hubble diagram analysis (\nsdsscsne), 2) inter-calibration of the snls and sdss surveys and reduced systematicuncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect tothe cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errorsassociated with the salt2 modeling of sn ia light-curves. we producerecalibrated sn ia light-curves and associated distances for the sdss-ii andsnls samples. the large sdss-ii sample provides an effective, independent,low-z anchor for the hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error fromcalibration systematics in the low-z sn sample. for a flat lcdm cosmology wefind omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recentcmb measurement from the planck and wmap experiments. our result is 1.8sigma(stat+sys) different than the previously published result of snls 3-year data.the change is due primarily to improvements in the snls photometriccalibration. when combined with cmb constraints, we measure a constantdark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flatuniverse. adding bao distance measurements gives similar constraints:w=-1.027+-0.055.

(2012). by obtaining images and spectra at the same light echo positionbetween 2011 and 2014, we follow the evolution of the great eruption on athree-year timescale. we find remarkable changes in the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of the echo light. the $i$-band light curve shows adecline of $\sim 0.9$ mag in $\sim 1$ year after the peak observed in early2011 and a flattening at later times. the spectra show a pure-absorption earlyg-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the[ca ii] triplet develop strong p-cygni profiles and we see the appearance of[ca ii] 7291,7324 doublet in emission. these emission features and theirevolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some type iinsupernovae and supernova impostors. most surprisingly, starting $\sim 300$ daysafter peak brightness, the spectra show strong molecular transitions of cn at$\gtrsim 6800$ \aa. the appearance of these cn features can be explained if theejecta are strongly nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modernspectroscopic studies of the bipolar homunculus nebula. given the spectroscopicevolution of the light echo, velocities of the main features, and detection ofstrong cn, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to thehomunculus nebula.

0805.4607	scattered-light echoes from the historical galactic supernovae  cassiopeia a and tycho (sn 1572)	we report the discovery of an extensive system of scattered light echoarclets associated with the recent supernovae in the local neighbourhood of themilky way: tycho (sn 1572) and cassiopeia a. existing work suggests that thetycho sn was a thermonuclear explosion while the cas a supernova was a corecollapse explosion. precise classifications according to modern nomenclaturerequire spectra of the outburst light. in the case of ancient sne, this canonly be done with spectroscopy of their light echo, where the discovery of thelight echoes from the outburst light is the first step. adjacent light echopositions suggest that cas a and tycho may share common scattering duststructures. if so, it is possible to measure precise distances betweenhistorical galactic supernovae. on-going surveys that alert on the developmentof bright scattered-light echo features have the potential to reveal detailedspectroscopic information for many recent galactic supernovae, both directlyvisible and obscured by dust in the galactic plane.

astro-ph;0411357	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first two years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations of targets discoveredduring the first two years of the essence project. the goal of essence is touse a sample of ~200 type ia supernovae (sne ia) at moderate redshifts (0.2 &lt; z&lt; 0.8) to place constraints on the equation of state of the universe.spectroscopy not only provides the redshifts of the objects, but also confirmsthat some of the discoveries are indeed sne ia. this confirmation is criticalto the project, as techniques developed to determine luminosity distances tosne ia depend upon the knowledge that the objects at high redshift are the sameas the ones at low redshift. we describe the methods of target selection andprioritization, the telescopes and detectors, and the software used to identifyobjects. the redshifts deduced from spectral matching of high-redshift sne iawith low-redshift sne ia are consistent with those determined from host-galaxyspectra. we show that the high-redshift sne ia match well with low-redshifttemplates. we include all spectra obtained by the essence project, including 52sne ia, 5 core-collapse sne, 12 active galactic nuclei, 19 galaxies, 4 possiblyvariable stars, and 16 objects with uncertain identifications.

astro-ph;0510738	echoes from ancient supernovae in the large magellanic cloud	in principle, the light from historical supernovae could still be visible asscattered-light echoes even centuries later. however, while echoes have beendiscovered around some nearby extragalactic supernovae well after theexplosion, targeted searches have not recovered any echoes in the regions ofhistorical galactic supernovae. the discovery of echoes can allow us topinpoint the supernova event both in position and age and, most importantly,allow us to acquire spectra of the echo light to type the supernova centuriesafter the direct light from the explosion first reached the earth. here wereport on the discovery of three faint new variable surface brightnesscomplexes with high apparent proper motion pointing back to well-definedpositions in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). these positions correspond tothree of the six smallest (and likely youngest) previously catalogued supernovaremnants, and are believed to be due to thermonuclear (type ia) supernovae.using the distance and proper motions of these echo arcs, we estimate ages of610 and 410 yr for the echoes #2 and #3.

astro-ph;0602495	"anomalous" optical grb afterglows are common: two z~4 bursts, grb  060206 and 060210	we report on two recent z~4 gamma-ray bursts (grbs), grb 060206 and grb060210, for which we have obtained well-sampled optical light curves. our data,combined with early optical data reported in the literature, shows unusualbehavior for both afterglows. in r-band grb 060206 (z=4.045) experienced a slowearly decay, followed by a rapid increase in brightness by factor ~2.5 about 1hour after the burst. its afterglow then faded in a broken power-law fashion,with a smooth break at t_b=0.6 days, but with additional, less dramatic (~10%)``bumps and wiggles'', well detected in the densely sampled light curve. ther-band afterglow of grb 060210 (z=3.91) is also unusual: the light curves wasmore or less flat between 60 and 300 sec after the burst, followed by ~70%increase at ~600 sec after the burst, after which the light curve declined as at^{-1.3} power-law. despite earlier reports to the contrary, we find that forgrb 060206 x-rays also more or less follow the optical decay, but withsignificant variations on short timescales. however, the x-ray afterglow iscontaminated by a nearby, variable source, which especially at late timesobscures the behavior of the x-ray afterglow. we argue that ``anomalous''optical afterglows are likely to be the norm, and that the rapid variationsoften seen in swift-xrt data would also be seen in the optical light curves,given good enough sampling. as a result, some of the often employed procedures,such as deriving the jet opening angle using a smooth broken power-law fit tothe optical light curves, in many cases might have a poor statisticalsignificance. we argue that the early increase in brighness for both burstsmight be due to the turn-on of the external shock. existence of such featurescould provide valuable additional information about the burst.
