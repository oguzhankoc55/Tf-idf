0905.1981	correlation and time delays of the x-ray and optical emission of the  seyfert galaxy ngc3783	we present simultaneous x-ray and optical b and v band light curves of theseyfert galaxy ngc3783 spanning 2 years. the flux in all bands is highlyvariable and the fluctuations are significantly correlated. as shown before bystirpe et al. the optical bands vary simultaneously, with a delay of less than1.5 days but both b and v bands lag the x-ray fluctuations by 3-9 days. thisdelay points at optical variability produced by x-ray reprocessing and thevalue of the lag places the reprocessor close to the broad line region. a powerspectrum analysis of the light curve, however, shows that the x-ray variabilityhas a power law shape bending to a steeper slope at a time-scale ~2.9 dayswhile the variability amplitude in the optical bands continues to grow towardsthe longest time-scale covered, ~ 300 days. we show that the power spectratogether with the small value of the time delay is inconsistent with a picturewhere all the optical variability is produced by x-ray reprocessing, though thesmall amplitude, rapid optical fluctuations might be produced in this way. wedetect larger variability amplitudes on long time-scales in the optical bandsthan in the x-rays. this behaviour adds to similar results recently obtainedfor at least three other agn and indicates a separate source of long termoptical variability, possibly accretion rate or thermal fluctuations in theoptically emitting accretion disc.

0906.1817	investigating the far-ir/radio correlation of star forming galaxies to  z=3	in order to examine the far-ir/radio correlation at high redshift we havestudied the spitzer 70um/far-infrared (far-ir) properties of sub-mjy radiosources from the 13^h xmm-newton/chandra deep field by redshift and galaxytype: active galactic nucleus (agn) or star forming galaxy (sfg). we directlydetect 70um counterparts (at &gt;3sigma significance) for 22.5% (92/408) of theradio sources, while for the rest we perform stacking analysis by redshift andgalaxy type. for the sources detected at 70um we find that the median andscatter of the observed flux density ratio, q70, are similar to previousresults in the literature, but with a slight decrease in q70 towards higherredshifts. of the radio sources detected at 70um 8/92 were already classifiedas agn, but two of which maybe sfgs. for the stacked sources we obtain adetection for the sfgs at every redshift bin which implies they have mean fluxdensities a factor ~5 below the original 70um detection limit. for the stackedagn we obtain a detection only in our highest redshift bin (1&lt;~z&lt;~5) where wemay be sampling hot dust associated with the agn at rest-frame 12-35um. thecombined observed mean value of q70 for the sfgs (detected and non-detected at70um) decreases gradually with redshift, consistent with tracks derived fromempirical spectral energy distributions (seds) of local sfgs. upon closerinspection and when comparing with tracks of appropriate luminosity, the valuesof q70 broadly agree at low redshift. however, at z~1, the observed q70 (forulirgs) is 2sigma below the value seen for local ulirgs tracks, implying adifference in the sed between local and z~1 ulirgs. at higher redshifts, theconvergence of the tracks and the higher uncertainties in q70 do not allow usto determine if such a difference persists.

0909.2579	x-ray variability of agn and relationship to galactic black hole binary  systems	over the last 12 years, agn monitoring by rxte, has revolutionised ourunderstanding of the x-ray variability of agn, of the relationship between agnand galactic black hole x-ray binaries (bhbs) and hence of the accretionprocess itself, which fuels the emission in agn and bhbs and is the majorsource of power in the universe. in this paper i review our currentunderstanding of these topics. i begin by considering whether agn and bhbs showthe same x-ray spectral-timing `states' (e.g. low-flux, hard-spectrum or `hard'and high-flux, soft-spectrum or `soft'). observational selection effects meanthat most of the agn which we have monitored will probably be `soft state'objects, but agn are found in the other bhb states, although possibly withdifferent critical transition accretion rates. i examine timescale scalingrelationships between agn and bhbs. i show that characteristic power spectral`bend' timescales, t_b, scale approximately with black hole mass, m_bh, butinversely with accretion rate, mdot_e, (in units of the eddington accretionrate) probably signifying that t_b, arises at the inner edge of the accretiondisc. the relationship t_b proportional to m_bh/mdot_e is a good fit, implyingthat no other potential variable, e.g. black hole spin, varies significantly.lags between hard and soft x-ray bands as a function of fourier timescalefollow similar patterns in agn and bhbs.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.5365	a correlation between the spectral and timing properties of agn	we present the results from a combined study of the average x-ray spectraland timing properties of 14 nearby agn. for 11 of the sources in the sample, weused all the available data from the rxte archive, which were taken until theend of 2006. there are 7795 rxte observations in total for these agn, obtainedover a period of ~7-11 years. we extracted their 3-20 kev spectra and fittedthem with a simple power-law model, modified by the presence of a gaussian line(at 6.4 kev) and cold absorption, when necessary. we used these best-fit slopesto estimate the mean spectral slope for each object, while we used results fromthe literature to estimate the average spectral slope of the three objectswithout archival, monitorin rxte data. our results show that the agn averagespectral slopes are not correlated either with the black hole mass or thecharacteristic frequencies that were detected in the power spectra.they arepositively correlated, though, with the characteristic frequency whennormalised to the sources black hole mass. this is similar to thespectral-timing correlation that has been observed in cyg x-1, but not thesame.the agn spectral-timing correlation can be explained if we assume that theaccretion rate determines both the average spectral slope and thecharacteristic time scales in agn. the spectrum should steepen and thecharacteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasingaccretion rate. we also provide a quantitative expression between spectralslope and accretion rate. thermal comptonisation models are broadly consistentwith our result, but only if the ratio of the soft photons' luminosity to thepower injected to the hot corona is proportionally related to the accretionrate.

0911.4134	the comoving infrared luminosity density: domination of cold galaxies  across 0&lt;z&lt;1	in this paper we examine the contribution of galaxies with different infrared(ir) spectral energy distributions (seds) to the comoving infrared luminositydensity, a proxy for the comoving star formation rate (sfr) density. wecharacterise galaxies as having either a cold or hot ir sed depending uponwhether the rest-frame wavelength of their peak ir energy output is above orbelow 90um. our work is based on a far-ir selected sample both in the localuniverse and at high redshift, the former consisting of iras 60um-selectedgalaxies at z&lt;0.07 and the latter of spitzer 70um selected galaxies across0.1&lt;z&lt;1. we find that the total ir luminosity densities for eachredshift/luminosity bin agree well with results derived from other deepmid/far-ir surveys. at z&lt;0.07 we observe the previously known results: thatmoderate luminosity galaxies (l_ir&lt;10^11 lsun) dominate the total luminositydensity and that the fraction of cold galaxies decreases with increasingluminosity, becoming negligible at the highest luminosities. conversely, abovez=0.1 we find that luminous ir galaxies (l_ir&gt;10^11 lsun), the majority ofwhich are cold, dominate the ir luminosity density. we therefore infer thatcold galaxies dominate the ir luminosity density across the whole 0&lt;z&lt;1 range,hence appear to be the main driver behind the increase in sfr density up to z~1whereas local luminous galaxies are not, on the whole, representative of thehigh redshift population.

0912.0544	twelve years of x-ray and optical variability in the seyfert galaxy ngc  4051	we discuss the origin of the optical variations in the narrow line seyfert 1galaxy ngc 4051 and present the results of a cross-correlation study usingx-ray and optical light curves spanning more than 12 years. the emission ishighly variable in all wavebands, and the amplitude of the optical variationsis found to be smaller than that of the x-rays, even after correcting for thecontaminating host galaxy flux falling inside the photometric aperture. theoptical power spectrum is best described by an unbroken power law model withslope $\alpha=1.4^{+0.6}_{-0.2}$ and displays lower variability power than the2-10 kev x-rays on all time-scales probed. we find the light curves to besignificantly correlated at an optical delay of $1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.3}$ days behindthe x-rays. this time-scale is consistent with the light travel time to theoptical emitting region of the accretion disc, suggesting that the opticalvariations are driven by x-ray reprocessing. we show, however, that a modelwhereby the optical variations arise from reprocessing by a flat accretion disccannot account for all the optical variability. there is also a secondsignificant peak in the cross-correlation function, at an optical delay of$39^{+2.7}_{-8.4}$ days. the lag is consistent with the dust sublimation radiusin this source, suggesting that there is a measurable amount of optical fluxcoming from the dust torus. we discuss the origin of the additional opticalflux in terms of reprocessing of x-rays and reflection of optical light by thedust.

1001.1339	suzaku monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548: warm absorber  location and its implication for cosmic feedback	(abridged) we present a two month suzaku x-ray monitoring of the seyfert 1galaxy ngc 5548. the campaign consists of 7 observations. we analyze theresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizingflux variations. despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impingingcontinuum, the soft x-ray spectra of the source show little spectralvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. a detailed timemodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing componentwith high ionization. instead, the models tentatively suggest that theionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changingwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.using the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e &lt;2.0e7 cm-3 for theelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocitycomponent. this implies a large distance from the continuum source (r &gt; 0.033pc). if the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e&gt;9.8e4 cm-3 and r &lt; 3 pc. we discuss our results in terms of two differentscenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of theaccretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out. giventhe large distance of the wind, the implied mass outflow rate is also large (mw&gt; 0.08 maccr). the associated total kinetic energy deployed by the wind in thehost galaxy (&gt;1.2e56 erg) can be enough to disrupt the interstellar medium,possibly regulating large scale star formation. the total mass and energyejected by the wind is still lower than the one required for cosmic feedback,even when extrapolated to quasar luminosities. such feedback would require thatwe are observing the wind before it is fully accelerated.

0704.2051	a 610 mhz survey of the 1h xmm-newton/chandra survey field	we present the results of a deep 610 mhz survey of the 1^h xmm/chandra surveyarea with the gmrt. the resulting maps have a resolution of ~7 arcsec and anrms noise limit of 60 microjy. to a 5 sigma detection limit of 300 microjy wedetect 223 sources within a survey area of diameter 64 arcmin. we compute the610 mhz source counts and compare them to those measured at other radiowavelengths. the well know flattening of the euclidean-normalised 1.4 ghzsource counts below ~2 mjy, usually explained by a population of starburstgalaxies undergoing luminosity evolution, is seen at 610 mhz. the 610 mhzsource counts can be modelled by the same populations that explain the 1.4 ghzsource counts, assuming a spectral index of -0.7 for the starburst galaxies andthe steep spectrum agn population. we find a similar dependence of luminosityevolution on redshift for the starburst galaxies at 610 mhz as is found at 1.4ghz (i.e. 'q'= 2.45 (+0.3,-0.4)).

0709.0262	discovery of multiple lorentzian components in the x-ray timing  properties of the narrow line seyfert 1 ark 564	we present a power spectral analysis of a 100 ksec xmm-newton observation ofthe narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ark~564. when combined with earlier rxte andasca observations, these data produce a power spectrum covering seven decadesof frequency which is well described by a power law with two very clear breaks.this shape is unlike the power spectra of almost all other agn observed so far,which have only one detected break, and resemble galactic binary systems in asoft state. the power spectrum can also be well described by the sum of twolorentzian-shaped components, the one at higher frequencies having a hardspectrum, similar to those seen in galactic binary systems. previously we havedemonstrated that the lag of the hard band variations relative to the soft bandin ark 564 is dependent on variability time-scale, as seen in galactic binarysources. here we show that the time-scale dependence of the lags can bedescribed well using the same two-lorentzian model which describes the powerspectrum, assuming that each lorentzian component has a distinct time lag. thusall x-ray timing evidence points strongly to two discrete, localised, regionsas the origin of most of the variability. similar behaviour is seen in galacticx-ray binary systems in most states other than the soft state, i.e. in thelow-hard and intermediate/very high states. given the very high accretion rateof ark 564 the closest analogy is with the very high (intermediate) staterather than the low-hard state. we therefore strengthen the comparison betweenagn and galactic binary sources beyond previous studies by extending it to thepreviously poorly studied very high accretion rate regime.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1205.3524	the `harder when brighter' x-ray behaviour of the low luminosity active  galactic nucleus ngc 7213	we present the first robust evidence of an anti-correlation between the x-rayphoton index, \gamma, and the x-ray luminosity in a single low luminosityactive galactic nuclei (llagn), ngc 7213. up to now, such anti-correlationtrends have been seen only in large samples of llagn that span a wide range ofx-ray fluxes, although the opposite behaviour (i.e. a positive correlationbetween \gamma and x-ray luminosity) has been extensively studied forindividual x-ray bright active galactic nuclei. for ngc 7213, we use thelong-term x-ray monitoring data of rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte),regularly obtained on average every two days from march 2006 to december 2009.based on our x-ray data, we derive the \gamma versus flux and the hardnessratio versus flux relations, indicating clearly that ngc 7213 follows a `harderwhen brighter' spectral behaviour. additionally, by analysing radio and opticaldata, and combining data from the literature, we form the most completespectral energy distribution (sed) of the source across the electromagneticspectrum yielding a bolometric luminosity of 1.7*10^43 erg s^-1.phenomenologically, the sed of ngc 7213 is similar to that of low-ionizationnuclear emission-line region. the robust anti-correlation trend that we findbetween \gamma and x-ray luminosity together with the low accretion rate of thesource, 0.14 per cent that of eddington limit, make ngc 7213 the first llagnexhibiting a similar spectral behaviour with that of black hole x-ray binariesin `hard state'.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

1305.0304	generating artificial light curves: revisited and updated	the production of artificial light curves with known statistical andvariability properties is of great importance in astrophysics. consolidatingthe confidence levels during cross-correlation studies, understanding theartefacts induced by sampling irregularities, establishing detection limits forfuture observatories are just some of the applications of simulated data sets.currently, the widely used methodology of amplitude and phase randomisation isable to produce artificial light curves which have a given underlying powerspectral density (psd) but which are strictly gaussian distributed. thisrestriction is a significant limitation, since the majority of the light curvese.g. active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts show strongdeviations from gaussianity exhibiting `burst-like' events in their lightcurves yielding long-tailed probability distribution functions (pdfs). in thisstudy we propose a simple method which is able to precisely reproduce lightcurves which match both the psd and the pdf of either an observed light curveor a theoretical model. the pdf can be representative of either the parentdistribution or the actual distribution of the observed data, depending on thestudy to be conducted for a given source. the final artificial light curvescontain all of the statistical and variability properties of the observedsource or theoretical model i.e. same pdf and psd, respectively. within theframework of reproducible research, the code, together with the illustrativeexample used in this manuscript, are both made publicly available in the formof an interactive mathematica notebook.

1402.0899	general relativistic modelling of the negative reverberation x-ray time  delays in agn	we present the first systematic physical modelling of the time-lag spectrabetween the soft (0.3-1 kev) and the hard (1.5-4 kev) x-ray energy bands, as afunction of fourier frequency, in a sample of 12 active galactic nuclei whichhave been observed by xmm-newton. we concentrate particularly on the negativex-ray time-lags (typically seen above $10^{-4}$ hz) i.e. soft band variationslag the hard band variations, and we assume that they are produced byreprocessing and reflection by the accretion disc within a lamp-post x-raysource geometry. we also assume that the response of the accretion disc, in thesoft x-ray bands, is adequately described by the response in the neutral ironline (fe k$\alpha$) at 6.4 kev for which we use fully general relativisticray-tracing simulations to determine its time evolution. these responsefunctions, and thus the corresponding time-lag spectra, yield much morerealistic results than the commonly-used, but erroneous, top-hat models.additionally we parametrize the positive part of the time-lag spectra(typically seen below $10^{-4}$ hz) by a power-law. we find that thebest-fitting bh masses, m, agree quite well with those derived by othermethods, thus providing us with a new tool for bh mass determination. we findno evidence for any correlation between m and the bh spin parameter, $\alpha$,the viewing angle, $\theta$, or the height of the x-ray source above the disc,$h$. also on average, the x-ray source lies only around 3.7 gravitational radiiabove the accretion disc and the viewing angles are distributed uniformlybetween 20 and 60 degrees. finally, there is a tentative indication that thedistribution of spin parameters may be bimodal above and below 0.62.

1403.4253	long term wind-driven x-ray spectral variability of ngc 1365 with swift	we present long-term (months-years) x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert1.8 galaxy ngc 1365 as observed by swift, which provides well sampledobservations over a much longer timescale (6 years) and a much larger fluxrange than is afforded by other observatories. at very low luminosities thespectrum is very soft, becoming rapidly harder as the luminosity increases andthen, above a particular luminosity, softening again. at a given flux level,the scatter in hardness ratio is not very large, meaning that the spectralshape is largely determined by the luminosity. the spectra were thereforesummed in luminosity bins and fitted with a variety of models. the best fittingmodel consists of two power laws, one unabsorbed and another, more luminous,which is absorbed. in this model, we find a range of intrinsic 0.5-10.0 kevluminosities of approximately 1.1-3.5 ergs/s, and a very large range ofabsorbing columns, of approximately 10^22 - 10^24 cm^-2. interestingly, we findthat the absorbing column decreases with increasing luminosity, but that thisresult is not due to changes in ionisation. we suggest that these observationsmight be interpreted in terms of a wind model in which the launch radius variesas a function of ionising flux and disc temperature and therefore moves outwith increasing accretion rate, i.e. increasing x-ray luminosity. thus,depending on the inclination angle of the disc relative to the observer, theabsorbing column may decrease as the accretion rate goes up. the weaker,unabsorbed, component may be a scattered component from the wind.

0803.1668	fourier-resolved energy spectra of the narrow line seyfert 1 mkn 766	we compute fourier-resolved x-ray spectra of the seyfert 1 markarian 766 tostudy the shape of the variable components contributing to the 0.3-10 kevenergy spectrum and their time-scale dependence. the fractional variabilityspectra peak at 1-3 kev, as in other seyfert 1 galaxies, consistent with eithera constant contribution from a soft excess component below 1 kev and comptonreflection component above 2 kev, or variable warm absorption enhancing thevariability in the 1-3 kev range. the rms spectra, which shows the shape of thevariable components only, is well described by a single power law with anabsorption feature around 0.7 kev, which gives it an apparent soft excess. thisspectral shape can be produced by a power law varying in normalisation,affected by an approximately constant (within each orbit) warm absorber, withparameters similar to those found by turner et al. for the warm-absorber layercovering all spectral components in their scattering scenario. the total softexcess in the average spectrum can therefore be produced by a combination ofconstant warm absorption on the power law plus an additional less variablecomponent. on shorter time-scales, the rms spectrum hardens and this evolutionis well described by a change in power law slope, while the absorptionparameters remain the same. the frequency dependence of the rms spectra can beinterpreted as variability arising from propagating fluctuations through anextended emitting region, whose emitted spectrum is a power law that hardenstowards the centre. this scenario reduces the short time-scale variability oflower energy bands making the variable spectrum harder on shorter time-scalesand at the same time explains the hard lags found in these data by markowitz etal.

1407.6361	swift monitoring of ngc 5548: x-ray reprocessing and short term  uv/optical variability	lags measured from correlated x-ray/uv/optical monitoring of agn allow us todetermine whether uv/optical variability is driven by reprocessing of x-rays orx-ray variability is driven by uv/optical seed photon variations. we presentthe results of the largest study to date of the relationship between the x-ray,uv and optical variability in an agn with 554 observations, over a 750d period,of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 with swift. there is a good overallcorrelation between the x-ray and uv/optical bands, particularly on shorttimescales (tens of days). these bands lag the x-ray band with lags which areproportional to wavelength to the power 1.23+/-0.31. this power is very closeto the power (4/3) expected if short timescale uv/optical variability is drivenby reprocessing of x-rays by a surrounding accretion disc.  the observed lags, however, are longer than expected from a standardshakura-sunyaev accretion disc with x-ray heating, given the currently acceptedblack hole mass and accretion rate values, but can be explained with a slightlylarger mass and accretion rate, and a generally hotter disc.  some long term uv/optical variations are not paralleled exactly in thex-rays, suggesting an additional component to the uv/optical variabilityarising perhaps from accretion rate perturbations propagating inwards throughthe disc.

1501.05951	space telescope and optical reverberation mapping project. ii. swift and  hst reverberation mapping of the accretion disk of ngc 5548	recent intensive swift monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 yielded282 usable epochs over 125 days across six uv/optical bands and the x-rays.this is the densest extended agn uv/optical continuum sampling ever obtained,with a mean sampling rate &lt;0.5 day. approximately daily hst uv sampling wasalso obtained. the uv/optical light curves show strong correlations (r_max =0.57 - 0.90) and the clearest measurement to date of interband lags. these lagsare well-fit by a \tau propto \lambda^4/3 wavelength dependence, with anormalization that indicates an unexpectedly large disk radius of 0.35 +/- 0.05lt-day at 1367 a, assuming a simple face-on model. the u-band shows amarginally larger lag than expected from the fit and surrounding bands, whichcould be due to balmer continuum emission from the broad-line region assuggested by korista and goad. the uv/x-ray correlation is weaker (r_max &lt;0.45) and less consistent over time. this indicates that while swift isbeginning to measure uv/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disktheory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationshipwith x-ray variability is less well understood. combining this accretion disksize estimate with those from quasar microlensing studies suggests that agndisk sizes scale approximately linearly with central black hole mass over awide range of masses.

0804.3397	x-ray variability of the seyfert 1 markarian 335: power spectrum and  time lags	to investigate further the comparison between agn and black hole x-raybinaries, we have studied the main x-ray variability properties of the seyfert1 galaxy markarian 335. we put particular emphasis on the x-ray time lags,which is a potentially important diagnostic of physical models. from a 100 ksecobservation by xmm-newton we show that the power spectrum of this source iswell fitted by a bending power law model, and the bend time-scale tb isprecisely at the value predicted by the tb vs hbeta line-width relation ofmchardy et al. variations in different energy bands show time-scale dependenttime lags, where higher energy bands lag lower ones. the lag, tau, varies as afunction of the fourier frequency, f, of the variability component in the lightcurves as tau propto 1/f at low frequencies, but there is a sharp cut-off inthe lags at a frequency close to the bend frequency in the power spectrum.similar behaviour is seen in black hole x-ray binary systems. the length of thetime lags increases continuously with energy separation, in an almostlog-linear relation. we show that the lag spectra can be produced byfluctuations propagating through the accretion flow as long as the energyspectrum of the x-ray emitting region hardens towards the centre.

1502.07501	long-term x-ray spectral variability of seyfert galaxies with swift	we present analysis of the long-term x-ray spectral variability of seyfertgalaxies as observed by swift, which provides well-sampled observations over amuch larger flux range and a much longer timescale than any other x-rayobservatory. we examine long-term variability of three agn: ngc 1365 (seeconnolly et al. 2014), mkn 335 and ngc 5548. at high fluxes, the 0.5-10 kevspectra soften with increasing flux, as seen previously within the 2-10 kevband. however, at very low fluxes the sources also become very soft. we havefitted a number of models to the data and find that both intrinsic luminosityvariability and variable absorption are required to explain the observations.in some systems, e.g. ngc 1365, the best explanation is a two-component windmodel in which one component represents direct emission absorbed by a disc windwind, with the absorbing column inversely proportional to the intrinsicluminosity, and the second component represents unabsorbed emission reflectedfrom the wind. in other agn the situation is more complex.

0805.3411	the multiwavelength variability of 3c 273	we present an update of 3c 273's database hosted by the isdc, completed withdata from radio to gamma-ray observations over the last 10 years. we use thislarge data set to study the multiwavelength properties of thisquasar,especially focussing on its variability behaviour. we study theamplitude of the variations and the maximum variability time scales across thebroad-band spectrum and correlate the light curves in different bands,specifically with the x-rays, to search for possible connections between theemission at different energies. 3c 273 shows variability at all frequencies,with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being thesignatures of the different emission mechanisms. the variability properties ofthe x-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly aseyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timingproperties to account for the x-ray emission below and above ~20 kev. thedominant hard x-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons acceleratedby the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with theflaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescalevariations in the optical. this optical component is consistent with beingoptically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hardx-rays would be produced through inverse compton processes (ssc and/or ec) bythe same electron population. we show evidence that this synchrotron componentextends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended byemission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-yearfrom the ultraviolet source.

0704.0721	timing evidence in determining the accretion state of the seyfert galaxy  ngc 3783	previous observations with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) havesuggested that the power spectral density (psd) of ngc 3783 flattens to a slopenear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of galactic blackhole x-ray binary systems (gbhs) in the `hard' state. the low radio fluxemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard stateinterpretation. the accretion rate of ngc 3783 (~7% of the eddington rate) issimilar to that of other agn with `soft' state psds and higher than that atwhich the gbh cyg x-1, with which agn are often compared, changes between`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the eddington rate). if ngc 3783 really doeshave a `hard' state psd, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that agnand gbhs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. here we present animproved x-ray psd of ngc 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} hz, based onconsiderably extended (5.5 years) rxte observations combined with two orbits ofcontinuous observation by xmm-newton. we show that this psd is, in fact, wellfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit byadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. thus ngc 3783 is notunusual. these results leave arakelian 564 as the only agn which shows a secondbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rateimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state psd. the break frequency foundin ngc 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with otheragn and gbhs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

0807.2451	correlated x-ray/optical variability in the quasar mr2251-178	emission from active galactic nuclei is known to vary strongly over time overa wide energy band, but the origin of the variability and especially of theinter-band correlations is still not well established. here we present theresults of our x-ray and optical monitoring campaign of the quasar mr2251-178,covering a period of 2.5 years. the x-ray 2-10 kev flux is remarkably wellcorrelated with the optical b, v and r bands, their fluctuations are almostsimultaneous with a delay consistent with 0 days and not larger than 4 days ineither direction. the amplitude of variations shows an intriguing behaviour:rapid, large amplitude fluctuations over tens of days in the x-rays have onlysmall counterparts in the optical bands, while the long-term trends overhundreds of days are stronger in the b band than in x-rays. we show that simplereprocessing models, where all the optical variability arises from the variablex-ray heating, cannot simultaneously explain the discrepant variabilityamplitudes on different time-scales and the short delays between x-ray andoptical bands. we interpret the variability and correlations, in theoptically-thick accretion disc plus corona scenario, as the result of intrinsicaccretion rate variations modulating both x-ray and optical emission, togetherwith reprocessing of x-rays by the accretion disc.

(1998). our sample of 22 type 1 qsosis nearly complete above a flux limit of 1.4e-14 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the0.1-2 kev band. of these, nine qsos show long term (~ 2 yr) x-ray variabilityby a factor of 1.5-3.5. significant excess absorption above the galactic columnis seen in three qsos. the soft x-ray photon index of the qsos ranges from 1.4to 3.7. three qsos have steep soft x-ray spectra (gamma_x &gt; 3.0), one of whichis a narrow-line qso - a high luminosity version of narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies. the average photon index (&lt;gamma_x&gt;) is 2.40+/-0.09 (with adispersion of 0.57) in the 0.1-2 kev band. the average qso spectra in fourredshift bins flatten from an average photon index of &lt;gamma_x&gt; ~ 2.53 at 0.25&lt; z &lt; 1 to &lt;gamma_x&gt; ~ 2 at 2 &lt; z &lt; 3.4. the flattening of the average photonindex can be understood in terms of the redshift effect of the mean intrinsicqso spectrum consisting of two components - a soft x-ray excess and a power-lawcomponent. we have also studied optical spectra of 12 of the 22 qsos.

0808.2414	properties of x-ray selected broad absorption line quasars	broad absorption line quasars (commonly termed balqsos) contain the mostdramatic examples of agn-driven winds. the high absorbing columns in thesewinds, ~10^24 cm^-2, ensure that balqsos are generally x-ray faint. this highx-ray absorption means that almost all balqsos have been discovered throughoptical surveys, and so what little we know about their x-ray properties isderived from very bright optically-selected sources. a small number of x-rayselected balqsos (xbalqsos) have, however, recently been found in deep x-raysurvey fields. in this paper we investigate the x-ray and rest-frame uvproperties of five xbalqsos for which we have obtained xmm-newton epic x-rayspectra and deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. we find that, although thexbalqsos have an alpha_ox steeper by ~0.5 than normal qsos, their medianalpha_ox is nevertheless flatter by 0.30 than that of a comparable sample ofoptically selected balqsos (obalqsos). we rule out the possibility that thehigher x-ray to optical flux ratio is due to intrinsic optical extinction. wefind that the amount of x-ray and uv absorption due to the wind in xbalqsos issimilar, or perhaps greater than, the corresponding wind absorption inobalqsos, so the flatter alpha_ox cannot be a result of weaker wind absorption.we conclude that these xbalqsos have intrinsically higher x-ray to optical fluxratios than the obalqso sample with which we compare them.

astro-ph;0209145	the x-ray spectrum of the seyfert i galaxy mrk 766: dusty warm absorber  or relativistic emission lines?	competing models for broad spectral features in the soft x-ray spectrum ofthe seyfert i galaxy mrk766 are tested against data from a 130 ks xmm-newtonobservation. a model including relativistically broadened ly-alpha emissionlines of oviii, nvii and cvi is a better fit to 0.3-2 kev xmm rgs data than adusty warm absorber. moreover, the measured depth of neutral iron absorptionlines in the spectrum is inconsistent with the magnitude of the iron edgerequired to produce the continuum break at 17-18angstroms in the dusty warmabsorber model. the relativistic emission line model can reproduce thebroad-band (0.1-12 kev) xmm-epic data with the addition of a fourth line torepresent emission from ionized iron at 6.7 kev and an excess due to reflectionat energies above the iron line. the profile of the 6.7 kev iron line isconsistent with that measured for the low energy lines. there is evidence inthe rgs data at the 3sigma level for spectral features that vary with sourceflux. the covering fraction of warm absorber gas is estimated to be ~12%. ironin the warm absorber is found to be overabundant with respect to cno comparedto solar values.

astro-ph;0209155	x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4051	we report on the x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051observed with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) during a 1000 day periodbetween may 1996 and march 1999. the spectra were obtained as part ofmonitoring observations and from two long observations using the rxteproportional counter array (pca). during the monitoring period the 2-10 kevflux of ngc 4051 varied between 10e-12 and 7x 10e11 (cgs). we re-analysed rxtepca observations from a distinct low state in may 1998 using the latestbackground and detector response models. the rxte and bepposax observations ofngc 4051 during the low state show a very hard spectrum with a strongunresolved fluorescence line. this emission, probably due to reflection from amolecular torus, is likely to be constant over long time-scales and istherefore assumed as an underlying component at all flux states. by subtractingthe torus component we are able to determine the spectral variability of theprimary continuum. in the variable component we observe a stronganti-correlation of x-ray flux and spectral hardness in the pca energy band. weshow that the changes in hardness are caused by slope variability of theprimary power law spectrum rather than by changing reflection or variablephotoelectric absorption. the primary spectral index varies between gamma=1.6for the faintest states and gamma=2.3 during the brightest states, at whichlevel the spectral index approaches an asympotic value. we find that theresponse of the flux of the 6.4 kev iron fluorescence line to changes in thecontinuum flux depends on the timescale of the observation. the profile of theline is very broad and indicates an origin in the innermost regions of theaccretion disk.

astro-ph;0212035	x-ray and optical properties of x-ray sources in the 13hr  xmm-newton/chandra deep survey	the 13hr xmm-newton/chandra deep survey is the first of two extremely deepxmm-newton fields observed by the xmm-om consortium. a 120 ks chandra mosaic,covering 0.2 square degrees, provides sensitive, confusion-free point sourcedetection with sub-arcsecond positions, while the 200 ks xmm-newton observationprovides high quality x-ray spectroscopy over the same sky area. we haveoptical spectroscopic identifications for 70 x-ray sources. of these, 42 arebroad emission-line agn with a wide range of redshifts. the opticalcounterparts of a further 23 sources are narrow emission line galaxies andabsorption line galaxies. these 23 sources all lie at z &lt; 1 and typically havelower x-ray luminosities than the broad-line agn. about half of them showsignificant x-ray absorption and are almost certainly intrinsically absorbedagn. however some of them have unabsorbed, agn-like, power-law components intheir x-ray spectra, but do not show broad emission lines in their opticalspectra. these sources may be weak, unobscured agn in bright galaxies and theirexistence at low redshifts could be a consequence of the strong cosmologicalevolution of agn characteristic luminosities.

astro-ph;0302553	a medium deep chandra and subaru survey of the 13hr xmm/rosat deep  survey area	we present the results of a chandra acis-i survey of a high latitude regionat 13h +38 which was earlier observed with rosat (mchardy et al. 1998) andwhich has recently been observed by xmm-newton for 200ksec. xmm-newton willprovide good quality x-ray spectra for over 200 sources with fluxes around theknee of the logn/logs, which are responsible for the bulk of the x-raybackground (xrb). the main aim of the chandra observations is to providearcsecond, or better, positions, and hence reliable identifications, for thexmm-newton sources. the acis-i observations were arranged in a mosaic of four30ksec pointings, covering almost all of the 15' radius xmm-newton/rosat field.we detect 214 chandra sources above 5 sigma significance, to a limiting flux of\~1.3e-15 erg/cm2/s (0.5-7 kev). optical counterparts are derived from a subarusuprimecam image reaching to r~27. the very large majority of the chandrasources have an optical counterpart, with the distribution peaking at 23&lt;r&lt;24,although 14 have no counterpart to r=27. the fraction of x-ray sources with noidentification brighter than r=27 is similar to that found in deeper chandrasurveys. the majority of the identifications are with galaxies. as found inother chandra surveys, there is a very wide range of optical magnitude forgiven x-ray flux, implying a range of emission mechanisms, and many sourceshave high l_x/l_opt ratios, implying absorption at moderate redshift.comparison with the earlier rosat survey shows that the accuracy of the rosatpositions agrees very well with the predictions from simulations in mchardy etal. (1998) and that the large majority of the identifications were correct(abridged).

astro-ph;0305129	complex optical-x-ray correlations in the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy  ngc 4051	this paper presents the results of a dense and intensive x-ray and opticalmonitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 carried out in 2000.results of the optical analysis are consistent with previous measurements. theamplitude of optical emission line variability is a factor of two larger thanthat of the underlying optical continuum, but part or all of the difference canbe due to host-galaxy starlight contamination or due to the lines being drivenby the unseen uv continuum, which is more variable than the optical continuum.we measured the lag between optical lines and continuum and found a lower, moreaccurate broad line region size of 3.0+-1.5 light days in this object. theimplied black hole mass is m_bh=5(+6,-3)x10^5 m_sun; this is the lowest massfound, so far, for an active nucleus. we find significant evidence for anx-ray-optical (xo) correlation with a peak lag of about &lt;1 day, although thecentroid of the asymmetric correlation function reveals that part of theoptical flux varies in advance of the x-ray flux by 2.4+-1.0 days. this complexxo correlation is explained as a possible combination of x-ray reprocessing andperturbations propagating from the outer (optically emitting) parts of theaccretion disc into its inner (x-ray emitting) region.

astro-ph;0305130	an absorption event in the x-ray lightcurve of ngc 3227	we have monitored the seyfert galaxy ngc 3227 with the rossi x-ray timingexplorer (rxte) since january 1999. during late 2000 and early 2001 we observedan unusual hardening of the 2-10 kev x-ray spectrum which lasted severalmonths. the spectral hardening was not accompanied by any correlated variationin flux above 8 kev. we therefore interpret the spectral change as transientabsorption by a gas cloud of column density 2.6 10^23 cm^-2 crossing the lineof sight to the x-ray source. a spectrum obtained by xmm-newton during an earlyphase of the hard-spectrum event confirms the obscuration model and shows thatthe absorbing cloud is only weakly ionised. the xmm-newton spectrum also showsthat ~10% of the x-ray flux is not obscured, but this unabsorbed component isnot significantly variable and may be scattered radiation from a large-scalescattering medium. applying the spectral constraints on cloud ionisationparameter and assuming that the cloud follows a keplerian orbit, we constrainthe location of the cloud to be r~10-100 light-days from the central x-raysource, and its density to be n_h~10^8cm^-3, implying that we have witnessedthe eclipse of the x-ray source by a broad line region cloud.

astro-ph;0309180	combined long and short timescale x-ray variability of ngc4051 with rxte  and xmm-newton	we present a comprehensive examination of the x-ray variability of the narrowline seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxy ngc4051. we combine over 6.5 years of frequentmonitoring observations by rxte with a &gt;100ks continuous observation byxmm-newton and so present a powerspectral density (psd) covering anunprecedented frequency range of over 6.5 decades from &lt;1e-8 to &gt;1e-2 hz. thecombined rxte and xmm-newton psd is a very good match to the psd of thegalactic black hole binary system (gbh) cyg x-1 when in a `high', rather than`low', state providing the first definite confirmation of an agn in a `high'state. we find a break in the psd at a frequency \nu_{b}=8e-4 hz. if \nu_{b}scales linearly with mass then, assuming a black hole (bh) mass of 10 m_solarfor cyg x-1, we imply a bh mass of 3e-5 m_solar in ngc4051, which is consistentwith the recently reported reverberation mapped value. hence ngc4051 isemitting at \sim30% l_{edd}. we note that the higher energy photons lag thelower energy ones and that the lag is greater for variations of longer fourierperiod and increases with the energy separation of the bands. variations indifferent wavebands are very coherent at long fourier periods but the coherencedecreases at shorter periods and as the energy separation between bandsincreases. this behaviour is similar to that of gbhs and suggests a radialdistribution of frequencies and photon energies with higher energies and higherfrequencies being associated with smaller radii [abridged].

astro-ph;0310701	complex x-ray spectral behaviour of ngc 4051 in the low flux state	the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 was observed in one of itsprolonged low-lux states by xmm-newton in november 2002. here we present theresults of an analysis of epic-pn data obtained during the observation. withinthe low state, the source shows complex spectral variability which cannoteasily be explained by any simple model. however, by making a `flux-flux' plotwhich combines the low state data with data obtained during a normal fluxstate, we demonstrate that the extremely hard spectrum observed above 2 kevresults from a continuation of the spectral variability seen in the normalstate, which is caused by spectral pivoting of the power-law continuum. thepivoting power-law appears to be attached to a comptonised thermal component ofvariable flux (blackbody temperature kt~0.1 kev, consistent with the smallblack hole mass in ngc 4051) which dominates the soft x-ray band in the lowstate, and is probably the source of seed photons for comptonisation.additional constant thermal and reflection components, together with absorptionby ionised gas, seem to be required to complete the picture and explain thecomplex x-ray spectral variability seen in the low state of ngc 4051.

astro-ph;0502112	non-linear x-ray variability in x-ray binaries and active galaxies	we show that the rms-flux relation recently discovered in the x-ray lightcurves of active galactic nuclei (agn) and x-ray binaries (xrbs) implies thatthe light curves have a formally non-linear, exponential form, provided therms-flux relation applies to variations on all time-scales (as it appears to).this phenomenological model implies that stationary data will have a lognormalflux distribution. we confirm this result using an observation of cyg x-1, andfurther demonstrate that our model predicts the existence of the powerfulmillisecond flares observed in cyg x-1 in the low/hard state, and explains thegeneral shape and amplitude of the bicoherence spectrum in that source. ourmodel predicts that the most variable light curves will show the most extremenon-linearity. this result can naturally explain the apparent non-linearvariability observed in some highly variable narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxies, as well as the low states observed on long time-scales in the nls1ngc 4051, as being nothing more than extreme manifestations of the samevariability process that is observed in xrbs and less variable agn. thatvariability process must be multiplicative (with variations coupled together onall time-scales) and cannot be additive (such as shot-noise), or related toself-organised criticality, or result from completely independent variations inmany separate emitting regions. successful models for variability mustreproduce the observed rms-flux relation and non-linear behaviour, which aremore fundamental characteristics of the variability process than the powerspectrum or spectral-timing properties. models where x-ray variability isdriven by accretion rate variations produced at different radii remain the mostpromising.

astro-ph;9905104	the swansong in context: long-timescale x-ray variability of ngc 4051	on 9-11 may 1998, the highly-variable, low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxyngc4051 was observed in an unusual low flux state by bepposax (guainazzi et al.1998) rxte and euve. we present fits of the 4-15 kev rxte spectrum and bepposaxmecs spectrum obtained during this observation, which are consistent with theinterpretation that the source had switched off, leaving only the spectrum ofpure reflection from distant cold matter. we place this result in context byshowing the x-ray lightcurve of ngc4051 obtained by our rxte monitoringcampaign over the past two and a half years, which shows that the low statelasted for ~150 days before the may observations (implying that the reflectingmaterial is &gt; 10^17 cm from the continuum source) and forms part of alightcurve showing distinct variations in long-term average flux overtimescales &gt; months. we show that the long-timescale component to x-rayvariability is intrinsic to the primary continuum and is probably distinct fromthe variability at shorter timescales, possibly associated with variations inthe accretion flow of matter onto the central black hole. as the sourceapproaches the low state, the variability process becomes non-linear. ngc4051may represent a microcosm of all x-ray variability in radio quiet activegalactic nuclei (agns), displaying in a few years a variety of flux states andvariability properties which more luminous agns may pass through on timescalesof decades to thousands of years.

astro-ph;9906326	ultraviolet and multiwavelength variability of the blazar 3c 279:  evidence for thermal emission	the gamma-ray blazar 3c 279 was monitored on a nearly daily basis with iue,rosat and egret for three weeks between december 1992 and january 1993. duringthis period, the blazar was at a historical minimum at all wavelengths. here wepresent the uv data obtained during the above multiwavelength campaign. amaximum uv variation of ~50% is detected, while during the same period thex-ray flux varied by no more than 13%. at the lowest uv flux level the averagespectrum in the 1230-2700 a interval is unusually flat for this object(&lt;alpha_uv&gt;~1). the flattening could represent the lowest energy tail of theinverse compton component responsible for the x-ray emission, or could be dueto the presence of a thermal component at ~20000 k possibly associated with anaccretion disk. the presence of an accretion disk in this blazar object, likelyobservable only in very low states and otherwise hidden by the beamed, variablesynchrotron component, would be consistent with the scenario in which the seedphotons for the inverse compton mechanism producing the gamma-rays are externalto the relativistic jet. we further discuss the long term correlation of the uvflux with the x-ray and gamma-ray fluxes obtained at various epochs. all uvarchival data are included in the analysis. both the x- and gamma-ray fluxesare generally well correlated with the uv flux, approximately with square rootand quadratic dependences, respectively.

0811.0446	agn population in the deepest hard x-ray extragalactic survey	we present the results of the analysis of the agn population in the deepestextragalactic hard x-ray survey. the survey is based on integral observation ofthe 3c 273/coma cluster region, and covers 2500 deg2 with a 20-60 kev fluxlimit 1.5 times lower than other surveys at similar energies, resolving about2.5% of the cosmic hard x-ray background. using this survey, we can constrainin an unbiased way the distribution of hydrogen column absorption up tonh=10^25 cm-2. we put an upper limit of 24% to the fraction of compton-thickobjects. compared to models of the agn population selected in the 2-10 kevband, the log n-log s diagram is generally in good agreement, but the nhdistribution is significantly different, with significantly less unabsorbedsources (nh&lt;10^22 cm-2) at a given flux limit compared to the models. we alsostudy the local hard x-ray luminosity function (lf), which is compatible withwhat is found in other recent hard x-ray surveys. the extrapolation of the 2-10kev lf is lower than the hard x-ray lf. the discrepancy is resolved if agnspectra typically present reflection humps with reflection fraction r~1.finally, we use the population properties of this survey to show that a futureultra-deep integral extragalactic survey can result in a quite large agn samplewith enough objects at redshifts larger than z=0.05 so that we can detectevolution in the hard x-ray lf.

0812.0810	long term optical and x-ray variability of the seyfert galaxy markarian  79	we present the results of concurrent x-ray and optical monitoring of theseyfert 1 galaxy mrk 79 over a period of more than five years. we find that onshort to medium time-scales (days to a few tens of days) the 2-10 kev x-ray andoptical u and v band fluxes are significantly correlated, with a delay betweenthe bands consistent with zero days. we show that most of these variations maybe well reproduced by a model where the short-term optical variations originatefrom reprocessing of x-rays by an optically thick accretion disc. the opticallight curves, however, also display long time-scale variations over thousandsof days, which are not present in the x-ray light curve. these opticalvariations must originate from an independent variability mechanism and we showthat they can be produced by variations in the (geometrically) thin discaccretion rate as well as by varying reprocessed fractions through changes inthe location of the x-ray corona.
