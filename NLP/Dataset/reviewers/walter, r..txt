0902.1395	the hard x-ray view of bright infrared galaxies	aims. the synthesis of the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) requires a largepopulation of compton-thick active galactic nuclei that have not been detectedso far. we probe whether bright infrared galaxies could harbor a population ofcompton-thick nuclei and if they could contribute significantly. methods. weanalyzed 112 msec of integral observations obtained on 613 galaxies from theiras revised bright galaxy sample. we derived the average hard x-ray (18-80kev) emission of seyfert and various non seyfert galaxy subsamples to estimatetheir relative contribution to the locally emitted cxb. results. the seyfert 1&amp; 2 are detected at hard x-rays. none of the other galaxy subsamples weredetected. ulirgs are at least 5 times under-luminous at hard x-rays whencompared to seyferts. the upper limit obtained for the average non seyfertgalaxies is as low as 7e-13 erg/s cm2. on average, these galaxies do notcontain active nuclei brighter than 10e41 erg/s at hard x-rays. the total hardx-ray flux detected from the sample is 4.9e-9 erg/s cm2 (about 1% of the cxb),and 64% of this originates in absorbed active nuclei. local non-seyfertgalaxies contribute for less than 7% and do not harbor the compton-thick nucleiassumed to synthesize the locally emitted cxb.

0903.0580	pulsed thermal emission from the accreting pulsar xmmu j054134.7-682550	aims. soft x-ray excesses have been detected in several be/x-ray binaries andinterpreted as the signature of hard x-ray reprocessing in the inner accretiondisk. the system xmmu j054134.7-682550, located in the lmc, featured a gianttype ii outburst in august 2007. the geometry of this system can be understoodby studying the response of the soft excess emission to the hard x-ray pulses.  methods. we have analyzed series of simultaneous observations obtained withxmm-newton/epic-mos and rxte/pca in order to derive spectral and temporalcharacteristics of the system, before, during and after the giant outburst.spectral fits were performed and a timing analysis has been carried out.spectral variability, spin period evolution and energy dependent pulse shapesare analysed.  results. the outburst (l_x = 3* 10^38 erg/s \approx l_edd) spectrum could bemodeled successfully using a cutoff powerlaw, a cold disk emission, a hotblackbody, and a cyclotron absorption line. the magnetic field andmagnetospheric radius could be constrained. the thickness of the inneraccretion disk is broadened to a width of 75 km. the hot blackbody componentfeatures sinusoidal modulations indicating that the bulk of the hard x-rayemission is emitted preferentially along the magnetic equator. the spin periodof the pulsar decreased very significantly during the outburst. this isconsistent with a variety of neutron star equations of state and indicates avery high accretion rate.

0912.0290	exceptional flaring activity of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	(abridged) we studied an exceptional period of activity of the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408 in january 2009, during which about 200 bursts weredetected by integral. the major activity episode happened when the source wasoutside the field of view of all the integral instruments. but we were stillable to study the properties of 84 bursts detected simultaneously by theanti-coincidence shield of the spectrometer spi and by the detector of theimager isgri. we find that the luminosity of the 22 january 2009 bursts of 1e1547.0-5408 was &gt; 1e42 erg/s. this luminosity is comparable to that of thebursts of soft gamma repeaters (sgr) and is at least two orders of magnitudelarger than the luminosity of the previously reported bursts from axps.similarly to the sgr bursts, the brightest bursts of 1e 1547.0-5408 consist ofa short spike of ~100 ms duration with a hard spectrum, followed by a softerextended tail of 1-10 s duration, which occasionally exhibits pulsations withthe source spin period of ~2 s. the observation of axp bursts with luminositiescomparable to the one of sgr bursts strengthens the conjecture that axps andsgrs are different representatives of one and the same source type.

1001.2110	integral hard x-ray spectra of the cosmic x-ray background and galactic  ridge emission	we derive the spectra of the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) and of thegalactic ridge x-ray emission (grxe) in the ~20-200 kev range from the data ofthe ibis instrument aboard the integral satellite obtained during the fourdedicated earth-occultation observations of early 2006. we analyse themodulation of the ibis/isgri detector counts induced by the passage of theearth through the field of view of the instrument. unlike previous studies, wedo not fix the spectral shape of the various contributions, but model insteadtheir spatial distribution and derive for each of them the expected modulationof the detector counts. the spectra of the diffuse emission components areobtained by fitting the normalizations of the model lightcurves to the observedmodulation in different energy bins. the obtained cxb spectrum is consistentwith the historic heao-1 results and falls slightly below the spectrum derivedwith swift/bat. a 10% higher normalization of the cxb cannot be completelyexcluded, but it would imply an unrealistically high albedo of the earth. thederived spectrum of the grxe confirms the presence of a minimum around 80 kevwith improved statistics and yields an estimate of ~0.6 m_sun for the averagemass of white dwarfs in the galaxy. the analysis also provides updatednormalizations for the spectra of the earth's albedo and the cosmic-ray inducedatmospheric emission.

1005.0842	extreme flux states of ngc 4151 observed with integral	we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of all integral data obtained sofar for the x-ray--bright seyfert galaxy ngc 4151. we also use allcontemporaneous data from rxte, xmm, swift and suzaku. we find a linearcorrelation between the medium and hard-energy x-ray fluxes measured byintegral, which indicates an almost constant spectral index over six years. themajority of integral observations were made when the source was either at avery bright or very dim hard--x-ray state. we find that thermal comptonizationmodels applied to the bright state yields the plasma temperature of 50--70 kevand its optical depth of 1.3--2.6, depending on the assumed source geometry.for the dim state, these parameters are in the ranges of 180--230 kev and0.3--0.7, respectively. the compton parameter is y = 1 for all the spectra,indicating a stable geometry. using this result, we can determine thereflection effective solid angles associated with the close and distantreprocessing media as = 0.3 x 2pi and 0.2 x 2pi, respectively. the plasmaenergy balance, the weak disc reflection and a comparison of the uv fluxesilluminating the plasma to the observed ones are all consistent with an innerhot accretion surrounded by an outer cold disc. the disc truncation radius canbe determined from an approximate equipartition between the observed uv andx-ray emission, and from the fitted disc blackbody model, as 15 gravitationalradii. alternatively, our results can be explained by a mildly relativisticcoronal outflow.

1008.2533	{\eta} carinae: a very large hadron collider	eta carinae is the colliding wind binary with the largest mass loss rate inour galaxy and the only one in which hard x-ray emission has been detected. etacarinae is therefore a primary candidate to search for particle acceleration byprobing its gamma-ray emission. we used the first 21 months of fermi/lat datato extract gamma-ray (0.2-100 gev) images, spectra and light-curves, thencombined them with multi-wavelength observations to model the non-thermalspectral energy distribution. a bright gamma-ray source is detected at theposition of eta carinae. its flux at a few 100 mev corresponds very well to theextrapolation of the hard x-ray spectrum towards higher energies. the spectralenergy distribution features two distinct components. the first one extendsover the kev to gev energy range, and features an exponential cutoff at ~ 1gev. it can be understood as inverse compton scattering of ultraviolet photonsby electrons accelerated up to gamma~1e4 in the colliding wind region. theexpected synchrotron emission is compatible with the existing upper limit onthe non-thermal radio emission. the second component is a hard gamma-ray taildetected above 20 gev. it could be explained by pi0-decay of acceleratedhadrons interacting with the dense stellar wind. the ratio between the fluxesof the pi0 and inverse compton components is roughly as predicted bysimulations of colliding wind binaries. this hard gamma-ray tail can only beunderstood if emitted close to the wind collision region. the energytransferred to the accelerated particles (~5% of the collision mechanicalenergy) is comparable to that of the thermal x-ray emission. we have measuredthe electron spectrum responsible for the kev to gev emission and detected anevidence of hadronic acceleration in eta carinae. these observations are thusin good agreement with the colliding wind scenario suggested for eta carinae.

1008.5362	x-ray wind tomography of the highly absorbed hmxb igr j17252-3616	our goal is to understand the specificities of highly absorbed sghmxb and inparticular of the companion stellar wind, thought to be responsible for thestrong absorption. we have monitored igr j17252-3616, a highly absorbed systemfeaturing eclipses, with xmm-newton to study the vari- ability of the columndensity and of the fe k{\alpha} emission line along the orbit and during theeclipses. we also built a 3d model of the structure of the stellar wind toreproduce the observed variability. we first derived a refined orbital solutionbuilt from integral, rxte and xmm data. the xmm monitoring campaign revealedsignificant variation of intrinsic absorbing column density along the orbit andof the fe k{\alpha} line equivalent width around the eclipses. the origin ofthe soft x-ray absorption is modeled with an dense and extended hydrodynamicaltail, trailing the neutron star. this structure extends along most of theorbit, indicating that the stellar wind is strongly disrupted by the neutronstar. the variability of the absorbing column density suggests that theterminal velocity of the wind is smaller (~400 km/s) than observed in classicalsystems. this can also explain the much stronger density perturbation inferredfrom the observations. most of the fe k{\alpha} emission is generated in themost inner region of the hydrodynamical tail. this region, that extends over afew accretion radii, is ionized and does not contribute to the soft x-rayabsorption. we have built a qualitative model of the stellar wind of igrj17252-3616 that can represent the observations and suggest that highlyabsorbed systems have a lower wind velocity than classical sghmxb. thisproposal could be tested with de- tailed numerical simulations andhigh-resolution infrared/optical observations. if confirmed, it may turn outthat half of the persistent sghmxb have low stellar wind speeds.

1012.3397	twelve-hour spikes from the crab pevatron	aims. the crab nebula displayed a large gamma-ray flare on september 18,2010. to more closely understand the origin of this phenomenon, we analyze theintegral (20-500 kev) and fermi (0.1-300 gev) data collected almostsimultaneously during the flare. methods. we divide the available data intothree different sets, corresponding to the pre-flare period, the flare, and thesubsequent quiescence. for each period, we perform timing and spectral analysesto differentiate between the contributions of the pulsar and from thesurrounding nebula to the gamma-ray luminosity. results. no significantvariations in the pulse profile and spectral characteristics are detected inthe hard x-ray domain. in contrast, we identify three separate enhancements inthe gamma-ray flux lasting for about 12 hours and separated by an interval ofabout two days from each other. the spectral analysis shows that the fluxenhancement, confined below ~ 1 gev, can be modelled by a power-law with a highenergy exponential cut-off, where either the cut-off energy or the modelnormalization increased by a factor of ~ 5 relative to the pre-flare emission.we also confirm that the gamma-ray flare is not pulsed. conclusions. the timingand spectral analysis indicate that the gamma-ray flare is due to synchrotronemission from a very compact pevatron located in the region of interactionbetween the pulsar wind and the surrounding nebula. these are the highestelectron energies ever measured in a cosmic accelerator. the spectralproperties of the flare are interpreted in the framework of a relativisticallymoving emitter and/or a harder emitting electron population.

1103.5880	integral and the unified model of agn	according to the unified model, the differences observed in different classesof agn are due to anisotropic obscuration. this implies that in the hardx-rays, at energies where the radiation can pierce the obscuring material, theaverage spectral characteristics of different classes of agn should be thesame. here we present a study of the 17-250 kev integral ibis/isgri averagespectra of seyfert galaxies, aimed to constrain similarities and possibledifferences between different classes of agn. the sample we consists of all the172 seyfert galaxies detected by integral ibis/isgri at z&lt;0.2 during its first7 years of observations. of these, 45 are seyfert 1s, 31 seyfert 1.5s, 67compton-thin seyfert 2s, 11 narrow line seyfert 1s, 11 compton-thick seyfert2s, and 9 liners. comparing the average hard x-ray spectra of the differentclasses we found that, while the spectra of seyfert 1s, seyfert 1.5 and nls1sare consistent, compton-thin seyfert 2 show a clear excess in the 20-60 kevband over the spectrum of seyfert 1s and seyfert 1.5s. this excess might be dueto an intrinsically stronger reflection component or to a clumpy structure ofthe absorber in compton-thin seyfert 2s.

1307.0558	an active state of the bl lac object markarian 421 detected by integral  in april 2013	multiwavelength variability of blazars offers indirect insight into theirpowerful engines and on the mechanisms through which energy is propagated fromthe centre down the jet. the bl lac object mkn 421 is a tev emitter, a brightblazar at all wavelengths, and therefore an excellent target for variabilitystudies. mkn 421 was observed by integral and fermi-lat in an active state on16-21 april 2013. well sampled optical, soft, and hard x-ray light curves showthe presence of two flares. the average flux in the 20-100 kev range is 9.1e-11erg/s/cm2 (~4.5 mcrab) and the nuclear average apparent magnitude, correctedfor galactic extinction, is v ~12.2. in the time-resolved x-ray spectra (3.5-60kev), which are described by broken power laws and, marginally better, bylog-parabolic laws, we see a hardening that correlates with flux increase, asexpected in refreshed energy injections in a population of electrons that latercool via synchrotron radiation. the hardness ratios between the jem-x fluxes intwo different bands and between the jem-x and ibis/isgri fluxes confirm thistrend. during the observation, the variability level increases monotonicallyfrom the optical to the hard x-rays, while the large lat errors do not allow asignificant assessment of the mev-gev variability. the cross-correlationanalysis during the onset of the most prominent flare suggests a monotonicallyincreasing delay of the lower frequency emission with respect to that at higherfrequency, with a maximum time-lag of about 70 minutes, that is however notwell constrained. the spectral energy distributions from the optical to the tevdomain are satisfactorily described by homogeneous models of blazar emissionbased on synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-compton scattering, exceptin the state corresponding to the lat softest spectrum and highest flux.

1308.6278	probing the cosmic-ray content of galaxy clusters by stacking fermi-lat  count maps	observations in radio have shown that galaxy clusters are giant reservoirs ofcosmic rays (cr). although a gamma- ray signal from the cluster volume isexpected to arise through interactions of cr protons with the ambient plasma, aconfirming observation is still missing. we search for a cumulative gamma-rayemission in direction of galaxy clusters by analysing a collection of stackedfermi-lat count maps. additionally, we investigate possible systematicdifferences in the emission between cool-core and non-cool core clusterpopulations. making use of a sample of 53 clusters selected from the hiflugcscatalog, we do not detect a significant signal from the stacked sample. theupper limit on the average flux per cluster derived for the total stackedsample is at the level of a few 1e-11 ph cm-2 s-1 at 95% confidence level inthe 1-300 gev band, assuming power-law spectra with photon indices 2.0, 2.4,2.8 and 3.2. separate stacking of the cool core and non-cool core clusters inthe sample lead to similar values of around 5e-11 ph cm-2 s-1 and 2e-11 ph cm-2s-1, respectively. under the assumption that decaying pi0, produced incollisions between crs and the ambient thermal gas, are responsible for thegamma-ray emission, we set upper limits on the average cr content in galaxyclusters. for the entire cluster population, our upper limit on the gamma-rayflux translates into an upper limit on the average cr-to-thermal energy ratioof 4.6% for a photon index of 2.4, although it is possible for individualsystems to exceed this limit. our 95% upper limits are at the level expectedfrom numerical simulations, which likely suggests that the injection of cr atcosmological shocks is less efficient than previously assumed.

1310.8205	accretion in supergiant high mass x-ray binaries	supergiant high mass x-ray binary systems (sghmxbs) consist of a massive,late type, star and a neutron star. the massive stars exhibits strong,radiatively driven, stellar winds. wind accretion onto compact object triggersx-ray emission, which alters the stellar wind significantly. hydrodynamicsimulation has been used to study the neutron star - stellar wind interactionit two sghmxbs: i) a heavily obscured sghmxb (igr j17252-3616) discovered byintegral. to account for observable quantities (i.e., absorbing column density)we have to assume a very slow wind terminal velocity of about 500 km/s and arather massive neutron star. if confirmed in other obscured systems, this couldprovide a completely new stellar wind diagnostics. ii) a classical sghmxb (velax-1) has been studied in depth to understand the origin of the off-statesobserved in this system. among many models used to account for this observedbehavior (clumpy wind, gating mechanism) we propose that self-organizedcriticality of the accretion stream is the likely reason for the observedbehavior. in conclusion, the neutron star, in these two examples, acts veryefficiently as a probe to study stellar winds.

1511.01944	a closer view of the igr j11014-6103 outflows	the complex x-ray system igr j11014-6103 (a.k.a. the lighthouse nebula) iscomposed of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (pwn) as well as large-scalejet-like features, all launched by igr j11014-6103 which is movingsupersonically in the interstellar medium. previous observations suggested thatthe jet features stem from a ballistic jet of relativistic particles. in orderto confirm the nature of the jet and the marginally detected counter-jet, weobtained a new deep 250 ks chandra observation of the lighthouse nebula. weperformed detailed spatial and spectral analysis of all x-ray components of thesystem. the x-ray pwn is now better resolved and shows a clear bi-modalmorphology. the overall helical pattern of the main jet is confirmed. however,there are large deviations from a simple helical model at small and largescales. significant extended emission is now detected, encompassing the mainjet all along its length. the brightness dip of the main jet at ~50" distancefrom the pulsar is confirmed, the extended emission however preventsconclusions about the coherence at this position of the jet. the counter-jet isnow detected at high statistical significance. in addition, we found twosmall-scale "arcs" departing from the pulsar towards the jets. we also lookedfor possible bow-shock emission in front of the pulsar, with a short vlt/fors2h-alpha observation. no clear emission is found, most likely because ofcontamination from a diffuse surrounding nebulosity. the results of our x-rayanalysis show that current expectations from a ballistic nature of the jets canexplain satisfactorily some of the observational evidences but cannot fullyreproduce the observations. the alternative scenario (diffusion of particlesalong preexisting magnetic field lines in the surrounding medium) however alsocontinues to suffer from conflicts with the observations.

astro-ph;0406553	integral and xmm-newton spectral studies of ngc 4388	we present first integral and xmm-newton observations of a seyfert galaxy,the type 2 agn ngc 4388. several integral observations performed in 2003 allowus to study the spectrum in the 20 - 300 kev range. in addition two xmm-newtonobservations give detailed insight into the 0.2 - 10 kev emission. themeasurements presented here and comparison with previous observations bybepposax, sigma and cgro/osse show that the overall spectrum from soft x-raysup to the gamma-rays can be described by a highly absorbed (n_h = 2.7e231/cm^2) and variable non-thermal component in addition to constant non-absorbedthermal emission (t = 0.8 kev) of low abundance (7% solar), plus a constant fek-alpha and k-beta line. the hard x-ray component is well described by a simplepower law with a mean photon index of 1.7. during the integral observations the20 - 100 kev flux increased by a factor of 1.4. the analysis of xmm-newton dataimplies that the emission below 3 kev is decoupled from the agn and probablydue to extended emission as seen in chandra observations. the constant ironline emission is apparently also decoupled from the direct emission of thecentral engine and likely to be generated in the obscuring material, e.g. inthe molecular torus.

astro-ph;0504137	the broad-band x-ray spectrum of the blazar pks b1830-211 by chandra and  integral	in this paper we present a broad-band study of the x-ray emission of theblazar pks1830-211 based on chandra and integral observations. notwithstandingthe high redshift (z=2.507), it is a bright x-ray source (f(2-10 kev)~10^{-11}erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), due to gravitational lensing by an intervening galaxy atz=0.89. previous x-ray observations attribute the observed absorption at e&lt;2kev to the lensing galaxy. our analysis, although not in contrast with thishypothesis, suggests also the possibility of an intrinsic (ionized) absorption,taking place at the front side of the jet. this scenario is also supported bysome evidence, in the same data, of a feature observed at 2.15 kev which can beinterpreted as a blueshifted iron line (v/c ~ 0.18). the sed of pks1830-211 canbe well modelled by combining a synchrotron self-compton component and anexternal source of photons to be scattered up to \gamma-ray energies byrelativistic electrons moving outward in the jet. the main source of low energyphotons is a dust torus at the temperature of 10^3 k as expected in mevblazars.

astro-ph;0608250	integral observations of the cosmic x-ray background in the 5-100 kev  range via occultation by the earth	we study the spectrum of the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) in energy range$\sim$5-100 kev. early in 2006 the integral observatory performed a series offour 30ksec observations with the earth disk crossing the field of view of theinstruments. the modulation of the aperture flux due to occultation ofextragalactic objects by the earth disk was used to obtain the spectrum of thecosmic x-ray background(cxb). various sources of contamination were evaluated,including compact sources, galactic ridge emission, cxb reflection by the earthatmosphere, cosmic ray induced emission by the earth atmosphere and the earthauroral emission. the spectrum of the cosmic x-ray background in the energyband 5-100 kev is obtained. the shape of the spectrum is consistent with thatobtained previously by the heao-1 observatory, while the normalization is$\sim$10% higher. this difference in normalization can (at least partly) betraced to the different assumptions on the absolute flux from the crab nebulae.  the increase relative to the earlier adopted value of the absolute flux ofthe cxb near the energy of maximum luminosity (20-50 kev) has directimplications for the energy release of supermassive black holes in the universeand their growth at the epoch of the cxb origin.

astro-ph;0611343	the xmm-newton/integral monitoring campaign of igr j16318-4848	igr j16318-4848 is the prototype and one of the more extreme examples of thenew class of highly obscured galactic x-ray sources discovered by integral. amonitoring campaign on this source has been carried out by xmm-newton andintegral, consisting in three simultaneous observations performed in february,march and august 2004. the long-term variability of the compton-thickabsorption and emission line complexes will be used to probe the properties ofthe circumstellar matter. a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the threeobservations is performed, along with the reanalysis of the xmm-newtonobservation performed in february 2003. the results are compared withpredictions from numerical radiative transfer simulations to derive theparameters of the circumstellar matter. despite the large flux dynamic rangeobserved (almost a factor 3 between observations performed a few months apart),the source remained bright (suggesting it is a persistent source) andcompton-thick (nh &gt;1.2x10^24 cm-2). large equivalent width (ew) emission linesfrom fe kalpha, fe kbeta and ni kalpha were present in all spectra. theaddition of a fe kalpha compton shoulder improves the fits, especially in the2004 observations. sporadic occurrences of rapid x-ray flux risings wereobserved in three of the four observations. the fe kalpha light curve followedthe continuum almost instantaneously, suggesting that the emission lines areproduced by illumination of small-scale optically-thick matter around thehigh-energy continuum source. using the iron line ew and compton shoulder asdiagnostic of the geometry of the matter, we suggest that the obscuring matteris in a flattened configuration seen almost edge-on.

astro-ph;0701825	2003--2005 integral and xmm-newton observations of 3c 273	the aim of this paper is to study the evolution of the broadband spectrum ofone of the brightest and nearest quasars 3c 273.  we analyze the data obtained during quasi-simultaneous integral and xmmmonitoring of the blazar 3c 273 in 2003--2005 in the uv, x-ray and softgamma-ray bands and study the results in the context of the long-term evolutionof the source.  the 0.2-100 kev spectrum of the source is well fitted by a combination of asoft cut-off power law and a hard power law. no improvement of the fit isachieved if one replaces the soft cut-off power law by either a blackbody, or adisk reflection model. during the observation period the source has reached thehistorically softest state in the hard x-ray domain with a photon index$\gamma=1.82\pm 0.01$. comparing our data with available archived x-ray datafrom previous years, we find a secular evolution of the source toward softerx-ray emission (the photon index has increased by $\delta\gamma\simeq 0.3-0.4$over the last thirty years). we argue that existing theoretical models have tobe significantly modified to account for the observed spectral evolution of thesource.

astro-ph;9809113	the blue-bump of 3c 273	we present optical and ultraviolet observations of 3c273 covering the wholelife of the iue satellite. we analyze the variability properties of the lightcurves, and find that two variable components, written b and r respectively,must contribute to the blue-bump emission in this object. the b componentproduces most of the variability in the ultraviolet domain. a maximum timescale of variability of about 2 yr identical at all wavelengths is found. ifdiscrete events produce this component, the event rate is ~3-30 yr^-1. assumingan isotropic emission, each event must liberate about 10^51 erg in the form ofoptical-to-ultraviolet radiation. the spectral properties of the b componentsuggest that reprocessing on a truncated disk, or partially- thickbremsstrahlung may be the emission mechanism. we find evidence of a lag of afew days between the light curves of the b component at optical and ultravioletwavelengths. neither the variability properties, nor the spectral properties ofthe r component can be accurately measured. this component varies on very longtime scales, and may completely dominate the historical light curve of 3c 273in the optical domain. combining knowledge from other wavelengths, we obtainseveral indications that this component could reveal the ``blazar'' 3c 273. inparticular, its light curve is very similar to the hard x-ray light curve.

0811.0446	agn population in the deepest hard x-ray extragalactic survey	we present the results of the analysis of the agn population in the deepestextragalactic hard x-ray survey. the survey is based on integral observation ofthe 3c 273/coma cluster region, and covers 2500 deg2 with a 20-60 kev fluxlimit 1.5 times lower than other surveys at similar energies, resolving about2.5% of the cosmic hard x-ray background. using this survey, we can constrainin an unbiased way the distribution of hydrogen column absorption up tonh=10^25 cm-2. we put an upper limit of 24% to the fraction of compton-thickobjects. compared to models of the agn population selected in the 2-10 kevband, the log n-log s diagram is generally in good agreement, but the nhdistribution is significantly different, with significantly less unabsorbedsources (nh&lt;10^22 cm-2) at a given flux limit compared to the models. we alsostudy the local hard x-ray luminosity function (lf), which is compatible withwhat is found in other recent hard x-ray surveys. the extrapolation of the 2-10kev lf is lower than the hard x-ray lf. the discrepancy is resolved if agnspectra typically present reflection humps with reflection fraction r~1.finally, we use the population properties of this survey to show that a futureultra-deep integral extragalactic survey can result in a quite large agn samplewith enough objects at redshifts larger than z=0.05 so that we can detectevolution in the hard x-ray lf.

0811.0983	integral and xmm-newton observations of ax j1845.0-0433	ax j1845.0-0433 is a transient high-mass x-ray binary discovered by asca. thesource displays bright and short flares observed recently with integral. thetransient behaviour and the bright and short flares are studied in order tounderstand the accretion mechanisms and the nature of the source. publicintegral data and a pointed xmm-newton observation are used to study in detailsthe flaring and quiescent phases.  ax j1845.0-0433 is a persistent x-ray binary with a o9.5i supergiantcompanion emitting at a low 0.2-100 kev luminosity of ~1e35 erg/s with seldomflares reaching luminosities of 1e36 erg/s. the most-accurate x-ray position isr.a. (2000) =18h45m01s.4 and dec. = -04deg33'57''.7 (uncertainty 2'').variability factors of 50 are observed on time scale as short as hundreds ofseconds. the broad-band high-energy spectrum is typical of wind-fed accretingpulsars with an intrinsic absorption of nh=(2.6+/-0.2)e22 cm-2, a hardcontinuum of gamma=(0.7-0.9)+/-0.1 and a high-energy cutoff at ecut=16+/-3 kev.an excess at low energies is also observed fitted with a black body with atemperature of kt=0.18+/-0.05 kev. optically-thin and highly-ionised iron (fexviii-xix) located near the supergiant star is detected during the quiescencephase. the spectral shape of the x-ray continuum is constant. the flarecharacteristics in contrast to the persistent quiescent emission suggest thatclumps of mass m~1e22 g are formed within the stellar wind of the supergiantcompanion.

0811.2663	broad-band spectrum of the black hole candidate igr j17497-2821 studied  with suzaku	the broad-band 1-300 kev suzaku spectrum of igr j17497-2821, the x-raytransient discovered by integral in september 2006, is presented. suzakuobserved igr j17497-2821 on september 25, eight days after its discovery, for anet exposure of about 53 ksec. during the suzaku observation, igr j17497-2821is very bright, 2 x 10^37 erg/s at 8 kpc in the 1-300 kev range, and shows ahard spectrum, typical of black hole candidates in the low-hard state. despitethe multi-mission x-ray monitoring of the source, only with suzaku is itpossible to obtain a broad-band spectrum in the 1-300 kev range with a veryhigh signal to noise ratio. a sum of a multi-color disc (diskbb) and a thermalcomptonization component (compps) with mild reflection is a good representationof our igr j17497-2821 suzaku spectrum. the spectral properties of theaccretion disc as well as the cut-off energy in the spectrum at about 150 kevare clearly detected and constrained. we discuss the implications on thephysical model used to interpret the data and the comparison with previousresults.
