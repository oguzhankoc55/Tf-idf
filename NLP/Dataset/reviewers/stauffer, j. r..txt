0904.0819	new debris disks around young, low mass stars discovered with the  spitzer space telescope	(abridged) we present 24 and 70 micron mips observations of 70 a throughm-type dwarfs with estimated ages from 8 myr to 1.1 gyr, as part of a spitzerguaranteed time program. our sample is selected from stars with common youthindicators such as lithium abundance, x-ray activity, chromospheric activity,and rapid rotation. we compare our mips observations to empirically derivedk-[24] colors as a function of the stellar effective temperature to identify 24and 70 micron excesses.  we confirm the previously published 70 micron excesses for hd 92945, hd112429, and au mic. we present the discovery of 70 micron excesses for fivestars: hd 7590, hd 10008, hd 59967, hd 73350, and hd 135599. we also presentthe detection of 24 micron excesses for ten stars: hd 10008, gj 3400a, hd73350, hd 112429, hd 123998, hd 175742, at mic, bo mic, hd 358623 and gl 907.1.we find that large 70 micron excesses are less common around stars witheffective temperatures of less than 5000 k (3.7%) than around stars witheffective temperatures between 5000 k and 6000 k (21.4%), despite the coolerstars having a younger median age in our sample (12 vs.340 myr). we find thatthe previously reported excess for twa 13a at 70 microns is due to a nearbybackground galaxy.  in the appendix, we present an updated analysis of dust grain removaltime-scales due to grain-grain collisions and radiation pressure,poynting-robertson drag, stellar wind drag and planet-dust dynamicalinteraction.

0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

0907.3360	mid-infrared variability of protostars in ic 1396a	we have used spitzer/irac to conduct a photometric monitoring program of theic1396a dark globule in order to study the mid-ir (3.6 - 8 micron) variabilityof the heavily embedded young stellar objects (ysos) present in that area. weobtained light curves covering a 14 day timespan with a twice daily cadence for69 ysos, and continuous light curves with approximately 12 second cadence over7 hours for 38 ysos. typical accuracies for our relative photometry were 1-2%for the long timespan data and a few mmag, corresponding to less than 0.5%, forthe 7 hour continuous "staring-mode" data. more than half of the ysos showeddetectable variability, with amplitudes from ~0.05 mag to ~0.2 mag. aboutthirty percent of the ysos showed quasi-sinusoidal light curve shapes withapparent periods from 5-12 days and light curve amplitudes approximatelyindependent of wavelength over the irac bandpasses. we have constructed modelswhich simulate the time dependent spectral energy distributions of class i andi i ysos in order to attempt to explain these light curves. based on thesemodels, the apparently periodic light curves are best explained by yso modelswhere one or two high latitude photospheric spots heat the inner wall of thecircumstellar disk, and where we view the disk at fairly large inclinationangle. disk inhomogeneities, such as increasing the height where the accretionfunnel flows to the stellar hotspot, enhances the light curve modulations. theother ysos in our sample show a range of light curve shapes, some of which areprobably due to varying accretion rate or disk shadowing events. one star,ic1396a-47, shows a 3.5 hour periodic light curve; this object may be a pmsdelta scuti star.

1002.3365	mid-infrared variability from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	we use the multi-epoch, mid-infrared spitzer deep, wide-field survey toinvestigate the variability of 474,179 objects in 8.1 deg^2 of the ndwfs bootesfield. we perform a difference image analysis of the four available epochsbetween 2004 and 2008, focusing on the deeper 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. we findthat 1.1% of the studied sample meet our standard selection criteria for beingclassed as a variable source. we require that the 3.6 and 4.5 micronlight-curves are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.8) and that their joint varianceexceeds that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2 sigma. we thenexamine the mid-ir colors of the variable sources and match them with x-raysources from the xbootes survey, radio catalogs, 24 micron-selected agncandidates, and spectroscopically identified agns from the agn and galaxyevolution survey (ages). based on their mid-ir colors, most of the variablesources are agns (76%), with smaller contributions from stars (11%), galaxies(6%), and unclassified objects. most of the stellar, galaxy and unclassifiedsources are false positives. for our standard selection criteria, 11-12% of themid-ir counterparts to x-ray sources, 24 micron-selected agn candidates andspectroscopically identified agns show variability. mid-ir agn variability canbe well described by a single power-law structure function with a power-lawindex of 0.5 at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and an amplitude of 0.1 mag onrest-frame time scales of 2 years. the variability amplitude is higher forshorter rest-frame wavelengths and lower luminosities.

1003.0351	debris disks around solar-type stars: observations of the pleiades with  spitzer space telescope	we present spitzer mips observations at 24 um of 37 solar-type stars in thepleiades and combine them with previous observations to obtain a sample of 71stars. we report that 23 stars, or 32 +/- 6.8%, have excesses at 24 um at least10% above their photospheric emission. we compare our results with studies ofdebris disks in other open clusters and with a study of a stars to show thatdebris disks around solar-type stars at 115 myr occur at nearly the same rateas around a-type stars. we analyze the effects of binarity and x-ray activityon the excess flux. stars with warm excesses tend not to be in equal-massbinary systems, possibly due to clearing of planetesimals by binary companionsin similar orbits. we find that the apparent anti-correlations in the incidenceof excess and both the rate of stellar rotation and also the level of activityas judged by x-ray emission are statistically weak.

1206.6350	ysovar: six pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries in the orion nebula  cluster	eclipsing binaries (ebs) provide critical laboratories for empiricallytesting predictions of theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution.pre-main-sequence (pms) ebs are particularly valuable, both due to their rarityand the highly dynamic nature of pms evolution, such that a dense grid of pmsebs is required to properly calibrate theoretical pms models. analyzingmulti-epoch, multi-color light curves for 2400 candidateorion nebula cluster(onc) members from our warm spitzer exploration science program ysovar, we haveidentified 12 stars whose light curves show eclipse features. four of these 12ebs are previously known. supplementing our light curves with follow-up opticaland near-infrared spectroscopy, we establish two of the candidates as likelyfield ebs lying behind the onc. we confirm the remaining six candidate systems,however, as newly identified onc pms ebs. these systems increase the number ofknown pms ebs by over 50% and include the highest mass (theta1 ori e, for whichwe provide a complete set of well-determined parameters including componentmasses of 2.807 and 2.797 solar masses) and longest period (isoyj053505.71-052354.1, p \sim 20 days) pms ebs currently known. in two cases(theta1 ori e and isoy j053526.88-044730.7), enough photometric andspectroscopic data exist to attempt an orbit solution and derive the systemparameters. for the remaining systems, we combine our data with literatureinformation to provide a preliminary characterization sufficient to guidefollow-up investigations of these rare, benchmark systems.

1208.0135	herschel far-infrared photometric monitoring of protostars in the orion  nebula cluster	we have obtained time series observations of the orion nebula cluster at 70microns and 160 microns from the herschel/pacs photometer. this represents thefirst wide-field far-infrared photometric monitoring of a young star formingregion. the acquired 35'x35' maps show complex extended structures, withunprecedented details, that trace the interaction between the molecular gas andthe young hot stars. we detect 43 protostars, most of which are situated alongthe integral-shaped filament extending from the orion nebula, through omc2 andto omc3. we present high-reliability light curves for some of these objectsusing the first six epochs of our observing program spread over 6 weeks. wefind amplitude variations in excess of 20% for a fraction of the detectedprotostars over periods as short as a few weeks. this is inconsistent with thedynamical time-scales of cool far-ir emitting material that orbits at hundredsof au from the protostar, and it suggests that the mechanism(s) responsible forthe observed variability originates from the inner region of the protostars,likely driven by variable mass accretion.

0712.2975	x-ray properties of protostars in the orion nebula	the origin and evolution of the x-rays in very young stellar objects (ysos)are not yet well understood since it is very hard to observe ysos in theprotostellar phase. we study the x-ray properties of class 0-i objects in theorion nebula cluster (onc) and compare them with those of the more evolvedclass ii and iii members. using chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) data, westudy the x-ray properties of stars in different evolutionary classes:luminosities, nh, temperatures and time variability are compared in order tounderstand if the interaction between the circumstellar material and thecentral object can influence the x-ray emission. we have assembled the deepestand most complete photometric catalog of objects in the onc region from the uvto 8 microns using data from hst, wfi@2.2m eso and ispi@4m ctio telescopes, andspitzer irac. we select high probability candidate class 0-i protostars,distinguishing between those having a spectral energy distribution which risesfrom k up to 8 microns (class 0-ia) from those where the sed rises from k up to4.5 microns and decreasing afterwards (class 0-ib). we select a sample of bonafide class ii stars and a set of class iii stars with ir emission consistentwith normal photospheres. our principal result is that class 0-ia objects aresignificantly less luminous in x-rays, both in the total and hard bands, thanthe more evolved class ii stars with mass larger than 0.5 msun; these lattershow x-ray luminosities similar to those of class 0-ib stars. this resultsupports the hypothesis that the onset of x-ray emission occurs at a very earlystage of star formation. temporal variability and spectral properties of class0-i stars are similar to those of the more evolved class ii and iii objects,except for a larger absorption likely due to gas in the circumstellar material.

1408.6756	young stellar object variability (ysovar): long timescale variations in  the mid-infrared	the ysovar (young stellar object variability) spitzer space telescopeobserving program obtained the first extensive mid-infrared (3.6 &amp; 4.5 um)time-series photometry of the orion nebula cluster plus smaller footprints ineleven other star-forming cores (afgl490, ngc1333, monr2, ggd 12-15, ngc2264,l1688, serpens main, serpens south, iras 20050+2720, ic1396a, and ceph c).there are ~29,000 unique objects with light curves in either or both iracchannels in the ysovar data set. we present the data collection and reductionfor the spitzer and ancillary data, and define the "standard sample" on whichwe calculate statistics, consisting of fast cadence data, with epochs abouttwice per day for ~40d. we also define a "standard sample of members",consisting of all the ir-selected members and x-ray selected members. wecharacterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectralenergy distribution shape. we use three mechanisms to identify variables in thefast cadence data--the stetson index, a chi^2 fit to a flat light curve, andsignificant periodicity. we also identified variables on the longest timescalespossible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the spitzermission with the mean from our ysovar campaign. the fraction of members in eachcluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of theratio of class i/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with ahigher fraction of class i objects also have a higher fraction of long-termvariables. for objects with a ysovar-determined period and a [3.6]-[8] color,we find that a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorterperiods to have an ir excess. we do not find any evidence for variability thatcauses [3.6]-[4.5] excesses to appear or vanish within our data; out of membersand field objects combined, at most 0.02% may have transient ir excesses.

(1998). at least one of these bona fide young brown dwarfs hasstrong halpha emission, indicating that it is actively accreting. in addition,we confirm 21 new low mass members with spectral types of m4-m6, correspondingto approximate masses of 0.35-0.10 m_solar in omc 2/3. by comparing pre-mainsequence tracks to the positions of the members in the h-r diagram, we findthat most of the brown dwarfs are less than 1 myr, but find a number of lowmass stars with inferred ages greater than 3 myr. the discrepancy in thestellar and substellar ages is due to our selection of only low luminositysources; however, the presence of such objects implies the presence of an agespread in the omc 2/3 region. we discuss possible reasons for this apparent agespread.

astro-ph;0212571	brown dwarfs in the pleiades cluster : clues to the substellar mass  function	we present the results of a 6.4 square degrees imaging survey of the pleiadescluster in the i and z-bands. the survey extends up to 3 degrees from thecluster center and is 90% complete down to i~22. it covers a mass range from0.03 msun to 0.48 msun and yields 40 brown dwarf candidates (bdcs) of which 29are new. the spatial distribution of bdcs is fitted by a king profile in orderto estimate the cluster substellar core radius. the pleiades mass function isthen derived accross the stellar-substellar boundary and we find that, between0.03 msun and 0.48 msun, it is well represented by a single power-law, dn/dm\propto m^{-alpha}, with an index alpha=0.60 +/- 0.11. over a larger massdomain, however, from 0.03 msun to 10 msun, the mass function is better fittedby a log-normal function. we estimate that brown dwarfs represent about 25% ofthe cluster population which nevertheless makes up less than 1.5% of thecluster mass. the early dynamical evolution of the cluster appears to have hadlittle effect on its present mass distribution at an age of 120 myr. comparisonbetween the pleiades mass function and the galactic field mass functionsuggests that apparent differences may be mostly due to unresolved binarysystems.

astro-ph;0303083	the lithium depletion boundary and the age of ngc 2547	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey of cool mdwarf candidates in the young open cluster ngc 2547. using the 2df fiberspectrograph, we have searched for the luminosity at which lithium remainsunburned in an attempt to constrain the cluster age. the lack of a populationof individual lithium-rich objects towards the faint end of our sample places avery strong lower limit to the cluster age of 35 myr. however, the detection oflithium in the averaged spectra of our faintest targets suggests that thelithium depletion boundary lies at 9.5 &lt; m(i) &lt; 10.0 and that the cluster ageis &lt; 54 myr. the age of ngc 2547 judged from fitting isochrones to low-masspre-main-sequence stars in colour-magnitude diagrams is 20-35 myr using thesame evolutionary models. the sense and size of the discrepancy in agedetermined by these two techniques is similar to that found in another youngcluster, ic 2391, and in the low-mass pre main-sequence binary system, gj871.1ab. we suggest that the inclusion of rotation or dynamo-generated magneticfields in the evolutionary models could reconcile the two age determinations,but only at the expense of increasing the cluster ages beyond that currentlyindicated by the lithium depletion. alternatively, some mechanism is requiredthat increases the rate of lithium depletion in young, very low-mass fullyconvective stars.

astro-ph;0305058	cool stars in ngc 2547 and pre main sequence lithium depletion	we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of x-ray selected, low-masscandidate members of the young open cluster ngc 2547. using a combination ofphotometry, spectroscopic indices and radial velocities we refine our candidatelist and then use our spectroscopy to study the progression of lithiumdepletion in low-mass pre main sequence stars. we derive lithium abundances orupper limits for all our candidate members, which have effective temperaturesin the range 5000&gt;teff&gt;3200k, and compare these with predictions for lithiumburning and depletion provided by a number of models and also with the lithiumdepletion seen in younger and older stars. we find that some models canreproduce the lithium abundance pattern of ngc 2547 if the cluster has an ageof ~20-35myr, which is also indicated by fits to low-mass isochrones in thehertzsprung-russell diagram. but the lack of significant further lithiumdepletion between ngc 2547 and older clusters argues for an age of at least50myr, more in keeping with the lack of lithium observed in even fainter ngc2547 candidates. we show that reconciliation of these age estimates may requireadditions to the physics incorporated in current generations of pre mainsequence models.

astro-ph;0504447	identification of main sequence stars with mid-infrared excesses using  glimpse: beta-pictoris analogs?	spitzer irac 3.6-8 micron photometry obtained as part of the glimpse surveyhas revealed mid-infrared excesses for 33 field stars with known spectral typesin a 1.2 sq. degree field centered on the southern galactic hii region rcw49.these stars comprise a subset of 184 stars with known spectral classification,most of which were pre-selected to have unusually red ir colors. we proposethat the mid-ir excesses are caused by circumstellar dust disks that are eithervery late remnants of stellar formation or debris disks generated by planetformation. of these 33 stars, 29 appear to be main-sequence stars based onoptical spectral classifications. five of the 29 main-sequence stars are o or bstars with excesses that can be plausibly explained by thermal bremsstrahlungemission, and four are post main-sequence stars. the lone o star is an o4v((f))at a spectrophotometric distance of 3233+ 540- 535 pc and may be the earliestmember of the westerlund 2 cluster. of the remaining 24 main-sequence stars, 18have seds that are consistent with hot dusty debris disks, a possible signatureof planet formation. modeling the excesses as blackbodies demonstrates that theblackbody components have fractional bolometric disk-to-star luminosity ratios,lir/l*, ranging from 10^-3 to 10^-2 with temperatures ranging from 220 to 820k. the inferred temperatures are more consistent with asteroid belts ratherthan the cooler temperatures expected for kuiper belts. mid-ir excesses arefound in all spectral types from late b to early k.

astro-ph;0511250	formation and evolution of planetary systems (feps): primordial warm  dust evolution from 3-30 myr around sun-like stars	we present data obtained with the infrared array camera (irac) aboard thespitzer space telescope (spitzer) for a sample of 74 young (t &lt; 30 myr old)sun-like (0.7 &lt; m(star)/m(sun) &lt; 1.5) stars. these are a sub-set of theobservations that comprise the spitzer legacy science program entitled theformation and evolution of planetary systems (feps). using irac we study thefraction of young stars that exhibit 3.6-8.0 micron infrared emission in excessof that expected from the stellar photosphere, as a function of age from 3-30myr. the most straightforward interpretation of such excess emission is thepresence of hot (300-1000k) dust in the inner regions (&lt; 3 au) of acircumstellar disk. five out of the 74 young stars show a strong infraredexcess, four of which have estimated ages of 3-10 myr. while we detect excessesfrom 5 optically thick disks, and photospheric emission from the remainder ofour sample, we do not detect any excess emission from optically thin disks atthese wavelengths. we compare our results with accretion disk fractionsdetected in previous studies, and use the ensemble results to place additionalconstraints on the dissipation timescales for optically-thick, primordialdisks.

astro-ph;0603027	chandra x-ray observations of young clusters. iii. ngc 2264 and the  orion flanking fields	chandra observations of solar-like pre-main sequence (pms) stars in the orionflanking fields (age ~1 myr) and ngc 2264 (~3 myr) are compared with theresults of the coup survey of similar objects in the onc (~0.5 myr). thecorrelations between log lx and mass found for pms stars on convective tracksin these clusters are consistent with the relationships found for the onc,indicating little change in the median values of either log lx or log lx/lbolduring the first ~3-5 myr of evolution down convective tracks. the fraction ofstars with extreme values of lx, more than 10 times higher than the average fora given lbol or with log lx/lbol greater than the canonical saturation value of-2.9, is however larger by a factor of two in the younger onc when comparedwith the orion ff and ngc 2264.  pms stars in ngc 2264 on radiative tracks have lx/lbol values that aresystematically lower by a factor of ~10 times than those found for stars ofsimilar mass on convective tracks. the dramatic decrease in flux fromconvective to radiative phases of pms evolution is likely related to majorstructural changes which influence the efficiency of magnetic field generationand thus the level of magnetic activity.  as in the onc, we find that stars with measured periods have, on average,higher x-ray luminosities. however, there is a wide range in lx and lx/lbol forboth periodic and non-periodic stars of similar mass. among stars with measuredperiods, the level of x-ray emission does not correlate with the rotation rate.  for this data set, we find no statistically significant correlation betweenx-ray flux and (a) the presence or absence of circumstellar accretion disks, or(b) disk accretion rates as assessed from ultraviolet excesses.

astro-ph;0604104	a correlation between pre-main sequence stellar rotation rates and irac  excesses in orion	early observations of t tauri stars suggested that stars with evidence ofcircumstellar accretion disks rotated slower than stars without such evidence,but more recent results are not as clear. near-ir circumstellar diskindicators, though the most widely available, are subject to uncertainties thatcan result from inner disk holes and/or the system inclination. mid-infraredobservations are less sensitive to such effects, but until now, theseobservations have been difficult to obtain. the spitzer space telescope noweasily enables mid-infrared measurements of large samples of pms stars coveringa broad mass range in nearby star-forming regions. megeath and collaboratorssurveyed the orion molecular clouds (~1 myr) with the irac instrument (3.6,4.5, 5.8, 8 microns) as part of a joint irac and mips gto program. we examinethe relationship between rotation and spitzer mid-ir fluxes for ~900 stars inorion for stars between 3 and 0.1 msun. we find in these spitzer data theclearest indication to date that stars with longer periods are more likely thanthose with short periods to have ir excesses suggestive of disks.

astro-ph;0607537	a sensitive search for variability in late l dwarfs: the quest for  weather	we have conducted a photometric monitoring program of 3 field late-l browndwarfs looking for evidence of non-axisymmetric structure or temporalvariability in their photospheres. the observations were performed usingspitzer/irac 4.5 and 8 micron bandpasses and were designed to cover at leastone rotational period of each object. one-sigma rms (root mean squared)uncertainties of less than 3 mmag at 4.5 micron and around 9 mmag at 8 micronwere achieved. two out of the three objects studied exhibit some modulation intheir light curves at 4.5 micron - but not 8 micron - with periods of 7.4 hrand 4.6 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 10 mmag and 8 mmag. although the lackof detectable 8 micron variation suggests an instrumental origin for thedetected variations, the data may nevertheless still be consistent withintrinsic variability since the shorter wavelength irac bandpasses probe moredeeply into late l dwarf atmospheres than the longer wavelengths. a cloudfeature occupying a small percentage (1-2 %) of the visible hemisphere couldaccount for the observed amplitude of variation. if, instead, the variabilityis indeed instrumental in origin, then our non-variable l dwarfs could beeither completely covered with clouds or objects whose clouds are smaller anduniformly distributed. such scenarios would lead to very small photometricvariations. followup irac photometry at 3.6 and 5.8 micron bandpasses shoulddistinguish between the two cases. in any event, the present observationsprovide the most sensitive search to date for structure in the photospheres oflate-l dwarfs at mid-ir wavelengths, and our photometry provides stringentupper limits to the extent to which the photospheres of these transition ldwarfs are structured.

astro-ph;0609464	discovery of two t dwarf companions with the spitzer space telescope	we report the discovery of t dwarf companions to the nearby stars hn peg(g0v, 18.4 pc, ~0.3 gyr) and hd 3651 (k0v, 11.1 pc, ~7 gyr). during an ongoingsurvey of 5'x5' fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with iracaboard the spitzer space telescope, we identified these companions as candidatet dwarfs based on their mid-ir colors. using near-ir spectra obtained with spexat the nasa irtf, we confirm the presence of methane absorption thatcharacterizes t dwarfs and measure spectral types of t2.5+/-0.5 and t7.5+/-0.5for hn peg b and hd 3651 b, respectively. by comparing our spitzer data toimages from 2mass obtained several years earlier, we find that the propermotions of hn peg b and hd 3651 b are consistent with those of the primaries,confirming their companionship. hn peg b and hd 3651 b have angular separationsof 43.2" and 42.9" from their primaries, which correspond to projected physicalseparations of 795 and 476 au, respectively. a comparison of their luminositiesto the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of0.021+/-0.009 and 0.051+/-0.014 msun for hn peg b and hd 3651 b. in addition,the models imply an effective temperature for hn peg b that is significantlylower than the values derived for other t dwarfs at similar spectral types,which is the same behavior reported by metchev &amp; hillenbrand for the younglate-l dwarf hd 203030 b. thus, the temperature of the l/t transition appearsto depend on surface gravity. meanwhile, hd 3651 b is the first substellarcompanion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close-inplanet from rv surveys. the discovery of this companion supports the notionthat the high eccentricities of close-in planets like the one near hd 3651 maybe the result of perturbations by low-mass companions at wide separations.

astro-ph;9704058	lithium abundance in binaries of the hyades open cluster	we have derived accurate and homogeneous lithium abundances in 49 mainsequence binary systems belonging to the hyades open cluster by using adeconvolution method to determine individual magnitudes and colors for theprimary and secondary components of the binary. the input parameters of themodel are the observed li equivalent width, the actual distance to the binary,the integrated apparent magnitude and the integrated colors of the binaries-bv(ri)_k. we show that the general behavior is the same in binaries and insingle stars (li is depleted faster in k stars than in g stars and there is adeep dip for mid-f stars). however, there is a larger scatter in the abundancesof binary systems than in single stars. moreover, in general, binary systemshave an overabundance, which is more conspicuous in close binaries. in fact,there is a cut-off period, which can be estimated as p(orb)~9 d. this value isin excellent agreement with the theoretical predition of zahn (1994).

astro-ph;9804287	stellar activity in coeval open clusters: praesepe and the hyades	randich and schmitt [1995, a&amp;a 298, 115] found that the coronal activity ofsolar-type and low mass stars in praesepe is significantly lower than that ofstars in the hyades cluster. we have carried out several tests in order to finda possible explanation for this result. we have measured radial velocities oftwo groups of praesepe stars (a df-dk sample and a dm sample) and have measuredh$\alpha$ as a chromospheric activity index for the dm sample. we conclude thatthe praesepe catalog used in the x-ray analysis does not contain a significantnumber of non-members. the comparison of the h$\alpha$ equivalent widths forthe m dwarfs in praesepe with those in the hyades indicates that, at least forstars in this mass range, the praesepe stars are as active or more active thantheir hyades counterparts. we have also analyzed a few rosat pspc pointings ofpraesepe in order to obtain a new and independent estimate of the x-rayluminosities and upper limits for a small sample of praesepe members concludingthat the small differences between the old and new upper limits are not largeenough to explain the dichotomy in the x-ray properties of praesepe and thehyades. therefore, our examination of the available data does not provide aclear reason to explain why the x-ray luminosity functions of the two clustersare different. part of the explanation could be found in the binaries.speculatively, these clusters could have different orbital perioddistributions, with more short period binaries among the hyades, which wouldshow larger coronal activity.

astro-ph;9905242	the age of beta pic	we have reanalyzed data for the proposed moving group associated with betapic in order to determine if the group (or part of it) is real, and, if so, toderive an improved age estimate for beta pic. by using new, more accurateproper motions from ppm and hipparcos and a few new radial velocities, weconclude that on kinematic grounds, two m dwarfs have space motions thatcoincide with that of beta pic to within 1 km/s with small error bars. based ona cm diagram derived from accurate photometry and hipparcos parallaxes, thesetwo possible proper-motion companions to beta pic are very young; we derive anage of $\sim$20 myr by comparison to theoretical tracks from d'antona &amp;mazzitelli. in fact, the proposed beta pic companions comprise two of the threeyoungest m dwarfs in the sample of 160 dm stars for which we have data. thechromospheric and coronal activity of these two stars also confirm that theyare quite young. we argue that the probability that two of the three youngestnearby m dwarfs would accurately share the space motion of beta pic by chanceis quite small, and therefore we believe that beta pic and the two m dwarfs (gl799 and gl 803) were formed together. the estimated age for beta pic is then20$\pm$10 myr.

astro-ph;9907007	the lithium depletion boundary and the age of the young open cluster  ic~2391	we have obtained new photometry and intermediate resolution ($\delta \lambda= 2.7$ \aa\ ) spectra of 19 of these objects  (14.9 $\le$ $i_c$ $\le$ 17.5) in order to confirm cluster membership. weidentify 15 of our targets as likely cluster members based on their $vri$photometry, spectral types, radial velocity, and h$\alpha$ emission strengths.higher s/n spectra were obtained for 8 of these probable cluster members inorder to measure the strength of the lithium 6708 \aa\ doublet and thus obtainan estimate of the cluster's age. one of these 8 stars has a definite lithiumdetection and two other (fainter) stars have possible lithium detections. acolor-magnitude diagram for our program objects shows that the lithiumdepletion boundary in ic~2391 is at $i_c$=16.2. using recent theoretical modelpredictions, we derive an age for ic~2391 of 53$\pm$5 myr. while this isconsiderably older than the age most commonly attributed for this cluster($\sim$35 myr) this result for ic~2391 is comparable those recently derived forthe pleiades and alpha persei clusters and can be explained by new models forhigh mass stars that incorporate a modest amount of convective coreovershooting.

astro-ph;9907027	a lithium age for the young cluster ic2391	we have identified a large number of possible very low mass members of thecluster ic2391 based primarily on their location in an i versus (r-i)_c cmdiagram. we have obtained new photometry and low resolution ($\delta \lambda =2.7$ \aa) spectroscopy of 19 of these objects (14.9 $\le$ i_c $\le$ 17.5) inorder to confirm cluster membership. we identify 15 of our targets as likelycluster members based on their spectral types, radial velocity, ew(nai8200\aa),and h(alpha) emission strengths. one of these stars has a definite lithiumdetection and two other (fainter) stars have possible lithium detections. wefind the lithium depletion boundary in ic2391 is at i_c=16.2, which implies anage for ic2391 of 53$\pm$5 myr. while this is considerably older than the agemost commonly attributed for this cluster (~35 myr), the correction factor tothe ic2391 age is comparable to those recently derived for the pleiades andalpha per clusters and can be explained by new models for high mass stars thatincorporate a modest amount of convective core overshooting.

astro-ph;9909207	keck spectra of brown dwarf candidates and a precise determination of  the lithium depletion boundary in the alpha persei open cluster	we have identified twenty-seven candidate very low mass members of therelatively young alpha persei open cluster from a six square degree ccd imagingsurvey. based on their i magnitudes and the nominal age and distance to thecluster, these objects should have masses less than 0.1 msunif they are clustermembers. we have subsequently obtained intermediate resolution spectra ofseventeen of these objects using the keck ii telescope and lris spectrograph.we have also obtained near-ir photometry for many of the stars. our primarygoal was to determine the location of the "lithium depletion boundary" andhence to derive a precise age for the cluster. we detect lithium withequivalent widths greater than or equal to 0.4 \aa in five of the programobjects. we have constructed a color-magnitude diagram for the faint end of thealpha persei main sequence. these data allow us to accurately determine thealpha persei single-star lithium depletion boundary at m(i$_c$) = 11.47, m(bol)= 11.42, (r-i)$_{c0}$ = 2.12, spectral type m6.0. by reference to theoreticalevolutionary models, this converts fairly directly into an age for the alphapersei cluster of 90 $\pm$ 10 myr. at this age, the two faintest of ourspectroscopically confirmed members should be sub-stellar (i.e., brown dwarfs)according to theoretical models.
