0905.4126	a survey of z~6 quasars in the sdss deep stripe. ii. discovery of six  quasars at z_{ab}&gt;21	we present the discovery of six new quasars at z~6 selected from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) southern survey, a deep imaging survey obtained byrepeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator. the six quasars areabout two magnitudes fainter than the luminous z~6 quasars found in the sdssmain survey and one magnitude fainter than the quasars reported in paper i(jiang et al. 2008). four of them comprise a complete flux-limited sample at21&lt;z_ab&lt;21.8 over an effective area of 195 deg^2. the other two quasars arefainter than z_ab=22 and are not part of the complete sample. the quasarluminosity function at z~6 is well described as a single power law\phi(l_{1450}) \propto l_{1450}^{\beta} over the luminosity range-28&lt;m_{1450}&lt;-25. the best-fitting slope \beta varies from -2.6 to -3.1,depending on the quasar samples used, with a statistical error of 0.3-0.4.about 40% of the quasars discovered in the sdss southern survey have verynarrow lya emission lines, which may indicate small black hole masses and higheddington luminosity ratios, and therefore short black hole growth time scalesfor these faint quasars at early epochs.

0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al. (2008) supernova sample, we find \omega_{tot} = 1.011 +/- 0.009and w = -0.99 +/- 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equationof state w.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0910.4611	light curve templates and galactic distribution of rr lyrae stars from  sloan digital sky survey stripe 82	we present an improved analysis of halo substructure traced by rr lyrae starsin the sdss stripe 82 region. with the addition of sdss-ii data, a revisedselection method based on new ugriz light curve templates results in a sampleof 483 rr lyrae stars that is essentially free of contamination. the mainresult from our first study persists: the spatial distribution of halo stars atgalactocentric distances 5--100 kpc is highly inhomogeneous. at least 20% ofhalo stars within 30 kpc from the galactic center can be statisticallyassociated with substructure. we present strong direct evidence, based on bothrr lyrae stars and main sequence stars, that the halo stellar number densityprofile significantly steepens beyond a galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc, anda larger fraction of the stars are associated with substructure. by using anovel method that simultaneously combines data for rr lyrae and main sequencestars, and using photometric metallicity estimates for main sequence starsderived from deep co-added u-band data, we measure the metallicity of thesagittarius dsph tidal stream (trailing arm) towards r.a.2h-3h and dec~0 deg tobe 0.3 dex higher ([fe/h]=-1.2) than that of surrounding halo field stars.together with a similar result for another major halo substructure, themonoceros stream, these results support theoretical predictions that an earlyforming, smooth inner halo, is metal poor compared to high surface brightnessmaterial that have been accreted onto a later-forming outer halo. the meanmetallicity of stars in the outer halo that are not associated with detectableclumps may still be more metal-poor than the bulk of inner-halo stars, as hasbeen argued from other data sets.

0707.4473	stellar seds from 0.3-2.5 microns: tracing the stellar locus and  searching for color outliers in sdss and 2mass	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and two micron all sky survey (2mass) arerich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure andformation history of the galaxy. as new surveys and instruments adopt similarfilter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of theugrizjhks stellar locus, both to inform studies of `normal' main sequence starsas well as for robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. using asample of ~600,000 point sources detected by sdss and 2mass, we tabulate theposition and width of the ugrizjhks stellar locus as a function of g-i color,and provide accurate polynomial fits. we map the morgan-keenan spectral typesequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectralstandards and by analyzing 3000 sdss stellar spectra with a custom spectraltyping pipeline. we develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimumseparation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and useit to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurioussdss/2mass matches. analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliersidentifies 370 white-dwarf/m dwarf (wdmd) pairs, 93 qsos, and 90 m giant/carbonstar candidates, and demonstrates that wdmd pairs and qsos can be distinguishedon the basis of their j-ks and r-z colors. we also identify a group of objectswith correlated offsets in the u-g vs. g-r and g-r vs. r-i color-color spaces,but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects.future applications of this algorithm to a matched sdss-ukidss catalog may wellidentify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areasof color-magnitude space.

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

0708.2578	a survey of z~6 quasars in the sdss deep stripe: i. a flux-limited  sample at z_{ab}&lt;21	we present the discovery of five quasars at z~6 selected from 260 deg^2 ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) southern survey, a deep imaging surveyobtained by repeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator. the fivequasars with 20&lt;z_{ab}&lt;21 are 1-2 magnitudes fainter than the luminous z~6quasars discovered in the sdss main survey. one of them was independentlydiscovered by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey. these quasars, combined withanother z~6 quasar known in this region, make a complete flux- limited quasarsample at z_{ab}&lt;21. the sample spans the redshift range 5.85&lt;z&lt;6.12 and theluminosity range -26.5&lt;m_{1450}&lt;-25.4 (h_0=70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1},omega_{m}=0.3, and omega_{lambda}=0.7). we use the 1/v_{a} method to determinethat the comoving quasar spatial density at &lt;z&gt;=6.0 and &lt;m_{1450}&gt;=-25.8 is(5.0+/-2.1) x 10^{-9} mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}. we model the bright-end quasarluminosity function (qlf) at z~6 as a power law phi(l_{1450}) \proptol_{1450}^{beta}. the slope beta calculated from a combination of our sample andthe luminous sdss quasar sample is -3.1+/-0.4, significantly steeper than theslope of the qlf at z~4. based on the derived qlf, we find that the quasar/agnpopulation cannot provide enough photons to ionize the intergalactic medium(igm) at z~6 unless the igm is very homogeneous and the luminosity (l*_{1450})at which the qlf power law breaks is very low.

1010.1025	the atacama cosmology telescope: cosmology from galaxy clusters detected  via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample ofsunyaev-zel'dovich-selected galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wavesurvey by the atacama cosmology telescope. the cluster sample used in thisanalysis consists of 9 optically-confirmed high-mass clusters comprising thehigh-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 squaredegrees of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 ghz. we focus on the most massivesystems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics andcosmology derived from sz surveys. we describe the scaling relation betweencluster mass and sz signal with a 4-parameter fit. marginalizing over thevalues of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives sigma_8 =0.851 +/- 0.115 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.35 for a spatially-flat wcdm cosmologicalmodel with wmap 7-year priors on cosmological parameters. this gives a modestimprovement in statistical uncertainty over wmap 7-year constraints alone.fixing the scaling relation between cluster mass and sz signal to a fiducialrelation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by x-rayobservations, we find sigma_8 = 0.821 +/- 0.044 and w = -1.05 +/- 0.20. theseresults are consistent with constraints from wmap 7 plus baryon acousticoscillations plus type ia supernoava which give sigma_8 = 0.802 +/- 0.038 and w= -0.98 +/- 0.053. a stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample comparedto clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement.these results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both theastrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived fromthem are broadly consistent with current models.

1111.6958	seeing in the dark -- i. multi-epoch alchemy	weak lensing by large-scale structure is an invaluable cosmological toolgiven that most of the energy density of the concordance cosmology isinvisible. several large ground-based imaging surveys will attempt to measurethis effect over the coming decade, but reliable control of the spuriouslensing signal introduced by atmospheric turbulence and telescope opticsremains a challenging problem. we address this challenge with a demonstrationthat point-spread function (psf) effects on measured galaxy shapes in currentground-based surveys can be corrected with existing analysis techniques. inthis work, we co-add existing sloan digital sky survey imaging on theequatorial stripe in order to build a data set with the statistical power tomeasure cosmic shear, while using a rounding kernel method to null out theeffects of the anisotropic psf. we build a galaxy catalogue from the combinedimaging, characterise its photometric properties, and show that the spuriousshear remaining in this catalogue after the psf correction is negligiblecompared to the expected cosmic shear signal. we identify a new source ofsystematic error in the shear-shear auto-correlations arising from selectionbiases related to masking. finally, we discuss the circumstances in which thismethod is expected to be useful for upcoming ground-based surveys that havelensing as one of the science goals, and identify the systematic errors thatcan reduce its efficacy.

1112.0679	a description of quasar variability measured using repeated sdss and  poss imaging	we provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of theoptical continuum variability of quasars. the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)has obtained repeated imaging in five uv-to-ir photometric bands for 33,881spectroscopically confirmed quasars. about 10,000 quasars have an average of 60observations in each band obtained over a decade along stripe 82 (s82), whereasthe remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. the observedtime lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasarvariability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-framewavelengths from 1000a to 6000a. we publicly release a user-friendly catalog ofquasars from the sdss data release 7 that have been observed at least twice insdss or once in both sdss and the palomar observatory sky survey, and we use itto analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability. based on a dampedrandom walk (drw) model defined by a characteristic time scale and anasymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black holemass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in s82, we canfully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-s82 quasars suchas the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. all available dataare consistent with the drw model as a viable description of the opticalcontinuum variability of quasars on time scales of ~5-2000 days in the restframe. we use these models to predict the incidence of quasar contamination intransient surveys such as those from ptf and lsst.

1208.0050	the atacama cosmology telescope: data characterization and map making	we present a description of the data reduction and mapmaking pipeline usedfor the 2008 observing season of the atacama cosmology telescope (act). thedata presented here at 148 ghz represent 12% of the 90 tb collected by act from2007 to 2010. in 2008 we observed for 136 days, producing a total of 1423 hoursof data (11 tb for the 148 ghz band only), with a daily average of 10.5 hoursof observation. from these, 1085 hours were devoted to a 850 deg^2 stripe (11.2hours by 9.1 deg) centered on a declination of -52.7 deg, while 175 hours weredevoted to a 280 deg^2 stripe (4.5 hours by 4.8 deg) centered at the celestialequator. we discuss sources of statistical and systematic noise, calibration,telescope pointing, and data selection. out of 1260 survey hours and 1024detectors per array, 816 hours and 593 effective detectors remain after dataselection for this frequency band, yielding a 38% survey efficiency. the totalsensitivity in 2008, determined from the noise level between 5 hz and 20 hz inthe time-ordered data stream (tod), is 32 micro-kelvin sqrt{s} in cmb units.atmospheric brightness fluctuations constitute the main contaminant in the dataand dominate the detector noise covariance at low frequencies in the tod. themaps were made by solving the least-squares problem using the preconditionedconjugate gradient method, incorporating the details of the detector and noisecorrelations. cross-correlation with wmap sky maps, as well as analysis fromsimulations, reveal that our maps are unbiased at multipoles ell &gt; 300. thispaper accompanies the public release of the 148 ghz southern stripe maps from2008. the techniques described here will be applied to future maps and datareleases.

0712.0637	in pursuit of lsst science requirements: a comparison of photometry  algorithms	we have developed an end-to-end photometric data processing pipeline tocompare current photometric algorithms commonly used on ground-based imagingdata. this testbed is exceedingly adaptable, and enables us to perform manyresearch and development tasks, including image subtraction and co-addition,object detection and measurements, the production of photometric catalogs, andthe creation and stocking of database tables with time-series information. thistesting has been undertaken to evaluate existing photometry algorithms forconsideration by a next-generation image processing pipeline for the largesynoptic survey telescope (lsst). we outline the results of our tests for fourpackages: the sloan digital sky survey's (sdss) photo package, daophot andallframe, dophot, and two versions of source extractor (sextractor). theability of these algorithms to perform point-source photometry, astrometry,shape measurements, star-galaxy separation, and to measure objects at lowsignal-to-noise is quantified. we also perform a detailed crowded fieldcomparison of daophot and allframe, and profile the speed and memoryrequirements in detail for sextractor. we find that both daophot and photo areable to perform aperture photometry to high enough precision to meet lsst'sscience requirements, and less adequately at psf-fitting photometry. photoperforms the best at simultaneous point and extended-source shape andbrightness measurements. sextractor is the fastest algorithm, and recentupgrades in the software yield high-quality centroid and shape measurementswith little bias towards faint magnitudes. allframe yields the best photometricresults in crowded fields.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

1512.07914	the lsst data management system	the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) is a large-aperture, wide-field,ground-based survey system that will image the sky in six optical bands from320 to 1050 nm, uniformly covering approximately $18,000$deg$^2$ of the skyover 800 times. the lsst is currently under construction on cerro pach\'on inchile, and expected to enter operations in 2022. once operational, the lsstwill explore a wide range of astrophysical questions, from discovering "killer"asteroids to examining the nature of dark energy.  the lsst will generate on average 15 tb of data per night, and will require acomprehensive data management system to reduce the raw data to scientificallyuseful catalogs and images with minimum human intervention. these reductionswill result in a real-time alert stream, and eleven data releases over the10-year duration of lsst operations. to enable this processing, the lsstproject is developing a new, general-purpose, high-performance, scalable, welldocumented, open source data processing software stack for o/ir surveys.prototypes of this stack are already capable of processing data from existingcameras (e.g., sdss, decam, megacam), and form the basis of the hyper-suprimecam (hsc) survey data reduction pipeline.

0807.3762	the size distributions of asteroid families in the sdss moving object  catalog 4	asteroid families, traditionally defined as clusters of objects in orbitalparameter space, often have distinctive optical colors. we show that theseparation of family members from background interlopers can be improved withthe aid of sdss colors as a qualifier for family membership. based on an~88,000 object subset of the sloan digital sky survey moving object catalog 4with available proper orbital elements, we define 37 statistically robustasteroid families with at least 100 members using a simple gaussiandistribution model in both orbital and color space. the interloper rejectionrate based on colors is typically ~10% for a given orbital family definition,with four families that can be reliably isolated only with the aid of colors.about 50% of all objects in this data set belong to families, and this fractionvaries from about 35% for objects brighter than an h magnitude of 13 and risesto 60% for objects fainter than this. the fraction of c-type objects infamilies decreases with increasing h magnitude for h &gt; 13, while the fractionof s-type objects above this limit remains effectively constant. this suggeststhat s-type objects require a shorter timescale for equilibrating thebackground and family size distributions via collisional processing. the sizedistributions for 15 families display a well-defined change of slope and can bemodeled as a "broken" double power-law. such "broken" size distributions aretwice as likely for s-type familes than for c-type families, and are dominatedby dynamically old families. the remaining families with size distributionsthat can be modeled as a single power law are dominated by young families. whensize distribution requires a double power-law model, the two slopes arecorrelated and are steeper for s-type families.

0808.0001	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  crowded field photometry and cluster fiducial sequences in ugriz	we present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to exploit over 100 million stellarobjects with r &lt; 22.5 mag observed by sdss, we need to understand thecharacteristics of stars in the sdss ugriz filters. while star clusters provideimportant calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globularclusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded forthe standard sdss photometric pipeline to process. to complement the sdssimaging survey, we reduce the sdss imaging data for crowded cluster fieldsusing the daophot/allframe suite of programs and present photometry for 17globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a sdss value-added catalog. ourphotometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native sdss 2.5-meterugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied tothe sdss photometry without relying upon any transformations. model photometryfor red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by girardi et al. cannotbe matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by~0.02-0.05 mag. good agreement (&lt; ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with clem etal. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformationequations in tucker et al.

astro-ph;0008401	discovery of a close pair of z = 4.25 quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we report the discovery of a pair of z = 4.25 quasars with a separation of 33arcseconds. the brighter of the two objects was identified as a high-redshiftquasar candidate from sloan digital sky survey multicolor imaging data, and theredshift was measured from a spectrum obtained with the hobby-eberly telescope.the slit orientation of this observation {\it by chance} included anotherquasar, approximately one magnitude fainter and having the same redshift as thetarget. this is the third serendipitous discovery of a z &gt; 4 quasar. thedifferences in the relative strengths and profiles of the emission linessuggest that this is a quasar pair and not a gravitational lens. the twoobjects are likely to be physically associated; the projected physicalseparation is approximately 210 $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc and the redshifts areidentical to $\approx$ 0.01, implying a radial physical separation of 950$h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc or less. the existence of this pair is strong circumstantialevidence that $z \sim 4$ quasars are clustered.

astro-ph;0102410	broad absorption line quasars in the sloan digital sky survey with  vla-first radio detections	we present 13 broad absorption line (bal) quasars, including 12 new objects,which were identified in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and matched within2'' to sources in the first radio survey catalog. the surface density of thissample of radio-detected bal quasars is 4.5 +- 1.2 per 100 deg^2, i.e.approximately 4 times larger than previously found by the shallower firstbright quasar survey (fbqs). a majority of these radio-detected bal quasars aremoderately radio-loud objects. the fraction of bal quasars in the entire radioquasar sample, 4.8 +- 1.3 %, is comparable to the fraction of bal quasars amongthe sdss optical quasar sample (ignoring selection effects). we estimate thatthe true fraction of bal quasars (mostly hibals) in the radio sample is 9.2 +-2.6 % once selection effects are accounted for. we caution that the absorptiontroughs of 4 of the 13 radio-detected quasars considered do not strictlysatisfy the standard balnicity criterion. one or possibly two of the newradio-detected bal quasars are of the rare ``iron lobal'' type. bal quasars aregenerally redder than the median sdss quasar at the same redshift.

astro-ph;0105545	galaxy number counts from the sloan digital sky survey commissioning  data	we present bright galaxy number counts in five broad bands ($u', g', r', i',z'$) from imaging data taken during the commissioning phase of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the counts are derived from two independent stripesof imaging scans along the celestial equator, one each toward the north and thesouth galactic cap, covering about 230 and 210 square degrees, respectively. acareful study is made to verify the reliability of the photometric catalog. forgalaxies brighter than $r^* = 16$, the catalog produced by automated softwareis examined against eye inspection of all objects. statistically meaningfulresults on the galaxy counts are obtained in the magnitude range $12 \le r^*\le 21$, using a sample of 900,000 galaxies. the counts from the two stripesdiffer by about 30% at magnitudes brighter than $r^*= 15.5$, consistent with alocal $2\sigma$ fluctuation due to large scale structure in the galaxydistribution. the shape of the number counts-magnitude relation brighter than$r^* = 16$ is well characterized by $n \propto 10^{0.6m}$, the relationexpected for a homogeneous galaxy distribution in a ``euclidean'' universe. inthe magnitude range $ 16 &lt; r^* &lt; 21$, the galaxy counts from both stripes agreevery well, and follow the prediction of the no-evolution model, although thedata do not exclude a small amount of evolution. we use empirically determinedcolor transformations to derive the galaxy number counts in the $b$ and$i_{814}$ bands. we compute the luminosity density of the universe at zeroredshift in the five sdss bands and in the $b$ band. we find ${\cal l}_{b} =2.4 \pm 0.4 \times 10^8l_\odot h $mpc$^{-3}$, for a reasonably wide range ofparameters of the schechter luminosity function in the $b$ band.

astro-ph;0108013	galaxy mass and luminosity scaling laws determined by weak gravitational  lensing	we present new measurements of scaling laws relating the luminosity ofgalaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. early imagingand spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to make weaklensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast delta sigma_+ aroundclasses of lens objects. this surface mass density contrast as a function ofradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (gmcf). becausespectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass anddistance scales are well constrained. the gmcf measured around ~31,000 lensesis well fit by a power law of the form  delta sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (r/1 mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h m_sun pc^-2.  we compare this gmcf to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and findthat it varies strongly with all three. we quantify these variations bycomparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, m_260, to thegalaxy luminosity. while m_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluestband u', there is a simple, linear relation between m_260 and luminosity inredder bands (g', r', i', and z'). we test the universality of thesemass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral andelliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. we findremarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'and z'. this consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that themeasured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that theintegrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the darkmatter environments in which they form.

astro-ph;0108063	a survey of z&gt;5.8 quasars in the sloan digital sky survey i: discovery  of three new quasars and the spatial density of luminous quasars at z~6	we present the results from a survey of i-dropout objects selected from ~1550deg^2 of multicolor imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey, to searchfor luminous quasars at z&gt;5.8. objects with i*-z*&gt;2.2 and z*&lt;20.2 are selected,and follow-up j band photometry is used to separate l and t type cool dwarfsfrom high-redshift quasars. we describe the discovery of three new quasars, atz=5.82, 5.99 and 6.28, respectively. their spectra show strong and broad lyalpha+nv emission lines, and very strong ly alpha absorption, with a meancontinuum decrement d_a &gt; 0.90. the arc 3.5m spectrum of the z=6.28 quasarshows that over a range of 300 a immediately blueward of the ly alpha emission,the average transmitted flux is only 0.003 +/-0.020 times that of the continuumlevel, consistent with zero flux, and suggesting a tentative detection of thecomplete gunn-peterson trough. the existence of strong metal lines suggestsearly chemical enrichment in the quasar enviornment. the three new objects,together with the previously published z=5.8 quasar form a completecolor-selected flux-limited sample at z&gt;5.8. we estimate that at $z=6$, thecomoving density of luminous quasars at m_1450 &lt; -26.89 (h=0.5, omega=1)is1.1x10^-9 mpc^-3. this is a factor of ~2 lower than that at z~5, and isconsistent with an extrapolation of the observed quasar evolution at low-z. wediscuss the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background at z~6. theluminous quasars discussed in the paper have central black hole masses ofseveral times 10^9 m_sun by the eddington argument. their observed spacedensity provides a sensitive test of models of quasar and galaxy formation athigh redshift.

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0110259	detecting clusters of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i : monte  carlo comparison of cluster detection algorithms	we present a comparison of three cluster finding algorithms from imaging datausing monte carlo simulations of clusters embedded in a 25 deg^2 region ofsloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging data: the matched filter (mf; postmanet al. 1996), the adaptive matched filter (amf; kepner et al. 1999) and acolor-magnitude filtered voronoi tessellation technique (vtt). among the twomatched filters, we find that the mf is more efficient in detecting faintclusters, whereas the amf evaluates the redshifts and richnesses moreaccurately, therefore suggesting a hybrid method (hmf) that combines the two.the hmf outperforms the vtt when using a background that is uniform, but it ismore sensitive to the presence of a non-uniform galaxy background than is thevtt; this is due to the assumption of a uniform background in the hmf model. wethus find that for the detection thresholds we determine to be appropriate forthe sdss data, the performance of both algorithms are similar; we present theselection function for each method evaluated with these thresholds as afunction of redshift and richness. for simulated clusters generated with aschechter luminosity function (m_r^* = -21.5 and alpha = -1.1) both algorithmsare complete for abell richness &gt;= 1 clusters up to z ~ 0.4 for a samplemagnitude limited to r = 21. while the cluster parameter evaluation shows amild correlation with the local background density, the detection efficiency isnot significantly affected by the background fluctuations, unlike previousshallower surveys.

astro-ph;0110383	the alignment effect of brightest cluster galaxies in the sdss	one of the most vital observational clues for unraveling the origin ofbrightest cluster galaxies (bcg) is the observed alignment of the bcgs withtheir host cluster and its surroundings. we have examined the bcg-clusteralignment effect, using clusters of galaxies detected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we find that the bcgs are preferentially aligned with theprincipal axis of their hosts, to a much higher redshift (z &gt;~ 0.3) than probedby previous studies (z &lt;~ 0.1). the alignment effect strongly depends on themagnitude difference of the bcg and the second and third brightest clustermembers: we find a strong alignment effect for the dominant bcgs, while lessdominant bcgs do not show any departure from random alignment with respect tothe cluster. we therefore claim that the alignment process originates from thesame process that makes the bcg grow dominant, be it direct mergers in theearly stage of cluster formation, or a later process that resembles thegalactic cannibalism scenario. we do not find strong evidence for (or against)redshift evolution between 0&lt;z&lt;0.45, largely due to the insufficient samplesize (&lt; 200 clusters). however, we have developed a framework by which we canexamine many more clusters in an automated fashion for the upcoming sdsscluster catalogs, which will provide us with better statistics for systematicinvestigations of the alignment with redshift, richness and morphology of boththe cluster and the bcg.

astro-ph;0202251	spectroscopic target selection in the sloan digital sky survey: the  quasar sample	we describe the algorithm for selecting quasar candidates for opticalspectroscopy in the sloan digital sky survey. quasar candidates are selectedvia their non-stellar colors in "ugriz" broad-band photometry, and by matchingunresolved sources to the first radio catalogs. the automated algorithm issensitive to quasars at all redshifts lower than z=5.8. extended sources arealso targeted as low-redshift quasar candidates in order to investigate theevolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) at the faint end of the luminosityfunction. nearly 95% of previously known quasars are recovered (based on 1540quasars in 446 square degrees). the overall completeness, estimated fromsimulated quasars, is expected to be over 90%, whereas the overall efficiency(quasars:quasar candidates) is better than 65%. the selection algorithm targetsultraviolet excess quasars to i^*=19.1 and higher-redshift (z&gt;3) quasars toi^*=20.2, yielding approximately 18 candidates per square degree. in additionto selecting ``normal'' quasars, the design of the algorithm makes it sensitiveto atypical agn such as broad absorption line quasars and heavily reddenedquasars.

astro-ph;0206225	spectroscopic target selection in the sloan digital sky survey: the main  galaxy sample	we describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies forspectroscopy in the sloan digital sky survey from the photometric data obtainedby the imaging survey. galaxy photometric properties are measured using thepetrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by theshape of the surface brightness profile. the metric aperture used isessentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foregroundextinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. the maingalaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band petrosian magnitude r &lt; 17.77and r-band petrosian half-light surface brightness &lt; 24.5 magnitudes per squarearcsec. these cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with amedian redshift of 0.104. we carry out a number of tests to show that (a) ourstar-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellarcontamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (b) the fraction ofgalaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (0.1%), (c) thecompleteness of the sample is high, exceeding 99%, and (d) the reproducibilityof target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with theexpected random photometric errors.

astro-ph;0408505	efficient photometric selection of quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey: 100,000 z&lt;3 quasars from data release one	we present a catalog of 100,563 unresolved, uv-excess (uvx) quasar candidatesto g=21 from 2099 deg^2 of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release one(dr1) imaging data. existing spectra of 22,737 sources reveals that 22,191(97.6%) are quasars; accounting for the magnitude dependence of thisefficiency, we estimate that 95,502 (95.0%) of the objects in the catalog arequasars. such a high efficiency is unprecedented in broad-band surveys ofquasars. this ``proof-of-concept'' sample is designed to be maximallyefficient, but still has 94.7% completeness to unresolved, g&lt;~19.5, uvx quasarsfrom the dr1 quasar catalog. this efficient and complete selection is theresult of our application of a probability density type analysis to trainingsets that describe the 4-d color distribution of stars and spectroscopicallyconfirmed quasars in the sdss. specifically, we use a non-parametric bayesianclassification, based on kernel density estimation, to parameterize the colordistribution of astronomical sources -- allowing for fast and robustclassification. we further supplement the catalog by providing photometricredshifts and matches to first/vla, rosat, and usno-b sources. future workneeded to extend the this selection algorithm to larger redshifts, faintermagnitudes, and resolved sources is discussed. finally, we examine some scienceapplications of the catalog, particularly a tentative quasar number countsdistribution covering the largest range in magnitude (14.2&lt;g&lt;21.0) ever madewithin the framework of a single quasar survey.

astro-ph;0410164	the properties and luminosity function of extremely low luminosity  galaxies	we examine a sample of low redshift (10 &lt; d &lt; 150 mpc) galaxies includinggalaxies with r-band absolute magnitudes as faint as -12.5 (for h=1), selectedfrom the sloan digital sky survey data release 2 (sdss). the sample is uniquein containing galaxies of extremely low luminosities in a wide range ofenvironments, selected with uniform and well-understood criteria. we presentthe luminosity function as well as the broad-band properties of low luminositygalaxies in this sample. a schechter function is an insufficientparameterization of the r-band luminosity function; there is an upturn in theslope at low luminosities. the resulting slope at low luminosities in thissample is around -1.3. however, we almost certainly miss a large number ofgalaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selectioneffects, and we estimate that the true low luminosity slope may be as steep orsteeper than -1.5. the results here are consistent with previous sdss resultsand, in the g-band, roughly consistent with the results of the two degree fieldgalaxy redshift survey. extremely low luminosity galaxies are predominantlyblue, low surface brightness, exponential disks.

astro-ph;0410166	nyu-vagc: a galaxy catalog based on new public surveys	here we present the new york university value-added galaxy catalog(nyu-vagc), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below a redshift of about 0.3)based on a set of publicly-released surveys (including the 2dfgrs, 2mass, pscz,first, and rc3) matched to the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 2.excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514square degrees and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 square degrees (withabout 85% completeness). earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog haveformed the basis of many sdss investigations of the power spectrum, correlationfunction, and luminosity function of galaxies. we calculate and compile derivedquantities (for example, k-corrections and structural parameters for galaxies).the sdss catalog presented here is photometrically recalibrated, reducingsystematic calibration errors across the sky from about 2% to about 1%. weinclude an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including allimaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. finally, wehave performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in thecatalog in order to flag deblending and other errors. this catalog iscomplementary to the sdss archive servers, in that nyu-vagc's calibration,geometrical description, and conveniently small size are specifically designedfor studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using thesdss spectroscopic catalog.

astro-ph;0501042	active galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey: ii.  emission-line luminosity function	the emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (agn) ismeasured from about 3000 agn included in the main galaxy sample of the sloandigital sky survey within a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.15$. the $\ha$ and[oiii]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for seyferts cover luminosity rangeof $10^{5-9}$$l_\odot$ in h$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken powerlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. assuming a universalconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred bband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the agn luminosityfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity functionderived from the 2df redshift survey. the inferred agn number density isapproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the totallight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. the numbersof seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at highluminosity, seyfert 1s outnumber seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. in making theluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity isindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it aposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. given the relationshipbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack ofcorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variablethat determines the agn luminosity is the eddington ratio, not the black holemass. this appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likelyto be shining near the eddington limit.

astro-ph;0505334	the uv, optical, and ir properties of sdss sources detected by galex	we discuss the uv, optical, and ir properties of the sdss sources detected bygalex as part of its all-sky imaging survey early release observations.virtually all of the galex sources in the overlap region are detected by sdss.galex sources represent ~2.5% of all sdss sources within these fields and abouthalf are optically unresolved. most unresolved galex/sdss sources are brightblue turn-off thick disk stars and are typically detected only in the galexnear-uv band. the remaining unresolved sources include low-redshift quasars,white dwarfs, and white dwarf/m dwarf pairs, and these dominate the opticallyunresolved sources detected in both galex bands.  almost all the resolved sdss sources detected by galex are fainter than thesdss 'main' spectroscopic limit. these sources have colors consistent withthose of blue (spiral) galaxies (u-r&lt;2.2), and most are detected in both galexbands. measurements of their uv colors allow much more accurate and robustestimates of star-formation history than are possible using only sdss data.indeed, galaxies with the most recent (&lt;20 myr) star formation can be robustlyselected from the galex data by requiring that they be brighter in the far-uvthan in the near-uv band. however, older starburst galaxies have uv colorssimilar to agn, and thus cannot be selected unambiguously on the basis of galexfluxes alone.  with the aid of 2mass data, we construct and discuss median 10 banduv-optical-ir spectral energy distributions for turn-off stars, hot whitedwarfs, low-redshift quasars, and spiral and elliptical galaxies. we point outthe high degree of correlation between the uv color and the contribution of theuv flux to the uv-optical-ir flux of galaxies detected by galex.

astro-ph;0508564	photometric covariance in multi-band surveys: understanding the  photometric error in the sdss	in this paper we describe a detailed analysis of the photometricuncertainties present within the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging surveybased on repeat observations of approximately 200 square degrees of the sky. weshow that, for the standard sdss aperture systems (petrocounts, counts_model,psfcounts and cmodel_counts), the errors generated by the sdss photometricpipeline under-estimate the observed scatter in the individual bands. thedegree of disagreement is a strong function of aperture and magnitude (rangingfrom 20% to more than a factor of 2). we also find that the photometry in thefive optical bands can be highly correlated for both point sources andgalaxies, although the correlation for point sources is almost entirely due tovariable objects. without correcting for this covariance the sdss color errorscould be in over-estimated by a factor of two to three. combining theseopposing effects, the sdss errors on the colors differ from the observed colorvariation by approximately 10-20% for most apertures and magnitudes. we providea prescription to correct the errors derived from the sdss photometric pipelineas a function of magnitude and a semi-analytic method for generating theappropriate covariance between the different photometric passbands. given theintrinsic nature of these correlations, we expect that all current and futuremulti-band surveys will also observe strongly covariant magnitudes. the abilityof these surveys to complete their science goals is largely dependent oncolor-based target selection and photometric redshifts; these results show theimportance of spending a significant fraction of early survey operations onre-imaging to empirically determine the photometric covariance of anyobserving/reduction pipeline.

astro-ph;0510520	the milky way tomography with sdss: i. stellar number density  distribution	abridged: we estimate the distances to ~48 million stars detected by thesloan digital sky survey and map their 3d number density distribution in 100 &lt;d &lt; 20 kpc range over 6,500 deg^2 of sky. the data show strong evidence for agalaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number oflocalized overdensities with exponential disk parameters (bias-corrected for anassumed 35% binary fraction) h_1 = 300 pc, l_1 = 2600 pc, h_2 = 900 pc, l_2 =3600 pc, and local density normalization of 12%. we find the halo to be oblate,with best-fit axis ratio c/a = 0.64, r^{-2.8} profile, and the localhalo-to-thin disk normalization of 0.5%. we estimate the errors of derivedmodel parameters to be no larger than ~20% (disk scales) and ~10% (thick disknormalization). while generally consistent with the above model, the densitydistribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations.we detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at (r, z) ~ (6.5, 1.5)kpcand (r, z) ~ (9.5, 0.8) kpc, and a remarkable density enhancement in the halocovering &gt;1000deg^2 of sky towards the constellation of virgo, at distances of~6-20 kpc. compared to a region symmetric with respect to the l=0 line, thevirgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess andmay be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy mergingwith the milky way. after removal of the resolved overdensities, the remainingdata are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidenceof further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from ~50pc in thedisk, to ~1 - 2 kpc in the halo.

astro-ph;0512080	a survey of z&gt;5.7 quasars in the sloan digital sky survey iv: discovery  of seven additional quasars	we present the discovery of seven quasars at z&gt;5.7, selected from ~2000 deg^2of multicolor imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the newquasars have redshifts z from 5.79 to 6.13. five are selected as part of acomplete flux-limited sample in the sdss northern galactic cap; two have largerphotometric errors and are not part of the complete sample. one of the newquasars, sdss j1335+3533 (z=5.93), exhibits no emission lines; the 3-sigmalimit on the rest-frame equivalent width of ly alpha+nv line is 5 a. it is thehighest redshift lineless quasar known, and could be a gravitational lensedgalaxy, a bl lac object or a new type of quasar. two new z&gt;6 quasars, sdss1250+3130 (z=6.13) and sdss j1137+3549 (z=6.01), show deep gunn-petersonabsorption gaps in ly alpha. these gaps are narrower the complete gunn-petersonabsorption troughs observed among quasars at z&gt;6.2 and do not have complete lybeta absorption.

astro-ph;0603742	quasars probing quasars i: optically thick absorbers near luminous  quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we search 149 moderate resolution background quasar spectra, from gemini, keck,the mmt, and the sdss to survey lyman limit systems (llss) and damped ly-alphasystems (dlas) in the vicinity of 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 4.0 luminous foreground quasars. asample of 27 new quasar-absorber pairs is uncovered with column densities, 17.2&lt; log (n_hi/cm^2) &lt; 20.9, and transverse (proper) distances of 22 kpc/h &lt; r &lt;1.7 mpc/h, from the foreground quasars. if they emit isotropically, the impliedionizing photon fluxes are a factor of ~ 5-8000 times larger than the ambientextragalactic uv background over this range of distances. the observedprobability of intercepting an absorber is very high for small separations: sixout of eight projected sightlines with transverse separations r &lt; 150 kpc/hhave an absorber coincident with the foreground quasar, of which four have logn_hi &gt; 10^19. the covering factor of log n_hi &gt; 10^19 absorbers is thus ~ 50 %(4/8) on these small scales, whereas &lt; 2% would have been expected at random.there are many cosmological applications of these new sightlines: they providelaboratories for studying fluorescent ly-alpha recombination radiation fromllss, constrain the environments, emission geometry, and radiative histories ofquasars, and shed light on the physical nature of llss and dlas.

astro-ph;0605571	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. i. candidate selection  algorithm	we present an algorithm for selecting an uniform sample of gravitationallylensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2) quasars brighter thani=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the sdss. our algorithmuses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small-and large-separation lenses, respectively. our selection algorithm only relieson parameters that the sdss standard image processing pipeline generates,allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. the algorithm has beentested against simulated sdss images, which adopt distributions of field andquasar parameters taken from the real sdss data as input. furthermore, we takedifferential reddening into account. we find that our selection algorithm isalmost complete down to separations of 1'' and flux ratios of 10^-0.5. thealgorithm selects both double and quadruple lenses. at a separation of 2'',doubles and quads are selected with similar completeness, and above (below) 2''the selection of quads is better (worse) than for doubles. our morphologicalselection identifies a non-negligible fraction of single quasars: to removethese we fit images of candidates with a model of two point sources and rejectthose with unusually small image separations and/or large magnitude differencesbetween the two point sources. we estimate the efficiency of our selectionalgorithm to be at least 8% at image separations smaller than 2'', comparableto that of radio surveys. the efficiency declines as the image separationincreases, because of larger contamination from stars. we also present themagnification factor of lensed images as a function of the image separation,which is needed for accurate computation of magnification bias.
