0909.5186	star formation histories within the antennae galaxies (arp 244)	with the imagery from galex, hst, 2mass, and spitzer, and at the resolutionof mips 24 micron(~6"), we study the variations of the broadband spectralenergy distributions (seds) of star-forming regions within the nearestprototypal major merger -- the antennae galaxies. by including mips 24 microndust emission into stellar population analysis, we reliably, albeit roughly,constrain the star formation histories of these 24 micron selected star-formingregions across the merging disks of the antennae. our population analysis isconsistent with the star formation scenario that, most regions across the wholesystem are at a modest level of star formation with the exception of somelocalized intense starburst sites in the well-known overlap regions and thewestern-loop regions of northern galaxy ngc 4038. compared with all the otherregions, the young overlap regions currently (&lt;10 myr) are experiencing muchmore violent enhancement of star formation. across the overlap regions, wesuggest two sequential star formation paths which we interpret as the imprintsof the interpenetrating process of the two merging disks following their secondclose encounter. and we suggest that the star formation in the southern and(especially) northwestern edges of the overlap zone may have been justtriggered by pre-starburst shocks. the well-known mid-infrared "hotspot" in theoverlap regions is also a "hotspot" at 4.5 micron, whose total 4.5 micronemission (&gt;=80% from both hot dust and atomic/molecular lines) is comparablewith that of the two galactic nuclei.

0911.5713	new dynamo pattern revealed by solar helical magnetic fields	previously unobservable mirror asymmetry of the solar magnetic field -- a keyingredient of the dynamo mechanism which is believed to drive the 11-yearactivity cycle -- has now been measured. this was achieved through systematicmonitoring of solar active regions carried out for more than 20 years atobservatories in mees, huairou, and mitaka. in this paper we report on detailedanalysis of vector magnetic field data, obtained at huairou solar observingstation in china. electric current helicity (the product of current andmagnetic field component in the same direction) was estimated from the data anda latitude-time plot of solar helicity during the last two solar cycles hasbeen produced. we find that like sunspots helicity patterns propagateequatorwards but unlike sunspot polarity helicity in each solar hemisphere doesnot change sign from cycle to cycle - confirming the theory. there are,however, two significant time-latitudinal domains in each cycle when the signdoes briefly invert. our findings shed new light on stellar and planetarydynamos and has yet to be included in the theory.

1002.3648	local benchmarks for the evolution of major-merger galaxies -- spitzer  observations of a k-band selected sample	we present spitzer observations for a sample of close major-merger galaxypairs (kpair sample) selected from 2mass/sdss-dr3 cross-matches. the goals areto study the star formation activity in these galaxies and to set a local benchmark for the cosmic evolution of close major mergers. the spitzer kpair sample(27 pairs, 54 galaxies) includes all spectroscopically confirmed s+s and s+epairs in a parent sample that is complete for primaries brighter than k=12.5mag, projected separations of 5&lt; s &lt; 20 kpc/h, and mass ratios&lt;2.5. the spitzerdata consist of images in 7 bands (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8, 24, 70, 160 um). comparedto single spiral galaxies in a control sample, only spiral galaxies in s+spairs show significantly enhanced specific star formation rate (ssfr=sfr/m),whereas spiral galaxies in s+e pairs do not. furthermore, the sfr enhancementof spiral galaxies in s+s pairs is highly mass-dependent. only those with $\rmm \gsim 10^{10.5} m_\sun$ show significant enhancement. relatively low mass($\rm m \sim 10^{10} m_\sun$) spirals in s+s pairs have about the same sfr/mcompared to their counterparts in the control sample. there is evidence for acorrelation between the global star formation activities (but not the nuclearactivities) of the component galaxies in massive s+s major-merger pairs (the"holmberg effect"). there is no significant difference in the sfr/m between theprimaries and the secondaries, nor between spirals of sep&lt;1 and those of sep.1.the contribution of kpair galaxies to the cosmic sfr density in the localuniverse is only 1.7%.

1003.3505	the radio continuum, far-infrared emission, and dense molecular gas in  galaxies	a tight linear correlation is established between the hcn line luminosity andthe radio continuum (rc) luminosity for a sample of 65 galaxies (from gao &amp;solomon's hcn survey), including normal spiral galaxies and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs/ulirgs). after analyzing the variouscorrelations among the global far-infrared (fir), rc, co, and hcn luminositiesand their various ratios, we conclude that the fir-rc and fir-hcn correlationsappear to be linear and are the tightest among all correlations. thecombination of these two correlations could result in the tight rc-hcncorrelation we observed. meanwhile, the non-linear rc-co correlation showsslightly larger scatter as compared with the rc-hcn correlation, and there isno correlation between ratios of either rc/hcn-co/hcn or rc/fir-co/fir. incomparison, a meaningful correlation is still observed between ratios ofrc/co-hcn/co. nevertheless, the correlation between rc/fir and hcn/fir alsodisappears, reflecting again the two tightest fir-rc and fir-hcn correlationsas well as suggesting that fir seems to be the bridge that connects hcn withrc. interestingly, despite obvious hcn-rc and rc-co correlations,multi-parameter fits hint that while both rc and hcn contribute significantly(with no contribution from co) to fir, yet rc is primarily determined from firwith a very small contribution from co and essentially no contribution fromhcn. these analyses confirm independently the former conclusions that it ispractical to use rc luminosity instead of fir luminosity, at least globally, asan indicator of star formation rate in galaxies including lirgs/ulirgs, and hcnis a much better tracer of star-forming molecular gas and correlates with firmuch better than that of co.

(2003) sample with the sloan digitalsky survey data release 6 (sdss dr6). the sample includes 31 bcds, which span alarge range in galactic parameters. using a stellar population synthesismethod, we derive the stellar populations and reconstruct the star formationhistories for these bcds. our studies confirm that bcds are not young systemsexperiencing their first star formation but old systems undergoing a starburstactivity. the stellar mass-weighted ages can be as old as 10 gyr while theluminosity-weighted ages might be up to $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude younger($\sim 10$ myr) for most galaxies.  based on multi-wavelength data, we also study the integrated star formationproperties. the sfr for our sample galaxies spans nearly 3 orders of magnitude,from a few $10^{-3}$ to $\sim1\,m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, with the median value of$\sim 0.1\, m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. we find that about 90% bcds in our sample havetheir birthrate parameter (the ratio of the current sfr to the averaged pastsfr) $b&gt;2-3$. we further discuss correlations of the current sfr with theintegrated galactic stellar mass and explore the connection between sfr andmetallicity.

1103.0018	determining the squark mass at the lhc	we propose a new way to determine the squark mass based on the shape ofdi-jet invariant mass distribution of supersymmetry (susy) di-jet events at thelarge hadron collider (lhc). our algorithm, which is based on event kinematics,requires that the branching ratio $b(\tilde{q} \rightarrow q \tilde{z}_1)$ issubstantial for at least some types of squarks, and that$m_{\tilde{z}_1}^2/m_{\tilde{q}}^2 \ll 1$. we select di-jet events with noisolated leptons, and impose cuts on the total jet transverse energy,$e_t^{tot}=e_t(j_1)+e_t(j_2)$, on $\alpha = e_t(j_2)/m_{jj}$, and on theazimuthal angle between the two jets to reduce sm backgrounds. the shape of theresulting di-jet mass distribution depends sensitively on the squark mass,especially if the integrated luminosity is sufficient to allow a hard enoughcut on $e_t^{tot}$ and yet leave a large enough signal to obtain the $m_{jj}$distribution. we simulate the signal and standard model (sm) backgrounds for100 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at 14 tev requiring $e_t^{tot}&gt; 700$ gev.we show that it should be possible to extract $m_{\tilde{q}}$ to within about3% at 95% cl --- similar to the precision obtained using $m_{t2}$ --- from thedi-jet mass distribution if $m_{\tilde{q}} \sim 650$ gev, or to within $\sim5$% if $m_{\tilde{q}}\sim 1$ tev.

1103.2546	tidal dwarf galaxies at intermediate redshifts	we present the first attempt at measuring the production rate of tidal dwarfgalaxies (tdgs) and estimating their contribution to the overall dwarfpopulation. using hst/acs deep imaging data from goods and gems surveys inconjunction with photometric redshifts from combo-17 survey, we performed amorphological analysis for a sample of merging/interacting galaxies in theextended chandra deep field south and identified tidal dwarf candidates in therest-frame optical bands. we estimated a production rate about 1.4 {\times}10^{-5} per gyr per comoving volume for long-lived tdgs with stellar mass 3{\times} 10^{8-9} solar mass at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1. together with galaxy merger ratesand tdg survival rate from the literature, our results suggest that only amarginal fraction (less than 10%) of dwarf galaxies in the local universe couldbe tidally-originated. tdgs in our sample are on average bluer than their hostgalaxies in the optical. stellar population modelling of optical tonear-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) for two tdgs favors a burstcomponent with age 400/200 myr and stellar mass 40%/26% of the total,indicating that a young stellar population newly formed in tdgs. this isconsistent with the episodic star formation histories found for nearby tdgs.

1103.5540	12co, 13co and c18o observations along the major axes of nearby bright  infrared galaxies	we present simultaneous observations of co,13co and c18o j=1-0 emission in 11nearby (cz&lt;1000 km/s) bright infrared galaxies. both 12co and 13co are detectedin the centers of all galaxies, except for 13co in ngc 3031. we have alsodetected c18o, cs j=2-1, and hco+ j=1-0 emission in the nuclear regions of m82and m51. these are the first systematical extragalactic detections of 12co andits isotopes from the pmo 14m telescope. we have conducted half-beam spacingmapping of m82 over an area of 4'*2.5' and major axis mapping of ngc 3627, ngc3628, ngc 4631, and m51. the radial distributions of 12co and 13co in ngc 3627,ngc 3628, and m51 can be well fitted by an exponential profile. the 12co/13cointensity ratio,r,decreases monotonically with galactocentric radius in allmapped sources. the average r in the center and disk of the galaxies are9.9+/-3.0 and 5.6+/-1.9 respectively, much lower than the peculiar r(~24) foundin the center of m82. the intensity ratios of 13co/c18o, 13co/hco+ and 13co/cs(either ours or literature data) show little variations with galactocentricradius, in sharp contrast with the greatly varied r. this supports the notionthat the observed gradient in r could be the results of the variations of thephysical conditions across the disks. the h_2 column density derived from c18oshows that the galactic standard conversion factor (x-factor) overestimates theamount of the molecular gas in m82 by a factor of ~2.5. these observationssuggest that the x-factor in active star-forming regions (i.e., nuclearregions) should be lower than that in normal star-forming disks, and thegradient in r can be used to trace the variations of the x-factor.

1104.3935	minimal hcn emission from molecular clouds in m33	since hcn emission has been shown to be a linear tracer of ongoing starformation activity, we have searched for hcn (j = 1-&gt;0) emission from knowngmcs in the nearby galaxy m33. no significant hcn emission has been found alongany of the lines of sight. we find two lines of sight where co-to-hcnintegrated intensity ratios up to 280, nearly a factor of 6 above what is foundin comparable regions of the milky way. star formation tracers suggest that thehcn-to-star formation rate ratio (l_hcn/m_sfr) is a factor of six lower thanwhat is observed in the milky way (on average) and local extragalactic systems.simple chemical models accounting for the sub-solar n/o ratio suggest thatdepletion cannot account for the high co-to-hcn ratios. given hcn formationrequires high extinction (a_v &gt; 4), low metallicity may yield reduced dustshielding and thus a high co/hcn ratio. the turbulence and structure of gmcs inm33 are comparable to those found in other systems, so the differences areunlikely to result from different gmc properties. since lower co-to-hcn ratiosare associated with the highest rates of star formation, we attribute thedeficits in part to evolutionary effects within gmcs.

1106.2813	the global star formation law of galaxies revisited in the radio  continuum	we study the global star formation law - the relation between the gas andstar formation rate (sfr) in a sample of 130 local galaxies with infrared (ir)luminosities spanning over three orders of magnitude (10^9-10^12 lsun), whichincludes 91 normal spiral galaxies and 39 (ultra)luminous ir galaxies[(u)lirgs]. we derive their total (atomic and molecular) gas and densemolecular gas masses using newly available hi, co and hcn data from theliterature. the sfr of galaxies is determined from total ir (8-1000 um) and 1.4ghz radio continuum (rc) luminosities. the galaxy disk sizes are defined by thede-convolved elliptical gaussian fwhm of the rc maps. we derive the galaxydisk-averaged sfrs and various gas surface densities, and investigate theirrelationship. we find that the galaxy disk-averaged surface densities of densemolecular gas mass has the tightest correlation with that of sfr (scatter ~0.26 dex), and is linear in log-log space (power-law slope of n=1.03 +/- 0.02)across the full galaxy sample. the correlation between the total gas and sfrsurface densities for the full sample has a somewhat larger scatter (~ 0.48dex), and is best fit by a power-law with slope 1.45 +/- 0.02. however, theslope changes from ~ 1 when only normal spirals are considered, to ~ 1.5 whenmore and more (u)lirgs are included in the fitting. when different co-to-h2conversion factors are used to infer molecular gas masses for normal galaxiesand (u)lirgs, the bi-modal relations claimed recently in co observations ofhigh-redshift galaxies appear to also exist in local populations ofstar-forming galaxies.

1111.3363	outside-in shrinking of the star-forming disk of dwarf irregular  galaxies	we have studied multi-band surface brightness profiles of a representativesample of 34 nearby dwarf irregular galaxies (dirrs). our data include galexfuv/nuv, ubv, h\alpha, and spitzer 3.6 \mum images. these galaxies constitutethe majority of the little things survey. by modeling the azimuthal averages ofthe spectral energy distributions with a complete library of star formation(sf) histories, we derived the stellar mass surface density distributions andthe sf rate averaged over three different timescales: the recent 0.1 gyr, 1 gyrand a hubble time. we find that, for \sim 80% (27 galaxies) of our samplegalaxies, radial profiles (at least in the outer part) at shorter wavelengthshave shorter disk scale lengths than those at longer wavelengths. thisindicates that the star-forming disk has been shrinking. in addition, theradial distributions of the stellar mass surface density are well described aspiece-wise exponential profiles, and \sim 80% of the galaxies have steeper massprofiles in the outer disk than in the inner region. the steep radial declineof sf rate in the outer parts compared to that in the inner disks gives anatural explanation for the down-bending stellar mass surface density profiles.within the inner disks, our sample galaxies on average have constant ratios ofrecent sf rate to stellar mass with radius. nevertheless, \sim 35% (12galaxies, among which 7 have baryonic mass &lt; 10^8 m\odot) of the sample exhibitnegative slopes across the observed disk, which is in contrast with the"inside-out" disk growth scenario suggested for luminous spiral galaxies. thetendency of sf to become concentrated toward the inner disks in low mass dirrsis interpreted as a result of their susceptibility to environmental effects andregulation through stellar feedback.

1310.1434	air: fused analytical and iterative reconstruction method for computed  tomography	purpose: ct image reconstruction techniques have two major categories:analytical reconstruction (ar) method and iterative reconstruction (ir) method.ar reconstructs images through analytical formulas, such as filteredbackprojection (fbp) in 2d and feldkamp-davis-kress (fdk) method in 3d, whichcan be either mathematically exact or approximate. on the other hand, ir isoften based on the discrete forward model of x-ray transform and formulated asa minimization problem with some appropriate image regularization method, sothat the reconstructed image corresponds to the minimizer of the optimizationproblem. this work is to investigate the fused analytical and iterativereconstruction (air) method.  methods: based on ir with l1-type image regularization, air is formulatedwith a ar-specific preconditioner in the data fidelity term, which results inthe minimal change of the solution algorithm that replaces the adjoint x-raytransform by the filtered x-ray transform. as a proof-of-concept 2d example ofair, fbp is incorporated into tensor framelet (tf) regularization based ir, andthe formulated air minimization problem is then solved through split bregmanmethod with gpu-accelerated x-ray transform and filtered adjoint x-raytransform.  conclusion: air, the fused analytical and iterative reconstruction method, isproposed with a proof-of-concept 2d example to synergize fbp and tf-regularizedir, with improved image resolution and contrast for experimental data. thepotential impact of air is that it offers a general framework to developvarious ar enhanced ir methods, when neither ar nor ir alone is sufficient.

1403.7992	dust and gas in luminous proto-cluster galaxies at z=4.05: the case for  different cosmic dust evolution in normal and starburst galaxies	we measure the dust and gas content of the three sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs) in the gn20 proto-cluster at $z=4.05$ using new iram plateau de bureinterferometer (pdbi) co(4-3) and 1.2-3.3 mm continuum observations. all thesethree smgs are heavily dust obscured, with uv-based star formation rate (sfr)estimates significantly smaller than the ones derived from the bolometricinfrared (ir), consistent with the spatial offsets revealed by hst and coimaging. based also on evaluations of the specific sfr, co-to-h$_2$ conversionfactor and gas depletion timescale, we classify all the three galaxies asstarbursts (sbs), although with a lower confidence for gn20.2b that might be alater stage merging event. we place our measurements in the context of theevolutionary properties of main sequence (ms) and sb galaxies. ulirgs have 3-5times larger $l'_{\rm co}/m_{\rm dust}$ and $m_{\rm dust}/m_\star$ ratios than$z=0$ ms galaxies, but by $z\sim2$ the difference appears to be blurred,probably due to differential metallicity evolution. sb galaxies appear toslowly evolve in their $l'_{\rm co}/m_{\rm dust}$ and $m_{\rm dust}/m_\star$ratios all the way to $z&gt;6$ (consistent with rapid enrichment of sb events),while ms galaxies rapidly increase in $m_{\rm dust}/m_\star$ from $z=0$ to 2(due to gas fraction increase, compensated by a decrease of metallicities).while no ir/submm continuum detection is available for indisputably normalmassive galaxies at $z&gt;2.5$, we show that if metallicity indeed decreaserapidly for these systems at $z&gt;3$ as claimed in the literature, we shouldexpect a strong decrease of their $m_{\rm dust}/m_\star$, consistent withrecent pdbi and alma upper limits. we conclude that the $m_{\rm dust}/m_\star$ratio could be a powerful tool for distinguishing starbursts from normalgalaxies at $z&gt;4$.

1405.6253	dark matter indirect detection signals and the nature of neutrinos in  the supersymmetric $u(1)_{b-l}$ extension of the standard model	in this paper, we study the prospects for determining the nature of neutrinosin the context of a supersymmetric $b-l$ extension of the standard model byusing dark matter indirect detection signals and bounds on $n_{\text{eff}}$from the cosmic microwave background data. the model contains two new darkmatter candidates whose dominant annihilation channels produce more neutrinosthan neutralino dark matter in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. thephoton and neutrino counts may then be used to discriminate between the twomodels. if the dark matter comes from the b-l sector, its indirect signals andimpact on the cosmic microwave background can shed light on the nature of theneutrinos. when the light neutrinos are of majorana type, the indirect neutrinosignal from the sun and the galactic center may show a prompt neutrinobox-feature, as well as an earlier cut-off in both neutrino and gamma rayenergy spectra. when the light neutrinos are of dirac type, their contributionto the effective number of neutrinos $n_{\text{eff}}$ is at a detectable level.

1410.5504	inefficient star formation in extremely metal poor galaxies	the first galaxies contain stars born out of gas with little or no metals.the lack of metals is expected to inhibit efficient gas cooling and starformation but this effect has yet to be observed in galaxies with oxygenabundance relative to hydrogen below a tenth of that of the sun. extremelymetal poor nearby galaxies may be our best local laboratories for studying indetail the conditions that prevailed in low metallicity galaxies at earlyepochs. carbon monoxide (co) emission is unreliable as tracers of gas at lowmetallicities, and while dust has been used to trace gas in low-metallicitygalaxies, low-spatial resolution in the far-infrared has typically led to largeuncertainties. here we report spatially-resolved infrared observations of twogalaxies with oxygen abundances below 10 per cent solar, and show that starsform very inefficiently in seven star-forming clumps of these galaxies. thestar formation efficiencies are more than ten times lower than found in normal,metal rich galaxies today, suggesting that star formation may have been veryinefficient in the early universe.

1412.2774	light higgsino decays as a probe of the nmssm	in the next-to minimal supersymmetric standard model (nmssm), a sizablecoupling $\lambda$ between the singlet and higgs fields can naturallyaccommodate the observed higgs boson mass of 125 gev. this large coupling alsoresults in a large separation between the higgsino and singlino mass scales inthe neutralino sector to evade stringent constraints from direct detectionexperiments. most of the natural parameter space in this setup thereforecontains light higgsinos that can decay into the singlino and the 125 gevhiggs. if the higgsinos are to be light enough to be produced at the lhc, themass gap $m_{\tilde\chi^0_2} -(m_{\tilde\chi^0_1} +m_h)$ is generally fairlylow, resulting in small missing energy. we study the collider phenomenology ofthis process and demonstrate that the 4$b+j+{e\!\!\!\!/_{\rm t}}$ signalarising from $pp\rightarrow\tilde\chi_i^0\tilde\chi_j^0jj$ process can be aviable channel to search for this low mass gap region at the 14 tev lhc. inaddition, we find that a potential signal from the lhc search, in tandem withdirect detection experiments, can distinguish the nmssm from the analogousprocess in the mssm, where the bino plays the role of the singlino, forpositive values of the $\mu$ parameter even when the additionalsinglet-dominated (pseudo)scalars are absent or indistinguishable from thehiggs in the decay.

1503.02052	measuring star-formation rate and far-infrared color in high-redshift  galaxies using the co (7-6) and [nii] 205 micron lines	to better characterize the global star formation (sf) activity in a galaxy,one needs to know not only the star formation rate (sfr) but also therest-frame, far-infrared (fir) color (e.g., the 60-to-100 $\mu$m color,$c(60/100)$] of the dust emission. the latter probes the average intensity ofthe dust heating radiation field and scales statistically with the effectivesfr surface density in star-forming galaxies including (ultra-)luminousinfrared galaxies [(u)lirgs]. to this end, we exploit here a new spectroscopicapproach involving only two emission lines: co\,(7$-$6) at 372 $\mu$m and [nii]at 205 $\mu$m. for local (u)lirgs, the ratios of the co (7$-$6) luminosity($l_{\rm co\,(7-6)}$) to the total infrared luminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$; 8$-$1000$\mu$m) are fairly tightly distributed (to within $\sim$0.12 dex) and showlittle dependence on $c(60/100)$. this makes $l_{\rm co\,(7-6)}$ a good sfrtracer, which is less contaminated by active galactic nuclei (agn) than $l_{\rmir}$ and may also be much less sensitive to metallicity than $l_{\rmco\,(1-0)}$. furthermore, the logarithmic [nii] 205 $\mu$m to co (7$-$6)luminosity ratio is fairly steeply (at a slope of $\sim$$-1.4$) correlated with$c(60/100)$, with a modest scatter ($\sim$0.23 dex). this makes it a usefulestimator on $c(60/100)$ with an implied uncertainty of $\sim$0.15 [or$\lesssim$4 k in the dust temperature ($t_{\rm dust}$) in the case of agraybody emission with $t_{\rm dust} \gtrsim 30$ k and a dust emissivity index$\beta \ge 1$]. our locally calibrated sfr and $c(60/100)$ estimators are shownto be consistent with the published data of (u)lirgs of $z$ up to $\sim$6.5.

astro-ph;0005025	mapping ir enhancements in closely interacting spiral-spiral pairs. i.  iso~cam and iso~sws observations	mid-infrared (mir) imaging and spectroscopic observations are presented for awell defined sample of eight closely interacting (clo) pairs of spiral galaxiesthat have overlapping disks and show enhanced far-infrared (fir) emission. thegoal is to study the star formation distribution in clo pairs, with specialemphasis on the role of 'overlap starbursts'. observations were made with theinfrared space observatory (iso) using the cam and sws instruments. the iso~cammaps, tracing the mir emission of warm dust heated by young massive stars, arecompared to new ground based h$\alpha$ and r-band images. we identify threepossible subgroups in the sample, classified according to the star formationmorphology: (1) advanced mergers (arp~157, arp~244 and arp~299), (2) severelydisturbed systems (arp~81 and arp~278), and (3) less disturbed systems(arp~276, kpg 347 and kpg 426). localized starbursts are detected in theoverlap regions in all five pairs of subgroups (1) and (2), suggesting thatthey are a common property in colliding systems. except for arp~244, the'overlap starburst' is usually fainter than the major nuclear starburst in clopairs. star formation in 'less disturbed systems' is often distributedthroughout the disks of both galaxies with no 'overlap starburst' detected inany of them. these systems also show less enhanced fir emission, suggestingthat they are in an earlier interaction stage than pairs of the other twosubgroups where the direct disk collisions have probably not yet occurred.

astro-ph;0008114	molecular gas concentrations outside the merging disks	we present our preliminary bima co(1-0) images of ii~zw~96 which show hugemolecular gas concentrations outside the merging disks. the dominant extra-diskco concentrations in ii~zw~96 correspond to the two star-forming ``knots''hidden by dust, whereas the others are associated with the two spiral disks.the unique huge co concentrations, $\approxgt 5$ kpc away from the mergingnuclei, account for $\approxgt 50 %$ of the total co emission, yet only at amoderate gas surface density as compared with that of ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (uligs). we tentatively conclude that the huge extra-disk gasconcentrations are most likely the overlap region of the gas disks, notnecessarily coinciding with the stellar disks overlap region. the gas disksoverlap region could be formed prior to the merging of the stellar disks andbecome the overlap regions found between the disks like that in arp~244 (the``antennae'' galaxies). these overlap regions would eventually nurture the {\itextreme starbursts} and evolve into the extended gas disk surrounding thedouble nuclei in final merging in most uligs.

astro-ph;0010128	molecular gas and the modest star formation efficiency in the  ``antennae'' galaxies: arp~244=ngc 4038/39	(abridged) we report here a factor of 5.7 higher total co flux in arp~244(the ``antennae'' galaxies) than that previously accepted in the literature(thus a total molecular gas mass of 1.5x10$^{10}$ msun), based on our fullysampled co(1-0) observations at the nrao 12m telescope. our observations showthat the molecular gas peaks predominately in the disk-disk overlap regionbetween the nuclei, similar to the far-infrared (fir) and mid-infrared (mir)emission. the bulk of the molecular gas is forming into stars with a normalstar formation efficiency (sfe) l_{ir}/m(h_2) \approx 4.2 lsun/msun, same asthat of giant molecular clouds in the galactic disk. additional supportiveevidence is the extremely low fraction of the dense molecular gas in arp~244,revealed by our detections of the hcn(1-0) emission.  we estimate the local sfe indicated by the ratio map of the radio continuumto co(1-0) emission. remarkably, the local sfe stays roughly same over the bulkof the molecular gas distribution. only some localized regions show the highestradio-to-co ratios that we have identified as the sites of the most intensestarbursts with sfe &gt;~ 20 lsun/msun. these starburst regions are confinedexclusively in the dusty patches seen in the hst images near the co and firpeaks where presumably the violent starbursts are heavily obscured.nevertheless, recent large-scale star formation is going on throughout thesystem, yet the measured level is more suggestive of a moderate starburst (sfe&gt;~ 10 lsun/msun) or a weak to normal star formation (sfe ~ 4 lsun/msun). theoverall starburst from the bulk of the molecular gas is yet to be initiated asmost of the gas further condenses into kpc scale in the final coalescence.

astro-ph;0103285	nature of widely separated ultraluminous infrared galaxies	in the complete sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) compiledby kim (1995) about 5% consists of widely separated galaxies which arepresumably in the early phase of interaction. this fact is contrary to theconventional view that ulirgs are in the final stages of the merger of twogas-rich disk galaxies. we have undertaken high resolution co(j=1-0)observations for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies that have nuclearseparations larger than 20 kpc. we have detected the co emission in 5 out of 6systems, but only in one component of the ulirg pairs. 4 of them have linerspectral type and 1 galaxy has seyfert ii spectral type. in k'-band imagesthese components are also brighter than the other components which have eitherhii-region spectra or no detectable emission lines. using the standardconversion factor, the molecular gas content is estimated to be a few times 10$^{10}$ m$_\odot$, similar to that of the other ultraluminous galaxies. theresult indicates that the galaxy containing the molecular gas is also thesource of most, if not all, of the huge far-infrared luminosity of the system.the optical and k'-band imaging observations and optical spectra suggestmultiple merger scenario for 1 system. if the remaining systems are in an earlystage of a binary tidal interaction, the commonly accepted interpretation ofthe ulirg phenomenon as the final merger stage of two disk galaxies may need tobe re-examined.
