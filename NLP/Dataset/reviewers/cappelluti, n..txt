0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0901.3357	a candidate tidal disruption event in the galaxy cluster abell 3571	tidal disruption events are possible sources of temporary nuclear activity ingalactic nuclei and can be considered as good indicators of the existence ofsuper massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. a new x-ray source hasbeen serendipitously detected with rosat in a pspc pointed observation of thegalaxy cluster a3571. given the strong flux decay of the object in subsequentdetections, the tidal disruption scenario is investigated as possibleexplanationof the event. we followed up the evolution of the x-ray transientwith rosat, xmm-newton and chandra for a total period of ~13 years. we alsoobtained 7-band optical/nir photometry with grond at the eso/mpi 2.2mtelescope. we report a very large decay of the x-ray flux of rosat sourceidentified with the galaxy leda 095953 a member of the cluster abell 3571. wemeasured a maximum 0.3-2.4 kev luminosity log(l_x)=42.8 erg s^-1. the highstate of the source lasted at least 150 ks, afterwards l_x declined as ~t^-2.the spectrum of the brightest epoch is consistent with a black body withtemperature kt ~0.12 kev. the total energy released by this event in 10 yr wasestimated to be delta_e&gt;2x10^50 erg. we interpret this event as a tidaldisruption of a solar type star by the central supermassive black hole (i.e.~10^7 m_sun) of the galaxy.

0910.2617	the chandra survey of the cosmos field ii: source detection and  photometry	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra program,that covers the central contiguous ~0.92 deg^2 of the cosmos field. c-cosmos isthe result of a complex tiling, with every position being observed in up to sixoverlapping pointings (four overlapping pointings in most of the central ~0.45deg^2 area with the best exposure, and two overlapping pointings in most of thesurrounding area, covering an additional ~0.47 deg^2). therefore, the fullexploitation of the c-cosmos data requires a dedicated and accurate analysisfocused on three main issues: 1) maximizing the sensitivity when the psfchanges strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1arcsec up to ~10 arcsec half power radius); 2) resolving close pairs; and 3)obtaining the best source localization and count rate. we present here ourtreatment of four key analysis items: source detection, localization,photometry, and survey sensitivity. our final procedure consists of a two stepprocedure: (1) a wavelet detection algorithm, to find source candidates, (2) amaximum likelihood point spread function fitting algorithm to evaluate thesource count rates and the probability that each source candidate is afluctuation of the background. we discuss the main characteristics of thisprocedure, that was the result of detailed comparisons between differentdetection algorithms and photometry tools, calibrated with extensive anddedicated simulations.

0910.5219	a weak lensing study of x-ray groups in the cosmos survey: form and  evolution of the mass-luminosity relation	measurements of x-ray scaling laws are critical for improving cosmologicalconstraints derived with the halo mass function and for understanding thephysical processes that govern the heating and cooling of the intraclustermedium. in this paper, we use a sample of 206 x-ray selected galaxy groups toinvestigate the scaling relation between x-ray luminosity (lx) and halo mass(m00) where m200 is derived via stacked weak gravitational lensing. this workdraws upon a broad array of multi-wavelength cosmos observations including 1.64square degrees of contiguous imaging with the advanced camera for surveys (acs)and deep xmm-newton/chandra imaging. the combined depth of these two data-setsallows us to probe the lensing signals of x-ray detected structures at bothhigher redshifts and lower masses than previously explored. weak lensingprofiles and halo masses are derived for nine sub-samples, narrowly binned inluminosity and redshift. the cosmos data alone are well fit by a power law,m200 ~ lx^a, with a slope of a=0.66+-0.14. these results significantly extendthe dynamic range for which the halo masses of x-ray selected structures havebeen measured with weak gravitational lensing. as a result, tight constraintsare obtained for the slope of the m-lx relation. the combination of our groupdata with previously published cluster data demonstrates that the m-lx relationis well described by a single power law, a=0.64+-0.03, over two decades inmass, 10^13.5-10^15.5 h72^-1 msun. these results are inconsistent at the 3.7level with the self-similar prediction of a=0.75. we examine the redshiftdependence of the m-lx relation and find little evidence for evolution beyondthe rate predicted by self-similarity from z ~ 0.25 to z ~ 0.8.

0912.4166	the x-ray to optical-uv luminosity ratio of x-ray selected type 1 agn in  xmm-cosmos	we present a study of the x-ray to optical properties of a sample of 545x-ray selected type 1 agn, from the xmm-cosmos survey, over a wide range ofredshifts ($0.04&lt;\z&lt;4.25$) and x-ray luminosities ($40.6 \leq \log \lhard \leq45.3$). about 60% of them are spectroscopically identified type 1 agn, whilethe others have a reliable photometric redshift and are classified as type 1agn on the basis of their multi-band spectral energy distributions. we discussthe relationship between uv and x-ray luminosity, as parameterized by the$\alphaox$ spectral slope, and its dependence on redshift and luminosity. wecompare our findings with previous investigations of optically selectedbroad-line agn (mostly from sdss). a highly significant correlation between$\alphaox$ and $\lo$ is found, in agreement with previous investigations ofoptically selected samples. we calculate bolometric corrections, $\kbol$, forthe whole sample using hard x-ray luminosities ($\lhard$), and the eddingtonratios for a subsample of 150 objects for which black hole mass estimates areavailable. we confirm the trend of increasing bolometric correction withincreasing eddington ratio as proposed in previous works. a tight correlationis found between $\alphaox$ and $\kbol$, which can be used to estimate accuratebolometric corrections using only optical and x-ray data. we find a significantcorrelation between $\alphaox$ and eddington ratio, in which $\alphaox$increases for increasing eddington ratios.

1001.1354	the vla-cosmos perspective on the ir-radio relation. i. new constraints  on selection biases and the non-evolution of the ir/radio properties of star  forming and agn galaxies at intermediate and high redshift	vla 1.4 ghz (rms noise ~0.012 mjy) and mips 24 and 70 micron (rms noise ~0.02and ~1.7 mjy, respectively) observations covering the 2 square degree cosmosfield are combined with an extensive multi-wavelength data set to study theevolution of the ir-radio relation at intermediate and high redshift. with~4500 sources -- of which ~30% have spectroscopic redshifts -- the currentsample is significantly larger than previous ones used for the same purpose.both monochromatic ir/radio flux ratios (q24 &amp; q70), as well as the ratio ofthe total ir and the 1.4 ghz luminosity (qtir) are used as indicators for their/radio properties of star forming galaxies and agn.  using a sample jointly selected at ir and radio wavelengths in order toreduce selection biases, we provide firm support for previous findings that their-radio relation remains unchanged out to at least z~1.4. moreover, based ondata from ~150 objects we also find that the local relation likely still holdsat 2.5&lt;z&lt;5. at redshift z&lt;1.4 we observe that radio-quiet agn populate thelocus of the ir-radio relation in similar numbers as star forming sources. inour analysis we employ the methods of survival analysis in order to ensure astatistically sound treatment of flux limits arising from non-detections. wedetermine the observed shift in average ir/radio properties of ir- and radio-selected populations and show that it can reconcile apparently discrepantmeasurements presented in the literature. finally, we also investigatevariations of the ir/radio ratio with ir and radio luminosity and find that ithardly varies with ir luminosity but is a decreasing function of radioluminosity.

1002.4299	ultraluminous x-ray sources out to z~0.3 in the cosmos field	using chandra observations we have identified a sample of seven off-nuclearx-ray sources, in the redshift range z=0.072-0.283, located within opticallybright galaxies in the cosmos survey. using the multi-wavelength coverageavailable in the cosmos field, we study the properties of the host galaxies ofthese ulxs. in detail, we derived their star formation rate from h_alphameasurements and their stellar masses using sed fitting techniques with the aimto compute the probability to have an off-nuclear source based on the hostgalaxy properties. we divide the host galaxies in different morphologicalclasses using the available acs/hst imaging. we find that our ulxs candidatesare located in regions of the sfr versus m$_star$ plane where one or moreoff-nuclear detectable sources are expected. from a morphological analysis ofthe acs imaging and the use of rest-frame colours, we find that our ulxs arehosted both in late and early type galaxies. finally, we find that the fractionof galaxies hosting a ulx ranges from ~0.5% to ~0.2% going from l[0.5-2 kev]=3x 10^39 erg s^-1 to l[0.5-2 kev]= 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1004.2790	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field (xmm-cosmos):  demography and multiwavelength properties of obscured and unobscured luminous  agn	we report the final optical identifications of the medium-depth (~60 ksec),contiguous (2 deg^2) xmm-newton survey of the cosmos field. xmm-newton hasdetected ~800 x-ray sources down to limiting fluxes of ~5x10^{-16},~3x10^{-15}, and ~7x10^{-15} erg/cm2/s in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kevbands, respectively. the work is complemented by an extensive collection ofmulti-wavelength data from 24 micron to uv, available from the cosmos survey,for each of the x-ray sources, including spectroscopic redshifts for ~50% ofthe sample, and high-quality photometric redshifts for the rest. the xmm andmultiwavelength flux limits are well matched: 1760 (98%) of the x-ray sourceshave optical counterparts, 1711 (~95%) have irac counterparts, and 1394 (~78%)have mips 24micron detections. thanks to the redshift completeness (almost100%) we were able to constrain the high-luminosity tail of the x-rayluminosity function confirming that the peak of the number density oflogl_x&gt;44.5 agn is at z~2. spectroscopically-identified obscured and unobscuredagn, as well as normal and starforming galaxies, present well-defined opticaland infrared properties. we devised a robust method to identify a sample of~150 high redshift (z&gt;1), obscured agn candidates for which opticalspectroscopy is not available. we were able to determine that the fraction ofthe obscured agn population at the highest (l_x&gt;10^{44} erg s^{-1}) x-rayluminosity is ~15-30% when selection effects are taken into account, providingan important observational constraint for x-ray background synthesis. westudied in detail the optical spectrum and the overall spectral energydistribution of a prototypical type 2 qso, caught in a stage transitioning frombeing starburst dominated to agn dominated, which was possible to isolate onlythanks to the combination of x-ray and infrared observations.

1005.4968	agn clustering in the local universe: an unbiased picture from swift-bat	we present the clustering measurement of hard x-ray selected agn in the localuniverse. we used a sample of 199 sources spectroscopically confirmed detectedby swift-bat in its 15-55 kev all-sky survey. we measured the real spaceprojected auto-correlation function and detected a signal significant onprojected scales lower than 200 mpc/h. we measured a correlation length ofr0=5.56+0.49-0.43 mpc/h and a slope {\gamma}=1.64-0.08 -0.07. we also measuredthe auto-correlation function of type i and type ii agn and found highercorrelation length for type i agn. we have a marginal evidence of luminositydependent clustering of agn, as we detected a larger correlation length ofluminous agn than that of low luminosity sources. the corresponding typicalhost dm halo masses of swift-bat are log(mdmh) 12-14 h^-1 m/m_sun, depending onthe subsample. for the whole sample we measured log(mdmh)\sim 13.15 h-1 m/m_sunwhich is the typical mass of a galaxy group. we estimated that the local agnpopulation has a typical lifetime tau_agn \sim 0.7 gyr, it is powered by smbhwith mass mbh \sim 1-10x10^8 m_\odot and accreting with very low efficiency,log(epsilon)-2.0. we also conclude that local agn host galaxies are typicallyred-massive galaxies with stellar mass of the order 2-80x10^10 h^-1 m_sun. wecompared our results with clustering predictions of merger-driven agntriggering models and found a good agreement.

1009.4699	galaxy clusters in the swift/bat era ii: 10 more clusters detected above  15 kev	we report on the discovery of 10 additional galaxy clusters detected in theongoing swift/bat all-sky survey. among the newly bat-discovered clusters thereare: bullet, abell 85, norma, and pks 0745-19. norma is the only cluster, amongthose presented here, which is resolved by bat. for all the clusters we performa detailed spectral analysis using xmm-newton and swift/bat data to investigatethe presence of a hard (non-thermal) x-ray excess. we find that in most casesthe clusters' emission in the 0.3-200kev band can be explained by amulti-temperature thermal model confirming our previous results. for twoclusters (bullet and abell 3667) we find evidence for the presence of a hardx-ray excess. in the case of the bullet cluster, our analysis confirms thepresence of a non-thermal, power-law like, component with a 20-100 kev flux of3.4 \times 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 as detected in previous studies. for abell 3667the excess emission can be successfully modeled as a hot component (kt=~13kev).we thus conclude that the hard x-ray emission from galaxy clusters (except thebullet) has most likely thermal origin.

0704.2285	the 3d soft x-ray cluster-agn cross-correlation function in the rosat  nep survey	x-ray surveys facilitate investigations of the environment of agns. deepchandra observations revealed that the agns source surface density rises nearclusters of galaxies. the natural extension of these works is the measurementof spatial clustering of agns around clusters and the investigation of relativebiasing between active galactic nuclei and galaxies near clusters.the majoraims of this work are to obtain a measurement of the correlation length of agnsaround clusters and a measure of the averaged clustering properties of acomplete sample of agns in dense environments. we present the first measurementof the soft x-ray cluster-agn cross-correlation function in redshift spaceusing the data of the rosat-nep survey. the survey covers 9x9 deg^2 around thenorth ecliptic pole where 442 x-ray sources were detected and almost completelyspectroscopically identified. we detected a &gt;3sigma significant clusteringsignal on scales s&lt;50 h70^-1 mpc. we performed a classical maximum-likelihoodpower-law fit to the data and obtained a correlation length s_0=8.7+1.2-0.3h_70-1 mpc and a slope gamma=1.7$^+0.2_-0.7 (1sigma errors). this is a strongevidence that agns are good tracers of the large scale structure of theuniverse. our data were compared to the results obtained by cross-correlatingx-ray clusters and galaxies. we observe, with a large uncertainty, that thebias factor of agn is similar to that of galaxies.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1202.4275	the effect of feedback on the emission properties of the warm-hot  intergalactic medium	at present, 30-40 per cent of the baryons in the local universe is stillundetected. according to theoretical predictions, this gas should reside infilaments filling the large-scale structure (lss) in the form of a warm-hotintergalactic medium (whim), at temperatures of 10^5 - 10^7 k, thus emitting inthe soft x-ray energies via free-free interaction and line emission from heavyelements. in this work we characterize the properties of the x-ray emission ofthe whim, and the lss in general, focusing on the influence of differentphysical mechanisms, namely galactic winds (gws), black-hole feedback andstar-formation, and providing estimates of possible observational constraints.to this purpose we use a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations thatinclude a self-consistent treatment of star-formation and chemical enrichmentof the intergalactic medium, that allows us to follow the evolution ofdifferent metal species. we construct a set of simulated light-cones to makepredictions of the emission in the 0.3-10 kev energy range. we obtain that gwsincrease by a factor of 2 the emission of both galaxy clusters and whim. theamount of oxygen at average temperature and, consequently, the amount ofexpected bright ovii and oviii lines is increased by a factor of 3 due to gwsand by 20 per cent when assuming a top-heavy imf. we compare our results withcurrent observational constraints and find that the emission from faint groupsand whim should account from half to all of the unresolved x-ray background inthe 1-2 kev band.

1204.4485	x-ray properties of radio-selected star forming galaxies in the  chandra-cosmos survey	x-ray surveys contain sizable numbers of star forming galaxies, beyond theagn which usually make the majority of detections. many methods to separate thetwo populations are used in the literature, based on x-ray and multiwavelengthproperties. we aim at a detailed test of the classification schemes and tostudy the x-ray properties of the resulting samples. we build on a sample ofgalaxies selected at 1.4 ghz in the vla-cosmos survey, classified by smolcic etal. (2008) according to their optical colours and observed with chandra. asimilarly selected control sample of agn is also used for comparison. we reviewsome x-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the samplecomposition. the efficiency of the classification scheme devised by smolcic etal. (2008) is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expectedbecause of the higher x-ray brightness of agn with respect to galaxies. thelatter fraction is actually 50% in the x-ray detected sources, while it isexpected to be much lower among x-ray undetected sources. indeed, the analysisof the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, stronglydifferent properties between the agn and galaxy samples. x-ray based selectioncriteria are then used to refine both samples. the radio/x-ray luminositycorrelation for star forming galaxies is found to hold with the samex-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. some evolution of the ratio may bepossible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, tough it is likelyexplained by a bias arising from the radio selection. finally, we discuss thex-ray number counts of star forming galaxies from the vla- and c-cosmos surveysaccording to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similardetermination from the chandra deep fields. the classification scheme proposedhere may find application in future works and surveys.

1205.6470	millimeter imaging of submillimeter galaxies in the cosmos field:  redshift distribution	we present new iram pdbi 1.3mm continuum observations at ~1.5" resolution of28 smgs previously discovered with the 870um bolometer laboca at apex withinthe central 0.7deg2 of the cosmos field. 19 out of the 28 laboca sources weredetected with the pdbi at a &gt;~3sigma level of ~1.4mjy/b. a combined analysis ofthis new sample with existing interferometrically identified smgs in the cosmosfield yields the following results: 1) &gt;~15%, and possibly up to ~40% ofsingle-dish detected smgs consist of multiple sources, 2) statisticalidentifications of multi-wavelength counterparts to the single-dish smgs yieldthat only ~50% of these single-dish smgs have real radio or ir counterparts, 3)~18% of interferometric smgs have only radio or even no multi-wavelengthcounterpart at all, and 4) ~50-70% of z&gt;~3 smgs have no radio counterparts downto an rms of 7-12ujy at 1.4ghz. using the exact interferometric positions toidentify proper multi-wavelength counterparts allows us to determine accuratephotometric redshifts for these sources. the redshift distributions of thecombined and the individual 1.1mm and 870um selected samples have a higher meanand broader width than the redshift distributions derived in previous studies.our sample supports the previous tentative trend that on average brighterand/or mm-selected smgs are located at higher redshifts. there is a tentativeoffset between the mean redshift for the 1.1mm (&lt;z&gt;=3.1+/-0.4) and 870um(&lt;z&gt;=2.6+/-0.4) selected samples, with the 1.1mm sources lying on average athigher redshifts. based on our nearly complete sample of aztec 1.1mm smgswithin a uniform 0.15deg2 area we infer a higher surface density of z&gt;~4 smgsthan predicted by current cosmological models. in summary, our findings implythat (sub-)millimeter interferometric identifications are crucial to buildstatistically complete and unbiased samples of smgs.

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1208.4105	the nature of the unresolved extragalactic soft cxb	in this paper we investigate the power spectrum of the unresolved 0.5-2 kevcxb with deep chandra 4 ms observations in the cdfs. we measured a signalwhich, on scales &gt;30", is significantly higher than the shot-noise and isincreasing with the angular scale. we interpreted this signal as the jointcontribution of clustered undetected sources like agn, galaxies andinter-galactic-medium (igm). the power of unresolved cosmic sourcesfluctuations accounts for \sim 12% of the 0.5-2 kev extragalactic cxb. overall,our modeling predicts that \sim 20% of the unresolved cxb flux is made by lowluminosity agn, \sim 25% by galaxies and \sim 55% by the igm (inter galacticmedium). we do not find any direct evidence of the so called warm hotintergalactic medium (i.e. matter with 10^5k&lt;t&lt;10^7k and density contrast{\delta} &lt;1000), but we estimated that it could produce about 1/7 of theunresolved cxb. we placed an upper limit to the space density of postulatedx-ray-emitting early black hole at z&gt;7.5 and compared it with smbh evolutionmodels.

1210.5302	cross-correlating cosmic ir and x-ray background fluctuations: evidence  of significant black hole populations among the cib sources	in order to understand the nature of the sources producing the recentlyuncovered cosmic infrared background (cib) fluctuations, we studycross-correlations between the fluctuations in the source-subtracted cib fromspitzer/irac data and the unresolved cosmic x-ray background from deep chandraobservations. our study uses data from the egs/aegis field, where both datasets cover an 8'x45' region of the sky. our measurement is the cross-powerspectrum between the ir and x-ray data. the cross-power signal between the iracmaps at 3.6 um and 4.5 um and the chandra [0.5-2] kev data has been detected,at angular scales 20'', with an overall significance of 3.8 sigma and 5.6sigma, respectively. at the same time we find no evidence of significantcross-correlations at the harder chandra bands. the cross-correlation signal isproduced by individual ir sources with 3.6 um and 4.5 um magnitudes m_ab 25-26and [0.5-2] kev x-ray fluxes 7e-17 cgs.we determine that at least 15%-25% ofthe large scale power of the cib fluctuations is correlated with the spatialpower spectrum of the x-ray fluctuations. if this correlation is attributed toemission from accretion processes at both ir and x-ray wavelengths, thisimplies a much higher fraction of accreting black holes than among the knownpopulations. we discuss the various possible origins for the cross-power signaland show that neither local foregrounds nor the known remaining normal galaxiesand active galactic nuclei can reproduce the measurements. these observationalresults are an important new constraint on theoretical modeling of the near-ircib fluctuations.

1310.1398	reversal or no reversal: the evolution of the star formation  rate-density relation up to z~1.6	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr)-densityrelation in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) and the greatobservatories origin deep survey (goods) fields up to z~1.6. in addition to the"traditional method", in which the environment is defined according to astatistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a "dynamical"approach, where galaxies are classified according to three differentenvironment regimes: group, "filament-like", and field. both methods show noevidence of a sfr-density reversal. moreover, group galaxies show a mean sfrlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group andfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (sf) activity. wefind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant inthe suppression of the sf below z~1, with respect to purely density-relatedprocesses. we confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies indifferent environments with respect to the so-called main sequence (ms) ofstar-forming galaxies. galaxies in both group and "filament-like" environmentspreferentially lie below the ms up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lowerlevels of star-forming activity at a given mass. at z&gt;1, the star-forminggalaxies in groups reside on the ms. groups exhibit the highest fraction ofquiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, "filament-like", and fieldenvironments have a similar mix of galaxy types. we conclude that groups arethe most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. thus, a fundamentaldifference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matterhaloes of different masses.

1312.2264	agn x-ray variability in the xmm-cosmos survey	we took advantage of the observations carried out by xmm in the cosmos fieldduring 3.5 years, to study the long term variability of a large sample of agn(638 sources), in a wide range of redshift (0.1&lt;z&lt;3.5) and x-ray luminosity($10^{41}&lt;$l(2-10)$&lt;10^{45.5}$). both a simple statistical method to asses thesignificance of variability, and the normalized excess variance($\sigma^{2}_{rms}$) parameter, where used to obtain a quantitative measurementof the variability. variability is found to be prevalent in most agn, wheneverwe have good statistic to measure it, and no significant differences betweentype-1 and type-2 agn were found. a flat (slope -0.23+/-0.03) anti-correlationbetween $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity is found, when significantlyvariable sources are considered all together. when divided in three redshiftbins, the anti-correlation becomes stronger and evolving with z, with higherredshift agn being more variable. we prove however that this effect is due tothe pre-selection of variable sources: considering all the sources withavailable $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ measurement, the evolution in redshift disappears.for the first time we were also able to study the long term x-ray variabilityas a function of $m_{\rm bh}$ and eddington ratio, for a large sample of agnspanning a wide range of redshift. an anti-correlation between$\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and $m_{\rm bh}$ is found, with the same slope of theanti-correlation between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity, suggestingthat the latter can be a byproduct of the former one. no clear correlation isfound between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the eddington ratio in our sample.finally, no correlation is found between the x-ray $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and theoptical variability.

1406.3961	the primordial environment of super massive black holes: large scale  galaxy overdensities around $z\sim6$ qsos with lbt	we investigated the presence of galaxy overdensities around four $z\sim6$qsos, namely sdss j1030+0524 (z = 6.28), sdss j1148+5251 (z = 6.41), sdssj1048+4637 (z = 6.20) and sdss j1411+1217 (z = 5.95), through deep $r$-, $i$-and $z$- band imaging obtained with the wide-field ($\sim23'\times25'$) largebinocular camera (lbc) at the large binocular telescope (lbt). we adoptedcolor-color selections within the $i-z$ vs $r-z$ plane to identify samples of$i$-band dropouts at the qso redshift and measure their relative abundance andspatial distribution in the four lbc fields, each covering $\sim8\times8$physical mpc at $z\sim6$. the same selection criteria were then applied to$z$-band selected sources in the $\sim$1 deg$^2$ subaru-xmm newton deep surveyto derive the expected number of dropouts over a blank lbc-sized field($\sim$0.14 deg$^2$). the four observed qso fields host a number of candidateslarger than what is expected in a blank field. by defining as $i$-band dropoutsobjects with $z_{ab}&lt;25$, $i-z&gt;1.4$ and undetected in the $r$-band, we found16, 10, 9, 12 dropouts in sdss j1030+0524, sdss j1148+5251, sdss j1048+4637,and sdss j1411+1217, respectively, whereas only 4.3 such objects are expectedover a 0.14 deg$^2$ blank field. this corresponds to overdensity significancesof 3.3, 1.9, 1.7, 2.5$\sigma$, respectively. by considering the total number ofdropouts in the four lbc fields and comparing it with what is expected in fourblank fields of 0.14 deg$^2$ each, we find that high-z qsos reside in overdenseenvironments at the $3.7\sigma$ level. this is the first direct and unambiguousmeasurement of the large scale structures around $z\sim6$ qsos.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1409.5795	the evolution of star formation activity in galaxy groups	we study the evolution of the total star formation (sf) activity, totalstellar mass and halo occupation distribution in massive halos by using one ofthe largest x-ray selected sample of galaxy groups with secure spectroscopicidentification in the major blank field surveys (ecdfs, cdfn, cosmos, aegis).we provide an accurate measurement of sfr for the bulk of the star-forminggalaxies using very deep mid-infrared spitzer mips and far-infrared herschelpacs observations. for undetected ir sources, we provide a well-calibrated sfrfrom sed fitting. we observe a clear evolution in the level of sf activity ingalaxy groups. the total sf activity in the high redshift groups (0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1) ishigher with respect to the low redshift (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5) sample at any mass by0.8+/-0.12 dex. a milder difference (0.35+/-0.1 dex) is observed between thelow redshift bin and the groups at z~0. we show that the level of sf activityis declining more rapidly in the more massive halos than in the more commonlower mass halos. we do not observe any evolution in the halo occupationdistribution and total stellar mass- halo mass relations in groups. the pictureemerging from our findings suggests that the galaxy population in the mostmassive systems is evolving faster than galaxies in lower mass halos,consistently with a "halo downsizing" scenario.

1409.7693	clustering properties of moderate luminosity x-ray selected type 1 and  type 2 agn at z~3	we investigate, for the first time at z~3, the clustering properties of 189type 1 and 157 type 2 x-ray active galactic nuclei (agn) of moderate luminosity(log&lt;lbol&gt; = 45.3 erg/s), with photometric or spectroscopic redshifts in therange 2.2&lt;z&lt;6.8. these samples are based on chandra and xmm-newton data incosmos. we find that type 1 and type 2 cosmos agn at z=3 inhabit dmhs withtypical mass of logmh = 12.84+0.10/-0.11 and 11.73+0.39/-0.45 msun/h,respectively. this result requires a drop in the halo masses of type 1 and 2cosmos agn at z~3 compared to z&lt;2 xmm cosmos agn with similar luminosities.additionally, we infer that unobscured cosmos agn at z~3 reside in 10 timesmore massive halos compared to obscured cosmos agn, at 2.6sigma level. thisresult extends to z~3 that found in cosmos at z&lt;2, and rules out the picture inwhich obscuration is purely an orientation effect. a model which assumes thatthe agn activity is triggered by major mergers is quite successful inpredicting both the low halo mass of cosmos agn and the typical mass ofluminous sdss quasars at z~3, with the latter inhabiting more massive halosrespect to moderate luminosity agn. alternatively we can argue, at least fortype 1 cosmos agn, that they are possibly representative of an early phase offast (i.e. eddington limited) bh growth induced by cosmic cold flows or diskinstabilities. given the moderate luminosity, these new fast growing bhs havemasses of e7-8 msun at z~3 which might evolve into e8.5-9 msun mass bhs at z=0.following our clustering measurements, we argue that this fast bh growth at z~3in agn with moderate luminosity occurs in dmhs with typical mass of 6 times e12msun/h.

1501.03506	ultra-deep catalog of x-ray groups in the extended chandra deep field  south	ultra-deep observations of ecdf-s with chandra and xmm-newton enable a searchfor extended x-ray emission down to an unprecedented flux of $2\times10^{-16}$ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. we present the search for the extended emission onspatial scales of 32$^{\prime\prime}$ in both chandra and xmm data, covering0.3 square degrees and model the extended emission on scales of arcminutes. wepresent a catalog of 46 spectroscopically identified groups, reaching aredshift of 1.6. we show that the statistical properties of ecdf-s, such aslogn-logs and x-ray luminosity function are broadly consistent with lcdm, withthe exception that dn/dz/d$\omega$ test reveals that a redshift range of$0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5$ in ecdf-s is sparsely populated. the lack of nearby structure,however, makes studies of high-redshift groups particularly easier both inx-rays and lensing, due to a lower level of clustered foreground. we presentone and two point statistics of the galaxy groups as well as weak-lensinganalysis to show that the detected low-luminosity systems are indeed low-masssystems. we verify the applicability of the scaling relations between the x-rayluminosity and the total mass of the group, derived for the cosmos survey tolower masses and higher redshifts probed by ecdf-s by means of stacked weaklensing and clustering analysis, constraining any possible departures to bewithin 30% in mass. abridged.

1503.00056	detailed shape and evolutionary behavior of the x-ray luminosity  function of active galactic nuclei	we construct the rest-frame 2--10 kev intrinsic x-ray luminosity function ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) from a combination of x-ray surveys from theall-sky swift bat survey to the chandra deep field-south. we use ~3200 agns inour analysis, which covers six orders of magnitude in flux. the inclusion ofthe xmm and chandra cosmos data has allowed us to investigate the detailedbehavior of the xlf and evolution. in deriving our xlf, we take into accountrealistic agn spectrum templates, absorption corrections, and probabilitydensity distributions in photometric redshift. we present an analyticalexpression for the overall behavior of the xlf in terms of theluminosity-dependent density evolution, smoothed two power-law expressions in11 redshift shells, three-segment power-law expression of the number densityevolution in four luminosity classes, and binned xlf. we observe a suddenflattening of the low luminosity end slope of the xlf slope at z&gt;~0.6. detailedstructures of the agn downsizing have been also revealed, where the numberdensity curves have two clear breaks at all luminosity classes above log lx&gt;43.the two break structure is suggestive of two-phase agn evolution, consisting ofmajor merger triggering and secular processes.

1505.01153	the most obscured agn in the cosmos field	highly obscured active galactic nuclei (agn) are common in nearby galaxies,but are difficult to observe beyond the local universe, where they are expectedto significantly contribute to the black hole accretion rate density.furthermore, compton-thick (ct) absorbers (nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) suppress even thehard x-ray (2-10 kev) agn nuclear emission, and therefore the column densitydistribution above 10^24 cm^-2 is largely unknown. we present theidentification and multi-wavelength properties of a heavily obscured (nh&gt;~10^25cm^-2), intrinsically luminous (l(2-10kev)&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn at z=0.353 inthe cosmos field. several independent indicators, such as the shape of thex-ray spectrum, the decomposition of the spectral energy distribution andx-ray/[nev] and x-ray/6{\mu}m luminosity ratios, agree on the fact that thenuclear emission must be suppressed by a 10^25 cm^-2 column density. the hostgalaxy properties show that this highly obscured agn is hosted in a massivestar-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlatewith the presence of ct absorbers. finally, asymmetric and blueshiftedcomponents in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate thepresence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense agn activity(l(bol)/l(edd) = 0.3-0.5). such highly obscured, highly accreting agn areintrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be muchmore common at the peak of the star formation and bh accretion history, atz~2-3. we demonstrate that a fully multi-wavelength approach can recover asizable sample of such peculiar sources in large and deep surveys such ascosmos.

1505.02516	t-phot: a new code for psf-matched, prior-based, multiwavelength  extragalactic deconfusion photometry	we present t-phot, a publicly available software aimed at extracting accuratephotometry from low-resolution images of deep extragalactic fields, where theblending of sources can be a serious problem for the accurate and unbiasedmeasurement of fluxes and colours. t-phot has been developed within theastrodeep project and it can be considered as the next generation to tfit,providing significant improvements above it and other similar codes. t-photgathers data from a high-resolution image of a region of the sky, and uses itto obtain priors for the photometric analysis of a lower resolution image ofthe same field. it can handle different types of datasets as input priors: i) alist of objects that will be used to obtain cutouts from the realhigh-resolution image; ii) a set of analytical models; iii) a list ofunresolved, point-like sources, useful e.g. for far-infrared wavelengthdomains. we show that t-phot yields accurate estimations of fluxes within theintrinsic uncertainties of the method, when systematic errors are taken intoaccount (which can be done thanks to a flagging code given in the output).t-phot is many times faster than similar codes like tfit and convphot (up tohundreds, depending on the problem and the method adopted), whilst at the sametime being more robust and more versatile. this makes it an optimal choice forthe analysis of large datasets. in addition we show how the use of differentsettings and methods significantly enhances the performance. given itsversatility and robustness, t-phot can be considered the preferred choice forcombined photometric analysis of current and forthcoming extragalactic opticalto far-infrared imaging surveys.

1507.03953	satellite content and quenching of star formation in galaxy groups at  z~1.8	we study the properties of satellites in the environment of massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.8 in the cosmos field, using a sample of 215galaxies on the main sequence of star formation with an average mass of 10^11msun. at z&gt;1.5, these galaxies typically trace halos of mass &gt;10^13 msun. weuse optical-near-infrared photometry to estimate stellar masses and starformation rates (sfr) of centrals and satellites down to ~6*10^9 msun. we stackdata around 215 central galaxies to statistically detect their satellite halos,finding an average of ~3 galaxies in excess of the background density. we fitthe radial profiles of satellites with simple beta-models, and compare theirintegrated properties to model predictions. we find that the total stellar massof satellites amounts to 68% of the central galaxy, while sed modeling andfar-infrared photometry consistently show their total sfr to be 25-35% of thecentral's rate. we also see significant variation in the specific sfr ofsatellites within the halo with, in particular, a sharp decrease at &lt;100 kpc.after considering different potential explanations, we conclude that this islikely an environmental signature of the hot inner halo. this effect can beexplained in the first order by a simple free-fall scenario, suggesting thatthese low-mass environments can shut down star formation in satellites onrelatively short timescales of ~0.3 gyr.

1509.05413	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s. ix. an x-ray outflow in a luminous  obscured quasar at z~1.6	in active galactic nuclei (agn)-galaxy co-evolution models, agn winds andoutflows are often invoked to explain why super-massive black holes andgalaxies stop growing efficiently at a certain phase of their lives. they arecommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. evidence ofultra-fast (v&gt;0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of agn has beencollected in the past decade by sensitive x-ray observations for sizablesamples of agn, mostly at low redshift. here we present ultra-deep xmm-newtonand chandra spectral data of an obscured (nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsicallyluminous (l2-10kev~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named pid352) at z~1.6 (derivedfrom the x-ray spectral analysis) in the chandra deep field-south. the sourceis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observedenergies of e~2-3 kev. while the emission line is interpreted as being due toneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorptionfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (fexxv, fexxvi) with anoutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionizationmodels. the mass outflow rate - ~2 msun/yr - is similar to the source accretionrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,corresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. pid352 represents oneof the few cases where indications of x-ray outflowing gas have been observedat high redshift thus far. this wind is powerful enough to provide feedback onthe host galaxy.

1511.01899	non-linearity and environmental dependence of the star forming galaxies  main sequence	using data from four deep fields (cosmos, aegis, ecdfs, and cdfn), we studythe correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate(sfr) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z&lt;1.1$. to accuratelyestimate the galaxy sfr, we use the deepest available spitzer/mips 24 andherschel/pacs datasets. we distinguish group environments ($m_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$m_{\odot}$) based on the available deep x-raydata and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. weconfirm that the main sequence (ms) of star forming galaxies is not a linearrelation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses ($m_*&gt;10^{10.4-10.6}$ $m_{\odot}$), across all environments. at high redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1$ ), the ms varies little with environment. at low redshift ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean ms towards theregion of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-denseenvironments. we find that the flattening of the ms toward low sfr is due to anincreased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. instead, thedeviation of group galaxies from the ms at low redshift is caused by a largefraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lowerdensity environments. our results suggest that above a mass threshold ($\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$m_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environmentact together in driving the evolution of the sf activity towards lower level.the presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes arealready in place beyond $z\sim$1. the environmental effects appear, instead, atlower redshifts and have a long time-scale.

1512.00167	identification of z~&gt;2 herschel 500 micron sources using  color-deconfusion	we present a new method to search for candidate z~&gt;2 herschel 500{\mu}msources in the goods-north field, using a s500{\mu}m/s24{\mu}m "colordeconfusion" technique. potential high-z sources are selected againstlow-redshift ones from their large 500{\mu}m to 24{\mu}m flux density ratios.by effectively reducing the contribution from low-redshift populations to theobserved 500{\mu}m emission, we are able to identify counterparts to high-z500{\mu}m sources whose 24{\mu}m fluxes are relatively faint. the recovery ofknown z~4 starbursts confirms the efficiency of this approach in selectinghigh-z herschel sources. the resulting sample consists of 34 dusty star-forminggalaxies at z~&gt;2. the inferred infrared luminosities are in the range1.5x10^12-1.8x10^13 lsun, corresponding to dust-obscured star formation rates(sfrs) of ~260-3100 msun/yr for a salpeter imf. comparison with previous scuba850{\mu}m-selected galaxy samples shows that our method is more efficient atselecting high-z dusty galaxies with a median redshift of z=3.07+/-0.83 and 10of the sources at z~&gt;4. we find that at a fixed luminosity, the dusttemperature is ~5k cooler than that expected from the td-lir relation at z&lt;1,though different temperature selection effects should be taken into account.the radio-detected subsample (excluding three strong agn) follows thefar-infrared/radio correlation at lower redshifts, and no evolution withredshift is observed out to z~5, suggesting that the far-infrared emission isstar formation dominated. the contribution of the high-z herschel 500{\mu}msources to the cosmic sfr density is comparable to that of smg populations atz~2.5 and at least 40% of the extinction-corrected uv samples at z~4(abridged).

astro-ph;0610790	chandra point-source counts in distant galaxy clusters	with the superb angular resolution of the chandra observatory, it is nowpossible to detect x-ray point sources, either embedded in galaxy clusters oralong the cluster line of sight, which could not be resolved by previousinstruments. this now allows studies of source counts in distant clusterfields. a sample of 18 distant (0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.01) galaxy clusters from thechandra archive were used to analyze the inner region of clusters of galaxiesto check for the presence of any overdensity of x-ray point sources embedded inthe gas diffuse emission. we constructed the logn-logs, in both the soft andhard energy bands, for the x-ray point sources detected in the central clusterregion (within 1 mpc)to be compared with the counts of point sources detectedin similarly deep fields without clusters. we find a ~ 2 sigma excess ofcluster region sources at the bright end of the logn-logs. the radialdistribution of the brightest x-ray point sources confirms this excess andindicates that it is confined to the inner 0.5 mpc of the cluster region. theresults suggest the possible existence of x-ray sources belonging to thecluster (most probably agn, given their 0.5-10 kev luminosity ranging from10^43 to 10^44 erg/s): on average one every three clusters. the x-ray sourceexcess found here is much smaller than the excess of radio galaxies foundrecently in high-z x-ray selected clusters, possibly due to the highersensitivity of the radio observations.

astro-ph;0612360	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field: vi. statistical  properties of clusters of galaxies	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the first 36xmm-newton pointings on the cosmos field. we reach a depth for a total clusterflux in the 0.5-2 kev band of 3x10-15 ergs cm-2 s-1, having one of the widestxmm-newton contiguous raster surveys, covering an area of 2.1 square degrees.cluster candidates are identified through a wavelet detection of extended x-rayemission. verification of the cluster candidates is done based on a galaxyconcentration analysis in redshift slices of thickness of 0.1-0.2 in redshift,using the multi-band photometric catalog of the cosmos field and restrictingthe search to z&lt;1.3 and i_ab &lt; 25. we identify 72 clusters and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray cluster scaling relations. a statisticaldescription of the survey in terms of the cumulative log(n&gt;s)-lg(s)distribution compares well with previous results, although yielding a somewhathigher number of clusters at similar fluxes. the x-ray luminosity function ofcosmos clusters matches well the results of nearby surveys, providing acomparably tight constraint on the faint end slope of alpha=1.93+/-0.04. forthe probed luminosity range of 8x10+42 - 2x10+44 ergs s-1, our survey is inagreement with and adds significantly to the existing data on the clusterluminosity function at high redshifts and implies no substantial evolution atthese luminosities to z=1.3.

astro-ph;0701196	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field ii: x-ray data and  the logn-logs	we present the data analysis and the x-ray source counts for the first seasonof xmm-newton observations in the cosmos field. the survey covers ~2 deg^2within the region of sky bounded by 9^h57.5^m&lt;r.a.&lt;10^h03.5^m;1^d27.5^m&lt;dec&lt;2^d57.5^m with a total net integration time of 504 ks. a maximumlikelihood source detection was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-4.5 kev and4.5-10 kev energy bands and 1390 point-like sources were detected in at leastone band. detailed monte carlo simulations were performed to fully test thesource detection method and to derive the sky coverage to be used in thecomputation of the logn-logs relations. the 0.5--2 kev and 2--10 kevdifferential logn-logs were fitted with a broken power-law model which revealeda euclidean slope (alpha~2.5) at the bright end and a flatter slope (alpha~1.5)at faint fluxes. in the 5--10 kev energy band a single power-law provides anacceptable fit to the observed source counts with a slope alpha~2.4. acomparison with the results of previous surveys shows good agreement in all theenergy bands under investigation in the overlapping flux range.  we also notice a remarkable agreement between our logn-logs relations and themost recent model of the xrb. the slightly different normalizations observed inthe source counts of cosmos and previous surveys can be largely explained as acombination of low counting statistics and cosmic variance introduced by thelarge scale structure.

0809.2098	photometric redshift and classification for the xmm-cosmos sources	we present photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution (sed)classifications for a sample of 1542 optically identified sources detected withxmm in the cosmos field. our template fitting classifies 46 sources as starsand 464 as non-active galaxies, while the remaining 1032 require templates withan agn contribution. high accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts wasaccomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with highsignificance detections, 2) a new set of sed templates including 18 hybridscovering the far-uv to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by thecombination of agn and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epochobservations that have been used to correct for variability (most important fortype 1 agn). the reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated usingthe sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. weachieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5). the high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (wherethe sed is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 agn and qsos out to$z=4.5$. the number of outliers is a large improvement over previousphotometric redshift estimates for x-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%outliers for i$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 and i$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5, respectively). we show thatthe intermediate band photometry is vital to achieving accurate photometricredshifts for agn, whereas the broad sed coverage provided by mid infrared(spitzer/irac) bands is important to reduce the number of outliers for normalgalaxies.

0809.2513	high redshift quasars in the cosmos survey: the space density of z&gt;3  x-ray selected qsos	we present a new measurement of the space density of high redshift(3.0&lt;z&lt;4.5), x-ray selected qsos obtained by exploiting the deep and uniformmultiwavelength coverage of the cosmos survey. we have assembled astatistically large (40 objects), x-ray selected (f_{0.5-2 kev} &gt;10^{-15} cgs),homogeneous sample of z&gt;3 qsos for which spectroscopic (22) or photometric (18)redshifts are available. we present the optical (color-color diagrams) andx-ray properties, the number counts and space densities of the z&gt;3 x-rayselected quasars population and compare our findings with previous works andmodel predictions. we find that the optical properties of x-ray selectedquasars are not significantly different from those of optically selectedsamples. there is evidence for substantial x-ray absorption (logn_h&gt;23 cm^{-2})in about 20% of the sources in the sample. the comoving space density ofluminous (l_x &gt;10^{44} erg s^-1) qsos declines exponentially (by an e--foldingper unit redshift) in the z=3.0-4.5 range, with a behavior similar to thatobserved for optically bright unobscured qsos selected in large area opticalsurveys. prospects for future, large and deep x-ray surveys are also discussed.

0810.0720	chasing highly obscured qsos in the cosmos field	(abridged) we take advantage of the deep chandra and spitzer coverage of alarge area (more than 10 times the area covered by the chandra deep fields,cdfs in the cosmos field, to extend the search of highly obscured,compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. these sources have lowsurface density and large samples can be provided only through large areasurveys, like the cosmos survey. we analyze the x-ray properties of cosmos mipssources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$jy. for the mips sources notdirectly detected in the chandra images we produce stacked images in soft andhard x-rays bands. to estimate the fraction of compton-thick agn in the mipssource population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardnessratios to those predicted by detailed monte carlo simulations including bothobscured agn and star-forming galaxies. the density of lower luminositycompton-thick agn (logl(2-10kev)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of x-ray selectedagn. the comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, compton thickagn to the x-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured agn at high andlow luminosity suggests that compton-thick agn follow a luminosity dependencesimilar to that discovered for compton-thin agn, becoming relatively rarer athigh luminosities. we estimate that the fraction of agn (unobscured, moderatelyobscured and compton thick) to the total mips source population is $49\pm10%$,a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$mfluxes. we discuss how our findings can constrain agn feedback models.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0810.4769	the spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn in the xmm-cosmos field	we study the spatial clustering of 538 x-ray selected agn in the 2 deg^2xmm-cosmos field that are spectroscopically identified to i_{ab}&lt;23 and spanthe redshift range z=0.2-3.0. the median redshift and luminosity of the sampleare z = 0.98 and l_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. a strongclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significantmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of x-ray selected agn. by fittingthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales ofr_p=0.3-40 mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6+- 0.5 mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (poissonian errors; bootstraperrors are about a factor of 2 larger). an excess signal is observed in therange r_p~5-15 mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36containing about 40 agn. when removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computingw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 mpc/h, which isconsistent with that observed for bright optical qsos at the same redshift.  we investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured agnseparately. within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence thatagn with broad optical lines (blagn) cluster differently from agn without broadoptical lines (non-blagn).  the correlation length measured for xmm-cosmos agn at z~1 is similar to thatof massive galaxies (stellar mass m_*&gt; 3 x 10^{10} m_sun) at the same redshift.this suggests that agn at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, asobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) universe.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
