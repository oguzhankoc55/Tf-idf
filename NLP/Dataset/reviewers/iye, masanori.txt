0906.1062	spectropolarimetry of the unique type ib supernova 2005bf: larger  asymmetry revealed by later-phase data	we present an optical spectropolarimetric observation of the unique type ibsupernova (sn) 2005bf at 8 days after the second maximum. the data, combinedwith the polarization spectrum taken at 6 days before the second maximum (maundet al. 2007a), enable us to closely examine the intrinsic properties of the sn.the polarization percentage is smaller at the later epoch over a widewavelength range, while the position angle is similar at the two epochs. wefind that an assumption of complete depolarization of strong lines at theemission peak is not necessarily correct. the intrinsic polarization of the snis larger, and thus, the ejecta of sn 2005bf would be more asymmetric thanpreviously expected. the axis ratio of the photosphere projected on the skydeviates from unity by at least 20 %. if the position angle of interstellarpolarization is aligned with the spiral arm of the host galaxy, the deviationis larger than 25 %. the line polarization at the he i, ca ii and fe ii linesis also smaller at the later epoch. the changes in the position angle acrossthese lines, which were observed at the earlier epoch, are still marginallypresent at the later epoch. the similar polarimetric behavior suggests that thedistributions of these ions are correlated. properties of polarization, as wellas the light curve and the spectra both at photospheric and nebular phases, canbe explained by an aspherical, possibly unipolar explosion of a wn star inwhich the blob of 56ni penetrates c+o core and stops within the he layer.

0908.2057	spectropolarimetry of extremely luminous type ia supernova 2009dc:  nearly spherical explosion of super-chandrasekhar mass white dwarf	we present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a candidate ofsuper-chandrasekhar mass type ia supernova (sn): sn 2009dc. the observationswere performed at 5.6 and 89.5 days after the b-band maximum. the data taken atthe later epoch are used to determine the interstellar polarization. continuumpolarization is found to be small (&lt;0.3 %), indicating that the explosion isnearly spherically symmetric. this fact suggests that a very asphericalexplosion is not a likely scenario for sn 2009dc. polarization at the si ii andca ii lines clearly shows a loop in the q-u plane, indicating anon-axisymmetric, clumpy distribution of intermediate-mass elements. the degreeof line polarization at the si and ca line is moderate (0.5% +- 0.1% and 0.7%+- 0.1%, respectively), but it is higher than expected from the trend of othertype ia sne. this may suggest that there are thick enough, clumpy si-richlayers above the thick 56ni-rich layers (&gt;~ 1.2 msun). the observedspectropolarimetric properties, combined with the photometric and spectroscopicproperties, suggest that the progenitor of sn 2009dc has a super-chandrasekharmass, and that the explosion geometry is globally spherically symmetric, withclumpy distribution of intermediate-mass elements.

0707.1050	morphologies and color gradients of luminous evolved galaxies at z~1.5	we have examined in detail the morphologies of seven z~1.5 passively evolvingluminous red galaxies using high resolution hst nicmos and acs imaging data.almost all of these galaxies appear to be relaxed systems, with smoothmorphologies at both rest-frame uv and visible wavelengths. previous resultsfrom spectral synthesis modeling favor a single burst of star formation morethan 1 gyr before the observed epoch. the prevalence of old stellarpopulations, however, does not correlate exclusively with early-typemorphologies as it does in the local universe; the light profiles for some ofthese galaxies appear to be dominated by massive exponential disks. thisevidence for massive old disks, along with the apparent uniformity of stellarage across the disk, suggests formation by a mechanism better described as aform of monolithic collapse than as a hierarchical merger. these galaxies couldnot have undergone a single major merging event since the bulk of their starswere formed, more than 1 gyr earlier. there is at least one case, however, thatappears to be undergoing a "dry merger", which may be an example of the processthat converts these unusual galaxies into the familiar spheroids that dominategalaxies comprising old stellar populations at the present epoch.

0707.1561	the reionization and galaxy evolution probed by z=7 lyman alpha emitters	we made a narrowband nb973 (bandwidth of 200a at 9755a) imaging of the subarudeep field (sdf) and found two z=7 lyman alpha emitter (lae) candidates down tonb973=24.9. carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy, we identified one of themas a real z=6.96 lae. this has shown that galaxy formation was in progress just750 myr after the big bang. meanwhile, the lyman alpha line luminosity functionof lae is known to decline from z=5.7 to 6.6 in the sdf. l* at z=6.6 is 40-60%of that at z=5.7. we also confirm that the number density of z=7 lae is only17% of the density at z=6.6 comparing the latest sdf lae samples. this seriesof significant decreases in lae density with increasing redshift can be theresult of galaxy evolution during these epochs. however, using the uv continuumluminosity functions of laes, those of lyman break galaxies, and a laeevolution model based on the hierarchical clustering, we find that galaxyevolution alone cannot explain all the decrease in density. this extra densitydeficit can be interpreted as the attenuation of the lyman alpha photons fromlaes due to a rapid evolution of neutral hydrogen fraction during the ongoingcosmic reionization at z~6.6-7.

0707.3161	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). iv. evolution of lya emitters  from z=3.1 to 5.7 in the 1 deg^2 field: luminosity functions and agn	we present luminosity functions (lfs) and various properties of lya emitters(laes) at z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7, in a 1 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey (sxds) field. we obtain a photometric sample of 858 lae candidates basedon deep subaru/suprime-cam imaging data, and a spectroscopic sample of 84confirmed laes from subaru/focas and vlt/vimos spectroscopy in a survey volumeof ~10^6 mpc^3 with a limiting lya luminosity of ~3x10^42 erg/s. we derive thelfs of lya and uv-continuum (~1500 \aa) for each redshift, taking into accountthe statistical error and the field-to-field variation. we find that theapparent lya lf shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 withinfactors of 1.8 and 2.7 in l* and phi*, respectively. on the other hand, the uvlf of laes increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with lyaemission are more common at earlier epochs. we identify six laes with agnactivities from our spectra combined with vla, spitzer, and xmm-newton data.among the photometrically selected laes at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show agnactivities, while the brightest laes with logl(lya) &gt;~ 43.4-43.6 erg/s appearto always host agns. our laes are bluer in uv-continuum color than dropoutgalaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. ourstacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and thef(heii)/f(lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation(+low-luminosity agn) and the primordial population in laes.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1008.4837	spitzer space telescope constraint on the stellar mass of a z = 6.96  lyman alpha emitter	we obtained mid-infrared 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging of a z=6.96 lyman alphaemitter (lae) iok-1 discovered in the subaru deep field, using spitzer spacetelescope infrared array camera observations. after removal of a nearby brightsource, we find that iok-1 is not significantly detected in any of theseinfrared bands to m_3.6 ~ 24.00 and m_4.5 ~ 23.54 at 3 sigma. fittingpopulation synthesis models to the spectral energy distribution consisting ofthe upper limit fluxes of the optical to infrared non-detection images andfluxes in detection images, we constrain the stellar mass m* of iok-1. this laecould have either a mass as low as m* &lt;~ 2-9 x 10^8 msun for the young age (&lt;~10 myr) and the low dust reddening (a_v ~ 0) or a mass as large as m* &lt;~ 1-4 x10^{10} msun for either the old age (&gt; 100 myr) or the high dust reddening (a_v~ 1.5). this would be within the range of masses of z ~ 3-6.6 laes studied todate, ~ 10^6-10^{10} msun. hence, iok-1 is not a particularly unique galaxywith extremely high mass or low mass but is similar to one of the laes seen atthe later epochs.

1008.4842	lyman alpha emitters at z=7 in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field:  photometric candidates and luminosity function	we conducted a deep narrowband nb973 (fwhm = 200 a centered at 9755 a) surveyof z=7 lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field,using the fully depleted ccds newly installed on the subaru telescopesuprime-cam, which is twice more sensitive to z=7 lyman alpha at ~ 1 micronthan the previous ccds. reaching the depth 0.5 magnitude deeper than ourprevious survey in the subaru deep field that led to the discovery of a z=6.96lae, we detected three probable z=7 lae candidates. even if all the candidatesare real, the lyman alpha luminosity function (lf) at z=7 shows a significantdeficit from the lf at z=5.7 determined by previous surveys. the lae number andlyman alpha luminosity densities at z=7 is ~ 7.7-54% and ~5.5-39% of those atz=5.7 to the lyman alpha line luminosity limit of l(ly-alpha) &gt;~ 9.2 x 10^{42}erg s^{-1}. this could be due to evolution of the lae population at theseepochs as a recent galaxy evolution model predicts that the lae modestlyevolves from z=5.7 to 7. however, even after correcting for this effect ofgalaxy evolution on the decrease in lae number density, the z=7 lyman alpha lfstill shows a deficit from z=5.7 lf. this might reflect the attenuation oflyman alpha emission by neutral hydrogen remaining at the epoch of reionizationand suggests that reionization of the universe might not be complete yet atz=7. if we attribute the density deficit to reionization, the intergalacticmedium (igm) transmission for lyman alpha photons at z=7 would be 0.4 &lt;=t_{ly-alpha}^{igm} &lt;= 1, supporting the possible higher neutral fraction at theearlier epochs at z &gt; 6 suggested by the previous surveys of z=5.7-7 laes, z ~6 quasars and z &gt; 6 gamma-ray bursts.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1112.3997	the first systematic survey for lyman alpha emitters at z=7.3 with  red-sensitive subaru/suprime-cam	we have performed deep imaging surveys for lya emitters (laes) at redshift~7.3 in two blank fields, the subaru deep field (sdf) and the subaru/xmm-newtondeep survey field (sxdf), using the subaru/suprime-cam equipped with newred-sensitive ccds and a new narrow-band filter, nb1006 (lambda_c=10052 ang,fwhm=214 ang). we identified four objects as lae candidates that exhibitluminosity excess in nb1006. by carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy forthree of them using subaru/focas and keck/deimos, a definitively asymmetricemission line is detected for one of them, sxdf-nb1006-2. assuming this line islya, this object is a lae at z=7.215 which has luminosity of 1.2^{+1.5}_{-0.6}x 10^43 [erg s-1] and a weighted skewness s_w=4.90+-0.86. another object,sdf-nb1006-2, shows variable photometry and is thus probably a quasar (qso) oran active galactic nucleus (agn). it shows an asymmetric emission line at 10076ang, which may be due to either lya at z=7.288 or [oii] at z=1.703. the thirdobject, sdf-nb1006-1, is likely a galaxy with temporal luminosity enhancementassociated with a supernova explosion, as the brightness of this object variesbetween the observed epochs. its spectrum does not show any emission lines. theinferred decrease in the number density of laes toward higher redshift isn_lya(z=7.3)/n_lya(z=5.7) = 0.05^+0.11_-0.05 from z=5.7 to 7.3 down tol(lya)=1.0 x 10^43 [erg s-1]. the present result is consistent with theinterpretation in previous studies that the neutral hydrogen fraction israpidly increasing from z=5.7 to 7.3.

1202.0278	dust attenuation and h-alpha star formation rates of z~0.5 galaxies	using deep narrow-band and broad-band imaging, we identify 401 z~0.40 and 249z~0.49 h-alpha line-emitting galaxies in the subaru deep field. compared toother h-alpha surveys at similar redshifts, our samples are unique since theyprobe lower h-alpha luminosities, are augmented with multi-wavelength(rest-frame 1000aa--1.5 microns) coverage, and a large fraction (20%) of oursamples has already been spectroscopically confirmed. our spectra allow us tomeasure the balmer decrement for nearly 60 galaxies with h-beta detected above5-sigma. the balmer decrements indicate an average extinction ofa(h-alpha)=0.7^{+1.4}_{-0.7} mag. we find that the balmer decrementsystematically increases with higher h-alpha luminosities and with largerstellar masses, in agreement with previous studies with sparser samples. wefind that the sfrs estimated from modeling the spectral energy distribution(sed) is reliable---we derived an "intrinsic" h-alpha luminosity which is thenreddened assuming the color excess from sed modeling. the sed-predicted h-alphaluminosity agrees with h-alpha narrow-band measurements over 3 dex (rms of 0.25dex). we then use the sed sfrs to test different statistically-based dustcorrections for h-alpha and find that adopting one magnitude of extinction isinappropriate: galaxies with lower luminosities are less reddened. we find thatthe luminosity-dependent dust correction of hopkins et al. yields consistentresults over 3 dex (rms of 0.3 dex). our comparisons are only possible byassuming that stellar reddening is roughly half of nebular reddening. thestrong correspondence argue that with sed modeling, we can derive reliableintrinsic sfrs even in the absence of h-alpha measurements at z~0.5.

1202.6082	suppresion of self-phase modulation in a laser transfer system using  optical fiber on the subaru telescope	we are developing the laser guide star adaptive optics (lgs/ao188) system forthe subaru telescope at mauna kea, hawaii. this system utilizes a combinationof an all-solid-state mode-locked sum-frequency generation (sfg) laser (1.7-ghzbandwidth, 0.7-ns pulse width) as a light source and a single-mode opticalfiber for beam transference. however, optical fibers induce nonlinear effects,especially self-phase modulation (spm). we studied spm in our photonic crystalfiber (pcf). spm broadens the spectrum of a laser beam and decrease theefficiency of bright laser guide star generation. we measured the spectrumwidth using a spectrum analyzer. we found a spectrum width of 8.4 ghz at fullwidth at half maximum (fwhm). the original fwhm of our laser spectrum was 1.4ghz. this was equivalent to a 70 % loss in laser energy. we also measured thebrightness of the sodium cell and evaluated its performance as a function oflaser wavelength. the cell's brightness showed a peculiar tendency;specifically, it did not extinguish even though the wavelength varied by morethan 5 pm. to reduce the impact of spm, we developed an optical system thatdivides one laser pulse into four lower-power pulses. the laser peak powerafter passing through the new optical system was decreased to one-fourth theoriginal, reducing the impact of spm on the sodium cell. an actual laser guidestar created with the new system was 0.41 mag brighter than the laser guidestar created with the original system. we achieved brighter laser guide stargeneration by dividing a laser pulse to reduce its peak intensity. this is aneffective method for laser relay using optical fiber.

1204.1165	a large scale structure traced by [oii] emitters hosting a distant  cluster at z=1.62	we present a panoramic narrow-band imaging survey of [oii] emitters in andaround the clg j0218.3-0510 cluster at z=1.62 with suprime-cam on subarutelescope. 352 [oii] emitters were identified on the basis of narrow-bandexcesses and photometric redshifts. we discovered a huge filamentary structurewith some clumps traced by [oii] emitters and found that the clg j0218.3-0510cluster is embedded in an even larger super-structure than the one reportedpreviously. 31 [oii] emitters were spectroscopically confirmed with thedetection of h-alpha and/or [oiii] emission lines by fmos observations. in thehigh density regions such as cluster core and clumps, star-forming [oii]emitters show a high overdensity by a factor of more than 10 compared to thefield region. although the star formation activity is very high even in thecluster core, some massive quiescent galaxies also exits at the same time.furthermore, the properties of the individual [oii] emitters, such as starformation rates, stellar masses and specific star formation rates, do not showa significant dependence on the local density, either. such lack ofenvironmental dependence is consistent with our earlier result by hayashi etal. (2011) on a z=1.5 cluster and its surrounding region. the fact that thestar-forming activity of galaxies in the cluster core is as high as that in thefield at z~1.6 may suggest that the star-forming galaxies are probably just ina transition phase from a starburst mode to a quiescent mode, and are thusshowing comparable level of star formation rates to those in lower densityenvironments. we may be witnessing the start of the reversal of the localsfr--density relation due to the "biased" galaxy formation and evolution inhigh density regions at high this redshift, beyond which massive galaxies wouldbe forming vigorously in a more biased way in proto-cluster cores.

1204.3233	subaru focas survey of z=7-7.1 ly{\alpha} emitters: a test for z &gt;~ 7  ly{\alpha} photometric luminosity functions	recent observations of z &gt;~ 7 ly{\alpha} emitters (laes) have derived avariety of ly{\alpha} luminosity functions (lfs) with contradictory results,evolution or non-evolution from z &lt;~ 6, the epoch after reionization. thiscould be because most of z &gt;~ 7 lfs comprise photometric candidates and mightinclude some contaminations. we conducted the subaru telescope faint objectcamera and spectrograph narrowband nb980 ({\lambda}c ~ 9800a, fwhm ~ 100a)imaging and spectroscopy survey of z=7-7.1 laes to compare its"contamination-free" result with z &gt;~ 7 photometric ly{\alpha} lfs previouslyderived. we imaged the subaru deep field and the sky around a cluster ms1520.1+3002 and found one lae candidate, but spectroscopy did not reveally{\alpha} though deep enough to detect it. we calculated the expected numberof laes in our survey, using five z=7 and three z=7.7 ly{\alpha} lfs fromrecent surveys. seven of them are consistent with null detection(0.1^{+1.8}_{-0.1}-1.1^{+2.2}_{-1.0} laes) within errors including poissonstatistics and cosmic variance, but average values (0.7-1.1 laes) predictedfrom one z=7 and two z=7.7 lfs among the seven indicate nearly a singledetection. the remaining one z=7 lf predicts 3.0^{+3.2}_{-2.0} laes. as to z=7,the discrepancy likely comes from different lae selection criteria. for z=7.7,there are two possibilities; (1) if z=7.7 laes are somehow brighter inly{\alpha} luminosity than lower redshift laes, z=7.7 lf is observed to besimilar to or higher than lower redshift lfs even if attenuated by neutralhydrogen. (2) all/most of the z=7.7 candidates are not laes. this supports thedecline of lf from z ~ 6 to 7.7 and reionization at z ~ 6-7.7.

1206.2011	the quasar-galaxy cross sdss j1320+1644: a probable large-separation  lensed quasar	we report the discovery of a pair of quasars at $z=1.487$, with a separationof $8\farcs585\pm0\farcs002$. subaru telescope infrared imaging reveals thepresence of an elliptical and a disk-like galaxy located almost symmetricallybetween the quasars, creating a cross-like configuration. based on absorptionlines in the quasar spectra and the colors of the galaxies, we estimate thatboth galaxies are located at redshift $z=0.899$. this, as well as thesimilarity of the quasar spectra, suggests that the system is a single quasarmultiply imaged by a galaxy group or cluster acting as a gravitational lens,although the possibility of a binary quasar cannot be fully excluded. we showthat the gravitational lensing hypothesis implies these galaxies are notisolated, but must be embedded in a dark matter halo of virial mass $\sim 4\times 10^{14}\ h_{70}^{-1}\ {m}_\odot$ assuming an nfw model with aconcentration parameter of $c_{vir}=6$, or a singular isothermal sphere profilewith a velocity dispersion of $\sim 670$ km s$^{-1}$. we place constraints onthe location of the dark matter halo, as well as the velocity dispersions ofthe galaxies. in addition, we discuss the influence of differential reddening,microlensing and intrinsic variability on the quasar spectra and broadbandphotometry.

1206.2619	a spectroscopic survey of andromeda's western shelf	the andromeda galaxy (m31) shows many tidal features in its halo, includingthe giant southern stream (gss) and a sharp ledge in surface density on itswestern side (the w shelf). using deimos on the keck telescope, we obtainradial velocities of m31's giant stars along its nw minor axis, in a radialrange covering the w shelf and extending beyond its edge. in the space ofvelocity versus radius, the sample shows the wedge pattern expected from aradial shell, which is detected clearly here for the first time. this confirmspredictions from an earlier model of formation of the gss, which proposed thatthe w shelf is a shell from the third orbital wrap of the same tidal debrisstream that produces the gss, with the main body of the progenitor lying in thesecond wrap. we calculate the distortions in the shelf wedge pattern expectedfrom its outward expansion and angular momentum, and show that these effectsare echoed in the data. in addition, a hot, relatively smooth spheroidpopulation is clearly present. we construct a bulge-disk-halo n-body model thatagrees with surface brightness and kinematic constraints, and combine it with asimulation of the gss. from the contrasting kinematic signatures of the hotspheroid and shelf components, we decompose the observed stellar metallicitydistribution into contributions from each component using a non-parametricmixture model. the shelf component's metallicity distribution matches previousobservations of the gss superbly, further strengthening the evidence they areconnected and bolstering the case for a massive progenitor of this stream.

1210.4933	a ly-alpha emitter with an extremely large rest-frame equivalent width  of ~900a at z=6.5: a candidate of population iii-dominated galaxy?	we have identified a very interesting ly-alpha emitter, whose ly-alphaemission line has an extremely large observed equivalent width ofew_0=436^{+422}_{-149}a, which corresponds to an extraordinarily largeintrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0^{int}=872^{+844}_{-298}a afterthe average intergalactic absorption correction. the object wasspectroscopically confirmed to be a real ly-alpha emitter by its apparentasymmetric ly-alpha line profile detected at z=6.538. the continuum emission ofthe object was definitely detected in our deep z'-band image; thus, its ew_0was reliably determined. follow-up deep near-infrared spectroscopy revealedemission lines of neither he ii lambda1640 as an apparent signature ofpopulation iii, nor c iv lambda1549 as a proof of active nucleus. no detectionof short-lived he ii lambda1640 line is not necessarily inconsistent with theinterpretation that the underlying stellar population of the object isdominated by population iii. we found that the observed extremely large ew_0 ofthe ly-alpha emission and the upper limit on the ew_0 of the he ii lambda1640emission can be explained by population synthesis models favoring a very youngage less than 2-4myr and massive metal-poor (z&lt;10^{-5}) or even metal-freestars. the observed large ew_0 of ly-alpha is hardly explained by populationi/ii synthesis models with z&gt;10^{-3}. however, we cannot conclusively rule outthe possibility that this object is composed of a normal stellar populationwith a clumpy dust distribution, which could enhance the ly-alpha ew_0, thoughits significance is still unclear.

1302.5705	mapping h-band scattered light emission in the mysterious sr21  transitional disk	we present the first near infrared (nir) spatially resolved images of thecircumstellar transitional disk around sr21. these images were obtained withthe subaru hiciao camera, adaptive optics and the polarized differentialimaging (pdi) technique. we resolve the disk in scattered light at h-band forstellocentric 0.1"&lt;r&lt;0.6" (12&lt;r&lt;75au). we compare our results with previouslypublished spatially-resolved 880 micron continuum submillimeter array (sma)images that show an inner r&lt;36au cavity in sr21. radiative transfer modelsreveal that the large disk depletion factor invoked to explain sr21's sub-mmcavity cannot be "universal" for all grain sizes. even significantly moremoderate depletions (delta=0.1, 0.01 relative to an undepleted disk) than thosethat reproduce the sub-mm cavity (delta~10^-6) are inconsistent with our h-bandimages when they are assumed to carry over to small grains, suggesting thatsurface grains scattering in the nir either survive or are generated bywhatever mechanism is clearing the disk midplane. in fact, the radial polarizedintensity profile of our h-band observations is smooth and steeplyinwardly-increasing (r^-3), with no evidence of a break at the 36au sub-mmcavity wall. we hypothesize that this profile is dominated by an optically thindisk envelope or atmosphere component. we also discuss the compatibility of ourdata with the previously postulated existence of a sub-stellar companion tosr21 at r~10-20au, and find that we can neither exclude nor verify thisscenario. this study demonstrates the power of multiwavelength imaging oftransitional disks to inform modeling efforts, including the debate overprecisely what physical mechanism is responsible for clearing these disks oftheir large midplane grains.

1306.0581	the seeds direct imaging survey for planets and scattered dust emission  in debris disk systems	debris disks around young main-sequence stars often have gaps and cavitieswhich for a long time have been interpreted as possibly being caused byplanets. in recent years, several giant planet discoveries have been made insystems hosting disks of precisely this nature, further implying thatinteractions with planets could be a common cause of such disk structures. aspart of the seeds high-contrast imaging survey, we are surveying a populationof debris disk-hosting stars with gaps and cavities implied by their spectralenergy distributions, in order to attempt to spatially resolve the disk as wellas to detect any planets that may be responsible for the disk structure. herewe report on intermediate results from this survey. five debris disks have beenspatially resolved, and a number of faint point sources have been discovered,most of which have been tested for common proper motion, which in each case hasexcluded physical companionship with the target stars. from the detectionlimits of the 50 targets that have been observed, we find that beta pic b-likeplanets (~10 mjup planets around g--a-type stars) near the gap edges are lessfrequent than 15--30%, implying that if giant planets are the dominant cause ofthese wide (27 au on average) gaps, they are generally less massive than betapic b.

1306.1887	high-contrast near-infrared imaging polarimetry of the protoplanetary  disk around ry tau	we present near-infrared coronagraphic imaging polarimetry of ry tau. thescattered light in the circumstellar environment was imaged at h-band at a highresolution (~0".05) for the first time, using subaru-hiciao. the observedpolarized intensity (pi) distribution shows a butterfly-like distribution ofbright emission with an angular scale similar to the disk observed atmillimeter wavelengths. this distribution is offset toward the blueshifted jet,indicating the presence of a geometrically thick disk or a remnant envelope,and therefore the earliest stage of the class ii evolutionary phase. we performcomparisons between the observed pi distribution and disk models with: (1) fullradiative transfer code, using the spectral energy distribution (sed) toconstrain the disk parameters; and (2) monochromatic simulations of scatteredlight which explore a wide range of parameters space to constrain the disk anddust parameters. we show that these models cannot consistently explain theobserved pi distribution, sed, and the viewing angle inferred by millimeterinterferometry. we suggest that the scattered light in the near-infrared isassociated with an optically thin and geometrically thick layer above the disksurface, with the surface responsible for the infrared sed. half of thescattered light and thermal radiation in this layer illuminates the disksurface, and this process may significantly affect the thermal structure of thedisk.

1309.2559	a discovery of a candidate companion to a transiting system koi-94: a  direct imaging study for a possibility of a false positive	we report a discovery of a companion candidate around one of {\it kepler}objects of interest (kois), koi-94, and results of our quantitativeinvestigation of the possibility that planetary candidates around koi-94 arefalse positives. koi-94 has a planetary system in which four planetarydetections have been reported by {\it kepler}, suggesting that this system isintriguing to study the dynamical evolutions of planets. however, while two ofthose detections (koi-94.01 and 03) have been made robust by previousobservations, the others (koi-94.02 and 04) are marginal detections, for whichfuture confirmations with various techniques are required. we have conductedhigh-contrast direct imaging observations with subaru/hiciao in $h$ band anddetected a faint object located at a separation of $\sim0.6''$ from koi-94. theobject has a contrast of $\sim 1\times 10^{-3}$ in $h$ band, and corresponds toan m type star on the assumption that the object is at the same distance ofkoi-94. based on our analysis, koi-94.02 is likely to be a real planet becauseof its transit depth, while koi-94.04 can be a false positive due to thecompanion candidate. the success in detecting the companion candidate suggeststhat high-contrast direct imaging observations are important keys to examinefalse positives of kois. on the other hand, our transit light curve reanalyseslead to a better period estimate of koi-94.04 than that on the koi catalogueand show that the planetary candidate has the same limb darkening parametervalue as the other planetary candidates in the koi-94 system, suggesting thatkoi-94.04 is also a real planet in the system.

1404.6066	accelerated evolution of ly$\alpha$ luminosity function at $\textit{z}  \gtrsim 7$ revealed by the subaru ultra-deep survey for ly$\alpha$ emitters  at $\textit{z}=7.3$	we present the ultra-deep subaru narrowband imaging survey for lya emitters(laes) at $z=7.3$ in sxds and cosmos fields with a total integration time of106 hours. exploiting our new sharp bandwidth filter, nb101, installed onsuprime-cam, we have reached $l(lya)=2.4\times10^{42} \ erg \ s^{-1}$($5\sigma$) for $z=7.3$ laes, about 4 times deeper than previous subaru $z\gtrsim 7$ studies, which allows us to reliably investigate evolution of lyaluminosity function (lf), for the first time, down to the luminosity limit sameas those of subaru $z=3.1-6.6$ lae samples. surprisingly, we only find threeand four laes in sxds and cosmos fields, respectively, while one expects atotal of $\sim 65$ laes by our survey in the case of no lya lf evolution from$z=6.6$ to $7.3$.we identify a decrease of lya lf from $z=6.6$ to $7.3$ at the$&gt;90\%$ confidence level from our $z=7.3$ lya lf.moreover, the evolution of lyalf is clearly accelerated at $z&gt;6.6$ beyond the measurement uncertaintiesincluding cosmic variance. because no such accelerated evolution ofuv-continuum lf or cosmic star-formation rate (sfr) is found at $z\sim 7$, butsuggested only at $z&gt;8$ (oesch et al. 2013, bouwens et al. 2014), thisaccelerated lya lf evolution is explained by physical mechanisms different froma pure sfr decrease but related to lya production and escape in the process ofcosmic reionization. because a simple accelerating increase of igm neutralhydrogen absorbing lya would not reconcile with thomson scattering opticaldepth measurements from wmap and planck, our findings may support new physicalpictures suggested by recent theoretical studies, such as the existence of hiclumpy clouds within cosmic ionized bubbles selectively absorbing lya and thelarge ionizing photon escape fraction of galaxies making weak lya emission.

1409.8386	indications of m-dwarf deficits in the halo and thick disk of the galaxy	we compared the number of faint stars detected in deep survey fields with thecurrent stellar distribution model of the galaxy and found that the detectednumber in the h band is significantly smaller than the predicted number. thisindicates that m-dwarfs, the major component, are fewer in the halo and thethick disk. we used archived data of several surveys in both the north andsouth field of goods (great observatories origins deep survey), mods ingoods-n, and ers and candels in goods-s. the number density of m-dwarfs in thehalo has to be 20+/-13% relative to that in the solar vicinity, in order forthe detected number of stars fainter than 20.5 mag in the h band to match withthe predicted value from the model. in the thick disk, the number density ofm-dwarfs must be reduced (52+/-13%) or the scale height must be decreased (~600pc). alternatively, overall fractions of the halo and thick disks can besignificantly reduced to achieve the same effect, because our sample mainlyconsists of faint m-dwarfs. our results imply that the m-dwarf population inregions distant from the galactic plane is significantly smaller thanpreviously thought. we then discussed the implications this has on thesuitability of the model predictions for the prediction of non-companion faintstars in direct imaging extrasolar planet surveys by using the best-fit numberdensities.

astro-ph;0001451	superwind-driven intense h_2 emission in ngc 6240	we have performed a long-slit k band spectroscopic observation of theluminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240. the peak position of the h_2 v=1-0 s(1)emission in the slit is located ~0.3" - 0.4" north of the southern nucleus. itis almost the midpoint between the southern nucleus and the peak position ofthe ^12co j=1-0 emission. based on the line-ratio analyses, we suggest theexcitation mechanism of h_2 is pure thermal at most positions. in the southernregion we find the following three velocity components in the h_2 emission: theblueshifted shell component (~-250 km s^-1 with respect to v_sys) which isrecognized as a distinct c-shape distortion in the velocity field around thesouthern nucleus, the high-velocity blueshifted ``wing'' component (~-1000 kms^-1 with respect to v_sys), and the component indicating possible linesplitting of ~500 km s^-1. the latter two components are extended to the southfrom the southern nucleus. we show that the kinematic properties of these threecomponents can be reproduced by expanding motion of a shell-like structurearound the southern nucleus. the offset peak position of the h_2 emission canbe understood if we assume that the shell expanding to the north interacts withthe extragalactic molecular gas. at the interface between the shell and themolecular gas concentration the cloud-crushing mechanism proposed by cowie etal.

astro-ph;0002343	subaru observations for the k-band luminosity distribution of galaxies  in clusters near to 3c 324 at z$\sim$1.2	we investigate the $k$-band luminosity distribution of galaxies in the regionof clusters at $z\sim1.2$ near to the radio galaxy 3c 324. the imaging datawere obtained during the commissioning period of the subaru telescope. there isa significant excess of the surface number density of the galaxies with $k =$17--20 mag in the region within $\sim$ 40'' from 3c 324. at this bright end,the measured luminosity distribution shows a drop, which can be represented bythe exponential cut off of the schechter-function formula; the best-fittedvalue of the characteristic magnitude, $k^{*}$, is $\sim 18.4\pm0.8$. thismeasurement follows the evolutionary trend of the $k^*$ of the rich clustersobserved at an intermediate redshift, which is consistent with passiveevolution models with a formation redshift $z_f \gtsim 2$. at $k \gtsim 20$mag, however, the excess of the galaxy surface density in the region of theclusters decreases abruptly, which may imply that the luminosity function ofthe cluster galaxies has a negative slope at the faint end. this may implystrong luminosity segregation between the inner and outer parts of theclusters, or some deficit of faint galaxies in the cluster central region ofthe cluster.

astro-ph;0002344	color-magnitude sequence in the clusters at z$\sim$1.2 near the radio  galaxy 3c 324	we have investigated the optical and near-infrared colors of k'-selectedgalaxies in clusters at z ~ 1.2 near to the radio galaxy 3c 324 using imagesobtained with the subaru telescope and archival hst data. the distribution ofcolors of the galaxies in the cluster region is found to be fairly broad, andit may imply significant scatter in their star-formation histories, althoughthe effect of contamination of field galaxies is uncertain. the red sequence ofgalaxies whose r-k colors are consistent with passive evolution models for oldgalaxies is found to be truncated at k' ~ 20 mag, and there are few faintergalaxies with similar red colors in the cluster region. we find that thebulge-dominated galaxies selected by quantitative morphological classificationform a broad sequence in the color-magnitude diagram, whose slope is muchsteeper than that expected from metallicity variations within a passivelyevolving coeval galaxy population. we argue that the observed color-magnitudesequence can be explained by metallicity and age variations, and the faintergalaxies with k' &gt; 20 mag may be 1-2 gyr younger than the brighter galaxies.some spatial segregation of the color and k'-band luminosity is seen in the skydistribution; the redder and the brighter objects tend to be located near 3c324.

astro-ph;0002390	high-resolution near-infrared imaging of the powerful radio galaxy 3c  324 at z = 1.21 with the subaru telescope	we have obtained high-resolution k'-band images of the powerful z=1.206 radiogalaxy 3c 324 with the subaru telescope under seeing conditions of 0.3--0.4arcsec. we clearly resolved the galaxy and directly compared it to the opticalimages obtained with the hubble space telescope. the host galaxy of 3c 324 isrevealed to be a moderately luminous elliptical galaxy with a smooth lightprofile. the effective radius of the galaxy, as determined by profile fitting,is 1.3+-0.1 arcsec (1.2 kpc), which is significantly smaller than the value of2.2 arcsec, published in best et al. (1998, mnras, 292, 758). the peak of thek'-band light coincides with the position of the radio core, which implies thatthe powerful agn lies at the nucleus of the host galaxy. the peak alsocoincides with the gap in the optical knotty structures which may be a dustlane hiding the uv-optical emission of the agn from our line of sight; it isvery likely that we are seeing the obscuring structure almost edge-on. weclearly detected the `aligned component' in the k'-band image by subtracting amodel elliptical galaxy from the observed image. the red r_f702w-k color of theouter region of the galaxy avoiding the aligned component indicates that thenear infrared light of the host galaxy is dominated by an old stellarpopulation.

astro-ph;0110473	discovery of very extended emission-line region around the seyfert 2  galaxy ngc 4388	we found a very large, 35 kpc, emission-line region around the seyfert type 2galaxy ngc 4388, using deep narrow-band imaging with the prime focus camera(suprime-cam) of the subaru telescope. this region consists of many faint gasclouds or filaments, and extends northeastwards from the galaxy. the typicalh-alpha luminosity l(h-alpha) of the clouds is 10^37 erg s^-1, and the totall(h-alpha) of the region within 10 kpc from the nucleus is 2 x 10^38 erg s^-1,which corresponds to an ionized gas mass of 10^5 m_solar. the map of theemission-line intensity ratio i([oiii])/i(h-alpha) indicates that the inner (r&lt; 12 kpc) region of the veelr may be excited by nuclear ionizing radiation. theexcitation mechanism of the outer (r &gt; 12 kpc) region is unclear, but it islikely that the nuclear radiation is also a dominant source of its ionization.we discuss the origin of the ionized gas. two plausible origins of the gas inthe veelr are (i) the tidal debris resulting from a past interaction with agas-rich dwarf galaxy, i.e., a minor merger, or (ii) the interstellar medium ofngc 4388, stripped by the ram pressure of the hot intracluster medium of thevirgo cluster.

astro-ph;0206019	chemo-dynamical evolution of globular cluster systems	we studied the relation between the ratio of rotational velocity to velocitydispersion and the metallicity (&lt;v_{rot}&gt;/\sigma_{v}-metallicity relation) ofglobular cluster systems (gcs) of disk galaxies by comparing the relationpredicted from simple chemo-dynamical models for the formation and evolution ofdisk galaxies with the observed kinematical and chemical properties of theirgcss. we conclude that proto disk galaxies underwent a slow initial collapsethat was followed by a rapid contraction and derive that the ratio of theinitial collapse time scale to the active star formation time scale is \sim 6for our galaxy and \sim 15 for m31. the fundamental formation process of diskgalaxies was simulated based on simple chemo-dynamical models assuming theconservation of their angular momentum. we suggest that there is a typicaluniversal pattern in the &lt;v_{rot}&gt;/\sigma_{v}-metallicity relation of the gcsof disk galaxies. this picture is supported by the observed properties of gcssin the galaxy and in m31. this relation would deviate from the universalpattern, however, if large-scale merging events took major role inchemo-dynamical evolution of galaxies and will reflect the epoch of suchmerging events. we discuss the properties of the gcs of m81 and suggest thepresence of past major merging event.

astro-ph;0209092	ero r1 in cl0939+4713 field - evidence for an s0-like galaxy at z \sim  1.5	we present further observations of the extremely red object eroj094258+4659.2, identified by \citet{iye00} as ero r1 in their deep images ofthe cluster a851. we estimate its redshift independently by eight-bandphotometric redshift determination and cross-correlation of a new h-bandspectrum with the optical spectra of local e/s0 galaxies, and conclude that itlies at $z \sim 1.5$. although its colors are consistent both with anelliptical galaxy and an s0 galaxy at that redshift, its elongated shape andexponential luminosity profile suggest the presence of an evolved stellar diskcomponent. we rule out the possibility that these properties are stronglyinfluenced by gravitational lensing by the foreground cluster, and thereforeconclude that this object is more likely to be an s0-like galaxy, rather than alensed elliptical. the h-band spectrum does not show strong h$\alpha$ emissionand the star formation rate therefore appears to be very modest. the presenceof such a galaxy with an apparently relaxed disk of stars at this high redshiftprovides a new and strong constraint on theoretical models which aim to explainthe formation and evolution of galaxies.

astro-ph;0512154	implications for the cosmic reionization from the optical afterglow  spectrum of the gamma-ray burst 050904 at z = 6.3	the gamma-ray burst (grb) 050904 at z = 6.3 provides the first opportunity ofprobing the intergalactic medium (igm) by grbs at the epoch of thereionization. here we present a spectral modeling analysis of the opticalafterglow spectrum taken by the subaru telescope, aiming to constrain thereionization history. the spectrum shows a clear damping wing at wavelengthsredward of the lyman break, and the wing shape can be fit either by a damped lyalpha system with a column density of log (n_hi/cm^{-2}) ~ 21.6 at a redshiftclose to the detected metal absorption lines (z_metal = 6.295), or by almostneutral igm extending to a slightly higher redshift of z_{igm,u} ~ 6.36. in thelatter case, the difference from z_metal may be explained by acceleration ofmetal absorbing shells by the activities of the grb or its progenitor. however,we exclude this possibility by using the light transmission feature around thely beta resonance, leading to a firm upper limit of z_{igm,u} &lt; 6.314. we thenshow an evidence that the igm was largely ionized already at z=6.3, with thebest-fit neutral fraction of igm, x_hi = n_hi/n_h = 0.00, and upper limits ofx_hi &lt; 0.17 and 0.60 at 68 and 95% c.l., respectively. this is the first directand quantitative upper limit on x_hi at z &gt; 6. various systematic uncertaintiesare examined, but none of them appears large enough to change this conclusion.to get further information on the reionization, it is important to increase thesample size of z &gt;~ 6 grbs, in order to find grbs with low column densities(log n_hi &lt;~ 20) within their host galaxies, and for statistical studies of lyalpha line emission from host galaxies.

astro-ph;0603290	first detection of nai d lines in high-redshift damped lyman-alpha  systems	a near-infrared (1.18-1.35 micron) high-resolution spectrum of thegravitationally-lensed qso apm 08279+5255 was obtained with the ircs mounted onthe subaru telescope using the ao system. we detected strong nai d 5891,5897doublet absorption in high-redshift dlas at z=1.062 and 1.181, confirming thepresence of nai, which was first reported for the rest-frame uv nai3303.3,3303.9 doublet by petitjean et al. this is the first detection of nai dabsorption in a high-redshift (z&gt;1) dla. in addition, we detected a new naicomponent in the z=1.062 dla and four new components in the z=1.181 dla. usingan empirical relationship between nai and hi column density, we found that all"components" have large hi column density, so that each component is classifiedas dla absorption. we also detected strong nai d absorption associated with amgii system at z=1.173. because no other metal absorption lines were detectedin this system at the velocity of the nai absorption in previously reportedoptical spectra (observed 3.6 years ago), we interpret this nai absorptioncloud probably appeared in the line of sight toward the qso after the opticalobservation. this newly found cloud is likely to be a dla based upon its largeestimated hi column density. we found that the n(nai)/n(caii) ratios in thesedlas are systematically smaller than those observed in the galaxy; they aremore consistent with the ratios seen in the large magellanic cloud. this isconsistent with dust depletion generally being smaller in lower metallicityenvironments. however, all five clouds of the z=1.181 system have a highn(nai)/n(caii) ratio, which is characteristic of cold dense gas. we tentativelysuggest that the host galaxy of this system may be the most significantcontributor to the gravitational-lens toward apm 08279+5255.

astro-ph;0606397	telescope to observe planetary systems (tops): a high throughput 1.2-m  visible telescope with a small inner working angle	the telescope to observe planetary systems (tops) is a proposed space missionto image in the visible (0.4-0.9 micron) planetary systems of nearby starssimultaneously in 16 spectral bands (resolution r~20). for the ~10 mostfavorable stars, it will have the sensitivity to discover 2 r_e rocky planetswithin habitable zones and characterize their surfaces or atmospheres throughspectrophotometry. many more massive planets and debris discs will be imagedand characterized for the first time. with a 1.2m visible telescope, theproposed mission achieves its power by exploiting the most efficient and robustcoronagraphic and wavefront control techniques. the phase-induced amplitudeapodization (piaa) coronagraph used by tops allows planet detection at 2lambda/d with nearly 100% throughput and preserves the telescope angularresolution. an efficient focal plane wavefront sensing scheme accuratelymeasures wavefront aberrations which are fed back to the telescope activeprimary mirror. fine wavefront control is also performed independently in eachof 4 spectral channels, resulting in a system that is robust to wavefrontchromaticity.

astro-ph;0606605	adaptive optics spectroscopy of the [fe ii] outflows from hl tauri and  rw aurigae	we present new results of [fe ii] 1.644-micron spectroscopy toward the jetsfrom hl tau and rw aur carried out with the subaru telescope combined with theadaptive optics system. we observed the regions within 2" - 3" from the starswith the sub-arcsecond resolutions of 0."5 and 0."2 for hl tau and rw aur,respectively. in addition to the strong, high velocity emission extended alongeach jet, we detected a blueshifted low velocity emission feature seen as awing or shoulder of the high velocity emission at each stellar position.detailed analysis shows that the position-velocity diagrams (pvds) of hl tauand rw aur show a characteristic similar to those of the cold disk wind andx-wind models in that the [fe ii] line width is broad in the vicinity of thestellar position and is narrower at the extended jet. a closer comparisonsuggests, however, that the disk wind model tends to have too large line widthat the jet while the x-wind model has excess emission on the redshifted side atthe stellar position. the narrow velocity width with symmetric line profiles ofthe observed high velocity emission supports an x-wind type model where thelaunching region is localized in a small radial range, while the low velocityemission located away from the star favors the presence of a disk wind. the [feii] emission from the hl tau jet shows a gap of 0."8 between the redshifted jetand the star, indicating the presence of an optically thick disk of ~ 160 au inradius. the [fe ii] emission from the rw aur jet shows a marked drop from theredshifted peak at y ~ -0."2 toward the star, suggesting that its disk radiusis smaller than 40 au.

astro-ph;0609393	a galaxy at a redshift z = 6.96	when galaxy formation started in the history of the universe remains unclear.studies of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe, afterinitial cooling (following the big bang), was reheated and reionized by hotstars in newborn galaxies at a redshift in the range 6 &lt; z &lt; 14 (ref. 1).though several candidate galaxies at redshift z &gt; 7 have been identifiedphotometrically (refs 2,3), galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshiftshave been confined to z &lt; 6.6 (refs. 4-8). here we report a spectroscopicredshift of z = 6.96 (corresponding to just 750 myr after the big bang) for agalaxy whose spectrum clearly shows lyman-alpha emission at 9,682 a, indicatingactive star formation at a rate of about 10 m_sun/yr, where m_sun us the massof the sun. this demonstrates that galaxy formation was under way when theuniverse was only about 6 per cent of its present age. the number density ofgalaxies at z = 7 seems to be only 18-36 per cent of the density at z = 6.6.

astro-ph;0610846	the luminosity function and star formation rate between redshifts of  0.07 and 1.47 for narrow-band emitters in the subaru deep field	abridged: subaru deep field line-emitting galaxies in four narrow-bandfilters at low and intermediate redshifts are presented. broad-band colors,follow-up optical spectroscopy, and multiple nb filters are used to distinguishha, [o ii], and [o iii] emitters between redshifts of 0.07 and 1.47 toconstruct their luminosity functions (lfs). these lfs are derived down to faintmagnitudes, which allows for a more accurate determination of the faint endslope. with a large (n~200-900) sample for each redshift interval, a schechterprofile is fitted to each lf. prior to dust extinction corrections, the [o iii]and [o ii] lfs reported in this paper agree reasonably well with those ofhippelein et al. the z=0.08 ha lf, which reaches two orders of magnitudefainter than gallego et al., is steeper by 25%. this indicates that there aremore low luminosity star-forming galaxies for z&lt;0.1. the faint end slope \alphaand \phi_{\star} show a strong evolution with redshift while l_{\star} showlittle evolution. the evolution in \alpha indicates that low-luminositygalaxies have a stronger evolution compared to brighter ones. integrated starformation rate densities are derived via ha, [o iii], and [o ii] for0.07&lt;z&lt;1.47. a steep increase in the star-formation rate density, as a functionof redshift, is seen for 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9. for z&gt;1, the star-formation rate densitiesare more or less constant. the latter is consistent with previous uv and [o ii]measurements. below z&lt;0.4, the sfr densities are consistent with several ha, [oii], and uv measurements, but other measurements are a factor of two higher.for example, the z=0.066-0.092 ha lf agrees with those of jones &amp;bland-hawthorn, but at z=0.24 and 0.40, their number density is higher by afactor of two. this discrepancy can be explained by cosmic variance.
