0906.5071	the mass and anisotropy profiles of galaxy clusters from the projected  phase space density: testing the method on simulated data	we present a new method of constraining the mass and velocity anisotropyprofiles of galaxy clusters from kinematic data. the method is based on a modelof the phase space density which allows the anisotropy to vary with radiusbetween two asymptotic values. the characteristic scale of transition betweenthese asymptotes is fixed and tuned to a typical anisotropy profile resultingfrom cosmological simulations. the model is parametrized by two values ofanisotropy, at the centre of the cluster and at infinity, and two parameters ofthe nfw density profile, the scale radius and the scale mass. in order to testthe performance of the method in reconstructing the true cluster parameters weanalyze mock kinematic data for 20 relaxed galaxy clusters generated from acosmological simulation of the standard lcdm model. we use bayesian methods ofinference and the analysis is carried out following the markov chain montecarlo approach. the parameters of the mass profile are reproduced quite well,but we note that the mass is typically underestimated by 15 percent, probablydue to the presence of small velocity substructures. the constraints on theanisotropy profile for a single cluster are in general barely conclusive.although the central asymptotic value is determined accurately, the outer oneis subject to significant systematic errors caused by substructures at largeclustercentric distance. the anisotropy profile is much better constrained ifone performs joint analysis of at least a few clusters. in this case it ispossible to reproduce the radial variation of the anisotropy over two decadesin radius inside the virial sphere.

0909.1916	the grouping, merging and survival of subhaloes in the simulated local  group	we use a simulation performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study a realistic local group-like object. weemploy this group as a numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of thepopulation of its subhaloes from the point of view of the effects it may haveon the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. we focus on the processesof tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and groupingbefore infall. the tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition betweenthe phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occursat the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape oftheir mass function with redshift. although the satellites often form groups,they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. theinfall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiardistribution of the local group satellites, but only if it occurred recently.mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an earlystage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 gyr ago, when they are still outside thehost haloes. such events could thus contribute to the formation of more distantearly type milky way companions. once the subhaloes enter the host halo themergers become very rare.

0909.4423	constrained simulations of the local group: on the radial distribution  of substructures	we examine the properties of satellites found in high resolution simulationsof the local group. we use constrained simulations designed to reproduce themain dynamical features that characterize the local neighborhood, i.e. withintens of mpc around the local group (lg). specifically, a lg-like object isfound located within the 'correct' dynamical environment and consisting ofthree main objects which are associated with the milky way, m31 and m33. byrunning two simulations of this lg from identical initial conditions - one withand one without baryons modeled hydrodynamically - we can quantify the effectof gas physics on the $z=0$ population of subhaloes in an environment similarto our own. we find that above a certain mass cut, $m_{\rm sub} &gt;2\times10^{8}h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ subhaloes in hydrodynamic simulations are moreradially concentrated than those in simulations with out gas. this is caused bythe collapse of baryons into stars that typically sit in the central regions ofsubhaloes, making them denser. the increased central density of such a subhalo,results in less mass loss due to tidal stripping than the same subhalosimulated with only dark matter. the increased mass in hydrodynamic subhaloeswith respect to dark matter ones, causes dynamical friction to be moreeffective, dragging the subhalo towards the centre of the host. this results inthese subhaloes being effectively more radially concentrated then their darkmatter counterparts.

1001.4721	dwarf galaxies in voids: dark matter halos and gas cooling	galaxy surveys have shown that luminous galaxies are mainly distributed inlarge filaments and galaxy clusters. the remaining large volumes are virtuallydevoid of luminous galaxies. this is in concordance with the formation of thelarge-scale structure in universe as derived from cosmological simulations.however, the numerical results indicate that cosmological voids are abundantlypopulated with dark matter haloes which may in principle host dwarf galaxies.observational efforts have in contrast revealed, that voids are apparentlydevoid of dwarf galaxies. we investigate the formation of dwarf galaxies invoids by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. due to the cosmicultra-violet background radiation low-mass haloes show generally are reducedbaryon fraction. we determine the characteristic mass below which dwarfgalaxies are baryon deficient. we show that the circular velocity below whichthe accretion of baryons is suppressed is approximately 40 km/s. the suppressedbaryon accretion is caused by the photo-heating due to the uv-background. weset up a spherical halo model and show that the effective equation of state ofthe gas in the periphery of dwarf galaxies determines the characteristic mass.this implies that any process which heats the gas around dwarf galaxiesincreases the characteristic mass and thus reduces the number of observabledwarf galaxies.

1002.2853	the impact of baryonic physics on the shape and radial alignment of  substructures in cosmological dark matter haloes	we use two simulations performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study both the shape and radial alignment of (thedark matter component of) subhaloes; one of the simulations is a dark matteronly model while the other run includes all the relevant gas physics and starformation recipes. we find that the involvement of gas physics does not have astatistically significant effect on either property -- at least not for themost massive subhaloes considered in this study. however, we observe in bothsimulations including and excluding gasdynamics a (pronounced) evolution of thedark matter shapes of subhaloes as well as of the radial alignment signal sinceinfall time. further, this evolution is different when positioned in thecentral and outer regions of the host halo today; while subhaloes tend tobecome more aspherical in the central 50% of their host's virial radius, theradial alignment weakens in the central regime while strengthening in the outerparts. we confirm that this is due to tidal torquing and the fact thatsubhaloes at pericentre move too fast for the alignment signal to respond.

0708.0229	too small to form a galaxy: how the uv background determines the baryon  fraction	the cosmic ultraviolet background (uvb) heats the intergalactic medium (igm),as a result the gas in dark matter halos below a certain mass is too hot tocool within a hubble time. the uvb effectively suppresses the formation ofdwarf galaxies. using high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulationswe show that photo heating leads to small baryon fractions in halos below ~6x10^9 h^{-1}m_sun, independent of the cosmic environment. the simulations arecarried out assuming a homogeneous uvb with flux densities as given by haardt &amp;madau (1996). a halo may stop to condense gas significantly after the universeis reionised, namely when its mass falls below the characteristic mass scaleset by the photo heating. assuming a spherical halo model we derive thischaracteristic mass analytically and identify the main mechanisms that preventthe gas from cooling in small halos. the theoretically derived characteristicmass is smaller than the one obtained from observations. increasing the energyper ionising photon by a factor between four and eight would be sufficient toreconcile both. this is equivalent to an average temperature of the igm of ~10^4 k. in this sense the faint end of the luminosity function may serve as acalorimeter for the igm.

1003.4544	strong lensing in the marenostrum universe: biases in the cluster lens  population	strong lensing is one of the most direct probes of the mass distribution inthe inner regions of galaxy clusters. it can be used to constrain the densityprofiles and to measure the mass of the lenses. moreover, the abundance ofstrong lensing events can be used to constrain the structure formation and thecosmological parameters through the so-called "arc-statistics" approach.however, several issues related to the usage of strong lensing clusters incosmological applications are still controversial, leading to the suspect thatseveral biases may affect this very peculiar class of objects. with this studywe aim at better understanding the properties of galaxy clusters which canpotentially act as strong lenses. we do so by investigating the properties of alarge sample of galaxy clusters extracted from the n-body/hydrodynamicalsimulation marenostrum universe. we explore the correlation between the crosssection for lensing and many properties of clusters, like the mass, thethree-dimensional and projected shapes, their concentrations, the x-rayluminosity and the dynamical activity. we find that the probability of strongalignments between the major axes of the lenses and the line of sight is agrowing function of the lensing cross section. in projection, the strong lensesappear rounder within r200, but we find that their cores tend to be moreelliptical as the lensing cross section increases. we also find that thecluster concentrations estimated from the projected density profiles tend to bebiased high. the x-ray luminosity of strong lensing clusters is higher thanthat of normal lenses of similar mass and redshift. this is particularsignificant for the least massive lenses. finally, we find that the strongestlenses generally exhibit an excess of kinetic energy within the virial radius,indicating that they are more dynamically active than usual clusters.

1005.3139	reionization of the local group of galaxies	we present the first detailed structure formation and radiative transfersimulations of the reionization history of our cosmic neighbourhood. to thisend, we follow the formation of the local group of galaxies and nearby clustersby means of constrained simulations, which use the available observationalconstraints to construct a representation of those structures which reproducestheir actual positions and properties at the present time. we find that thereionization history of the local group is strongly dependent on the assumedphoton production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorlyconstrained. if sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is'photon-rich', the local group is primarily ionized externally by the nearbyclusters. alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is'photon-poor' the local group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.the mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications forthe evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxypopulations and primordial stellar populations. this therefore provides animportant avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies ofour nearby structures.

1010.1531	the preferred direction of infalling satellite galaxies in the local  group	using a high resolution dm simulation of the local group (lg), conductedwithin the framework of the constrained local universe simulation (clues)project, we investigate the nature of how satellites of the mw and m31 areaccreted. satellites of these galaxies are accreted anisotropically, enteringthe virial radius of their hosts from specific "spots" with respect to thelarge scale structure. furthermore, material which is tidally stripped fromthese satellites is also, at z=0, distributed anisotropically and ischaracterized by an ellipsoidal sub-volume embedded in the halo. the angularpattern created by the locus of satellite infall points and the projectedstripped dm is investigated within a coordinate system determined by thelocation of the lg companion and the simulated virgo cluster across concentricshells ranging from 0.1 to 5 r_vir. remarkably, the principal axis of theellipsoidal sub-volume shows a coherent alignment extending from well withinthe halo to a few r_vir. a spherical harmonics transform applied to the angulardistributions confirms the visual impression: namely, the angular distributionsof both the satellites entry points and stripped dm is dominated by the l=2quadrupole term, whose major principal axis is aligned across the shellsconsidered. it follows that the structure of the outer (r&gt;0.5 r_vir) regions ofthe main halos is closely related to the cosmic web within which it isembedded. given the hypothesis that a large fraction of the stellar halo of themilky way has been accreted from satellites, the present results can be appliedto the stellar halo of the mw and m31. we predict that the remnants of tidallystripped satellites should be embedded in streams of material composed of darkmatter and stars. the present results can therefore shed light on the existenceof satellites embedded within larger streams of matter, such as the segue 2satellite.

1104.0949	haloes gone mad: the halo-finder comparison project	[abridged] we present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter haloproperties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. thesecodes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (fof),spherical-overdensity (so) and phase-space based algorithms. we furtherintroduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allowshalo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against thosepresented here. this set includes mock haloes containing various levels anddistributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as acosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. all thehalo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location ofour mock haloes. they further returned lists of particles (potentially)belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of thecircular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. all the findersbased in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was locatedclose to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the massrecovered varies from finder to finder. those finders based in phase spacecould resolve central substructure although they found difficulties inaccurately recovering its properties. via a resolution study we found that mostof the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than30-40 particles. however, also here the phase space finders excelled byresolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. by comparing the halo findersusing a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkablywell on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass,position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).

1107.2944	renegade subhaloes in the local group	using a dark matter only constrained local universe simulation (clues) weexamine the existence of subhaloes that change their affiliation from one ofthe two prominent hosts in the local group (i.e. the milky way and theandromeda galaxy) to the other, and call these objects "renegade subhaloes". inlight of recent claims that the two magellanic clouds (mcs) may have originatedfrom another region (or even the outskirts) of the local group or that theyhave been spawned by a major merger in the past of the andromeda galaxy, weinvestigate the nature of such events. however, we cannot confirm that renegadesubhaloes enter as deep into the potential well of their present host nor thatthey share the most simplest properties with the mcs, namely mass and relativevelocity. our simulation rather suggests that these renegade subhaloes appearto be flying past one host before being pulled into the other. a merger is notrequired to trigger such an event, it is rather the distinct environment of oursimulated local group facilitating such behavior. since just a small fractionof the full z=0 subhalo population are renegades, our study indicates that itwill be intrinsically difficult to distinguish them despite clear differencesin their velocity, radial distribution, shape and spin parameter distributions.

1107.5045	too small to succeed? lighting up massive dark matter subhaloes of the  milky way	using constrained local universe simulations (clues) of the formation of thelocal group in a cosmological context we investigate the recently highlightedproblem that the majority of the most massive dark subhaloes of the milky wayare too dense to host any of its bright satellites. in particular, we examinethe influence of baryonic processes and find that they leave a twofold effecton the relation between the peak of the rotation curve and its position (vmaxand rmax). satellites with a large baryon fraction experience adiabaticcontraction thus decreasing rmax while leaving vmax more or less unchanged.subhaloes with smaller baryon fractions undergo a decrease in vmax possibly dueto outflows of material. furthermore, the situation of finding subhaloes insimulations that lie outside the confidence interval for possible hosts of thebright mw dwarf spheroidals, appears to be far more prominent in cosmologieswith a high sigma8 normalisation and depends on the mass of the host. weconclude that the problem cannot be simply solved by including baryonicprocesses and hence demands further investigations.

0710.1297	the fossil phase in the life of a galaxy group	we investigate the origin and evolution of fossil groups in a concordancelcdm cosmological simulation. we consider haloes with masses between$(1-5)\times10^{13} \hmsun$ and study the physical mechanisms that lead to theformation of the large gap in magnitude between the brightest and the secondmost bright group member, which is typical for these fossil systems. fossilgroups are found to have high dark matter concentrations, which we can relateto their early formation time. the large magnitude-gaps arise after the groupshave build up half of their final mass, due to merging of massive groupmembers. we show that the existence of fossil systems is primarily driven bythe relatively early infall of massive satellites, and that we do not find astrong environmental dependence for these systems. in addition, we findtentative evidence for fossil group satellites falling in on orbits withtypically lower angular momentum, which might lead to a more efficient mergeronto the host. we find a population of groups at higher redshifts that gothrough a ``fossil phase'': a stage where they show a large magnitude-gap,which is terminated by renewed infall from their environment.

1202.6057	the clustering of galaxies at z~0.5 in the sdss-iii data release 9  boss-cmass sample: a test for the lcdm cosmology	we present results on the clustering of 282,068 galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) sample of massive galaxies withredshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii project.our results cover a large range of scales from ~0.5 to ~90 mpc/h. we comparethese estimates with the expectations of the flat lcdm cosmological model withparameters compatible with wmap7 data. we use the multidark cosmologicalsimulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, toestimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloesand galaxy biases. we find that the lcdm model gives a reasonable descriptionto the observed correlation functions at z~0.5, which is a remarkably goodagreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance ofboss galaxies, does not have any free parameters. however, we find a deviation(&gt;~10%) in the correlation functions for scales less than ~1 mpc/h and ~10-40mpc/h. a more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics fromupcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. we also estimatethat about 12% of the "galaxies" in the abundance-matched sample are satellitesinhabiting central haloes with mass m&gt;~1e14 m_sun/h. using the multidarksimulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched cataloguefinding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtainedusing the measured boss projected correlation function. furthermore, the linearlarge-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matchedsample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/mpc)^3). extrapolating these resultsto bao scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signalproduced by non-linear evolution that leads to ~2-4% dips at ~3 sigma level forwavenumbers k&gt;~0.1 h/mpc in the linear large-scale bias.

1204.0005	applying scale-free mass estimators to the local group in constrained  local universe simulations	we use the recently proposed scale-free mass estimators to determine themasses of the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) galaxy in a dark matter onlyconstrained local universe simulation (clues). while these mass estimators workrather well for isolated spherical host systems, we examine here theirapplicability to a simulated binary system with a unique satellite populationsimilar to the observed satellites of mw and m31. we confirm that thescale-free estimators work also very well in our simulated local group galaxieswith the right number of satellites which follow the observed radialdistribution. in the isotropic case and under the assumption that thesatellites are tracking the total gravitating mass, the power-law index of theradial satellite distribution $n(&lt;r)\propto r^{3-\gamma}$ is directly relatedto the host's mass profile $m(&lt;r)\propto r^{1-\alpha}$ as $\alpha=\gamma-2$.the use of this relation for any given $\gamma$ leads to highly accurate massestimations which is a crucial point for observer, since they do not know apriori the mass profile of the mw and m31 haloes. we discuss possible bias inthe mass estimators and conclude that the scale-free mass estimators can besatisfactorily applied to the real mw and m31 system.

1204.0515	size matters: the non-universal density profile of subhaloes in sph  simulations and implications for the milky way's dsphs	we use dark matter only and full hydrodynamical constrained local universesimulations (clues) of the formation of the local group to study the densityprofile of subhaloes of the simulated milky way and andromeda galaxies. we showthat the einasto model provides the best description of the subhaloes' densityprofile, as opposed to the more commonly used nfw profile or any generalisationof it. we further find that the einasto shape parameter \nein\ is stronglycorrelated with the total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of anon-universality of the subhaloes' density profile. we observe that the effectof mass loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and thehydrodynamical run, is the reduction of the shape parameter \nein\ between theinfall and the present time. assuming now that the dsphs of our galaxy followthe einasto profile and using the maximum and minimum values of \nein\ from ourhydrodynamical simulation as a gauge, we can improve the observationalconstraints on the \rmax-\vmax\ pairs obtained for the brightest satellitegalaxies of the milky way. when considering only the subhaloes with$-13.2\lesssim m_v\lesssim-8.8$, i.e. the range of luminosity of the classicaldwarfs, we find that all our simulated objects are consistent with the observeddsphs if their haloes follow the einasto model with $1.6\lesssim n_{\rm e}\lesssim5.3$. the numerically motivated einasto profile for the observed dsphswill alleviate the recently presented "massive failures" problem.

1205.1695	n-body simulations with a cosmic vector for dark energy	we present the results of a series of cosmological $n$-body simulations of avector dark energy (vde) model, performed using a suitably modified version ofthe publicly available \texttt{gadget}-2 code. the setups of our simulationswere calibrated pursuing a twofold aim: 1) to analyze the large scaledistribution of massive objects and 2) to determine the properties of halostructure in this different ramework.we observe that structure formation isenhanced in vde, since the mass function at high redshift is boosted up to afactor of ten with respect to \lcdm, possibly alleviating tensions with theobservations of massive clusters at high redshifts and early reionizationepoch. significant differences can also be found for the value of the growthfactor, that in vde shows a completely different behaviour, and in thedistribution of voids, which in this cosmology are on average smaller and lessabundant. we further studied the structure of dark matter haloes more massivethan $5\times10^{13}$\hmsun, finding that no substantial difference emergeswhen comparing spin parameter, shape, triaxiality and profiles of structuresevolved under different cosmological pictures. nevertheless, minor differencescan be found in the concentration-mass relation and the two point correlationfunction; both showing different amplitudes and steeper slopes.using anadditional series of simulations of a \lcdm\ scenario with the same $\omega_m$and $\sigma_8$ used in the vde cosmology, we have been able to establishwhether the modifications induced in the new cosmological picture were due tothe particular nature of the dynamical dark energy or a straightforwardconsequence of the cosmological parameters.

1207.4438	the music of galaxy clusters i: baryon properties and scaling relations  of the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we introduce the marenostrum-multidark simulations of galaxy clusters (music)dataset, one of the largest sample of hydrodynamically simulated galaxyclusters with more than 500 clusters and 2000 groups. the objects have beenselected from two large n-body simulations and have been resimulated at highresolution using sph together with relevant physical processes (cooling, uvphotoionization, star formation and different feedback processes). we focus onthe analysis of the baryon content (gas and star) of clusters in the musicdataset both as a function of aperture radius and redshift. the results fromour simulations are compared with the most recent observational estimates ofthe gas fraction in galaxy clusters at different overdensity radii. when theeffects of cooling and stellar feedbacks are included, the music clusters showa good agreement with the most recent observed gas fractions quoted in theliterature. a clear dependence of the gas fractions with the total cluster massis also evident. the impact of the aperture radius choice, when comparingintegrated quantities at different redshifts, is tested: the standarddefinition of radius at a fixed overdensity with respect to critical density iscompared with a definition based on the redshift dependent overdensity withrespect to background density. we also present a detailed analysis of thescaling relations of the thermal sz (sunyaev zel'dovich) effect derived frommusic clusters. the integrated sz brightness, y, is related to the clustertotal mass, m, as well as, the m-y counterpart, more suitable for observationalapplications. both laws are consistent with predictions from the self-similarmodel, showing a very low scatter. the effects of the gas fraction on the y-mscaling and the presence of a possible redshift dependence on the y-m scalingrelation are also explored.

1211.0536	dwarf galaxies and the cosmic web	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group ofgalaxies to identify a mechanism that enables the removal of baryons fromlow-mass halos without appealing to feedback or reionization. as the localgroup forms, matter bound to it develops a network of filaments and pancakes.this moving web of gas and dark matter drifts and sweeps a large volume,overtaking many halos in the process. the dark matter content of these halos isunaffected but their gas can be efficiently removed by ram-pressure. the lossof gas is especially pronounced in low-mass halos due to their lower bindingenergy and has a dramatic effect on the star formation history of affectedsystems. this "cosmic web stripping" may help to explain the scarcity of dwarfgalaxies compared with the numerous low-mass halos expected in \lambda cdm andthe large diversity of star formation histories and morphologies characteristicof faint galaxies. although our results are based on a single high-resolutionsimulation, it is likely that the hydrodynamical interaction of dwarf galaxieswith the cosmic web is a crucial ingredient so far missing from galaxyformation models.

1212.1454	cosmic vorticity and the origin of halo spins	in the standard model of cosmology, structure emerges out of non-rotationalflow and the angular momentum of collapsing halos is induced by tidal torques.the growth of halo angular momentum in the linear and quasi-linear phases isassociated with a shear, curl-free, flow and it is well described within thelinear framework of tidal torque theory (ttt). however, ttt is renderedirrelevant as haloes approach turn around and virialization. at that stage theflow field around halos has non-zero vorticity. using a cosmologicalsimulation, we have examined the importance of the curl of the velocity field(vorticity) in determining halo spin, finding a strong alignment between thetwo. we have also examined the alignment of vorticity with the principle axesof the shear tensor, finding that it tends to be perpendicular to the axisalong which material is collapsing fastest (e1). this behavior is independentof halo masses and cosmic web environment. our results agree with previousfindings on the tendency of halo spin to be perpendicular to e1, and of thespin of (simulated) halos and (observed) galaxies to be aligned with thelarge-scale structure. our results imply that angular momentum growth proceedsin two distinct phases. in the first phase angular momentum emerges out of ashear, curl-free, potential flow, as described by ttt. in the second phase, inwhich haloes approach virialization, the angular momentum emerges out of avortical flow and halo spin becomes strongly aligned with the vorticity of theambient flow field.

1212.2806	reconstructing cosmological initial conditions from galaxy peculiar  velocities. i. reverse zeldovich approximation	we propose a new method to recover the cosmological initial conditions of thepresently observed galaxy distribution, which can serve to run constrainedsimulations of the local universe. our method, the reverse zeldovichapproximation (rza), can be applied to radial galaxy peculiar velocity data andextends the previously used constrained realizations (cr) method by adding alagrangian reconstruction step. the rza method consists of applying thezeldovich approximation in reverse to galaxy peculiar velocities to estimatethe cosmic displacement field and the initial linear matter distribution fromwhich the present-day local universe evolved.we test our method with a mocksurvey taken from a cosmological simulation. we show that the halo peculiarvelocities at z = 0 are close to the linear prediction of the zeldovichapproximation, if a grouping is applied to the data to remove virial motions.we find that the addition of rza to the cr method significantly improves thereconstruction of the initial conditions. the rza is able to recover thecorrect initial positions of the velocity tracers with a median error of only1.36 mpc/h in our test simulation. for realistic sparse and noisy data, thismedian increases to 5 mpc/h. this is a significant improvement over theprevious approach of neglecting the displacement field, which introduces errorson a scale of 10 mpc/h or even higher. applying the rza method to the upcominghigh-quality observational peculiar velocity catalogues will generate much moreprecise constrained simulations of the local universe.

1212.2808	reconstructing cosmological initial conditions from galaxy peculiar  velocities. ii. the effect of observational errors	the reverse zeldovich approximation (rza) is a reconstruction method whichallows to estimate the cosmic displacement field from galaxy peculiar velocitydata and to constrain initial conditions for cosmological simulations of thelocal universe. in this paper, we investigate the effect of differentobservational errors on the reconstruction quality of this method. for this, webuild a set of mock catalogues from a cosmological simulation, varyingdifferent error sources like the galaxy distance measurement error (0 - 20%),the sparseness of the data points, and the maximum catalogue radius (3000 -6000 km/s). we perform the rza reconstruction of the initial conditions onthese mock catalogues and compare with the actual initial conditions of thesimulation. we also investigate the impact of the fact that only the radialpart of the peculiar velocity is observationally accessible. we find that thesparseness of a dataset has the highest detrimental effect on rzareconstruction quality. observational distance errors also have a significantinfluence, but it is possible to compensate this relatively well with wienerfilter reconstruction. we also investigate the effect of different objectselection criteria and find that distance catalogues distributed randomly andhomogeneously across the sky (such as spiral galaxies selected for thetully-fisher method) allow for a higher reconstruction quality than if whendata is preferentially drawn from massive objects or dense environments (suchas elliptical galaxies). we find that the error of estimating the initialconditions with rza is always dominated by the inherent non-linearity of dataobserved at z=0 rather than by the combined effect of the observational errors.even an extremely sparse dataset with high observational errors still leads toa good reconstruction of the initial conditions on a scale of about 5 mpc/h.

1212.2810	reconstructing cosmological initial conditions from galaxy peculiar  velocities. iii. constrained simulations	in previous works we proposed the reverse zeldovich approximation (rza)method, which can be used to estimate the cosmological initial conditionsunderlying the galaxy distribution in the local universe using peculiarvelocity data. in this paper, we apply the technique to run constrainedcosmological simulations from the rza-reconstructed initial conditions,designed to reproduce the large-scale structure of the local universe. we testthe method with mock peculiar velocity catalogues extracted from a referencesimulation. we first reconstruct the initial conditions of this referencesimulation using the mock data, and then run the reconstructed initialconditions forward in time until z=0. we compare the resulting constrainedsimulations with the original simulation at z=0 to test the accuracy of thismethod. we also compare them with constrained simulations run from the mockdata without the addition of rza, i.e. using only the currently establishedconstrained realizations (cr) method. our re-simulations are able to correctlyrecover the evolution of the large-scale structure underlying the data. theresults show that the addition of rza to the cr method significantly improvesboth the reconstruction of the initial conditions and the accuracy of theobtained constrained resimulations. haloes from the original simulation arerecovered in the re-simulations with an average accuracy of about 2 mpc/h ontheir position and a factor of 2 in mass, down to haloes with a mass of approx10^14 m_odot/h. in comparison, without rza the re-simulations recover only themost massive haloes with masses of about 5x10^14 m_odot/h and higher, and witha systematic shift on their position of about approx 10 mpc/h due to the cosmicdisplacement field. we show that with the additional lagrangian reconstructionstep introduced by the rza, this shift can be removed.

1303.2056	orbital anisotropy in cosmological haloes revisited	the velocity anisotropy of particles inside dark matter (dm) haloes is animportant physical quantity, which is required for the accurate modelling ofmass profiles of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. it is typically measuredusing the ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions at a givendistance from the halo centre. however, this measure is insufficient todescribe the dynamics of realistic haloes, which are typically quite elongated.studying the velocity distribution in massive dm haloes in cosmologicalsimulations, we find that in the inner parts of the haloes the local velocityellipsoids are strongly aligned with the major axis of the halo, the alignmentbeing stronger for more relaxed haloes. in the outer regions of the haloes, thealignment becomes gradually weaker and the orientation is more random. thesetwo distinct regions of different degree of the alignment coincide with twocharacteristic regimes of the dm density profile: shallower and steeper than\rho r^{-2}. this alignment of the local velocity ellipsoids requiresreinterpretation of features found in measurements based on the sphericallyaveraged ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions. in particular,we show that the velocity distribution in the central halo regions is highlyanisotropic. for cluster-size haloes with mass 10^{14}-10^{15} h^-1 msun, thevelocity anisotropy along the major axis is nearly independent of radius and isequal to \beta=1-\sigma^2_{perp}/\sigma^2_{radial}=0.4, which is significantlylarger than the previously estimated spherically averaged velocity anisotropy.the alignment of density and velocity anisotropies, and the radial trends mayalso have some implications for the mass modelling based on kinematical data ofsuch objects as galaxy clusters or dwarf spheroidals, where the orbitalanisotropy is a key element in an unbiased mass inference.

1303.2690	the kinematics of the local group in a cosmological context	recent observations constrained the tangential velocity of m31 with respectto the milky way (mw) to be v_tan&lt;34.4 km/s and the radial velocity to be inthe range v_rad=-109+/- 4.4 km/s (van der marel et al. 2012). in this study weuse a large volume high resolution n-body cosmological simulation (bolshoi)together with three constrained simulations to statistically study thiskinematics in the context of the lcdm. the comparison of the ensembles ofsimulated pairs with the observed lg at the 1-sigma level in the uncertaintieshas been done with respect to the radial and tangential velocities, the reducedorbital energy (e_tot), angular momentum (l_orb) and the dimensionless spinparameter, lambda. our main results are: (i) the preferred radial andtangential velocities for pairs in lcdm are v_rad=-80+/-20 km/s, v_tan=50+/-10km/s, (ii) pairs around that region are 3 to 13 times more common than pairswithin the observational values, (iii) 15%to 24% of lg-like pairs in lcdm haveenergy and angular momentum consistent with observations while (iv) 9% to 13%of pairs in the same sample show similar values in the inferred dimensionlessspin parameter. it follows that within current observational uncertainties thequasi-conserved quantities that characterize the orbit of the lg, i.e. e_tot,r_orb and lambda, do not challenge the standard lcdm model, but the model is intension with regard to the actual values of the radial and tangentialvelocities. this might hint to a problem of the lcdm model to reproduce theobserved lg.

1304.0585	structure finding in cosmological simulations: the state of affairs	the ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations ofcosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for theiranalysis. during the past decade, the art of object finding in thesesimulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. amultitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques havebeen spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will providethe same (physical) information about the structures of interest. here wesummarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": weinvestigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders.to this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods,clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties.we observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objectsleading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and vmax function,but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by allfinders differ. the strength of the variation, however, depends on the propertystudied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak valueof the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derivedquantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. our study indicatesthat the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codesstems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent --the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles isimplemented. we close with a discussion of the relevance and implications ofthe scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.

1304.6565	simulating structure formation of the local universe	in this work we present cosmological n-body simulations of the local universewith initial conditions constrained by the two-micron redshift survey (2mrs)within a cubic volume of 180 mpc/h side-length centred at the local group. weuse a self-consistent bayesian based approach to explore the joint parameterspace of primordial density fluctuations and peculiar velocity fields, whichare compatible with the 2mrs galaxy distribution after cosmic evolution. thismethod (the kigen-code) includes the novel alpt (augmented lagrangianperturbation theory) structure formation model which combines second order lpt(2lpt) on large scales with the spherical collapse model on small scales.furthermore we describe coherent flows with 2lpt and include a dispersion termto model fingers-of-god (fogs). these implementations are crucial to avoidartificial filamentary structures, which appear when using a structureformation model with 2lpt and data with compressed fogs. we assume lcdmcosmology throughout our method. the recovered initial gaussian fields are usedto perform a set of 25 constrained simulations. statistically this ensemble ofsimulations is in agreement with a reference set of 25 simulations based onrandomly seeded gaussian fluctuations in terms of matter statistics,power-spectra and mass functions. considering the entire volume, we obtaincorrelation coefficients of about 98.3% for the comparison between thesimulated density fields and the galaxy density field in log-space withgaussian smoothing scales of r_s=3.5 mpc/h (74% for r_s=1.4 mpc/h). the crosspower-spectra show correlations with the galaxy distribution which weakentowards smaller length scales until they vanish at scales of 2.2-3.0 mpc/h. thesimulations we present provide a fully nonlinear density and velocity fieldwith a high level of correlation with the observed galaxy distribution atscales of a few mpc.

1305.5557	cold versus warm dark matter simulations of a galaxy group	the differences between cold (cdm) and warm (wdm) dark matter in theformation of a group of galaxies is examined by running two identicalsimulations where in the wdm case the initial power spectrum has been alteredto mimic a 1kev dark matter particle. the cdm initial conditions wereconstrained to reproduce at z = 0 the correct local environment within which a"local group" (lg) of galaxies may form. two significant differences betweenthe two simulations are found. while in the cdm case a group of galaxies thatresembles the real lg forms, the wdm run fails to reproduce a viable lg,instead forming a diffuse group which is still expanding at z = 0. this issurprising since, due to the suppression of small scale power in its powerspectrum, wdm is naively expected to only affect the collapse of small haloesand not necessarily the dynamics on a scale of a group of galaxies. furthermorethe concentration of baryons in halo center's is greater in cdm than in wdm andthe properties of the disks differ.

1311.2253	simulations of the local universe constrained by observational peculiar  velocities	peculiar velocities, obtained from direct distance measurements, are data ofchoice to achieve constrained simulations of the local universe reliable downto a scale of a few megaparsecs. unlike redshift surveys, peculiar velocitiesare direct tracers of the underlying gravitational field as they trace bothbaryonic and dark matter. this paper presents the first attempt to use solelyobservational peculiar velocities to constrain cosmological simulations of thenearby universe. in order to set up initial conditions, a reverse zel'dovichapproximation (rza) is used to displace constraints from their positions at z=0to their precursors' locations at higher redshifts. an additional new featurereplaces original observed radial peculiar velocity vectors by their full 3dreconstructions provided by the wiener-filter (wf) estimator. subsequently, theconstrained realization of gaussian fields technique (cr) is applied to buildvarious realizations of the initial conditions. the wf/rza/cr method is firsttested on realistic mock catalogs built from a reference simulation similar tothe local universe. these mocks include errors on peculiar velocities, ondata-point positions and a large continuous zone devoid of data in order tomimic galactic extinction. large scale structures are recovered with a typicalaccuracy of 5 megaparsecs/h in position, the best realizations reaching a 2-3mpc/h precision, the limit imposed by the rza linear theory. then, the methodis applied to the first observational radial peculiar velocity catalog of theproject cosmicflows. this paper is a proof of concept that the wf/rza/cr methodcan be applied to observational peculiar velocities to successfully buildconstrained initial conditions.

0802.0429	the distribution function of dark matter in massive haloes	we study the distribution function (df) of dark matter particles in haloes ofmass range 10^{14}--10^{15}\msun. in the numerical part of this work we measurethe df for a sample of relaxed haloes formed in the simulation of a standard\lambdacdm model. the df is expressed as a function of energy e and theabsolute value of the angular momentum l, a form suitable for comparison withtheoretical models. by proper scaling we obtain the results that do not dependon the virial mass of the haloes. we demonstrate that the df can be separatedinto energy and angular momentum components and propose a phenomenologicalmodel of the df in the formf_{e}(e)[1+l^{2}/(2l_{0}^{2})]^{-\beta_{\infty}+\beta_{0}}l^{-2\beta_{0}}. thisformulation involves three parameters describing the anisotropy profile interms of its asymptotic values (\beta_{0} and \beta_{\infty}) and the scale oftransition between them (l_{0}). the energy part f_{e}(e) is obtained viainversion of the integral for spatial density. we provide a straightforwardnumerical scheme for this procedure as well as a simple analyticalapproximation for a typical halo formed in the simulation. the df model isextensively compared with the simulations: using the model parameters obtainedfrom fitting the anisotropy profile, we recover the df from the simulation aswell as the profiles of the dispersion and kurtosis of radial and tangentialvelocities. finally, we show that our df model reproduces the power-lawbehaviour of phase space density q=\rho(r)/\sigma^{3}(r).

1312.0105	dark matter in the local universe	we review how dark matter is distributed in our local neighbourhood from anobservational and theoretical perspective. we will start by describing firstthe dark matter halo of our own galaxy and in the local group. then we proceedto describe the dark matter distribution in the more extended area known as thelocal universe. depending on the nature of dark matter, numerical simulationspredict different abundances of substructures in local group galaxies, in thenumber of void regions and in the abundance of low rotational velocity galaxiesin the local universe. by comparing these predictions with the most recentobservations, strong constrains on the physical properties of the dark matterparticles can be derived. we devote particular attention to the results fromthe constrained local universe simulations (clues) project, a special set ofsimulations whose initial conditions are constrained by observational data fromthe local universe. the resulting simulations are designed to reproduce theobserved structures in the nearby universe. the clues provides a numericallaboratory for simulating the local group of galaxies and exploring the physicsof galaxy formation in an environment designed to follow the observed localuniverse. it has come of age as the numerical analogue of near-field cosmology.

1312.0276	cosmic variance of the local hubble flow in large-scale cosmological  simulations	the increasing precision in the determination of the hubble parameter hasreached a per cent level at which large-scale cosmic flows induced byinhomogeneities of the matter distribution become non-negligible. here we uselarge-scale cosmological n-body simulations to study statistical properties ofthe local hubble parameter as measured by local observers. we show that thedistribution of the local hubble parameter depends not only on the scale ofinhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in thecosmic web and what reference frame is used. observers located in random darkmatter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at randompositions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect isstronger from the halo rest frames compared to the cmb rest frame. we comparethe predictions for the local hubble parameter with observational constraintsbased on type ia supernovae (snia) and cmb observations. due to cosmicvariance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the hubbleconstant determined from nearby snia may differ from that measured from the cmbby 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. this scatter is too smallto significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between currentmeasurements assuming a flat lcdm model. however, for observers located in thecentres of the largest voids permitted by the standard lcdm model, we find thathubble constant measurements from snia would be biased high by 5 per cent,rendering this tension inexistent in this extreme case.

0802.1917	on the relation between radial alignment of dark matter subhalos and  host mass in cosmological simulations	we explore the dependence of the radial alignment of subhalos on the mass ofthe host halo they orbit in. as the effect is seen on a broad range of scalesincluding massive clusters as well as galactic systems it only appears naturalto explore this phenomenon by means of cosmological simulations covering thesame range in masses. we have 25 well resolved host dark matter halos at ourdisposal ranging from 10^15 msun/h down to 10^12 msun/h each consisting oforder of a couple of million particles within the virial radius. we observethat subhalos tend to be more spherical than isolated objects. both thedistributions of sphericity and triaxiality of subhalos are gaussiandistributed with peak values of s approx. 0.80 and t approx. 0.56, irrespectiveof host mass. interestingly we note that the radial alignment is independent ofhost halo mass and the distribution of \cos\theta (i.e. the angle between themajor axis e_a of each subhalo and the radius vector of the subhalo in thereference frame of the host) is well fitted by a simple power law p(\cos\theta)proportional to \cos^4\theta with the same fitting parameters for all hosthalos.

1403.7528	the distribution of gas in the local group from constrained cosmological  simulations: the case for andromeda and the milky way galaxies	we study the gas distribution in the milky way and andromeda using aconstrained cosmological simulation of the local group (lg) within the contextof the clues (constrained local universe simulations) project. we analyse theproperties of gas in the simulated galaxies at $z=0$ for three differentphases: `cold', `hot' and hi, and compare our results with observations. theamount of material in the hot halo ($m_{hot}\approx4-5\times10^{10}\,$m$_{\odot}$), and the cold($m_{cold}(r\lesssim10\,$kpc$)\approx10^{8}\,$m$_{\odot}$) and hi($m_{hi}(r\lesssim50\,$kpc$)\approx 3-4\times10^8\,$m$_{\odot}$) componentsdisplay a reasonable agreement with observations. we also compute theaccretion/ejection rates together with the hi (radial and all-sky) coveringfractions. the integrated hi accretion rate within $r=50\,$kpc gives$\sim$$0.2-0.3\,$m$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$, i.e. close to that obtained fromhigh-velocity clouds in the milky way. we find that the global accretion rateis dominated by hot material, although ionized gas with $t\lesssim10^5\,$k cancontribute significantly too. the $net$ accretion rates of $all$ material atthe virial radii are $6-8\,$m$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$. at $z=0$, we find asignificant gas excess between the two galaxies, as compared to any otherdirection, resulting from the overlap of their gaseous haloes. in oursimulation, the gas excess first occurs at $z\sim1$, as a consequence of thekinematical evolution of the lg.

0803.0918	the aspen--amsterdam void finder comparison project	despite a history that dates back at least a quarter of a century studies ofvoids in the large--scale structure of the universe are bedevilled by a majorproblem: there exist a large number of quite different void--findingalgorithms, a fact that has so far got in the way of groups comparing theirresults without worrying about whether such a comparison in fact makes sense.because of the recent increased interest in voids, both in very large galaxysurveys and in detailed simulations of cosmic structure formation, thissituation is very unfortunate. we here present the first systematic comparisonstudy of thirteen different void finders constructed using particles, haloes,and semi--analytical model galaxies extracted from a subvolume of themillennium simulation. the study includes many groups that have studied voidsover the past decade. we show their results and discuss their differences andagreements. as it turns out, the basic results of the various methods agreevery well with each other in that they all locate a major void near the centreof our volume. voids have very underdense centres, reaching below 10 percent ofthe mean cosmic density. in addition, those void finders that allow for voidgalaxies show that those galaxies follow similar trends. for example, theoverdensity of void galaxies brighter than $m_b = -20 $ is found to be smallerthan about -0.8 by all our void finding algorithms.

1405.5540	the imprint of reionization on the star formation histories of dwarf  galaxies	we explore the impact of cosmic reionization on nearby isolated dwarfgalaxies using a compilation of sfhs estimated from deep hst data and acosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the local group. the nearby dwarfsshow a wide diversity of star formation histories; from ancient systems thathave largely completed their star formation $\sim 10$ gyr ago to young dwarfsthat have formed the majority of their stars in the past $\sim 5$ gyr totwo-component systems characterized by the overlap of comparable numbers of oldand young stars. taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips tolower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4&lt;t$/gyr $&lt;8$), a feature thatwe trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. reionizationheats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low masshalos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that correspondsto a virial temperature of $\sim 2 \times 10^4 $ $\mathrm{k}$ at $z_{\rmreion}$.  the loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity ofearly-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early starformation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single oldstellar component prevails. in halos below the threshold at $z_{\rm reion}$,reionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lastsuntil the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cooland form stars. young stellar components therefore dominate in dwarfs whosehalos assemble late and thus form few stars before reionization. two-componentsystems may be traced to late mergers of individual examples of the twoaforementioned cases. the relative dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearbydwarfs might thus be the clearest signature yet identified of the imprint ofcosmic reionization on the star formation history of dwarf galaxies.

1407.0394	the universal nature of subhalo accretion	we examine the angular infall pattern of subhaloes onto host haloes in thecontext of the large-scale structure. we find that this infall pattern isessentially driven by the shear tensor of the ambient velocity field. darkmatter subhaloes are found to be preferentially accreted along the principalaxis of the shear tensor which corresponds to the direction of weakestcollapse. we examine the dependence of this preferential infall on subhalomass, host halo mass and redshift. although strongest for the most massivehosts and the most massive subhaloes at high redshift, the preferential infallof subhaloes is effectively universal in the sense that its always aligned withthe axis of weakest collapse of the velocity shear tensor. it is the same sheartensor that dictates the structure of the cosmic web and hence the shear fieldemerges as the key factor that governs the local anisotropic pattern ofstructure formation. since the small (sub-mpc) scale is strongly correlatedwith the mid-range (~10 mpc) scale - a scale accessible by current surveys ofpeculiar velocities - it follows that findings presented here open a new windowinto the relation between the observed large scale structure unveiled bycurrent surveys of peculiar velocities and the preferential infall direction ofthe local group. this may shed light on the unexpected alignments of dwarfgalaxies seen in the local group

0803.4343	the art of cosmological simulations	we describe the basic ideas of mpi parallelization of the n-body adaptiverefinement tree (art) code. the code uses self-adaptive domain decompositionwhere boundaries of the domains (parallelepipeds) constantly move -- with manydegrees of freedom -- in the search of the minimum of cpu time. the actual cputime spent by each mpi task on previous time-step is used to adjust boundariesfor the next time-step. for a typical decomposition of 5^3 domains, the numberof possible changes in boundaries is 3^{84}. we describe two algorithms offinding minimum of cpu time for configurations with a large number of domains.each mpi task in our code solves the n-body problem where the large-scaledistribution of matter outside of the boundaries of a domain is represented byrelatively few temporary large particles created by other domains. at thebeginning of a zero-level time-step, domains create and exchange largeparticles. then each domain advances all its particles for many smalltime-steps. at the end of the large step, the domains decide where to place newboundaries and re-distribute particles. the scheme requires littlecommunications between processors and is very efficient for large cosmologicalsimulations.

1501.03083	the effect of environment on milky way-mass galaxies in a constrained  simulation of the local group	in this letter we present, for the first time, a study of star formationrate, gas fraction and galaxy morphology of a constrained simulation of themilky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) galaxies, compared to other mw-massgalaxies. by combining with unconstrained simulations we cover a sufficientvolume to compare these galaxies environmental densities ranging from the fieldto that of the local group (lg). this is particularly relevant as it has beenshown that, quite generally, galaxy properties depend intimately upon theirenvironment, most prominently when galaxies in clusters are compared to thosein the field. for galaxies in loose groups such as the lg, however,environmental effects have been less clear. we consider the galaxy'senvironmental density in spheres of 1200 kpc (comoving) and find that whilstenvironment does not appear to directly affect morphology, there is a positivetrend with star formation rates. this enhancement in star formation occurssystematically for galaxies in higher density environments, regardless whetherthey are part of the lg or in filaments. our simulations suggest that thericher environment at mpc-scales may help replenish the star-forming gas,allowing higher specific star formation rates in galaxies such as the mw.

1503.00723	the milky way and andromeda galaxies in a constrained hydrodynamical  simulation: morphological evolution	we study the two main constituent galaxies of a constrained simulation of thelocal group as candidates for the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31). we focuson the formation of the stellar discs and its relation to the formation of thegroup as a rich system with two massive galaxies, and investigate the effectsof mergers and accretion as drivers of morphological transformations. we use astate-of-the-art hydrodynamical code which includes star formation, feedbackand chemical enrichment to carry out our study. we run two simulations, wherewe include or neglect the effects of radiation pressure from stars, toinvestigate the impact of this process on the morphologies and star formationrates of the simulated galaxies. we find that the simulated m31 and mw havedifferent formation histories, even though both inhabit, at z=0, the sameenvironment. these differences directly translate into and explain variationsin their star formation rates, in-situ fractions and final morphologies. them31 candidate has an active merger history, as a result of which its stellardisc is unable to survive unaffected until the present time. in contrast, themw candidate has a smoother history with no major mergers at late times, andforms a disc that grows steadily; at z=0 the simulated mw has an extended,rotationally-supported disc which is dominant over the bulge. our two feedbackimplementations predict similar evolution of the galaxies and their discs,although some variations are detected, the most important of which is theformation time of the discs: in the model with weaker/stronger feedback thediscs form earlier/later. in summary, by comparing the formation histories ofthe two galaxies, we conclude that the particular merger/accretion history of agalaxy rather than its environment at the lg-scales is the main driver of theformation and subsequent growth or destruction of galaxy discs.

1503.05915	planes of satellite galaxies and the cosmic web	recent observational studies have demonstrated that the majority of satellitegalaxies tend to orbit their hosts on highly flattened, vast, possiblyco-rotating planes. two nearly parallel planes of satellites have beenconfirmed around the m31 galaxy and around the centaurus a galaxy, while themilky way also sports a plane of satellites. it has been argued that such analignment of satellites on vast planes is unexpected in the standard({\lambda}cdm) model of cosmology if not even in contradiction to its genericpredictions. guided by {\lambda}cdm numerical simulations, which suggest thatsatellites are channeled towards hosts along the axis of the slowest collapseas dictated by the ambient velocity shear tensor, we re-examine the planes oflocal satellites systems within the framework of the local shear tensor derivedfrom the cosmicflows-2 dataset. the analysis reveals that the local group andcentaurus a reside in a filament stretched by the virgo cluster and compressedby the expansion of the local void. four out of five thin planes of satellitegalaxies are indeed closely aligned with the axis of compression induced by thelocal void. being the less massive system, the moderate misalignment of themilky way's satellite plane can likely be ascribed to its greatersusceptibility to tidal torques, as suggested by numerical simulations. thealignment of satellite systems in the local universe with the ambient shearfield is thus in general agreement with predictions of the {\lambda}cdm model.

1505.07861	redshift-space clustering of sdss galaxies --- luminosity dependence,  halo occupation distribution, and velocity bias	we present the measurements and modelling of the small-to-intermediate scale(0.1--25 mpc/h) projected and three-dimensional (3d) redshift-space two-pointcorrelation functions (2pcfs) of local galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release 7. we find a clear dependence of galaxy clustering onluminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger formore luminous samples. the measurements are successfully interpreted within thehalo occupation distribution (hod) framework with central and satellitevelocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and tomodel redshift-space distortion (rsd) effects. in agreement with previousstudies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes.including the redshift-space 2pcfs helps tighten the hod constraints. moreover,we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres,with the velocity dispersion about 30% that of the dark matter. such a relativemotion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find thatcentral galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect totheir host haloes. the motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples isconsistent with their following that of the dark matter. for faint samples,satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloesabout 85% that of the dark matter. we discuss possible applications of thevelocity bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. in theappendix, we characterize the distribution of galaxy redshift measurementerrors, which is well described by a gaussian-convolved double exponentialdistribution.

1510.04900	cosmicflows constrained local universe simulations	this paper combines observational datasets and cosmological simulations togenerate realistic numerical replicas of the nearby universe. these latter areexcellent laboratories for studies of the non-linear process of structureformation in our neighborhood. with measurements of radial peculiar velocitiesin the local universe (cosmicflows-2) and a newly developed technique, weproduce constrained local universe simulations (clues). to assess the qualityof these constrained simulations, we compare them with random simulations aswell as with local observations. the cosmic variance, defined as the meanone-sigma scatter of cell-to-cell comparison between two fields, issignificantly smaller for the constrained simulations than for the randomsimulations. within the inner part of the box where most of the constraintsare, the scatter is smaller by a factor 2 to 3 on a 5 mpc/h scale with respectto that found for random simulations. this one-sigma scatter obtained whencomparing the simulated and the observation-reconstructed velocity fields isonly 104 +/- 4 km/s i.e. the linear theory threshold. these two resultsdemonstrate that these simulations are in agreement with each other and withthe observations of our neighborhood. for the first time, simulationsconstrained with observational radial peculiar velocities resemble the localuniverse up to a distance of 150 mpc/h on a scale of a few tens of megaparsecs.when focusing on the inner part of the box, the resemblance with our cosmicneighborhood extends to a few megaparsecs (&lt; 5 mpc/h). the simulations providea proper large scale environment for studies of the formation of nearbyobjects.

1511.00011	cosmic dawn (coda): the first radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of  reionization and galaxy formation in the local universe	cosmic reionization by starlight from early galaxies affected theirevolution, thereby impacting reionization, itself. star formation suppression,for example, may explain the observed underabundance of local group dwarfsrelative to n-body predictions for cold dark matter. reionization modellingrequires simulating volumes large enough ~(100 mpc)^3 to sample reionization"patchiness", while resolving millions of galaxy sources above ~10^8 msun,combining gravitational and gas dynamics with radiative transfer. modelling thelocal group requires initial cosmological density fluctuations pre-selected toform the well-known structures of the local universe today. cosmic dawn("coda") is the first such fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation ofreionization of the local universe. our new hybrid cpu-gpu code,ramses-cudaton, performs hundreds of radiative transfer and ionizationrate-solver timesteps on the gpus for each hydro-gravity timestep on the cpus.coda simulated (91 mpc)^3 with 4096^3 particles and cells, to redshift 4.23, onornl supercomputer titan, utilizing 8192 cores and 8192 gpus. globalreionization ended slightly later than observed. however, a simple temporalrescaling which brings the evolution of ionized fraction into agreement withobservations also reconciles ionizing flux density, cosmic star formationhistory, cmb electron scattering optical depth and galaxy uv luminosityfunction with their observed values. haloes below ~3 x 10^9 msun were severelyaffected by the rising uv background: photoionization heating suppressed theirstar formation. for most of reionization, star formation was dominated byhaloes between 10^10 - 10^11msun. intergalactic filaments display sheathedstructures, with hot envelopes surrounding cooler cores, but do notself-shield, unlike regions denser than 100 rho_average.

1511.06188	mergers and the outside-in formation of dwarf spheroidals	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group toexplore the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidalgalaxies. we find that a number of simulated dwarfs form "outside-in", with anold, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentratedmetal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like sculptor orsextans. we focus on a few examples where stars form in two populationsdistinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. thespatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; theold stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young populationforms largely in situ. the older component results from a first episode of starformation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects ofstellar feedback and reionization. the younger component forms when a lateaccretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. the effect of mergers isto disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasingtheir central density relative to the young population. we argue thatdwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systemswith multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of ageand metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.

astro-ph;0107104	constrained simulations of the real universe: the local supercluster	we present cosmological simulations which closely mimic the real universewithin 100mpc of the local group. the simulations, called constrainedsimulations, reproduce the large-scale density field with major nearbystructures, including the local group, the coma and virgo clusters, the greatattractor, the perseus-pices, and the local supercluster, in approximatelycorrect locations. the mark iii survey of peculiar velocities of the observedstructures inside 80mpc/h sphere is used to constrain the initial conditions.fourier modes on scales larger then 5mpc/h are dominated by the constraints,while small scale waves are random. the main aim of this paper is the structureof the local supercluster (lsc; 30mpc/h around the virgo cluster) and the localgroup environment. we find that at the current epoch most of the mass(7.5e14msun/h) of the lsc is located in a filament roughly centered on thevirgo cluster and extending over 40mpc/h. the simulated local group (lg) islocated in an adjacent smaller filament, which is not a part of the main bodyof the lsc, and has a peculiar velocity of 250kms toward the virgo cluster. thepeculiar velocity field in the lsc region is complicated and is drasticallydifferent from the field assumed in the virgocentric infall models. thepeculiar velocity flow in the vicinity of the lg in the simulation is ``cold'':the peculiar line-of-sight velocity dispersion within 7mpc/h of the lg is lessthan 60km/s, comparable to the observed velocity dispersion of nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;0203148	spatial distribution of galactic halos and their merger histories	we use a novel statistical tool, the mark correlation functions (mcfs), tostudy clustering of galaxy-size halos as a function of their properties andenvironment in a high-resolution numerical simulation of the lambdacdmcosmology. we applied mcfs using several types of continuous and discretemarks: maximum circular velocity of halos, merger mark indicating whether halosexperienced or not a major merger in their evolution history, and a strippingmark indicating whether the halo underwent a tidal stripping. we find thathalos which experienced a relatively early (z&gt;1) major merger or mass loss (dueto tidal stripping) in their evolution histories are over-abundant in halopairs with separations &lt; 3 mpc/h. this result can be interpreted as spatialsegregation of halos with different merger histories, qualitatively similar tothe morphological segregation in the observed galaxy distribution. the analysispresented in this paper demonstrate that mcfs provide powerful, yetalgorithmically simple, quantitative measures of segregation in the spatialdistribution of objects with respect to their various properties (marks).

astro-ph;0209029	correlations in the orientations of galaxy clusters	the relative orientation of clusters' major elongation axes and clusters'angular momentum is studied using a large n-body simulation in a box of 500mpc/h base length for a standard lambdacdm model. employing the technique ofmark correlation functions, we successfully separated the correlations in theorientation from the well known clustering signal traced by the two-pointcorrelation function. the correlations in the orientation are highlysignificant for our sample of 3000 clusters. we found an alignment ofneighboring clusters, i.e. an enhanced probability of the major elongation axesof neighboring cluster pairs to be in parallel with each other. at 10 mpc/hseparation the amplitude of this signal is ~10% above the value expected fromrandom orientations, and it vanishes on scales larger than 15 mpc/h. the``filamentary'' alignment between clusters' major elongation axes and the linespointing towards neighboring clusters shows even stronger deviations fromrandom orientation, which can be detected out to scales of 100 mpc/h, both in2d and 3d analyses. similarly, strong correlations of the angular momentum wereseen. also a clear signal in the scalar correlation of the absolute value ofthe angular momentum, the spin parameter and the mass was found. they extend upto 50 mpc/h and have an amplitude of 40%, 15%, and 10% above a randomdistribution at 10 mpc/h separation, respectively.

astro-ph;0305393	the structure of voids	using high resolution n-body simulations we address the problem of emptinessof giant 20 mpc/h diameter voids found in the distribution of bright galaxies.are the voids filled by dwarf galaxies? do cosmological models predict too manysmall dark matter haloes inside the voids? can the problems of cosmologicalmodels on small scales be addressed by studying the abundance of dwarf galaxiesinside voids? we find that voids in the distribution of 10^12 msun/h haloes(expected galactic magnitudes ~ m_*) are almost the same as the voids in 10^11msun/h haloes. yet, much smaller haloes with masses 10^9 msun/h and circularvelocities v_circ about 20 km/s readily fill the voids: there should be almost1000 of these haloes in a 20 mpc/h void. a typical void of diameter 20 mpc/hcontains about 50 haloes with v_circ &gt; 50 km/s. the haloes are arranged in apattern, which looks like a miniature universe: it has the same structuralelements as the large-scale structure of the galactic distribution of theuniverse. there are filaments and voids; larger haloes are at the intersectionsof filaments. the only difference is that all masses are four orders ofmagnitude smaller. there is severe (anti)bias in the distribution of haloes,which depends on halo mass and on the distance from the centre of the void.large haloes are more antibiased and have a tendency to form close to voidboundaries. the mass function of haloes in voids is different from the``normal'' mass function. it is much steeper for high masses resulting in veryfew m33-type galaxies (v_circ about 100 km/s). we present an analyticalapproximation for the mass function of haloes in voids.

astro-ph;0308519	the dark side of the halo occupation distribution	we analyze the halo occupation distribution (hod), the probability for a haloof mass m to host a number of subhalos n, and two-point correlation function ofgalaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulationsof the concordance flat lcdm model. the halo samples include both the hosthalos and the subhalos, distinct gravitationally-bound halos within thevirialized regions of larger host systems. we find that the first moment of thehod, &lt;n&gt;(m), has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and apower law high-mass tail. the hod can be described by a poisson statistics athigh halo masses but becomes sub-poisson for &lt;n&gt;&lt;4. we show that the hod can beunderstood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass m to host acentral galaxy and the probability to host a given number ns of satellitegalaxies. the former can be approximated by a step-like function, while thelatter can be well approximated by a poisson distribution, fully specified byits first moment &lt;ns&gt;(m). we find that &lt;ns&gt;~m^b with b~1 for a wide range ofnumber densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. thisformulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupationdistribution found in simulations. at z=0, the two-point correlation function(cf) of galactic halos can be well fit by a power law down to ~100/h kpc withan amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. at redshiftsz&gt;~1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the cf atsmall scales. if the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, theassumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses ofhigh-redshift clustering is likely to bias the estimates of the correlationlength and slope of the correlation function.

astro-ph;0311062	density profiles of lcdm clusters	we analyze the mass accretion histories (mahs) and density profiles ofcluster- size halos with virial masses of 0.6-2.5x10^14/h msun in a flat lcdmcosmology. in agreement with previous studies,we find that the concentration ofthe density distribution is tightly correlated with the halo's mah and itsformation redshift.during the period of fast mass growth the concentrationremains approximately constant and low c_v ~ 3-4,while during the slowaccretion stages it increases with decreasing redshift as c_v ~ (1+z)^-1.weconsider fits of three widely discussed analytic density profiles to thesimulated clusters focusing on the most relaxed inner regions.we find thatthere is no unique best fit analytic profile for all the systems.if,however,acluster is best fit by a particular analytic profile at z=0,the same is usuallytrue at earlier epochs out to z ~ 1-2.the local logarithmic slope of thedensity profiles at 3% of the virial radius ranges from -1.2 to -2.0,aremarkable diversity for the relatively narrow mass range of our clustersample.for all the studied clusters the logarithmic slope becomes shallowerwith decreasing radius without reaching an asymptotic value down to thesmallest resolved scale &lt; ~1% of the virial radius.we do not find a clearcorrelation of the inner slope with the formation redshift or the shape of thehalo's mah.we do find, however,that during the period of rapid mass growth thedensity profiles can be well described by a single power law rho(r) ~ r^-gammawith gamma ~ 1.5-2.the relatively shallow power law slopes result in lowconcentrations at these stages of evolution.this indicates that the inner powerlaw like density distribution of halos is built up during the periods of rapidmass accretion and active merging,while outer steeper profile is formed whenthe mass accretion is slow.

astro-ph;0408488	supersonic motions of galaxies in clusters	we study motions of galaxies in galaxy clusters formed in the concordancelcdm cosmology. we use high-resolution cosmological simulations that followdynamics of dark matter and gas and include various physical processes criticalfor galaxy formation: gas cooling, heating and star formation. analysingmotions of galaxies and the properties of intracluster gas in the sample ofeight simulated clusters at z=0, we study velocity dispersion profiles of thedark matter, gas, and galaxies. we measure the mean velocity of galaxy motionsand gas sound speed as a function of radius and calculate the average machnumber of galaxy motions. the simulations show that galaxies, on average, movesupersonically with the average mach number of ~1.4, approximately independentof the cluster-centric radius. the supersonic motions of galaxies maypotentially provide an important source of heating for the intracluster gas bydriving weak shocks and via dynamical friction, although these heatingprocesses appear to be inefficient in our simulations. we also find thatgalaxies move faster than the dark matter particles in clusters. the magnitudeof the velocity bias, b_v~1.1, is, however, smaller than the bias estimated forsubhalos in dissipationless simulations. interestingly, we find velocity biasin the tangential component of the velocity dispersion, but not in the radialcomponent. finally, we find significant random bulk motions of gas. the typicalgas velocities are of order ~20-30% of the gas sound speed. these randommotions provide about 10% of the total pressure support in our simulatedclusters. the non-thermal pressure support, if neglected, will biasmeasurements of the total mass in the hydrostatic analyses of the x-ray clusterobservations.

astro-ph;0501304	dwarf galaxies in voids: suppressing star formation with photo-heating	we study structure formation in cosmological void regions usinghigh-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. despite being significantlyunderdense, voids are populated abundantly with small dark matter halos whichshould appear as dwarf galaxies if their star formation is not suppressedsignificantly. we here investigate to which extent the cosmologicaluv-background photo-evaporates baryons out of halos of dwarf galaxies, andthereby limits their cooling and star formation rates. assuming a haardt &amp;madau uv-background with reionisation at redshift z=6, our samples of simulatedgalaxies show that halos with masses below a characteristic mass of m_c(z=0) =6.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} m_sun are baryon-poor, but in general not completely empty,because baryons that are in the condensed cold phase or are already locked upin stars resist evaporation. in halos with mass m &lt; m_c, we find thatphoto-heating suppresses further cooling of gas. the redshift and uv-backgrounddependent characteristic mass m_c(z) can be understood from the equilibriumtemperature between heating and cooling at a characteristic overdensity of\delta ~ 1000. if a halo is massive enough to compress gas to this densitydespite the presence of the uv background, gas is free to `enter' the condensedphase and cooling continues in the halo, otherwise it stalls. by analysing themass accretion histories of dwarf galaxies in voids, we show that they canbuild up a significant amount of condensed mass at early times before the epochof reionisation. later on, the amount of mass in this phase remains roughlyconstant, but the masses of the dark matter halos continue to increase.(abridged)

astro-ph;0501452	imprints of mass accretion on properties of galaxy clusters	a large scale sph+n-body simulation (gadget) of the concordance lcdm universeis used to investigate orientation and angular momentum of galaxy clusters atz=0 in connection with their recent accretion histories. the basic clustersample comprises the 3000 most massive friends-of-friends halos found in the500 mpc/h simulation box. two disjoint sub-samples are constructed, using themass ratio of the two most massive progenitors at z=0.5 m_2 / m_1 (m_1 &lt; m_2),namely a recent major merger sample and a steady accretion mode sample. themass of clusters in the merger sample is on average ~43% larger than the massof the two progenitors (m_1 + m_2), whereas in the steady accretion mode samplea smaller increase of ~25% is found. the separation vector connecting the twomost massive progenitor halos at z=0.5 is strongly correlated with theorientation of the cluster at z=0. the angular momentum of the clusters in therecent major merger sample tends to be parallel to orbital angular momentum ofthe two progenitors, whereas the angular momentum of the steady accretion modesample is mainly determined by the angular momentum of the most massiveprogenitor. the long range correlations for the major and the minor principalaxes of cluster pairs extend to distances of ~100 mpc/h. weak angular momentumcorrelations are found for distances &lt; 20 mpc/h. within these ranges the majoraxes tend to be aligned with the connecting line of the cluster pairs whereasminor axes and angular momenta tend to be perpendicular to this line. aseparate analysis of the two sub-samples reveals that the long rangecorrelations are independent of the mass accretion mode. thus orientation andangular momentum of galaxy clusters is mainly determined by the accretion alongthe filaments independently of the particular accretion mode.

astro-ph;0503391	radial velocity moments of dark matter haloes	using cosmological n-body simulations we study the radial velocitydistribution in dark matter haloes focusing on the lowest-order even moments,dispersion and kurtosis. we determine the properties of ten massive haloes inthe simulation box approximating their density distribution by the nfw formulacharacterized by the virial mass and concentration. we also calculate thevelocity anisotropy parameter of the haloes and find it mildly radial andincreasing with distance from the halo centre. the radial velocity dispersionof the haloes shows a characteristic profile with a maximum, while the radialkurtosis profile decreases with distance starting from a value close togaussian near the centre. we therefore confirm that dark matter haloes possessintrinsically non-gaussian, flat-topped velocity distributions. we find thatthe radial velocity moments of the simulated haloes are quite well reproducedby the solutions of the jeans equations obtained for the halo parameters withthe anisotropy measured in the simulations. we also study the radial velocitymoments for a composite cluster made of ten haloes out to ten virial radii. inthis region the velocity dispersion decreases systematically to reach the valueof the background, while kurtosis increases from below to above the gaussianvalue of 3 signifying a transition from a flat-topped to a strongly peakedvelocity distribution with respect to the gaussian, which can be interpreted asthe dominance of ordered flow with a small dispersion. we illustrate thetransition by showing explicitly the velocity distribution of the compositecluster in a few radial bins.

astro-ph;0507508	the complex velocity distribution of galaxies in abell 1689:  implications for mass modelling	the abell 1689 galaxy cluster has recently become a subject of intensivestudy. thanks to its intermediate redshift (z=0.183) its mass distribution canbe reconstructed using numerous methods including gravitational lensing, galaxykinematics and x-ray imaging. the methods used to yield conflicting massestimates in the past and recently the cluster mass distribution has beenclaimed to be in conflict with standard cdm scenarios due to rather largeconcentration and steep mass profile obtained from detailed studies ofbroadhurst et al. using lensing. by studying in detail the kinematics of about200 galaxies with measured redshifts in the vicinity of the cluster we showthat the cluster is probably surrounded by a few structures, quite distant fromeach other, but aligned along the line of sight. we support our arguments byreferring to cosmological n-body simulations and showing explicitly thatdistant, non-interacting haloes can produce entangled multi-peak line-of-sightvelocity distributions similar to that in a1689. we conclude that it isdifficult to estimate the cluster mass reliably from galaxy kinematics, but thevalue we obtain after applying a simple cut-off in velocity agrees roughly withthe mass estimated from lensing. the complicated mass distribution around thecluster may however increase the uncertainty in the determination of thedensity profile shape obtained with weak lensing.

astro-ph;0511723	mass distribution in nearby abell clusters	we study the mass distribution in six nearby (z&lt;0.06) relaxed abell clustersof galaxies a0262, a0496, a1060, a2199, a3158 and a3558. given the dominance ofdark matter in galaxy clusters we approximate their total density distributionby the nfw formula characterized by virial mass and concentration. we alsoassume that the anisotropy of galactic orbits is reasonably well described by aconstant and that galaxy distribution traces that of the total density. usingthe velocity and position data for 120-420 galaxies per cluster we calculate,after removal of interlopers, the profiles of the lowest-order even velocitymoments, dispersion and kurtosis. we then reproduce the velocity moments byjointly fitting the moments to the solutions of the jeans equations. includingthe kurtosis in the analysis allows us to break the degeneracy between the massdistribution and anisotropy and constrain the anisotropy as well as the virialmass and concentration. the method is tested in detail on mock data extractedfrom n-body simulations of dark matter haloes. we find that the best-fittinggalactic orbits are remarkably close to isotropic in most clusters. using thefitted pairs of mass and concentration parameters for the six clusters weconclude that the trend of decreasing concentration for higher masses found incosmological n-body simulations is consistent with the data. by scaling theindividual cluster data by mass we combine them to create a composite clusterwith 1465 galaxies and perform a similar analysis on such sample. the estimatedconcentration parameter then lies in the range 1.5 &lt; c &lt; 14 and the anisotropyparameter in the range -1.1 &lt; \beta &lt; 0.5 at the 95 percent confidence level.

astro-ph;0606579	interloper treatment in dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters	the aim of this paper is to study the efficiency of different approaches tointerloper treatment in dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters. usingcosmological n-body simulation of standard lcdm model, we select 10 massivedark matter haloes and use their particles to emulate mock kinematic data interms of projected galaxy positions and velocities as they would be measured bya distant observer. taking advantage of the full 3d information available fromthe simulation, we select samples of interlopers defined with differentcriteria. the interlopers thus selected provide means to assess the efficiencyof different interloper removal schemes found in the literature. we studydirect methods of interloper removal based on dynamical or statisticalrestrictions imposed on ranges of positions and velocities available to clustermembers. in determining these ranges, we use either the velocity dispersioncriterion or a maximum velocity profile. we also generalize the commonapproaches taking into account both the position and velocity information.another criterion is based on the dependence of the commonly used virial massand projected mass estimators on the presence of interlopers. we find that thedirect methods exclude on average 60-70 percent of unbound particles producinga sample with contamination as low as 2-4 percent. next, we consider indirectmethods of interloper treatment which are applied to the data stacked from manyobjects. in these approaches, interlopers are treated in a statistical way as auniform background which modifies the distribution of cluster members. using abayesian approach, we reproduce the properties of composite clusters andestimate the probability of finding an interloper as a function of distancefrom the object centre.

astro-ph;9708191	galaxies in n-body simulations: overcoming the overmerging problem	we present analysis of the evolution of dark matter halos in denseenvironments of groups and clusters in dissipationless cosmologicalsimulations. the premature destruction of halos in such environments, known asthe overmerging, reduces the predictive power of n-body simulations and makesdifficult any comparison between models and observations. we analyze thepossible processes that cause the overmerging and assess the extent to whichthis problem can be cured with current computer resources and codes. using bothanalytic estimates and high resolution numerical simulations, we argue that theovermerging is mainly due to the lack of numerical resolution. we find that theforce and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in galaxygroups and clusters is extremely high and was almost never reached before: ~1-3kpc and 10^8-10^9 msun, respectively. we use the high-resolution adaptiverefinement tree (art) n-body code to run cosmological simulations with theparticle mass of \approx 2x10^8/h msun} and the spatial resolution of \approx1-2/h kpc, and show that in these simulations the halos do survive in regionsthat would appear overmerged with lower force resolution. nevertheless, thehalo identification in very dense environments remains a challenge even withthe resolution this high. we present two new halo finding algorithms developedto identify both isolated and satellite halos that are stable (existed atprevious moments) and gravitationally bound. to illustrate the use of thesatellite halos that survive the overmerging, we present a series of halostatistics, that can be compared with those of observed galaxies.

astro-ph;9810191	evolution of isolated halos and halos inside of groups and clusters in a  lcdm model	a significant fraction of mass in the universe is believed to be in the formof dark matter (dm). due to gravitational instability, the dm collapseshierarchically into dm halos. in this contribution we present a study of theformation and evolution of such dm halos in a cobe-normalized spatially flatlcdm model (omega_0=1-omega_l=0.3; h=0.7) using high-resolution n-bodysimulations. the novelty of this study is use of the newly developedhalo-finding algorithms to study the evolution of both isolated and satellite(located inside virial radii of larger group- and cluster-size systems) halos.the force and mass resolution required for a simulated halo to survive in thehigh-density environments typical of groups and clusters is high: ~1-3 kpc and\~10^9 m_sun, respectively. we use the high-resolution adaptive refinement tree(art) n-body code to follow the evolution of 256^3 dark matter particles withdynamic range in spatial resolution of 32,000 in a box of 60/h mpc.  we show that the correlation function of these halos is anti-biased withrespect to the dark matter correlation function and is high and steeper thanthe correlation function of the isolated virialized objects. the correlationfunction evolves only mildly between z=3 and z=1. the mass evolution ofisolated virialized objects determined from the simulation is in good agreementwith prediction of semi-analytical models. the differences exist, however, ifwe include satellite halos in the halo catalogs.

astro-ph;9912257	on effects of resolution in dissipationless cosmological simulations	we present a study of numerical effects in dissipationless cosmologicalsimulations. the numerical effects are evaluated and studied by comparingresults of a series of 64^3-particle simulations of varying force resolutionand number of time steps, performed using three different n-body techniques:the particle mesh (pm), the adaptive p3m (ap3m) code, and the adaptiverefinement tree (art) code. this study can therefore be interesting both as ananalysis of numerical effects and as a systematic comparison of differentcodes. we find that the ap3m and the art codes produce similar results, giventhat convergence is reached within the code type. we also find that numericaleffects may affect the high-resolution simulations in ways that have not beendiscussed before. in particular, our study revealed the presence of two-bodyscattering, effects of which can be greatly amplified by inaccuracies of timeintegration. this process appears to affect the correlation function of matter,mass function and inner density of dark matter halos and other statistics atscales much larger than the force resolution, although different statistics maybe affected in different fashion. we discuss the conditions at which strongtwo-body scattering is possible and discuss the choice of the force resolutionand integration time step. furthermore, we discuss recent claims thatsimulations with force softening smaller than the mean interparticle separationare not trustworthy and argue that this claim is incorrect in general andapplies only to the phase-sensitive statistics. our conclusion is that,depending on the choice of mass and force resolution and integration time step,a force resolution as small as 0.01 of the mean interparticle separation can bejustified.
