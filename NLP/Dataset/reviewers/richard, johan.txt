0901.0427	keck spectroscopic survey of strongly lensed galaxies in abell 1703:  further evidence for a relaxed, unimodal cluster	strong gravitational lensing is a unique tool to model with great accuracythe inner mass distribution of massive galaxy clusters. in particular, clusterswith large einstein radii provide a wealth of multiply imaged systems in thecluster core allowing to determine precisely the shape of the central darkmatter profile. this paper presents a spectroscopic survey in the massivecluster abell 1703, displaying a large einstein radius (28" at z=2.8) and ahigh number of strongly-lensed systems including a central ring-likeconfiguration. we used lris on keck to target multiple images and lensed galaxycandidates, and use the measured redshifts to constrain the mass distributionof the cluster using a parametric model. the data enable us to measure accurateredshifts in good agreement with their photometric redshifts, and to update theidentification of multiply imaged systems by discovering 3 new systems and aradial counter image. we also report the discovery of a remarkably bright ~3.6l* i-band dropout at z=5.827 in our mask which is only moderately magnified bythe cluster (~3.0+/-0.08). the improved parametric mass model, including 16multiple systems with 10 spectroscopic redshifts, further constrains thecluster-scale mass distribution with a generalized nfw profile of best-fitlogarithmic slope alpha=0.92+/-0.04, concentration c200=4.72+/-0.40 and scaleradius rs=476+/-45 kpc. our strong-lensing model predicts a large scale shearsignal consistent with subaru weak-lensing measurements out to 4 mpc h^-1.together with the fact that the strong-lensing modeling requires a single darkmatter clump, this suggests that abell 1703 is a relaxed, unimodal cluster.this unique cluster could be probed further using deep x-ray, sz and dynamicsanalysis, for a detailed study of the physics in a relaxed cluster.

0904.1742	detection of pah and far-infrared emission from the cosmic eye: probing  the dust and star formation of lyman break galaxies	we report the results of a spitzer infrared study of the cosmic eye, astrongly lensed, l*_uv lyman break galaxy (lbg) at z=3.074. we obtained spitzerirs spectroscopy as well as mips 24 and 70 micron photometry. the eye isdetected with high significance at both 24 and 70 microns and, when including aflux limit at 3.5 mm, we estimate an infrared luminosity of l_ir = 8.3(+4.7-4.4) x10^11 l_sun assuming a magnification of 28+-3. this l_ir is eighttimes lower than that predicted from the rest-frame uv properties assuming acalzetti reddening law. this has also been observed in other young lbgs, andindicates that the dust reddening law may be steeper in these galaxies. themid-ir spectrum shows strong pah emission at 6.2 and 7.7 microns, withequivalent widths near the maximum values observed in star-forming galaxies atany redshift. the l_pah-to-l_ir ratio lies close to the relation measured inlocal starbursts. therefore, l_pah or l_mir may be used to estimate l_ir andthus, star formation rate, of lbgs, whose fluxes at longer wavelengths aretypically below current confusion limits. we also report the highest redshiftdetection of the 3.3 micron pah emission feature. the pah ratio,l_6.2/l_3.3=5.1+- 2.7, and the pah-to-l_ir ratio, l_3.3/l_ir = 8.5 +- 4.7x10^-4, are both in agreement with measurements in local starbursts and ulirgs,suggesting that this line may serve as a good proxy for l_pah or l_ir at z &gt; 3with the james webb space telescope.

0906.4118	strong lensing as a probe of the mass distribution beyond the einstein  radius. mass &amp; light in sl2s j08544-0121, a galaxy group at z=0.35	precise modelling of strong lensing systems can be affected by external massdistributions, e.g. the group or cluster within which the lens is embedded. inthis article, we propose to turn this limitation to our advantage and to useprecise strong lensing modelling to probe external mass distributionssurrounding the lens. we consider sl2s j08544-0121, a galaxy group at z=0.35that contains a strong lensing system. a simple elliptical isothermal potentialcannot reproduce satisfactorily the strong lensing constraints. we include anexternal mass perturbation corresponding to the group within which the lens isembedded. the lensing properties of this perturbation are parametrised by itstotal mass m and a smoothing scale s that quantifies the characteristic scaleover which m is distributed. for a range of these parameters, we are able toreproduce accurately the observations. this suggests that light is a goodtracer of mass. interestingly, this also shows that a localised strong lensinganalysis (on scales of ~10") allows us to constrain global properties of thegroup as a whole (on scales of ~100). indeed, we constrain the groupmass-to-light ratio to be m/l=98+-27 (i band, solar units, not corrected forevolution) and s=20" +- 9 (2sigma confidence level). we demonstrate that thesestrong lensing only constraints are due to the perturbed strong lensingconfiguration, where the main arc is located at ~5" from the galaxy, whereasits counter-image is found at ~8". to test independently our resulting stronglensing model, we pursue an independent weak lensing analysis of the group andfind a mass-to-light ratio in the range 66-146 (1sigma confidence level).

0907.1687	locuss: a comparison of sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and gravitational  lensing measurements of galaxy clusters	we present the first measurement of the relationship between thesunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal and the mass of galaxy clusters that usesgravitational lensing to measure cluster mass, based on 14 x-ray luminousclusters at z~0.2 from the local cluster substructure survey. we measure theintegrated compton y-parameter, y, and total projected mass of the clusters(m_gl) within a projected clustercentric radius of 350 kpc, corresponding tomean overdensities of 4000-8000 relative to the critical density. we findself-similar scaling between m_gl and y, with a scatter in mass at fixed y of32%. this scatter exceeds that predicted from numerical cluster simulations,however, it is smaller than comparable measurements of the scatter in mass atfixed t_x. we also find no evidence of segregation in y between disturbed andundisturbed clusters, as had been seen with t_x on the same physical scales. wecompare our scaling relation to the bonamente et al. relation based on massmeasurements that assume hydrostatic equilibrium, finding no evidence for ahydrostatic mass bias in cluster cores (m_gl = 0.98+/-0.13 m_hse), consistentwith both predictions from numerical simulations and lensing/x-ray-basedmeasurements of mass-observable scaling relations at larger radii. overall ourresults suggest that the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect may be less sensitive thanx-ray observations to the details of cluster physics in cluster cores.

0909.0111	a spatially resolved map of the kinematics, star-formation and stellar  mass assembly in a star-forming galaxy at z=4.9	we present a detailed study of the spatially resolved kinematics,star-formation and stellar mass in a highly amplified galaxy at z=4.92 behindthe lensing cluster ms1358+62. we use the observed optical, near- andmid-infrared imaging from hst acs &amp; nicmos and spitzer irac to derive thestellar mass and the gemini/nifs ifu to investigate the velocity structure ofthe galaxy from the nebular [oii] emission. using a detailed gravitational lensmodel, we account for lensing amplification factor 12.+/-2.0 and find that thisintrinsically l* galaxy has a stellar mass of m*=7+/-2x10^8mo, a dynamical massof mdyn=3+/-1x10^9csc^2(i)mo (within of 2kpc) and a star-formation rate of42+/-8mo/yr. the source-plane uv/optical morphology of this galaxy is dominatedby five discrete star-forming regions. exploiting the dynamical information wederive masses for individual star-forming regions of mcl~10^(8-9)mo with sizesof ~200pc. we find that, at a fixed size, the star-formation rate densitywithin these hii regions is approximately two orders of magnitude greater thanthose observed in local spiral/starburst galaxies, but consistent with the mostmassive hii regions in the local universe such as 30dor. finally, we comparethe spatially resolved nebular emission line velocity with the ly-alpha anduv-ism lines and find that this galaxy is surrounded by a galactic scaleoutflow in which the ly-alpha appears redshifted by ~150km/s and the uv-ismlines blue-shifted by -200km/s from the (systemic) nebular emission. thevelocity structure of the outflow mirrors that of the nebular emissionsuggesting the outflow is young (~15myr), and has yet to burst out of thesystem. taken together, these results suggest that this young galaxy isundergoing its first major epoch of mass assembly.

0910.4488	resolved spectroscopy of gravitationally-lensed galaxies: recovering  coherent velocity fields in sub-luminous z~2-3 galaxies	we present spatially-resolved dynamics for six strongly lensed star-forminggalaxies at z=1.7-3.1, each enlarged by a linear magnification factor ~8. usingthe keck laser guide star ao system and the osiris integral field unitspectrograph we resolve kinematic and morphological detail in our sample withan unprecedented fidelity, in some cases achieving spatial resolutions of ~100pc. with one exception our sources have diameters ranging from 1-7 kpc, starformation rates of 2-40 msun/yr (uncorrected for extinction) and dynamicalmasses of 10^(9.7-10.3) msun. with this exquisite resolution we find that fourof the six galaxies display coherent velocity fields consistent with a simplerotating disk model, which can only be recovered with the considerably improvedspatial resolution and sampling from the combination of adaptive optics andstrong gravitational lensing. our model fits imply ratios for the systemic torandom motion, v sin(i)/sigma, ranging from 0.5-1.3 and toomre disk parametersq&lt;1. the large fraction of well-ordered velocity fields in our sample isconsistent with data analyzed for larger, more luminous sources at thisredshift. our high resolution data further reveal that all six galaxies containmultiple giant star-forming hii regions whose resolved diameters are in therange 300 pc - 1.0 kpc, consistent with the jeans length expected in the caseof dispersion support. the density of star formation in these regions is ~100times higher than observed in local spirals; such high values are only seen inthe most luminous local starbursts. the global dynamics and demographics ofstar formation in these hii regions suggest that vigorous star formation isprimarily governed by gravitational instability in primitive rotating disks.

0910.5553	abell 370 revisited: refurbished hubble imaging of the first strong  lensing cluster	we present a strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster abell 370(z=0.375) based on the recent multicolor acs images obtained as part of theearly release observation (ero) that followed the hubble service mission #4.back in 1987, the giant gravitational arc (z=0.725) in abell 370 was one of thefirst pieces of evidence that massive clusters are dense enough to act asstrong gravitational lenses. the new observations reveal in detail its disklikemorphology, and we show that it can be interpreted as a complex five-imageconfiguration, with a total magnification factor of 32+/-4. moreover, the highresolution multicolor information allowed us to identify 10 multiply imagedbackground galaxies. we derive a mean einstein radius of re=39+/-2" for asource redshift at z=2, corresponding to a mass of m(&lt;re) = 2.82+/-0.15 1e14msol and m(&lt;250 kpc)=3.8+/-0.2 1e14 msol, in good agreement with subaruweak-lensing measurements. the typical mass model error is smaller than 5%, afactor 3 of improvement compared to the previous lensing analysis. abell 370mass distribution is confirmed to be bi-modal with very small offset betweenthe dark matter, the x-ray gas and the stellar mass. combining this informationwith the velocity distribution reveals that abell 370 is likely the merging oftwo equally massive clusters along the line of sight, explaining the very highmass density necessary to efficiently produce strong lensing. these newobservations stress the importance of multicolor imaging for the identificationof multiple images which is key to determining an accurate mass model. the verylarge einstein radius makes abell 370 one of the best clusters to search forhigh redshift galaxies through strong magnification in the central region.

0912.1591	gas, dust and stars in the scuba galaxy, smm j02399-0136: the evla  reveals a colossal galactic nursery	we present new multi-wavelength observations of the first submm-selectedgalaxy, smm j02399-0136 at z=2.8. these observations include mapping of the coj=1-0 emission using elements of the expanded vla, as well as high-resolution1.4-ghz imaging and optical/ir data from the vla, hst, spitzer and keck.together these new data provide fundamental insights into the mass anddistribution of stars, gas and dust within this archetypal smg. the co j=1-0emission, with its minimal excitation and density requirements, traces the bulkof the metal-rich molecular gas, and reveals a mass of ~10^11 m(sun), extendingover ~5" (~25 kpc in the source plane), although there is tentative evidencethat it may be significantly larger. our data suggest that three or moredistinct structures are encompassed by this molecular gas reservoir, includingthe bal quasar from which the redshift of the smg was initially determined. inparticular, the new rest-frame near-ir observations identify a massive,obscured, starburst coincident with a previously known ly-alpha cloud. thisstarburst dominates the far-ir emission from the system and requires are-assessment of previous claims that the gas reservoir resides in a massive,extended disk around the bal qso. instead it appears that smm j02399-0136comprises a merger between a far-ir-luminous, but highly obscured starburst,the bal qso host and a faint third component. our findings suggest that thissmg and its immediate environment mark a vast and complex galactic nursery andthat detailed studies of other smgs are likely to uncover a similarly richdiversity of properties.

1001.1739	the dark matter of gravitational lensing	we review progress in understanding dark matter by astrophysics, andparticularly via the effect of gravitational lensing. evidence from manydifferent directions now all imply that five sixths of the material content ofthe universe is in this mysterious form, separate from and beyond the ordinary"baryonic" particles in the standard model of particle physics. dark matterappears not to interact via the electromagnetic force, and therefore neitheremits nor reflects light. however, it definitely does interact via gravity, andhas played the most important role in shaping the universe on large scales. themost successful technique with which to investigate it has so far been theeffect of gravitational lensing. the curvature of space-time near anygravitating mass (including dark matter) deflects passing rays of light -observably shifting, distorting and magnifying the images of backgroundgalaxies. measurements of such effects currently provide constraints on themean density of dark matter, and its density relative to baryonic matter; thesize and mass of individual dark matter particles; and its cross section undervarious fundamental forces.

1003.3674	intense star formation within resolved compact regions in a galaxy at  z=2.3	massive galaxies in the early universe have been shown to be forming stars atsurprisingly high rates. prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies whichare luminous when observed at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which maybe forming stars at rates upto 1,000mo/yr. these intense bursts of starformation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies.however, probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within thesegalaxies is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largesttelescopes at present. here, we report observations of the sub-mm galaxysmmj2135-0102 at redshift z=2.3259 which has been gravitationally magnified bya factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. this cosmicmagnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging, resolves thestar-forming regions at a linear scale of just ~100 parsecs. we find that theluminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the densecores of giant molecular clouds in the local universe, but they are ~100xlarger and 10^7 times more luminous. although vigorously star-forming, theunderlying physics of the star formation processes at z~2 appears to be similarto that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anythingfound in the present-day universe.

1102.5092	discovery of a possibly old galaxy at $z=6.027$, multiply imaged by the  massive cluster abell 383	we report the discovery of a unique $z=6.027$ galaxy, multiply imaged by thecluster abell 383 and detected in new hubble space telescope acs and wfc3imaging, as well as in warm spitzer observations. this galaxy was selected as apair of i-dropouts; its suspected high redshift was confirmed by themeasurement of a strong lyman-alpha line in both images using keck/deimos.combining hubble and spitzer photometry after correcting for contamination byline emission (estimated to be a small effect), we identify a strong balmerbreak of 1.5 magnitudes. taking into account the magnification factor of11.4+/-1.9 (2.65+/-0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the unlensed ab magnitudefor the source is 27.2+/-0.05 in the h band, corresponding to a 0.4 l* galaxy,and 25.7+/-0.08 at 3.6 um. the uv slope is consistent with beta~2.0, and fromthe rest-frame uv continuum we measure a current star formation rate of2.4+/-1.1 msol/yr. the unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc,from which we deduce a star-forming surface density of ~10 msol/yr/kpc2. thelyman-alpha emission is found to be extended over ~3" along the slit,corresponding to ~5 kpc in the source plane. this can be explained by thepresence of a much larger envelope of neutral hydrogen around the star-formingregion. finally, fitting the spectral energy distribution using 7 photometricdata points with simple sed models, we derive the following properties: verylittle reddening, an inferred stellar mass of m*=6e9 msol, and an inferred ageof ~800 myrs (corresponding to a redshift of formation of ~18). thestar-formation rate of this object was likely much stronger in the past than atthe time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a fraction ofgalaxies at z~6 which have already faded in rest-frame uv wavelengths.

(2011). 10candidates are selected within the common field of ~33 arcmin2 (effective areaonce corrected for contamination and lensing dilution). all of them aredetected in h and ks bands in addition to j and/or irac 3.6/4.5, withh(ab)~23.4 to 25.2, and have modest magnification factors. although best-fitphotometric redshifts place all these candidates at high-z, the contaminationby low-z interlopers is estimated at 50-75% level based on previous studies,and the comparison with the blank-field wircam ultra-deep survey (wuds). thesame result is obtained when photometric redshifts include a luminosity prior,allowing us to remove half of the original sample as likely z~1.7-3 interloperswith young stellar pulations and strong extinction. two additional sourcesamong the remaining sample could be identified at low-z based on a detection at24 microns and on the hst z_850 band. these low-z interlopers are not welldescribed by current templates given the large break, and cannot be easilyidentified based solely on optical and near-ir photometry. given the estimateddust extinction and high sfrs, some of them could be also detected in the ir orsub-mm bands. after correction for likely contaminants, the observed counts atz&gt;7.5 seem to be in agreement with an evolving lf.

1109.6351	near-ir search for lensed supernovae behind galaxy clusters: iii.  implications for cluster modeling and cosmology	massive galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts act as gravitational lensesthat can magnify supernovae (sne) occurring in background galaxies. we assessthe possibility to use lensed sne to put constraints on the mass models ofgalaxy clusters and the hubble parameter at high redshift. due to the standardcandle nature of type ia supernovae (sne ia), observational information on thelensing magnification from an intervening galaxy cluster can be used toconstrain the model for the cluster mass distribution. a statistical analysisusing parametric cluster models was performed to investigate the possibleimprovements from lensed sne ia for the accurately modeled galaxy cluster a1689and the less well constrained cluster a2204. time delay measurements obtainedfrom sne lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measurethe hubble parameter. for a survey of a1689 we estimate the expected rate ofdetectable sne ia and of multiply imaged sne. the velocity dispersion and coreradius of the main cluster potential show strong correlations with thepredicted magnifications and can therefore be constrained by observations ofsne ia in background galaxies. this technique proves especially powerful forgalaxy clusters with only few known multiple image systems. the mainuncertainty for measurements of the hubble parameter from the time delay ofstrongly lensed sne is due to cluster model uncertainties. for the extremelywell modeled cluster a1689, a single time delay measurement could be used todetermine the hubble parameter with a precision of ~ 10%. we conclude thatobservations of sne ia behind galaxy clusters can be used to improve the massmodeling of the large scale component of galaxy clusters and thus thedistribution of dark matter. time delays from sne strongly lensed by accuratelymodeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure the hubble constant at highredshifts.

0710.5636	where is the matter in the merging cluster abell 2218?	we present a parametric strong lensing model of the cluster abell 2218 basedon hst acs data. we constrain the lens model using 8 previously known multiplyimaged systems, of which 7 have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. inaddition, we propose five candidate multiply imaged systems and estimate theirredshifts using our mass model. the model parameters are optimized in thesource plane by a bayesian monte carlo markov chain as implemented in the thepublicly available software lenstool. we find rms=0."12 for the scatter of thesources in the source plane, which translates into rms=1."49 between thepredicted and measured image positions in the image plane. we find that theprojected mass distribution of abell 2218 is bimodal, which is supported by ananalysis of the light distribution. we also find evidence for two structures invelocity space, separated by ~1000 km/s, corresponding to the two large scaledark matter clumps. we find that the lensing constraints can not be wellreproduced using only dark matter halos associated with the cluster galaxies,but that the dark matter is required to be smoothly distributed in large scalehalos. at 100" the enclosed projected mass is 3.8e14 solar masses. at thatradius, the large scale halos contribute ~85% of the mass. we find that themodel is not very sensitive to the fainter galaxy sized halos, unless theylocally perturb a given multiply imaged system. therefore, dark galaxy sizedsubstructure can be reliably constrained only if it locally perturbs one of thesystems. in an appendix we give a self-contained description of the parametricprofile we use, the dual pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution (dpie).this profile is a two component pseudo isothermal mass distribution (piemd)with both a core radii and a scale radii.

1207.4489	the origin and evolution of metallicity gradients: probing the mode of  mass assembly at z=2	we present and discuss measurements of the gas-phase metallicity gradient ingravitationally lensed galaxies at z=2.0-2.4 based on adaptive optics-assistedimaging spectroscopy with the keck ii telescope. through deep exposures we havesecured high signal to noise data for four galaxies with well-understoodkinematic properties. three galaxies with well-ordered rotation revealmetallicity gradients in the sense of having lower gas-phase metallicities atlarger galactocentric radii. two of these display gradients much steeper thanfound locally, while a third has one similar to that seen in local diskgalaxies. the fourth galaxy exhibits complex kinematics indicative of anongoing merger and reveals an "inverted" gradient with lower metallicity in thecentral regions. by comparing our sample to similar data in the literature forlower redshift galaxies, we determine that, on average, metallicity gradientsmust flatten by a factor of 2.6 +/- 0.9 between z=2.2 and the present epoch.this factor is in rough agreement with the size growth of massive galaxiessuggesting that inside-out growth can account for the evolution of metallicitygradients. since the addition of our new data provides the first indication ofa coherent picture of this evolution, we develop a simple model of chemicalevolution to explain the collective data. we find that metallicity gradientsand their evolution can be explained by the inward radial migration of gastogether with a radial variation in the mass loading factor governing the ratioof outflowing gas to the local star formation rate. average mass loadingfactors of \lsim 2 are inferred from our model in good agreement with directmeasurements of outflowing gas in z \simeq 2 galaxies.

1207.6235	an x-ray/optical study of the geometry and dynamics of macs  j0140.0-0555, a massive post-collision cluster merger	we investigate the physical properties, geometry and dynamics of the massivecluster merger macs j0140.0-0555 (z=0.451) using x-ray and optical diagnostics.featuring two galaxy overdensities separated by about 250 kpc in projection onthe sky, and a single peak in the x-ray surface brightness distribution locatedbetween them, macs j0140.0-0555 shows the tell-tale x-ray/optical morphology ofa binary, post-collision merger. our spectral analysis of the x-ray emission,as measured by our chandra acis-i observation of the system, finds theintra-cluster medium to be close to isothermal (~8.5 kev) with no clear signsof cool cores or shock fronts. spectroscopic follow-up of galaxies in the fieldof macs j0140.0-0555 yields a velocity dispersion of 875 (+70/-100) km/s(n_z=66) and no significant evidence of bimodality or substructure along theline of sight. in addition, the difference in radial velocity between thebrightest cluster galaxies of the two sub-clusters of 144+/-25 km/s is smallcompared to typical collision velocities of several 1000 km/s. a stronglylensed background galaxy at z=0.873 (which features variable x-ray emissionfrom an active nucleus) provides the main constraint on the mass distributionof the system. we measure m(&lt;75 kpc) = (5.6+/- 0.5)*10^13 m_sun for thenorth-western cluster component and a much less certain estimate of(1.5-3)*10^13 m_sun for the south-eastern subcluster. these values are in goodagreement with our x-ray mass estimates which yield a total mass of macsj0140.0-0555 of m(&lt;r_500) ~ (6.8-9.1)*10^14 m_sun. ......

1208.4323	a weak-lensing mass reconstruction of the large-scale filament feeding  the massive galaxy cluster macsj0717.5+3745	we report the first weak-lensing detection of a large-scale filamentfunneling matter onto the core of the massive galaxy cluster macsj0717.5+3745.our analysis is based on a mosaic of 18 multi-passband images obtained with acsaboard the hst, covering an area of \sim 10x20 arcmin^2. we use a weak-lensingpipeline developed for the cosmos survey, modified for the analysis of galaxyclusters, to produce a weak-lensing catalogue. a mass map is then computed byapplying a weak-gravitational-lensing multi-scale reconstruction techniquedesigned to describe irregular mass distributions such as the one investigatedhere. we test the resulting mass map by comparing the mass distributioninferred for the cluster core with the one derived from strong-lensingconstraints and find excellent agreement. the filament is detected within the 3sigma detection contour of the lensing mass reconstruction, and underlines theimportance of filaments for theoretical and numerical models of the massdistribution in the cosmic web. we measure the filament's projected length as\sim 4.5 h_{74}^{-1} mpc, and its mean density as (2.92 \pm 0.66)10^8 h_{74}m_{\odot} kpc^{-2}. combined with the redshift distribution of galaxiesobtained after an extensive spectroscopic follow-up in the area, we can ruleout any projection effect resulting from the chance alignment on the sky ofunrelated galaxy group-scale structures. assuming plausible constraintsconcerning the structure's geometry based on its galaxy velocity field, weconstruct a 3d model of the large-scale filament. within this framework, wederive the three-dimensional length of the filament to be 18 h_{74}^{-1} mpc,and a deprojected density in terms of the critical density of the universe of(206 \pm 46) \rho_{crit}, a value that lies at the very high end of the rangepredicted by numerical simulations.

1209.0775	gravitationally lensed galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5: direct abundance  measurements of lya emitters	strong gravitational lensing magnifies the flux from distant galaxies,allowing us to detect emission lines that would otherwise fall below thedetection threshold for medium-resolution spectroscopy. here we present thedetection of temperature-sensitive oxygen emission lines from three galaxies at2&lt;z&lt;3.5, which enables us to directly determine the oxygen abundances andthereby double the number of galaxies at z&gt;2 for which this has been possible.the three galaxies have ~10% solar oxygen abundances in agreement with strongemission line diagnostics. carbon and nitrogen ratios relative to oxygen aresub-solar as expected for young metal-poor galaxies. two of the galaxies arelya emitters with rest-frame equivalent widths of 20 a and 40 a, respectively,and their high magnification factors allow us for the first time to gaininsight into the physical characteristics of high-redshift lya emitters. usingconstraints from the physical properties of the galaxies, we accuratelyreproduce their line profiles with radiative transfer models. the models show arelatively small outflow in agreement with the observed small velocity offsetsbetween nebular emission and interstellar absorption lines.

1209.1391	the density profiles of massive, relaxed galaxy clusters. i. the total  density over three decades in radius	clusters of galaxies are excellent locations to probe the distribution ofbaryons and dark matter (dm) over a wide range of scales. we study a sample ofseven massive, relaxed galaxy clusters with centrally-located brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) at z=0.2-0.3. using the observational tools of strong and weakgravitational lensing, combined with resolved stellar kinematics within thebcg, we measure the total radial density profile, comprising both dark andbaryonic matter, over scales of ~3-3000 kpc. lensing-derived mass profilestypically agree with independent x-ray estimates within ~15%, suggesting thatdepartures from hydrostatic equilibrium are small and that the clusters in oursample (except a383) are not strongly elongated along the line of sight. theinner logarithmic slope gamma_tot of the total density profile measured overr/r200=0.003-0.03, where rho_tot ~ r^(-gamma_tot), is found to be nearlyuniversal, with a mean &lt;gamma_tot&gt; = 1.16 +- 0.05 (random) +0.05-0.07(systematic) and an intrinsic scatter of &lt; 0.13 (68% confidence). this isfurther supported by the very homogeneous shape of the observed velocitydispersion profiles, obtained via keck spectroscopy, which are mutuallyconsistent after a simple scaling. remarkably, this slope agrees closely withnumerical simulations that contain only dark matter, despite the significantcontribution of stellar mass on the scales we probe. the navarro-frenk-whiteprofile characteristic of collisionless cold dark matter is a betterdescription of the total mass density at radii &gt;~ 5-10 kpc than that of darkmatter alone. hydrodynamical simulations that include baryons, cooling, andfeedback currently provide a poorer match. we discuss the significance of ourfindings for understanding the assembly of bcgs and cluster cores, particularlythe influence of baryons on the inner dm halo.

1209.2492	the three-dimensional geometry and merger history of the massive galaxy  cluster macs j0358.8-2955	we present results of a combined x-ray/optical analysis of the dynamics ofthe massive cluster macs j0358.8-2955 (z=0.428) based on observations with thechandra x-ray observatory, the hubble space telescope, and the keck-i telescopeon mauna kea. macs j0358.8-2955 is found to be one of the most x-ray luminousclusters known at z&gt;0.3, featuring l_x(&lt;r_500) = 4.24*10^45 erg/s, kt = (9.55+0.58/-0.37) kev, m^{3d}_{gas}(&lt;r_500) = (9.18+/-1.45)*10^13 m_sun, andm^{3d}_{tot}(&lt;r_500) = (1.12+/-0.18)*10^15 m_sun. the system's high velocitydispersion of (1440 +130/-110) km/s (890 km/s when the correct relativisticequation is used), however, is inflated by infall along the line of sight, asthe result of a complex merger of at least three sub-clusters. one collisionproceeds close to head-on, while the second features a significant impactparameter. the temperature variations in the intra-cluster gas, two tentativecold fronts, the radial velocities measured for cluster galaxies, and the smalloffsets between collisional and non-collisional cluster components all suggestthat both merger events are observed close to core passage and along axes thatare greatly inclined with respect to the plane of the sky. a strong-lensinganalysis of the system anchored upon three triple-image systems (two of whichhave spectroscopic redshifts) yields independent constraints on the massdistribution. for a gas fraction of 8.2%, the resulting strong-lensing massprofile is in good agreement with our x-ray estimates, and the details of themass distribution are fully consistent with our interpretation of thethree-dimensional merger history of this complex system.

1210.7681	the rates and time-delay distribution of multiply imaged supernovae  behind lensing clusters	time delays of gravitationally lensed sources can be used to constrain themass model of a deflector and determine cosmological parameters. we herepresent an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply imaged sourcesbehind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with well-calibrated mass models. wefind that for time delays less than 1000 days, at z=3.0, their logarithmicprobability distribution functions are well represented by p (log \delta t)=5.3x 10^-4 \delta t^\beta m_250^-2\beta, with \beta=0.77, where m_250 is theprojected cluster mass inside 250 kpc (in 10^14 m_sun), and \beta is thepower-law slope of the distribution. the resultant probability distributionfunction enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensingcluster of known mass. for a cluster with m_250=2 x 10^14 m_sun, the fractionof time delays less than 1000 days is approximately 3%. taking abell 1689 as anexample, its dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocitydispersions larger than 500 km/s, mainly produce large time delays, whilegalaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller time delays. weestimate the probability of observing multiple images of a supernova in theknown images of abell 1689. a two-component model of estimating the supernovarate is applied in this work. for a magnitude threshold of m_ab=26.5, theyearly rate of type ia (core-collapse) supernovae with time delays less than1000 days is 0.004 +- 0.002 (0.029 +- 0.001). if the magnitude threshold islowered to m_ab ~ 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae suitable for timedelay observation is 0.044 +- 0.015 per year.

0803.4391	a hubble &amp; spitzer space telescope survey for gravitationally-lensed  galaxies: further evidence for a significant population of low luminosity  galaxies beyond redshift seven	we present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally-lensedcontinuum lyman break `drop-outs' beyond a redshift 7 conducted via very deepimaging through six foreground clusters undertaken with the hubble and spitzerspace telescopes. the survey has yielded 10 z-band and 2 j-band drop-outcandidates to photometric limits of j_110~=26.2 ab (5sigma). taking intoaccount the magnifications afforded by our clusters (1-4 magnitudes), we probethe presence of z&gt;7 sources to unlensed limits of j_{110}~=30 ab, fainter thanthose charted in the hubble ultradeep field. to verify the fidelity of ourcandidates we conduct a number of tests for instrumental effects which wouldlead to spurious detections, and carefully evaluate the likelihood offoreground contamination by considering photometric uncertainties in thedrop-out signature, the upper limits from stacked irac data and the statisticsof multiply-imaged sources. overall, we conclude that we can expect about halfof our sample of z-band drop-outs are likely to be at high redshift. anambitious infrared spectroscopic campaign undertaken with the nirspecspectrograph at the wm keck observatory for seven of the most promisingcandidates failed to detect any lyman-alpha emission highlighting the challengeof making further progress in this field. while the volume density of highredshift sources will likely remain uncertain until more powerful facilitiesare available, our data provides the first potentially interesting constraintson the uv luminosity function at z~=7.5 at intrinsically faint limits. wediscuss the implications of our results in the context of the hypothesis thatthe bulk of the reionizing photons in the era 7&lt;z&lt;12 arise in low luminositygalaxies undetected by conventional surveys.

1502.05998	mapping the dynamics of a giant ly-alpha halo at z=4.1 with muse: the  energetics of a large scale agn-driven outflow around a massive,  high-redshift galaxy	we present deep muse integral-field unit (ifu) spectroscopic observations ofthe giant (~150 x 80 kpc) ly-alpha halo around the z=4.1 radio galaxy tnjj1338-1942. this 9-hr observation maps the two-dimensional kinematics of thely-alpha emission across the halo. we identify two hi absorbers which are seenagainst the ly-alpha emission, both of which cover the full 150 x 80 kpc extentof the halo and so have covering fractions ~1. the stronger and moreblue-shifted absorber (dv~1200 km/s) has dynamics that mirror that of theunderlying halo emission and we suggest that this high column material (n(hi) ~10^19.4 /cm^2), which is also seen in civ absorption, represents an out-flowingshell that has been driven by the agn (or star formation) within the galaxy.the weaker (n(hi)~10^14 /cm^2) and less blue shifted (dv~500 km/s) absorbermost likely represents material in the cavity between the out-flowing shell andthe ly-alpha halo. we estimate that the mass in the shell must be of order10^10 msol -- a significant fraction of the ism from a galaxy at z=4. the largescales of these coherent structures illustrate the potentially powerfulinfluence of agn feedback on the distribution and energetics of material intheir surroundings. indeed, the discovery of high-velocity (~1000 km/s),group-halo-scale (i.e. &gt;150 kpc) and mass-loaded winds in the vicinity of thecentral radio source are broadly in agreement with the requirements of modelsthat invoke agn-driven outflows to regulate star formation and black-holegrowth in massive galaxies at early times.

1503.00002	a dusty, normal galaxy in the epoch of reionization	candidates for the modest galaxies that formed most of the stars in the earlyuniverse, at redshifts $z &gt; 7$, have been found in large numbers with extremelydeep restframe-uv imaging. but it has proved difficult for existingspectrographs to characterise them in the uv. the detailed properties of thesegalaxies could be measured from dust and cool gas emission at far-infraredwavelengths if the galaxies have become sufficiently enriched in dust andmetals. so far, however, the most distant uv-selected galaxy detected in dustemission is only at $z = 3.25$, and recent results have cast doubt on whetherdust and molecules can be found in typical galaxies at this early epoch. herewe report thermal dust emission from an archetypal early universe star-forminggalaxy, a1689-zd1. we detect its stellar continuum in spectroscopy anddetermine its redshift to be $z = 7.5\pm0.2$ from a spectroscopic detection ofthe ly{\alpha} break. a1689-zd1 is representative of the star-formingpopulation during reionisation, with a total star-formation rate of about12m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. the galaxy is highly evolved: it has a large stellarmass, and is heavily enriched in dust, with a dust-to-gas ratio close to thatof the milky way. dusty, evolved galaxies are thus present among the fainterstar-forming population at $z &gt; 7$, in spite of the very short time since theyfirst appeared.

1504.03388	the behaviour of dark matter associated with 4 bright cluster galaxies  in the 10kpc core of abell 3827	galaxy cluster abell 3827 hosts the stellar remnants of four almost equallybright elliptical galaxies within a core of radius 10kpc. such corrugation ofthe stellar distribution is very rare, and suggests recent formation by severalsimultaneous mergers. we map the distribution of associated dark matter, usingnew hubble space telescope imaging and vlt/muse integral field spectroscopy ofa gravitationally lensed system threaded through the cluster core. we find thateach of the central galaxies retains a dark matter halo, but that (at least)one of these is spatially offset from its stars. the best-constrained offset is1.62+/-0.48kpc, where the 68% confidence limit includes both statistical errorand systematic biases in mass modelling. such offsets are not seen in fieldgalaxies, but are predicted during the long infall to a cluster, if dark matterself-interactions generate an extra drag force. with such a small physicalseparation, it is difficult to definitively rule out astrophysical effectsoperating exclusively in dense cluster core environments - but if interpretedsolely as evidence for self-interacting dark matter, this offset implies across-section sigma/m=(1.7+/-0.7)x10^{-4}cm^2/g x (t/10^9yrs)^{-2}, where t isthe infall duration.

1504.06881	spectroscopic detection of civ in a galaxy at z=7.045: implications for  the ionizing spectra of reionization-era galaxies	we present keck/mosfire observations of uv metal lines in four brightgravitationally-lensed z~6-8 galaxies behind the cluster abell 1703. thespectrum of a1703-zd6, a highly-magnified star forming galaxy with alyman-alpha redshift of z=7.045, reveals a confident detection of the nebularciv emission line (unresolved with fwhm &lt; 125 km/s). uv metal lines are notdetected in the three other galaxies. at z~2-3, nebular civ emission isobserved in just 1% of uv-selected galaxies. the presence of strong civemission in one of the small sample of galaxies targeted in this paper mayindicate hard ionizing spectra are more common at z~7. the total estimatedequivalent width of the civ doublet (38 a) and civ/lyman-alpha flux ratio (0.3)are comparable to measurements of narrow-lined agns. photoionization modelsshow that the nebular civ line can also be reproduced by a young stellarpopulation, with very hot metal poor stars dominating the photon fluxresponsible for triply ionizing carbon. regardless of the origin of the civ, weshow that the ionizing spectrum of a1703-zd6 is different from that of typicalgalaxies at z~2, producing more h ionizing photons per unit 1500a luminosityand a larger flux density at 30-50 ev. if such extreme radiation fields aretypical in uv-selected systems at z&gt;7, it would indicate that reionization-eragalaxies are more efficient ionizing agents than previously thought.alternatively, we suggest that the small sample of lyman-alpha emitters at z&gt;7may trace a rare population with intense radiation fields capable of ionizingtheir surrounding hydrogen distribution. additional constraints on highionization emission lines in galaxies with and without lyman-alpha detectionswill help clarify whether hard ionizing spectra are common in the reionizationera.

1509.06764	are ultra-faint galaxies at z=6-8 responsible for cosmic reionization ?  combined constraints from the hubble frontier fields clusters and parallels	we use deep hubble space telescope imaging of the frontier fields toaccurately measure the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (uvlf) in the redshift range $z \sim 6-8$. we combine observations in threelensing clusters a2744, macs0416, macs0717 and their associated parallelsfields to select high-redshift dropout candidates. we use the latest lensingmodels to estimate the flux magnification and the effective survey volume incombination with completeness simulations performed in the source plane. wereport the detection of 227 galaxy candidates at $z=6-7$ and 25 candidates at$z \sim 8$. while the total survey area is about 4 arcmin$^{2}$ in eachparallel field, it drops to about 0.6 to 1 arcmin$^{2}$ in the cluster corefields because of the strong lensing. we compute the uv luminosity function at$z \sim 7$ using the combined galaxy sample and perform monte carlo simulationsto determine the best fit schechter parameters. we are able to reliablyconstrain the lf down to an absolute magnitude of $m_{uv}=-15.25$, whichcorresponds to 0.005$l^{\star}$. more importantly, we find that the faint-endslope remains steep down to this magnitude limit with$\alpha=-2.04_{-0.17}^{+0.13}$. our results confirm the most recent results indeep blank fields but extend the lf measurements more than two magnitudesdeeper. the uv lf at $z \sim 8$ is not very well constrained below $m_{uv}=-18$due to the small number statistics and incompleteness uncertainties. to assessthe contribution of galaxies to cosmic reionization we derive the uv luminositydensity at $z\sim7$ by integrating the uv lf down to an observationallyconstrained limit of $m_{uv} = -15$. we show that our determination oflog($\rho_{uv}$)=$26.2\pm0.13$ (erg s$^{-1}$ hz$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$) can besufficient to maintain the igm ionized.

astro-ph;0606134	constraining the population of 6 &lt; z &lt; 10 star-forming galaxies with  deep near-ir images of lensing clusters	(abridged) we present the first results of our deep survey of lensingclusters aimed at constraining the abundance of star-forming galaxies atz~6-10. deep near-ir photometry of two lensing clusters (a1835 and ac114) wasobtained with isaac/vlt. these images, combined with existing data in theoptical bands, including hst images, were used to select very high redshiftcandidates at z&gt;~6 among the optical-dropouts. we have identified 18(8) firstand second-category optical dropouts in a1835 (ac114), detected in more thanone filter up to h(vega)~23.8 (ab~25.2,uncorrected for lensing). among them,8(5) exhibit homogeneous seds compatible with star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~6,and 5(1) are more likely intermediate-redshift eros based on luminosityconsiderations. we have also identified a number of fainter sources in thesefields fulfilling our photometric selection and located around the criticallines. we use all these data to make a first attempt at constraining thedensity of star-forming galaxies present at 6&lt;z&lt;10 using lensing clusters.taken at face value, it appears that the number of candidates found seems to behigher than the one achieved in blank fields with similar photometric depth inthe near-ir. the luminosity function derived for z&gt;6 candidates appearscompatible with that of lbgs at z~3. the turnover observed by bouwens et al.(2005) towards the bright end relative to the z~3 lf is not observed in thissample. also the upper limit for the uv sfr density at z~6-10 is compatiblewith the usual values derived at z~5-6, but higher than the estimates obtainedin the nicmos ultra deep field (udf). increasing the number of blank andlensing fields with ultra-deep near-ir photometry is essential to get moreaccurate constraints on the abundance of z&gt;6 galaxies.

astro-ph;0701279	a keck survey for gravitationally-lensed lyman-alpha emitters in the  redshift range 8.5 &lt; z &lt; 10.4: new constraints on the contribution of low  luminosity sources to cosmic reionization	we discuss new observational constraints on the abundance of faint highredshift lyman-alpha emitters secured from a deep keck near-infraredspectroscopic survey which utilizes the strong magnification provided bylensing galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift (z=0.2-0.5). in each of 9clusters we have undertaken a systematic `blind' search for line emission withnirspec in the j-band within carefully-selected regions which offer very highmagnifications (&gt;10-50x) for background sources with redshifts z~10. the highmagnification enables the detection of emission at unprecedented limits (10^41- 10^42 erg/s), much fainter than those of conventional narrow band imaging andother spectroscopic searches. as the comoving volumes probed are small, oursurvey is designed to address the important question of whether intrinsicallyfeeble star forming galaxies could provide the dominant ionizing flux at z~10.our survey has yielded six promising (&gt;5 sigma) candidate lyman-alpha emitterswhich lie between z=8.7 and z=10.2. while the predicted reionization photonbudget depends upon a large number of physical assumptions, our first glimpseat the z~10 universe suggests that low luminosity star-forming galaxiescontribute a significant proportion of the uv photons necessary for cosmicreionization.

astro-ph;0702705	a statistical study of multiply-imaged systems in the lensing cluster  abell 68	we have carried out an extensive spectroscopic survey with the keck and vlttelescopes, targeting lensed galaxies in the background of the massive clusterabell 68. spectroscopic measurements are obtained for 26 lensed images,including a distant galaxy at z=5.4 . redshifts have been determined for 5 outof 7 multiply-image systems. through a careful modeling of the massdistribution in the strongly-lensed regime, we derive a mass estimate of 5.3 x10^14 msun within 500 kpc. our mass model is then used to constrain theredshift distribution of the remaining multiply-imaged and singly-imagedsources. this enables us to examine the physical properties for a subsample of7 lyman-alpha emitters at 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 5.5, whose unlensed luminosities of ~ 10^41ergs/s are fainter than similar objects found in blank fields. of particularinterest is an extended lyman-alpha emission region surrounding a highlymagnified source at z=2.6, detected in vimos integral field spectroscopy data.the physical scale of the most distant lensed source at z=5.4 is very small(&lt;300 pc), similar to the lensed z ~ 5.6 emitter reported by ellis et al.(2001) in abell 2218. new photometric data available for abell 2218 allow for adirect comparison between these two unique objects. our survey illustrates thepracticality of using lensing clusters to probe the faint end of the z ~ 2-5lyman-alpha luminosity function in a manner that is complementary to blankfield narrow-band surveys.

0810.1471	the formation and assembly of a typical star-forming galaxy at z~3	recent studies of galaxies ~2-3 gyr after the big bang have revealed large,turbulent rotating systems. the existence of well-ordered rotation in galaxiesduring this peak epoch of cosmic star formation may suggest that gas accretionthrough cold streams is likely to be the dominant mode by which moststar-forming galaxies at high redshift since major mergers can completelydisrupt the observed velocity fields. however poor spatial resolution andsensitivity have hampered this interpretation, limiting the study to thelargest and most luminous galaxies, which may have fundamentally differentmodes of assembly than more typical star forming galaxies. here we reportobservations of a typical star forming galaxy at z=3.07 with a linearresolution of ~100 parsec. this spatial sampling is made possible by thecombination of gravitational lensing and laser guide star adaptive optics. wefind a well-ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being convertedefficiently into stars, likely assembling a spheroidal bulge and disk similarto those seen in spiral galaxies at the present day.
