0904.3066	barred galaxies in the abell 901/2 supercluster with stages	we present a study of bar and host disk evolution in a dense clusterenvironment, based on a sample of ~800 bright (mv &lt;= -18) galaxies in the abell901/2 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w imaging from the stagessurvey, and data from spitzer, xmm-newton, and combo-17. we identify andcharacterize bars through ellipse-fitting, and other morphological featuresthrough visual classification. (1) we explore three commonly used methods forselecting disk galaxies. we find 625, 485, and 353 disk galaxies, respectively,via visual classification, a single component s'ersic cut (n &lt;= 2.5), and ablue-cloud cut. in cluster environments, the latter two methods miss 31% and51%, respectively, of visually-identified disks. (2) for moderately inclineddisks, the three methods of disk selection yield a similar global optical barfraction (f_bar-opt) of 34% +10%/-3%, 31% +10%/-3%, and 30% +10%/-3%,respectively. (3) f_bar-opt rises in brighter galaxies and those which appearto have no significant bulge component. within a given absolute magnitude bin,f_bar-opt is higher in visually-selected disk galaxies that have no bulge asopposed to those with bulges. for a given morphological class, f_bar-opt risesat higher luminosities. (4) for bright early-types, as well as faint late-typesystems with no evident bulge, the optical bar fraction in the abell 901/2clusters is comparable within a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 to that of field galaxiesat lower redshifts (5) between the core and the virial radius of the cluster atintermediate environmental densities, the optical bar fraction does not appearto depend strongly on the local environment density and varies at most by afactor of ~1.3. we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution ofbars and disks in dense environments.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0707.1517	environmental dependence of agn activity in the supercluster a901/2	we present xmm data for the supercluster a901/2, at z ~ 0.17, which iscombined with deep imaging and 17-band photometric redshifts (from the combo-17survey), 2df spectra and spitzer 24um data, to identify agn in thesupercluster. the 90ksec xmm image contains 139 point sources, of which 11 areidentified as supercluster agn with l_x(0.5-7.5kev) &gt; 1.7x10^41 erg/cm2/s. thehost galaxies have m_r &lt; -20 and only 2 of 8 sources with spectra could havebeen identified as agn by the detected optical emission lines. using a largesample of 795 supercluster galaxies we define control samples of massivegalaxies with no detected agn. the local environments of the agn and controlsamples differ at &gt;98 per cent significance. the agn host galaxies liepredominantly in areas of moderate projected galaxy density and with more localblue galaxies than the control sample, with the exception of one very brighttype i agn very near the centre of a cluster. these environments are similarto, but not limited to, cluster outskirts and blue groups. despite the largenumber of potential host galaxies, no agn are found in regions with the highestgalaxy density (excluding some cluster cores where emission from the icmobscures moderate luminosity agn). agn are also absent from the areas withlowest galaxy density. we conclude that the prevalence of cluster agn is linkedto their environment.

0910.5718	interacting galaxies in the a901/902 supercluster with stages	we present a study of galaxy mergers and the influence of environment in theabell 901/902 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w data from thestages survey, combo-17, spitzer 24um, and xmm-newton x-ray data. our analysisutilizes both a visual classification system, and quantitative cas parametersto identify systems which show evidence of a recent or ongoing merger of massratio &gt;1/10. our results are: (1) after visual classification and minimizingthe contamination from false projection pairs, we find that the merger fractionf_merge is 0.023+/-0.007. the estimated fractions of likely major mergers,likely minor mergers, and ambiguous cases are 0.01+/-0.004, 0.006+/-0.003, and0.007+/-0.003, respectively. (2) the mergers lie outside the cluster core ofradius r &lt; 0.25 mpc: the lack of mergers in the core is likely due to the largegalaxy velocity dispersion in the core. mergers populate the region (0.25 mpc &lt;r &lt;= 2 mpc) between the core and outskirt. in this region, the estimatedfrequency of mergers is similar to those seen at typical group overdensities.this suggests ongoing growth of the clusters via accretion of group and fieldgalaxies. (3) we compare our observed merger fraction with those reported inother clusters and groups out to z~0.4. existing data points on the mergerfraction for l&lt;= l* galaxies in clusters allow for a range of evolutionaryscenarios. (4) the fraction of mergers, which lie on the blue cloud is80%+/-18% versus 34%+/-7% for non-interacting galaxies, implying thatinteracting galaxies are preferentially blue. (5) the average sfr, based on uvor uv+ir data, is enhanced by a factor of ~1.5 to 2 in mergers compared tonon-interacting galaxies. however, mergers in the clusters contribute only asmall fraction (between 10% and 15%) of the total sfr density.(abridged)

0911.0704	relating basic properties of bright early-type dwarf galaxies to their  location in abell 901/902	we present a study of the population of bright early-type dwarf galaxies inthe multiple-cluster system abell 901/902. we use data from the stages surveyand combo-17 to investigate the relation between the color and structuralproperties of the dwarfs and their location in the cluster. the definition ofthe dwarf sample is based on the central surface brightness and includesgalaxies in the luminosity range -16 &gt;= m_b &gt;~-19 mag. using a fit to the colormagnitude relation of the dwarfs, our sample is divided into a red and bluesubsample. we find a color-density relation in the projected radialdistribution of the dwarf sample: at the same luminosity dwarfs with reddercolors are located closer to the cluster centers than their bluer counterparts.furthermore, the redder dwarfs are on average more compact and rounder than thebluer dwarfs. these findings are consistent with theoretical expectationsassuming that bright early-type dwarfs are the remnants of transformedlate-type disk galaxies involving processes such as ram pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. this indicates that a considerable fraction of dwarfelliptical galaxies in clusters are the results of transformation processesrelated to interactions with their host cluster.

1002.1067	barred disks in dense environments	we investigate the properties of bright (mv &lt;= -18) barred and unbarred disksin the abell 901/902 cluster system at z~0.165 with the stages hst acs survey.to identify and characterize bars, we use ellipse-fitting. we use visualclassification, a sersic cut, and a color cut to select disk galaxies, and findthat the latter two methods miss 31% and 51%, respectively of disk galaxiesidentified through visual classification. this underscores the importance ofcarefully selecting the disk sample in cluster environments. however, we findthat the global optical bar fraction in the clusters is ~30% regardless of themethod of disk selection. we study the relationship of the optical bar fractionto host galaxy properties, and find that the optical bar fraction dependsstrongly on the luminosity of the galaxy and whether it hosts a prominent bulgeor is bulgeless. within a given absolute magnitude bin, the optical barfraction increases for galaxies with no significant bulge component. withineach morphological type bin, the optical bar fraction increases for brightergalaxies. we find no strong trend (variations larger than a factor of 1.3) forthe optical bar fraction with local density within the cluster between the coreand virial radius (r ~ 0.25 to 1.2 mpc). we discuss the implications of ourresults for the evolution of bars and disks in dense environments.

1008.0658	phat: photo-z accuracy testing	here we introduce phat, the photo-z accuracy testing programme, aninternational initiative to test and compare different methods of photo-zestimation. two different test environments are set up, one (phat0) based onsimulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, andanother one (phat1) based on data from the goods survey. the accuracy of thedifferent methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter,and outlier rates. most methods agree well on phat0 but produce photo-zscatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case.a larger spread in accuracy is found for phat1. few methods benefit from theaddition of mid-ir photometry. remaining biases and systematic effects can beexplained by shortcomings in the different template sets and the use of priorson the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. scatters of4-8% in delta_z/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. however,somewhat larger outlier rates (&gt;7.5% with delta_z/(1+z)&gt;0.15; &gt;4.5% aftercleaning) are found for all codes. there is a general trend that empiricalcodes produce smaller biases than template-based codes. the systematic,quantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshotof the current state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard forthe assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future. the rather large outlierrates reported here for phat1 on real data should be investigated further sincethey are most probably also present (and possibly hidden) in many otherstudies. the test data sets are publicly available and can be used to comparenew methods to established ones and help in guiding future photo-z methoddevelopment.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1106.3073	the spectroscopic classification and explosion properties of sn2009nz  associated with grb091127 at z=0.490	we present spectroscopic observations of grb091127 (z=0.490) at the peak ofthe putative associated supernova, sn2009nz. subtracting a late-time spectrumof the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of sn2009nz and uncover broadfeatures typical of nearby grb-sne. this establishes unambiguously thatgrb091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined type ic sn, and links a cosmologicallong burst with a standard energy release (e_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to amassive star progenitor. the spectrum of sn2009nz closely resembles that ofsn2006aj, with sn2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but hassignificantly narrower features than sne 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of alower expansion velocity. the photospheric velocity inferred from the siii 6355absorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of sne 2006ajand 2003dh than to the other grb-sne. combining the measured velocity with thelight curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosionparameters: m_ni ~ 0.35 m_sun, e_k ~ 2.3e51 erg, and m_ej ~ 1.4 m_sun, similarto those of sn2006aj. these properties indicate that sn2009nz follows a trendof lower m_ni for grb-sne with lower e_k and m_ej. equally important, sincegrb091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of sn2009nz tosn2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that xrf060218/sn2006aj was powered bya neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encodedin the sn properties but not in the prompt emission. future spectra of grb-sneat z &gt; 0.3, including proper subtraction of the host galaxy contribution, willshed light on the full dispersion of sn properties for standard long grbs, onthe relation between sne associated with sub-energetic and standard grbs, andon a potential dispersion in the associated sn types.

(2) for m&gt;=1e9 msunsystems, the average star formation rate (sfr) of strongly disturbed systems isonly modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies, in agreement withrecent simulations. in fact, over z~0.24 to 0.80, strongly disturbed systemsonly account for a small fraction (&lt;~30%) of the total sfr density. thissuggests that the behaviour of the cosmic sfr density over the last sevenbillion years is predominantly shaped by normal galaxies.

0803.3620	tracing the mass-dependent star formation history of late-type galaxies  using x-ray emission: results from the chandra deep fields	we report on the x-ray evolution over the last ~9 gyr of cosmic history(i.e., since z = 1.4) of late-type galaxy populations in the chandra deepfield-north and extended chandra deep field-south (cdf-n and e-cdf-s,respectively; jointly cdfs) survey fields. our late-type galaxy sample consistsof 2568 galaxies, which were identified using rest-frame optical colors and hstmorphologies. we utilized x-ray stacking analyses to investigate the x-rayemission from these galaxies, emphasizing the contributions from normalgalaxies that are not dominated by active galactic nuclei (agns). over thisredshift range, we find significant increases (factors of ~5--10) in thex-ray--to--optical mean luminosity ratio (l_x/l_b) and thex-ray--to--stellar-mass mean ratio (l_x/m*) for galaxy populations selected byl_b and m*, respectively. when analyzing galaxy samples selected via sfr, wefind that the mean x-ray--to--sfr ratio (l_x/sfr) is consistent with beingconstant over the entire redshift range for galaxies with sfr = 1--100 msolyr^-1, thus demonstrating that x-ray emission can be used as a robust indicatorof star-formation activity out to z = 1.4. we find that the star-formationactivity (as traced by x-ray luminosity) per unit stellar mass in a givenredshift bin increases with decreasing stellar mass over the redshift range z =0.2--1, which is consistent with previous studies of how star-formationactivity depends on stellar mass. finally, we extend our x-ray analyses tolyman break galaxies at z ~ 3 and estimate that l_x/l_b at z ~ 3 is similar toits value at z = 1.4.

0704.0774	galaxy morphologies and environment in the abell 901/902 supercluster  from combo-17	we present a morphological study of galaxies in the a901/902 superclusterfrom the combo-17 survey. a total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts inthe range 0.155 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.185 are visually classified by three independentclassifiers to m_v=-18. these morphological classifications are compared tolocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surfacemass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. at high localgalaxy densities, log(sigma_10 /mpc^2) &gt; 1.5, a classical morphology-densityrelation is found. a correlation is also found between morphology and localprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to thenearest cluster. this supports the finding that local environment is moreimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. the breakdown ofthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in thegalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of redgalaxies in the early-type population. using the 17-band photometry fromcombo-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passivegalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescriptionof wolf et al. (2005). we find that the dusty star-forming population describesan intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformedinto s0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.

astro-ph;0012343	the luminosity function of field galaxies and its evolution since z=1	we present the b-band luminosity function and comoving space and luminositydensities for a sample of 2779 i-band selected field galaxies based onmulti-color data from the cadis survey. the sample is complete down to i_815 =22 without correction and with completeness correction extends to i_815=23.0.by means of a new multi-color analysis the objects are classified according totheir spectral energy distributions (seds) and their redshifts are determinedwith typical errors of delta z &lt;= 0.03. we have split our sample into fourredshift bins between z=0.1 and z=1.04 and into three sed bins e-sa,sa-sc andstarbursting (emission line) galaxies. the evolution of the luminosity functionis clearly differential with sed. the normalization phi* of luminosity functionfor the e-sa galaxies decreases towards higher redshift, and we find evidencethat the comoving galaxy space density decreases with redshift as well. incontrast, we find phi* and the comoving space density increasing with redshiftfor the sa-sc galaxies. for the starburst galaxies we find a steepening of theluminosity function at the faint end and their comoving space density increaseswith redshift.

astro-ph;0101269	the calar alto deep imaging survey: k-band galaxy number counts	we present k-band number counts for the faint galaxies in the calar alto deepimaging survey (cadis). we covered 4 cadis fields, a total area of 0.2deg^2, inthe broad band filters b, r and k. we detect about 4000 galaxies in the k-bandimages, with a completeness limit of k=19.75mag, and derive the k-band galaxynumber counts in the range of 14.25 &lt; k &lt; 19.75mag. this is the largest mediumdeep k-band survey to date in this magnitude range. the b- and r-band numbercounts are also derived, down to completeness limits of b=24.75mag andr=23.25mag. the k-selected galaxies in this magnitude range are of particularinterest, since some medium deep near-infrared surveys have identified breaksof both the slope of the k-band number counts and the mean b-k color atk=17\sim18mag. there is, however, a significant disagreement in the k-bandnumber counts among the existing surveys. our large near-infrared selectedgalaxy sample allows us to establish the presence of a clear break in the slopeat k=17.0mag from dlogn/dm = 0.64 at brighter magnitudes to dlogn/dm = 0.36 atthe fainter end. we construct no-evolution and passive evolution models, andfind that the passive evolution model can simultaneously fit the b-, r- andk-band number counts well. the b-k colors show a clear trend to bluer colorsfor k &gt; 18mag. we also find that most of the k=18-20mag galaxies have a b-kcolor bluer than the prediction of a no-evolution model for an l_* sbc galaxy,implying either significant evolution, even for massive galaxies, or theexistence of an extra population of small galaxies.

astro-ph;0111288	probing the distribution of dark matter in the abell 901/902  supercluster with weak lensing	we present a weak shear analysis of the abell 901/902 supercluster, composedof three rich clusters at z=0.16. using a deep r-band image from the 0.5 x 0.5degree mpg/eso wide field imager together with supplementary b-bandobservations, we build up a comprehensive picture of the light and massdistributions in this region. we find that, on average, the light from theearly-type galaxies traces the dark matter fairly well, although one cluster isa notable exception to this rule. the clusters themselves exhibit a range ofmass-to-light (m/l) ratios, x-ray properties, and galaxy populations. weattempt to model the relation between the total mass and the light from theearly-type galaxies with a simple scale-independent linear biasing model. wefind m/l_b=130h for the early type galaxies with zero stochasticity, which, iftaken at face value, would imply omega_m &lt; 0.1. however, this linear relationbreaks down on small scales and on scales equivalent to the average clusterseparation (approximately 1 mpc), demonstrating that a single m/l ratio is notadequate to fully describe the mass-light relation in the supercluster. rather,the scatter in m/l ratios observed for the clusters supports a modelincorporating non-linear biasing or stochastic processes. finally, there is aclear detection of filamentary structure connecting two of the clusters, seenin both the galaxy and dark matter distributions, and we discuss the effects ofcluster-cluster and cluster-filament interactions as a means to reconcile thedisparate descriptions of the supercluster.

astro-ph;0208345	the combo-17 survey: evolution of the galaxy luminosity function from  25,000 galaxies with 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2	we present a detailed empirical assessment of how the galaxy luminosityfunction and stellar luminosity density evolves over the last half of theuniverse's age (0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2) for galaxies of different spectral energydistributions (sed). the results are based on ~25,000 galaxies (r&lt;24) withredshift measurements (sigma_z~0.03) and seds across 350..930 nm, derived frommedium-band photometry in 17 filters, observed as part of the combo-17 survey(``classifying objects by medium-band observations in 17 filters'') over threedisjoint fields with a total area of 0.78 square degrees. luminosity functions(lf), binned in redshift and sed-type, are presented in the restframe passbandsof the sdss r-band, the johnson b-band and a synthetic uv continuum band at 280nm. we find that the luminosity function depends strongly on sed-type at allredshifts covered. the shape of the lf, i.e. the faint-end power-law slope,does depend on sed type, but not on redshift. however, the redshift evolutionof the characteristic luminosity m* and density phi* depends strongly onsed-type: (1) early-type galaxies, defined as redder than a present-dayreference sa spectrum, become drastically more abundant towards low redshift,by a factor of 10 in the number density phi* from z=1.1 to now, and by a factorof 4 in their contribution to the co-moving r-band luminosity density, j_r. (2)galaxies resembling present-day sa- to sbc-colours show a co-moving numberdensity and contribution to j_r that does not vary much with redshift. (3)galaxies with blue spectra reflecting strong star formation decrease towardslow redshift both in luminosity and density, and by a factor of 4 in their j_rcontribution. (abridged)

astro-ph;0302116	star forming rates between z=0.25 and z=1.2 from the cadis emission line  survey	the emission line survey within the calar alto deep imaging survey (cadis)detects emission line galaxies by a scan with an imaging fabry-perotinterferometer. it covers 5 fields of &gt; 100 square arcmin each in threewavelengths windows centered on lambda ~ 700, 820, and 920nm, and reaches to atypical limiting line flux of 3 x 10^(-20) w m^(-2). this is the deepestemission line survey covering a field of several 100 square arcmin. galaxiesbetween z = 0.25 and z = 1.4 are detected by prominent emission lines (fromhalpha to [oii]372.7) falling into the fp scans. additional observations with adozen medium band filters allow to establish the line identification and thusthe redshift of the galaxies to better than sigma(z) =0.001. on the basis of atotal of more than 400 emission line galaxies detected in halpha (92 galaxies),[oiii]500.7 (124 galaxies), or [oii]372.7 (222 galaxies) we measure theinstantaneous star formation rate (sfr) in the range 0.24 &lt; z &lt; 1.21. with thispurely emission line selected sample we are able to reach much fainter emissionline galaxies than previous, continuum-selected samples. thus completenesscorrections are much less important. our results substantiates the indicationsfrom previous studies (based on small galaxy samples) that the sfr decreases bya factor of ~20 between z = 1.2 and today. in fact, for a omega(m) = 0.3,omega(lambda) = 0.7 cosmology, we find an exponential decline rho(sfr)proportional to exp(-lookback_time) / 2.6gyr). the inferred sf density is inperfect agreement with that deduced from the fir emission of optically selectedgalaxies which is explained by a large overlap between both populations. weshow that self-consistent extinction corrections of both our emission lines andthe uv continua lead to consistent results for the sf density.

astro-ph;0404527	the influence of redshift information on galaxy-galaxy lensing  measurements	we investigate how galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements depend on the knowledgeof redshifts for lens and source galaxies. galaxy-galaxy lensing allows one tostudy dark matter halos of galaxies statistically using weak gravitationallensing. redshift information is required to reliably distinguish foregroundlens galaxies from background source galaxies and to convert the measured shearinto constraints on the lens model. without spectroscopy or multi-colourinformation, redshifts can be drawn from independently estimated probabilitydistributions. the combo-17 survey provides redshifts for both lens and sourcegalaxies. it thus offers the unique possibility to do this investigation withobservational data. we find that it is of great importance to know theredshifts of individual lens galaxies in order to constrain the properties oftheir dark matter halos. whether the redshifts are derived from $ubvri$ or thelarger number of filters available in combo-17 is not very important. incontrast, knowledge of individual source redshifts improves the measurementsonly very little over the use of statistical source redshift distributions aslong as the source redshift distribution is known accurately.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0412615	weak lensing measurements of dark matter halos of galaxies from combo-17	we present a measurement of mass estimates for dark matter halos aroundgalaxies from the combo-17 survey using weak gravitational lensing. combo-17 isparticularly useful for this kind of investigation because it coversobservations in 17 optical filters from which accurate photometric redshiftsand spectral classification for objects with $r&lt;24$ are derived. this allows usto select lens and source galaxies from their redshifts and to thus avoid anyuncertainties from estimates of the source redshift distribution. we studygalaxy lenses at redshifts $z_\mathrm{d}=0.2-0.7$ by fitting the normalizationof either singular isothermal spheres (sis) or navarro-frenk-white (nfw)profiles to the whole lens sample; we then consider halos around blue and redsubsamples separately. we also constrain the scaling of halo mass with light.for the nfw model, we find virial masses$m_\mathrm{vir}^*=3.9^{+3.3}_{-2.4}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$ (1-$\sigma$)for blue and $m_\mathrm{vir}^*=7.1^{+7.1}_{-3.8}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$for red galaxies of $l_\star=10^{10}h^{-2}l_{\sun}$, respectively. the derivedmass-to-light scaling relations suggest that the mass-to-light ratio mightdecrease with increasing luminosity for blue galaxies but increase withincreasing luminosity for red galaxies. however, these differences between blueand red galaxies are only marginally significant and both subsamples areconsistent with having the same mass-to-light ratio at all luminosities.finally, we compare our results to those obtained from the red-sequence clustersurvey (rcs) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). taking differences in theactual modelling into account, we find very good agreement with these surveys.

astro-ph;0506044	galaxy luminosity functions to z~1: deep2 vs. combo-17 and implications  for red galaxy formation	the deep2 and combo-17 surveys are used to study the evolution of theluminosity function of red and blue galaxies to $z \sim 1$. schechter functionfits show that, since $z = 1$, $m^*_b$ dims by $\sim$ 1.3 mag per unit redshiftfor both color classes, $\phi^*$ of blue galaxies shows little change, while$\phi^*$ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. at face value, thenumber density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since $ z = 1$,whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. luminosity densities support bothconclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our dataand local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest.we discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after $z = 1$from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the propertiesof local and distant e/s0s. we suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some bluegalaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to thered sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence inone or more purely stellar mergers. e/s0s of a given mass today will haveformed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain thefundamental plane and other local scaling laws.

astro-ph;0506150	red-sequence galaxies with young stars and dust: the cluster abell  901/902 seen with combo-17	we report the discovery of a rich component of dusty star-forming galaxiescontaminating the red-sequence in the supercluster system comprising abell901a, 901b and a902 at redshift ~0.17. these galaxies do not fit into thecolour-density relation, because their preferred habitat is different from thatof regular red-sequence galaxies, which are typically dust-poor, old andpassively evolving. the dusty red galaxies prefer the medium-density outskirtsof clusters while being rare in both the low-density field and the high-densitycluster cores. this new result is based on the information content in themedium-band photometry of the combo-17 survey. the photo-z accuracy of the ~800brightest cluster galaxies is &lt;0.01 and of the order of the velocity dispersionof the cluster. this enables us to select a rich and clean cluster sample, inwhich we can trace age-sensitive and dust-sensitive spectral featuresindependently with the detailed medium-band sed data. we find the red colour ofthe dusty galaxies to be a result of dust extinction combined with relativelyold stellar ages. we speculate that the dusty red galaxies could either be aproduct of minor mergers between established old red cluster galaxies withinfalling blue field galaxies, or mark a period in the internal transformationof blue field galaxies into red cluster galaxies, which is triggered by theenvironmental influences experienced during cluster infall.

astro-ph;0506320	galaxy clustering from combo-17: the halo occupation distribution at  &lt;z&gt;=0.6	we present measurements of galaxy clustering at redshift &lt;z&gt;=0.6 using 10360galaxies with photometric redshifts over an area of 0.78 square degree from thecombo-17 survey. to obtain a result that is unaffected by redshiftuncertainties, we calculate the projected correlation function w(r_p), givingresults for red sequence and blue cloud galaxies separately. the correlationfunction of the red galaxies displays clear deviations from a power law atcomoving separations around 1 to 3 h^-1 mpc, and similar but weaker trends aresuggested by the data for the blue galaxies. to interpret these results, we fitthe correlation functions with analytical predictions derived from a simplehalo occupation model. this combines linear clustering of the underlying masswith a description of the number of galaxies occupying each dark-matter halo(the halo occupation distribution). if the occupation numbers are taken to be asimple power law with n proportional to m^alpha, then alpha ~ 0.5 and alpha ~0.2 for red and blue galaxies respectively. these figures are little differentfrom the values required to fit present-day clustering data. the power-spectrumshape is assumed to be known in this exercise, but we allow the data todetermine the preferred value of sigma_8, the linear power-spectrumnormalization. the average normalization inferred from red and blue galaxies at&lt;z&gt; =0.6 is sigma_8=1.02+-0.17 at zero redshift, consistent with independentestimates of this local value. this agreement can be regarded as a verificationof the hierarchical growth of the halo mass function.

astro-ph;0605019	the wide field imager lyman-alpha search (wfilas) for galaxies at  redshift ~5.7: ii. survey design and sample analysis	context: wide-field narrowband surveys are an efficient way of searchinglarge volumes of high-redshift space for distant galaxies.  aims: we describe the wide field imager lyman-alpha search (wfilas) over 0.74sq. degree for bright emission-line galaxies at z~5.7.  methods: wfilas uses deep images taken with the wide field imager (wfi) onthe eso/mpi 2.2m telescope in three narrowband (70 a), one encompassingintermediate band (220 a) and two broadband filters, b and r. we use the noveltechnique of an encompassing intermediate band filter to exclude falsedetections. images taken with broadband b and r filters are used to remove lowredshift galaxies from our sample.  results: we present a sample of seven lya emitting galaxy candidates, two ofwhich are spectroscopically confirmed. compared to other surveys all ourcandidates are bright, the results of this survey complements other narrowbandsurveys at this redshift. most of our candidates are in the regime of brightluminosities, beyond the reach of less voluminous surveys. adding ourcandidates to those of another survey increases the derived luminosity densityby ~30%. we also find potential clustering in the chandra deep field south,supporting overdensities discovered by other surveys. based on a fors2/vltspectrum we additionally present the analysis of the second confirmed lyaemitting galaxy in our sample. we find that it is the brightest lya emittinggalaxy (1 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2) at this redshift to date and the secondconfirmed candidate of our survey. both objects exhibit the presence of apossible second lya component redward of the line.

astro-ph;0606622	gabods: the garching-bonn deep survey: vii. probing galaxy bias using  weak gravitational lensing	[abridged] the weak gravitational lensing effect is used to infer matterdensity fluctuations within the field-of-view of the garching-bonn deep survey(gabods). this information is employed for a statistical comparison of thegalaxy distribution to the total matter distribution. the result of thiscomparison is expressed by means of the linear bias factor, b, the ratio ofdensity fluctuations, and the correlation factor $r$ between densityfluctuations. the total galaxy sample is divided into three sub-samples usingr-band magnitudes and the weak lensing analysis is applied separately for eachsub-sample. together with the photometric redshifts from the related combo-17survey we estimate the typical mean redshifts of these samples with$\bar{z}=0.35, 0.47, 0.61$, respectively. for all three samples, a slightgalaxy anti-bias, b~0.8+-0.1, on scales of a few mpc/h is found; the biasfactor shows evidence for a slight scale-dependence. the correlation betweengalaxy and (dark) matter distribution is high, r~0.6+-0.2, indicating anon-linear or/and stochastic biasing relation between matter and galaxies.between the three samples no significant evolution with redshift is found.

astro-ph;0610284	cosmological constraints from combo-17 using 3d weak lensing	we present the first application of the 3d cosmic shear method developed inheavens et al. (2006) and the geometric shear-ratio analysis developed intaylor et al. (2006), to the combo-17 data set. 3d cosmic shear has been usedto analyse galaxies with redshift estimates from two random combo-17 fieldscovering 0.52 square degrees in total, providing a conditional constraint inthe (sigma_8, omega_m) plane as well as a conditional constraint on theequation of state of dark energy, parameterised by a constant w= p/rho c^2. the(sigma_8, omega_m) plane analysis constrained the relation between sigma_8 andomega_m to be sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^{0.57 +- 0.19}=1.06 +0.17 -0.16, inagreement with a 2d cosmic shear analysis of combo-17. the 3d cosmic shearconditional constraint on w using the two random fields is w=-1.27 +0.64 -0.70.the geometric shear-ratio analysis has been applied to the a901/2 field, whichcontains three small galaxy clusters. combining the analysis from the a901/2field, using the geometric shear-ratio analysis, and the two random fields,using 3d cosmic shear, w is conditionally constrained to w=-1.08 +0.63 -0.58.the errors presented in this paper are shown to agree with fisher matrixpredictions made in heavens et al. (2006) and taylor et al. (2006). when thesemethods are applied to large datasets, as expected soon from surveys such aspan-starrs and vst-kids, the dark energy equation of state could be constrainedto an unprecedented degree of accuracy.

astro-ph;0612066	combo-17 measurements of the effect of environment on the type-dependent  galaxy luminosity function	we have developed a method to calculate overdensities in multicolour surveys,facilitating a direct comparison of the local density contrast measured usinggalaxy samples that have different redshift error distributions, i.e. for redand blue, or bright and faint galaxies, respectively. we calculateoverdensities in small redshift slices (delta z =0.02, which at z=0.3corresponds roughly to delta r_comoving=53 h^-1 mpc) for 9176 galaxies withr&lt;=23.65, m_b(vega)-5log h&lt;=-18, and z&lt;= 0.7, in three combo-17 fields(measuring 31'x 31' each). the mean redshift errors of this sample areapproximately sigma_z/(1+z)~0.015. in the chandra deep field south we identifya region that is underdense by almost a factor 2 compared to the other twofields in the same redshift range (0.25&lt;~ z &lt;~0.4). this can be used for aninvestigation of the variation of the colour-dependent luminosity function withenvironment: we calculate the luminosity function in this redshift range forred sequence and blue cloud galaxies (as defined by bell et al. 04) in each ofthe fields separately. while the luminosity function of the blue galaxiesremains unaffected by different density contrasts, the luminosity function ofthe red galaxies clearly has a more positive faint-end slope in the chandradeep field south as compared to the other two combo-17 fields. the underdensitythere is thus mainly due to a deficiency of faint red galaxies. this result isin qualitative agreement with the trends seen at z=0.1, e.g. in the 2dfgrs(croton et al. 05), or in the sdss (zandivarez et al. 06).

0809.2042	obscured star formation in intermediate-density environments: a spitzer  study of the abell 901/902 supercluster	we explore the amount of obscured star-formation as a function of environmentin the a901/902 supercluster at z=0.165 in conjunction with a field sampledrawn from the a901 and cdfs fields, imaged with hst as part of the stages andgems surveys. we combine the combo-17 near-uv/optical sed with spitzer 24umphotometry to estimate both the unobscured and obscured star formation ingalaxies with mstar&gt;10^{10}msun. we find that the star formation activity inmassive galaxies is suppressed in dense environments, in agreement withprevious studies. yet, nearly 40% of the star-forming galaxies have red opticalcolors at intermediate and high densities. these red systems are notstarbursting; they have star formation rates per unit stellar mass similar toor lower than blue star-forming galaxies. more than half of the redstar-forming galaxies have low ir-to-uv luminosity ratios, relatively highsersic indices and they are equally abundant at all densities. they might begradually quenching their star-formation, possibly but not necessarily underthe influence of gas-removing environmental processes. the other &gt;40% of thered star-forming galaxies have high ir-to-uv luminosity ratios, indicative ofhigh dust obscuration. they have relatively high specific star formation ratesand are more abundant at intermediate densities. our results indicate thatwhile there is an overall suppression in the star-forming galaxy fraction withdensity, the small amount of star formation surviving the cluster environmentis to a large extent obscured, suggesting that environmental interactionstrigger a phase of obscured star formation, before complete quenching.

astro-ph;9710322	evidence for diverse optical emission from gamma-ray burst sources	optical transients from gamma-ray burst sources, in addition to offering adistance determination, convey important information on the physics of theemission mechanism, and perhaps also about the underlying energy source. as thegamma-ray phenomenon is extremely diverse, with time scales spanning severalorders of magnitude, some diversity in optical counterpart signatures appearsplausible. we have studied the optical transient, which accompanied thegamma-ray burst of may 8, 1997 (grb 970508). observations conducted at the2.5-m nordic optical telescope (not) and the 2.2-m telescope at thegerman-spanish calar alto observatory (caha) cover the time interval starting 3hours 5 minutes to 96 days after the high energy event. this brackets all otherpublished observations, including radio. when analyzed in conjunction withoptical data from other observatories, evidence emerges for a composite lightcurve. the first interval, from 3 to 8 hours after the event was characterizedby a constant, or slowly declining brightness. at a later moment the brightnessstarted increasing rapidly, and reached a maximum approximately 40 hours afterthe grb. from that moment the grb brightness decayed approximately as apower-law of index -1.21. the last observation, after 96 days, m_r =24.28+-0.10, is brighter than the extrapolated power-law, and hints that aconstant component, m_r = 25.50+-0.40 is present. the ot is unresolved (fwhm0.83") at the faintest magnitude level. the brightness of the opticaltransient, its duration and the general shape of the light curve sets thissource apart from the single other optical transient known, that of thefebruary 28, 1997 event.

astro-ph;9809034	an optical study of the grb 970111 field beginning 19 hours after the  gamma-ray burst	we present the results of the monitoring of the grb 970111 field that started19 hours after the event. this observation represents the fastest ground-basedfollow-up performed for grb 970111 in all wavelengths. as soon as the detectionof the possible grb 970111 x-ray afterglow was reported by feroci et al. (1998)we reanalyzed the optical data collected for the grb 970111 field. although wedetect small magnitude variability in some objects, no convincing opticalcounterpart is found inside the wfc error box. any change in brightness 19hours after the grb is less than 0.2 mag for objects with b &lt; 21 and r &lt; 20.8.  the bluest object found in the field is coincident with 1saxj1528.8+1937.spectroscopic observations revealed that this object is a seyfert-1 galaxy withredshift z=0.657, which we propose as the optical counterpart of the x-raysource.  further observations allowed to perform multicolour photometry for objects inthe grb 970111 error box. the colour-colour diagrams do not show any objectwith unusual colours. we applied a photometric classification method to theobjects inside the grb error box, that can distinguish stars from galaxies andestimate redshifts. we were able to estimate photometric redshifts in the range0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.4 for several galaxies in this field and we did not find anyconspicuous unusual object.  we note that grb 970111 and grb 980329 could belong to the same class ofgrbs, which may be related to nearby sources (z ~1) in which high intrinsicabsorption leads to faint optical afterglows.

astro-ph;9812409	did most high-redshift quasars escape detection?	we present follow-up spectroscopy to the calar alto deep imaging survey(cadis), reporting on the quasars in the cadis 16h-field, and includingpreliminary data from two other fields. in this 10' x 10' field we found sixquasars at redshift z&gt;2.2 which are brighter than r=22 mag, while surfacedensities determined in previous surveys are reported to be below one onaverage. this is the highest reported surface density of high-redshift quasarswithin the given limits. we believe this result to be a consequence of themulticolor database and the search technique used in cadis.  our observations further seem to indicate that the density of high-redshiftquasars is also higher than predicted by the luminosity function of warren(1994) by a factor of three, implying that common search methods haveoverlooked the majority of high-redshift quasars at this magnitude level. inparticular, an application of the v/v max test to our preliminary list of agnswith r&lt;22 mag and z&lt;4 yields &lt;v/v max&gt; = 0.51 +-0.06, characterizing ourpreliminary redshift distribution as flat.
