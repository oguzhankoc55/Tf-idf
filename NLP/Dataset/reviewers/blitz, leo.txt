0903.3802	the milky way's dark matter halo appears to be lopsided	the atomic hydrogen gas (hi) disk in the outer region (beyond ~10 kpc fromthe centre) of milky way can provide valuable information about the structureof the dark matter halo. the recent 3-d thickness map of the outer hi disk fromthe all sky 21-cm line lab survey, gives us a unique opportunity to investigatethe structure of the dark matter halo of milky way in great detail. a strikingfeature of this new survey is the north-south asymmetry in the thickness map ofthe atomic hydrogen gas. assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium under thetotal potential of the galaxy, we derive the model thickness map of the hi gas.we show that simple axisymmetric halo models, such as softened isothermal halo(producing a flat rotation curve with v_c ~ 220 km/s) or any halo with densityfalling faster than the isothermal one, are not able to explain the observedradial variation of the gas thickness. we also show that such axisymmetrichalos along with different hi velocity dispersion in the two halves, cannotexplain the observed asymmetry in the thickness map. amongst thenon-axisymmetric models, it is shown that a purely lopsided (m=1, firstharmonic) dark matter halo with reasonable hi velocity dispersion fails toexplain the north-south asymmetry satisfactorily. however, we show that bysuperposing a second harmonic (m=2) out of phase onto a purely lopsided haloe.g. our best fit and more acceptable model a (with parameters\epsilon_{h}^{1}=0.2, \epsilon_{h}^{2}=0.18 and \sigma_{hi}=8.5 km/s) canprovide an excellent fit to the observation and reproduce the north-southasymmetry naturally. the emerging picture of the asymmetric dark matter halo issupported by the \lambda cdm halos formed in the cosmological n-bodysimulation.

0908.0334	tidal imprints of a dark sub-halo on the outskirts of the milky way	we present a new analysis of the observed perturbations of the hi disk of themilky way to infer the existence of a dark sub-halo that tidally interactedwith the milky way disk. we examine tidal interactions between perturbing darksub-halos and the gas disk of the milky way using high resolution smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations. we compare our results to theobserved hi map of the milky way to find that the fourier amplitudes of theplanar disturbances are best-fit by a perturbing dark sub-halo with a mass thatis one-hundredth of the milky way with a pericentric distance of 5 kpc. thisbest-fit to the fourier modes occurs about a dynamical time after pericentricapproach, when the perturber is 90 kpc from the galactic center. our analysishere represents a new method to indirectly characterize dark sub-halos from thetidal gravitational imprints they leave on the gaseous disks of galaxies. wealso elucidate a fundamental property of parabolic orbits. we show that undercertain conditions, one can break the degeneracy between the mass of theperturber and the pericentric distance in the evaluation of the tidal force --to directly determine the mass of the dark perturber that produced the observeddisturbances.

0909.3840	the gas consumption history to z ~ 4	using the observations of the star formation rate and hi densities to z ~ 4,with measurements of the molecular gas depletion rate (mgdr) and local densityof h_2 at z = 0, we derive the history of the gas consumption by star formationto z ~ 4. we find that closed-box models in which h_2 is not replenished by hirequire improbably large increases in rho(h_2) and a decrease in the mgdr withlookback time that is inconsistent with observations. allowing the h_2 used instar formation to be replenished by hi does not alleviate the problem becauseobservations show that there is very little evolution of rho(hi) from z = 0 toz = 4. we show that to be consistent with observational constraints, starformation on cosmic timescales must be fueled by intergalactic ionized gas,which may come from either accretion of gas through cold (but ionized) flows orfrom ionized gas associated with accretion of dark matter halos. we constrainthe rate at which the extraglactic ionized gas must be converted into hi andultimately into h_2. the ionized gas inflow rate roughly traces the sfrd: about1 - 2 x 10^8 m_sun gyr^-1 mpc^-3 from z ~ 1 - 4, decreasing by about an orderof magnitude from z=1 to z=0 with details depending largely on mgdr(t). allmodels considered require the volume averaged density of rho(h_2) to increaseby a factor of 1.5 - 10 to z ~ 1.5 over the currently measured value. becausethe molecular gas must reside in galaxies, it implies that galaxies at high zmust, on average, be more molecule rich than they are at the present epoch,which is consistent with observations. these quantitative results, derivedsolely from observations, agree well with cosmological simulations.

1006.2003	the allen telescope array twenty-centimeter survey - a  690-square-degree, 12-epoch radio dataset - i: catalog and long-duration  transient statistics	we present the allen telescope array twenty-centimeter survey (atats), amulti-epoch (12 visits), 690 square degree radio image and catalog at 1.4ghz.the survey is designed to detect rare, very bright transients as well as toverify the capabilities of the ata to form large mosaics. the combined imageusing data from all 12 atats epochs has rms noise sigma = 3.94mjy / beam anddynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec fwhm. it contains 4408sources to a limiting sensitivity of s = 20 mjy / beam. we compare the cataloggenerated from this 12-epoch combined image to the nrao vla sky survey (nvss),a legacy survey at the same frequency, and find that we can measure sourcepositions to better than ~20 arcsec. for sources above the atats completenesslimit, the median flux density is 97% of the median value for matched nvsssources, indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration. we examine theeffects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution betweenatats and nvss on our ability to compare flux densities. we detect notransients at flux densities greater than 40 mjy in comparison with nvss, andplace a 2-sigma upper limit on the transient rate for such sources of 0.004 persquare degree. these results suggest that the &gt; 1 jy transients reported bymatsumura et al.

1007.1982	tidal imprints of a dark sub-halo on the outskirts of the milky way ii.  perturber azimuth	we extend our analysis of the observed disturbances on the outskirts of thehi disk of the milky way. we employ the additional constraints of the phase ofthe modes of the observed hi image and asymmetry in the radial velocity fieldto derive the azimuth of the perturber inferred to be responsible for thedisturbances in the hi disk. we carry out a modal analysis of the phase of thedisturbances in the hi image and in sph simulations of a milky way-like galaxytidally interacting with dark perturbers, the relative offset of which weutilize to derive the perturber azimuth. to make a direct connection withobservations, we express our results in sun-centered coordinates, predictingthat the perturber responsible for the observed disturbances is between $-50\la l \la -10$. we show explicitly that the phase of the disturbances in theoutskirts of simulated galaxies at the time that best fits the fourieramplitudes, our primary metric for the azimuth determination, is relativelyinsensitive to the equation of state. our calculations here represent ourcontinuing efforts to develop the "tidal analysis" method of chakrabarti \&amp;blitz (2009; cb09). cb09 employed sph simulations to examine tidal interactionsbetween perturbing dark sub-halos and the milky way. they found that theamplitudes of the fourier modes of the observed planar disturbances arebest-fit by a perturbing dark sub-halo with mass one-hundredth that of themilky way, and a pericentric approach distance of $\sim 5-10~\rm kpc$. theoverarching goal of this work is to attempt to outline an alternate procedureto optical studies for characterizing and potentially discovering dwarfgalaxies -- whereby one can approximately infer the azimuthal location of aperturber, its mass and pericentric distance (cb09) from analysis of its tidalgravitational imprints on the hi disk of the primary galaxy.

1009.3272	carma survey toward infrared-bright nearby galaxies (sting): molecular  gas star formation law in ngc4254	this study explores the effects of different assumptions and systematics onthe determination of the local, spatially resolved star formation law. usingfour star formation rate (sfr) tracers (h\alpha with azimuthally averagedextinction correction, mid-infrared 24 micron, combined h\alpha andmid-infrared 24 micron, and combined far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared 24micron), several fitting procedures, and different sampling strategies we probethe relation between sfr and molecular gas at various spatial resolutions andsurface densities within the central 6.5 kpc in the disk of ngc4254. we findthat in the high surface brightness regions of ngc4254 the form of themolecular gas star formation law is robustly determined and approximatelylinear and independent of the assumed fraction of diffuse emission and the sfrtracer employed. when the low surface brightness regions are included, theslope of the star formation law depends primarily on the assumed fraction ofdiffuse emission. in such case, results range from linear when the fraction ofdiffuse emission in the sfr tracer is ~30% or less (or when diffuse emission isremoved in both the star formation and the molecular gas tracer), tosuper-linear when the diffuse fraction is ~50% and above. we find that thetightness of the correlation between gas and star formation varies with thechoice of star formation tracer. the 24 micron sfr tracer by itself shows thetightest correlation with the molecular gas surface density, whereas theh\alpha corrected for extinction using an azimuthally-averaged correction showsthe highest dispersion. we find that for r&lt;0.5r_25 the local star formationefficiency is constant and similar to that observed in other large spirals,with a molecular gas depletion time ~2 gyr.

1101.0815	finding dwarf galaxies from their tidal imprints	we describe ongoing work on a new method that allows one to determine themass and relative position (in galactocentric radius and azimuth) of galacticcompanions purely from analysis of observed disturbances in gas disks. here, wedemonstrate the validity of this method, which we call tidal analysis, byapplying it to local spirals with known optical companions, namely m51 and ngc1512. these galaxies span the range from having a very low mass companion($\sim$ one-hundredth the mass of the primary galaxy) to a fairly massivecompanion ($\sim$ one-third the mass of the primary galaxy). this approach hasbroad implications for many areas of astrophysics -- for the indirect detectionof dark matter (or dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies), and for galaxyevolution in its use as a decipher for the dynamical impact of satellites ongalactic disks. here, we provide a proof of principle of the method by applyingit to infer and quantitatively characterize optically visible galacticcompanions of local spirals, from the analysis of observed disturbances inouter gas disks.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4633	the atlas3d project -- iv: the molecular gas content of early-type  galaxies	we have carried out a survey for 12co j=1-0 and j=2-1 emission in the 260early-type galaxies of the volume-limited atlas3d sample, with the goal ofconnecting their star formation and assembly histories to their cold gascontent. this is the largest volume-limited co survey of its kind and is thefirst to include many virgo cluster members. sample members are dynamically hotgalaxies with a median stellar mass 3\times 10^{10} msun; they are selected bymorphology rather than colour, and the bulk of them lie on the red sequence.the overall co detection rate is 56/259 = 0.22 \error 0.03, with no dependenceon k luminosity and only a modest dependence on dynamical mass. there are adozen co detections among the virgo cluster members; statistical analysis oftheir h_2 mass distributions and their dynamical status within the clustershows that the cluster's influence on their molecular masses is subtle at best,even though (unlike spirals) they seem to be virialized within the cluster. wesuggest that the cluster members have retained their molecular gas throughseveral gyr residences in the cluster. there are also a few extremely co-richearly-type galaxies with h_2 masses &gt;= 10^9 msun, and these are in low densityenvironments. we do find a significant trend between molecular content and thestellar specific angular momentum. the galaxies of low angular momentum alsohave low co detection rates, suggesting that their formation processes weremore effective at destroying molecular gas or preventing its re-accretion. wespeculate on the implications of these data for the formation of varioussub-classes of early-type galaxies.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1112.3641	the atlas3d project -- xi. dense molecular gas properties of co-luminous  early-type galaxies	surveying eighteen 12co-bright galaxies from the atlas3d early-type galaxysample with the institut de radio astronomie millim\'etrique (iram) 30mtelescope, we detect 13co(1-0) and 13co(2-1) in all eighteen galaxies, hcn(1-0)in 12/18 and hco+(1-0) in 10/18. we find that the line ratios12co(1-0)/13co(1-0) and 12co(1-0)/hcn(1-0) are clearly correlated with severalgalaxy properties: total stellar mass, luminosity-weighted mean stellar age,molecular to atomic gas ratio, dust temperature and dust morphology. we suggestthat these correlations are primarily governed by the optical depth in the 12colines; interacting, accreting and/or starbursting early-type galaxies have moreoptically thin molecular gas while those with settled dust and gas discs hostoptically thick molecular gas. the ranges of the integrated line intensityratios generally overlap with those of spirals, although we note some outliersin the 12co(1- 0)/13co(1-0), 12co(2-1)/13co(2-1) and hcn/hco+(1-0) ratios. inparticular, three galaxies are found to have very low 12co(1-0)/13co(1-0) and12co(2-1)/13co(2-1) ratios. such low ratios may signal particularly stablemolecular gas which creates stars less efficiently than 'normal' (i.e. belowschmidt-kennicutt prediction), consistent with the low dust temperatures seenin these galaxies.

1201.0885	simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the link with fast rotators,  slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies (etgs) through mergers with asample of 70 high-resolution numerical simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies. these simulations encompass various mass ratios, initial conditionsand orbital parameters. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with massratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators accordingto the atlas3d criterion: they preserve the structure of the input fastrotating spiral progenitors. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1)lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the slow rotators hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. the mass ratio of theprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators inbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitorgalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. the importance of theinitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxymergers of the galmer project.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1208.3523	the atlas3d project - xx. mass-size and mass-sigma distributions of  early-type galaxies: bulge fraction drives kinematics, mass-to-light ratio,  molecular gas fraction and stellar initial mass function	we study the (m,sigma) and (m,re) projections of the thin mass plane (mp)(m,sigma,re) which describes the distribution of the galaxy population. thedistribution of galaxy properties on the mp is characterized by: (i) a zone ofexclusion described by two power-laws joined by a break at m 3e10 msun. thisresults in a break in the mean m-sigma relation with msigma^2.3 and m sigma^4.7at small and large sigma respectively; (ii) a mass m 2e11 msun which separatesa population dominated by flat fast rotator with disks and spiral galaxies atlower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses;(iii) below that mass the distribution of etgs properties tends to be constantalong lines of constant sigma; (iv) it forms a parallel sequence with thedistribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution offast rotator etgs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf etgs(sph) and dwarf irregulars (im) respectively. we show via dynamical models thatsigma traces the bulge fraction, which drives the observed trends in m/l,hbeta, colour, imf and molecular gas fraction. we interpret this as due to acombination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction whichincreases sigma and greatly enhances the likelihood for a galaxy to have itsstar formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass alonglines of nearly constant sigma, while leaving the population unchanged.[abriged]

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.6118	the molecular gas density in galaxy centers and how it connects to  bulges	in this paper we present gas density, star formation rate, stellar masses,and bulge disk decompositions for a sample of 60 galaxies. our sample is thecombined sample of bima song, carma sting, and pdbi nuga surveys. we study theeffect of using co-to-h_2 conversion factors that depend on the co surfacebrightness, and also that of correcting star formation rates for diffuseemission from old stellar populations. we estimate that star formation rates inbulges are typically lower by 20% when correcting for diffuse emission. we findthat over half of the galaxies in our sample have molecular gas surface density&gt;100 m_sun pc^-2. we find a trend between gas density of bulges and bulgesersic index; bulges with lower sersic index have higher gas density. thosebulges with low sersic index (pseudobulges) have gas fractions that are similarto that of disks. we also find that there is a strong correlation betweenbulges with the highest gas surface density and the galaxy being barred.however, we also find that classical bulges with low gas surface density can bebarred as well. our results suggest that understanding the connection betweenthe central surface density of gas in disk galaxies and the presence of barsshould also take into account the total gas content of the galaxy and/or bulgesersic index. indeed, we find that high bulge sersic index is the bestpredictor of low gas density inside the bulge (not barredness of the disk).finally, we show that when using the corrected star formation rates and gasdensities, the correlation between star formation rate surface density and gassurface density of bulges is similar to that of disks.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.0631	the egnog survey: gas excitation in normal galaxies at z~0.3	as observations of molecular gas in galaxies are pushed to lower starformation rate galaxies at higher redshifts, it is becoming increasinglyimportant to understand the conditions of the gas in these systems to properlyinfer their molecular gas content. the rotational transitions of the carbonmonoxide (co) molecule provide an excellent probe of the gas excitationconditions in these galaxies. in this paper we present the results from the gasexcitation sample of the evolution of molecular gas in normal galaxies (egnog)survey at the combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma).this subset of the full egnog sample consists of four galaxies at z~0.3 withstar formation rates of 40-65 m_sun yr^-1 and stellar masses of ~2x10^11 m_sun.using the 3 mm and 1 mm bands at carma, we observe both the co(1-0) and co(3-2)transitions in these four galaxies in order to probe the excitation of themolecular gas. we report robust detections of both lines in three galaxies (andan upper limit on the fourth), with an average line ratio, r_31 = l'_co(3-2) /l'_co(1-0), of 0.46 \pm 0.07 (with systematic errors \lesssim 40%), whichimplies sub-thermal excitation of the co(3-2) line. we conclude that theexcitation of the gas in these massive, highly star-forming galaxies isconsistent with normal star-forming galaxies such as local spirals, notstarbursting systems like local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. since theegnog gas excitation sample galaxies are selected from the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, we suggest that this result is applicable to studies ofmain sequence galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts, supporting theassumptions made in studies that find molecular gas fractions in star forminggalaxies at z~1-2 to be an order of magnitude larger than what is observedlocally.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1301.7184	a black-hole mass measurement from molecular gas kinematics in ngc4526	the masses of the supermassive black-holes found in galaxy bulges arecorrelated with a multitude of galaxy properties, leading to suggestions thatgalaxies and black-holes may evolve together. the number of reliably measuredblack-hole masses is small, and the number of methods for measuring them islimited, holding back attempts to understand this co-evolution. directlymeasuring black-hole masses is currently possible with stellar kinematics (inearly-type galaxies), ionised-gas kinematics (in some spiral and early-typegalaxies) and in rare objects which have central maser emission. here we reportthat by modelling the effect of a black-hole on the kinematics of molecular gasit is possible to fit interferometric observations of co emission and therebyaccurately estimate black hole masses. we study the dynamics of the gas in theearly-type galaxy ngc4526, and obtain a best fit which requires the presence ofa central dark-object of 4.5(+4.2-3.0)x10^8 msun (3 sigma confidence limit).with next generation mm-interferometers (e.g. alma) these observations could bereproduced in galaxies out to 75 megaparsecs in less the 5 hours of observingtime. the use of molecular gas as a kinematic tracer should thus allow one toestimate black-hole masses in hundreds of galaxies in the local universe, manymore than accessible with current techniques.

1304.0010	the egnog survey: molecular gas in intermediate-redshift star-forming  galaxies	we present the evolution of molecular gas in normal galaxies (egnog) survey,an observational study of molecular gas in 31 star-forming galaxies from z=0.05to z=0.5, with stellar masses of (4-30)x10^10 m_sun and star formation rates of4-100 m_sun yr^-1. this survey probes a relatively un-observed redshift rangein which the molecular gas content of galaxies is expected to have evolvedsignificantly. to trace the molecular gas in the egnog galaxies, we observe theco(1-0) and co(3-2) rotational lines using the combined array for research inmillimeter-wave astronomy (carma). we detect 24 of 31 galaxies and presentresolved maps of 10 galaxies in the lower redshift portion of the survey. weuse a bimodal prescription for the co to molecular gas conversion factor, basedon specific star formation rate, and compare the egnog galaxies to a largesample of galaxies assembled from the literature. we find an average moleculargas depletion time of 0.76 \pm 0.54 gyr for normal galaxies and 0.06 \pm 0.04gyr for starburst galaxies. we calculate an average molecular gas fraction of7-20% at the intermediate redshifts probed by the egnog survey. by expressingthe molecular gas fraction in terms of the specific star formation rate andmolecular gas depletion time (using typical values), we also calculate theexpected evolution of the molecular gas fraction with redshift. the predictedbehavior agrees well with the significant evolution observed from z~2.5 totoday.

1309.6513	carma survey toward infrared-bright nearby galaxies (sting). iii. the  dependence of atomic and molecular gas surface densities on galaxy properties	we investigate the correlation between co and hi emission in 18 nearbygalaxies from the carma survey toward ir-bright nearby galaxies (sting) atsub-kpc and kpc scales. our sample, spanning a wide range in stellar mass andmetallicity, reveals evidence for a metallicity dependence of the hi columndensity measured in regions exhibiting co emission. such a dependence ispredicted by the equilibrium model of mckee &amp; krumholz, which balances h_2formation and dissociation. the observed hi column density is often smallerthan predicted by the model, an effect we attribute to unresolved clumping,although values close to the model prediction are also seen. we do not observehi column densities much larger than predicted, as might be expected were therea diffuse hi component that did not contribute to h_2 shielding. we also findthat the h_2 column density inferred from co correlates strongly with thestellar surface density, suggesting that the local supply of molecular gas istightly regulated by the stellar disk.

(2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

0802.2714	the milky way rotation curve and its vertical derivatives inside the  solar circle	we measure the galactic rotation curve and its first two vertical derivativesin the first and fourth quadrants of the milky way using the 21 cm vgps andsgps. we find tangent velocities of the atomic gas as a function of galacticlongitude and latitude by fitting an analytic line profile to the edges of thevelocity profiles. the shape of the analytic profile depends only on thetangent velocity and the velocity dispersion of the gas. we use twocomplementary methods to analyze the tangent velocities: a global model to fittypical parameter values and a local fitting routine to examine spatialvariations. we confirm the validity of our fitting routines by testing simplemodels. both the global and local fits are consistent with a vertical falloffin the rotation curve of -22 +/- 6 km/s/kpc within 100 pc of the galacticmidplane. the magnitude of the falloff is several times larger than what wouldbe expected from the change in the potential alone, indicating some otherphysical process is important. the falloff we measure is consistent inmagnitude with that measured in the halo gas of other galaxies.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1410.0981	the atlas3d project -- xxix. the new look of early-type galaxies and  surrounding fields disclosed by extremely deep optical images	galactic archeology based on star counts is instrumental to reconstruct thepast mass assembly of local group galaxies. the development of new observingtechniques and data-reduction, coupled with the use of sensitive large field ofview cameras, now allows us to pursue this technique in more distant galaxiesexploiting their diffuse low surface brightness (lsb) light. as part of theatlas3d project, we have obtained with the megacam camera at the canada-francehawaii telescope extremely deep, multi--band, images of nearby early-typegalaxies. we present here a catalog of 92 galaxies from the atlas3d sample,that are located in low to medium density environments. the observing strategyand data reduction pipeline, that achieve a gain of several magnitudes in thelimiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, arepresented. the size and depth of the survey is compared to other recent deepimaging projects. the paper highlights the capability of lsb--optimized surveysat detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology ofgalaxies. the intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are alsodiscussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar halos of galaxies byextended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from galactic dust. thedetection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present andpast mass assembly of etgs is one of the prime goals of the project. we providespecific examples of each type of observed structures -- tidal tails, stellarstreams and shells --, and explain how they were identified and classified. wegive an overview of the initial results. the detailed statistical analysis willbe presented in future papers.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1502.01358	clustered cepheid variables 90 kiloparsec from the galactic center	distant regions close to the plane of our galaxy are largely unexplored byoptical surveys as they are hidden by dust. we have used near-infrared data(that minimizes dust obscuration) from the eso public survey vista variables ofthe via lactea (vvv) (minniti et al. 2011; saito et al. 2012; henceforth s12)to search for distant stars at low latitudes. we have discovered four cepheidvariables within an angular extent of one degree centered at galactic longitudeof $l = -27.4^\circ$ and galactic latitude of $b = -1.08 ^\circ$. we use thetightly constrained period-luminosity relationship that these pulsating starsobey (persson et al. 2004; matsunaga et al. 2011) to derive distances. we inferan average distance to these cepheid variables of 90 kpc. the cepheid variablesare highly clustered in angle (within one degree) and in distance (the standarddeviation of the distances is 12 kpc). they are at an average distance of $\sim2~\rm kpc$ from the plane and their maximum projected separation is $\sim 1~\rm kpc$. these young ($\sim$ 100 myr old), pulsating stars (bono et al. 2005)are unexpected at such large distances from the galactic disk, which terminatesat $\sim$ 15 kpc (minniti et al. 2011). the highly clustered nature in distanceand angle of the cepheid variables suggests that the stars may be associatedwith a dwarf galaxy, one that was earlier predicted by a dynamical analysis(chakrabarti \&amp; blitz 2009).

astro-ph;0001142	gas rich dwarf spheroidals	we present evidence that nearly half of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphand dsph/dirr) in the local group are associated with large reservoirs ofatomic gas, in some cases larger than the stellar mass. the gas is sometimesfound at large distance (~10 kpc) from the center of a galaxy and is notnecessarily centered on it. similarly large quantities of ionized gas could behidden in these systems as well. the properties of some of the gas reservoirsare similar to the median properties of the high-velocity clouds (hvcs); two ofthe hi reservoirs are catalogued hvcs. the association of the hi with the dwarfspheroidals might thus provide a link between the hvcs and stars. we show thatthe hi content of the local group dsphs and dirrs exhibits a sharp decline ifthe galaxy is within 250 kpc of either the milky way or m31. this can beexplained if both galaxies have a sufficiently massive x-ray emitting halo thatproduces ram-pressure stripping if a dwarf ventures too close to either giantspiral. we also investigate tidal stripping of the dwarf galaxies and find thatalthough it may play a role, it cannot explain the apparent total absence ofneutral gas in most dsph galaxies at distances less than 250 kpc. for thederived mean density of the hot gas, n_0 = 2.5e-5 cm^-2, ram-pressure strippingis found to be more than an order of magnitude more effective in removing thegas from the dsph galaxies. the hot halo, with an inferred mass of 1e10 solarmasses, may represent a reservoir of ~1000 destroyed dwarf systems, either hvcsor true dwarf galaxies similar to those we observe now.

astro-ph;0107211	the bima survey of nearby galaxies (bima song): i. the radial  distribution of co emission in spiral galaxies	we present the first results of the bima survey of nearby galaxies (bimasong), an imaging survey of the co j=(1-0) emission in 44 nearby spiralgalaxies at a typical resolution of 6". bima song differs from previoushigh-resolution co surveys in that: (1) co brightness was not an explicitselection criterion; (2) a larger area (200" diameter for most galaxies) ofeach galaxy was imaged; and (3) fully-sampled single-dish co data (55"resolution) were obtained for over half of the sample galaxies, so all of theco flux is imaged in these galaxies. the radial distribution of stellar lightin galactic disks is generally characterized as an exponential. it is,therefore, of interest to investigate whether the molecular gas, which is thestar-forming medium, has a similar distribution. though our low-resolutionsingle-dish radial profiles of co emission can be described by simpleexponentials, this is not true for the emission at our full 6" resolution. thescale lengths of the co disks are correlated with the scale lengths of thestellar disks with a mean ratio of the scale lengths of about one. we also findthat:(1) there is also a weak correlation between the ratio of k-band to columinosity and hubble type; (2) in half of the galaxies presented here, coemission does not peak at the location of the stellar nucleus; (3) averagedover the inner kiloparsec, the co emission in one-half of the galaxies exhibitsan excess over that expected from an exponential disk which is similar to theexcess in stellar light caused by the bulge stars; and (4) this excess coemission may be due to an increase in the total molecular gas content in thebulge region, or alternatively, to an increase in the co emissivity caused bythe increased pressure of the bulge region.

astro-ph;0108050	the density profile of the dark matter halo of ngc 4605	we have obtained ~100 pc resolution co and ~60 pc resolution halphaobservations of the dwarf spiral galaxy ngc 4605. we use them to derive a highresolution rotation curve and study the central density profile of ngc 4605'sdark matter halo. we find that these observations do not agree with thepredictions of most high resolution cold dark matter calculations. weinvestigate two extreme cases: 1) ngc 4605 has a maximal exponential disk, thatwe model using k-band observations and remove to study the structure of itsdark matter halo, and 2) ngc 4605 is dark matter dominated and its disk isdynamically negligible. because the mass-to-light ratio of the maximal disk isalready very low we favor the first solution, which indicates the halo has onecomponent with a density profile rho ~ r^{-0.6} out to r~2.8 kpc. in the secondcase, the rotation curve requires the presence of two components: a small (~600pc) core surrounded by a much steeper rho ~ r^{-1.1} halo. removal ofintermediate (submaximal) disks does not ameliorate the discrepancy between thepredictions and the observations.

astro-ph;0112204	the relationship between gas content and star formation in molecule-rich  spiral galaxies	we investigate the relationship between hi, h_2, and the star formation rate(sfr) using azimuthally averaged data for seven co-bright spiral galaxies.contrary to some earlier studies based on global fluxes, we find that the sfrsurface density exhibits a much stronger correlation with the h_2 than with thehi, as the hi surface density saturates at a value of $\sim$10 msol pc^{-2} oreven declines at large sfr surface densities. hence the good correlationbetween the sfr surface density and the total (hi+h_2) gas surface density isdriven by the molecular component in these galaxies. we find no clear evidencefor a link between the gravitational instability parameter for the gas disk(q_g) and the sfr, and suggest that q_g be considered a measure of the gasfraction. this implies that for a state of marginal gravitational stability toexist in galaxies with low gas fractions, it must be due to instability of thestellar disk. in regions where we have both hi and co measurements, the ratioof hi to h_2 surface density scales with radius r as roughly r^{1.5}, and wesuggest that the balance between hi and h_2 is determined primarily by themidplane interstellar pressure. these results favor a "law" of star formationin quiescent disks in which the ambient pressure and metallicity control theformation of molecular clouds from hi, with star formation then occurring at aroughly constant rate per unit h_2 mass.

astro-ph;0204042	the absence of stars in compact high-velocity clouds	we present the results of our search for faint local group dwarf galaxies incompact high-velocity clouds (hvcs). we used digitized palomar observatory skysurvey (poss) data to examine 1 square degree of sky around each of ~250northern hemisphere hvcs. the poss images were processed to remove foregroundstars and large-scale backgrounds, smoothed to enhance arcminute-sized lowsurface brightness features, and then compared to the original plates. usingthis technique, we located 60 candidate dwarf galaxies in the ~250 squaredegrees that we surveyed. followup observations of these candidates haverevealed several distant clusters of galaxies and a number of possible galacticcirrus clouds, but no local group dwarfs. it appears that many of the lowsurface brightness features in the sky survey data are plate flaws. thesecond-generation red poss plates are sensitive down to surface brightnesslevels of 25-26 magnitudes per square arcsecond, and our followup imagesreached 10-sigma limiting magnitudes of r = 21-23 for point sources. giventhese limits, all known local group galaxies except four of the very diffuse,extended dwarf spheroidals located within 100 kpc of the milky way would havebeen detected had they been in our survey. therefore, we can rule out thepossibility that these hvcs are associated with normal but faint dwarfgalaxies. if compact hvcs do contain stars, they must have surface brightnesses&gt; 1 magnitude per square arcsecond fainter than most known local groupgalaxies.

astro-ph;0307154	high-resolution measurements of the dark matter halo of ngc 2976:  evidence for a shallow density profile	we have obtained two-dimensional velocity fields of the dwarf spiral galaxyngc 2976 in halpha and co. the high spatial (~75 pc) and spectral (13 km/s and2 km/s, respectively) resolution of these observations, along with ourmulticolor optical and near-infrared imaging, allow us to measure the shape ofthe density profile of the dark matter halo with good precision. we find thatthe total (baryonic plus dark matter) mass distribution of ngc 2976 follows arho_tot ~ r^(-0.27 +/- 0.09) power law out to a radius of 1.8 kpc, assumingthat the observed radial motions provide no support. the density profileattributed to the dark halo is even shallower, consistent with a nearlyconstant density of dark matter over the entire observed region. a maximal diskfit yields an upper limit to the k-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (m*/l_k) of0.09^{+0.15}_{-0.08} m_sun/l_sun,k (including systematic uncertainties), withthe caveat that for m*/l_k &gt; 0.19 m_sun/l_sun,k the dark matter densityincreases with radius, which is unphysical. assuming 0.10 m_sun/l_sun,k &lt;m*/l_k &lt; 0.19 m_sun/l_sun,k, the dark matter density profile lies betweenrho_dm ~ r^-0.17 and rho_dm ~ r^-0.01. therefore, independent of anyassumptions about the stellar disk or the functional form of the densityprofile, ngc 2976 does not contain a cuspy dark matter halo. we alsoinvestigate some of the systematic effects that can hamper rotation curvestudies, and show that 1) longslit rotation curves are far more vulnerable tosystematic errors than two-dimensional velocity fields, 2) ngc 2976 containslarge radial motions at small radii, and 3) the halpha and co velocity fieldsof ngc 2976 agree within their uncertainties.

astro-ph;0307322	giant molecular clouds in m33 -- ii. high resolution observations	we present 12co(1-&gt;0) observations of 45 giant molecular clouds in m33 madewith the bima array. the observations have a linear resolution of 20 pc,sufficient to measure the sizes of most gmcs in the sample. we place upperlimits on the specific angular momentum of the gmcs and find the observedvalues to be nearly an order of magnitude below the values predicted fromsimple formation mechanisms. the velocity gradients across neighboring,high-mass gmcs appear preferentially aligned on scales less than 500 pc. if theclouds are rotating, 40% are counter-rotating with respect to the galaxy. gmcsrequire a braking mechanism if they form from the large scale radialaccumulation of gas. these observations suggest that molecular clouds formlocally out of atomic gas with significant braking by magnetic fields todissipate the angular momentum imparted by galactic shear. the observed gmcsshare basic properties with those found in the galaxy such as similar masses,sizes, and linewidths as well as a constant surface density of 120 m_sunpc^{-2}. the size-linewidth relationship follows delta v ~ r^{0.45\pm 0.02},consistent with that found in the galaxy. the cloud virial masses imply thatthe co-to-h_2 conversion factor has a value of 2 x 10^20 h2 cm^-2/(k km/s) anddoes not change significantly over the disk of m33 despite a change of 0.8 dexin the metallicity.

astro-ph;0311258	molecular gas in nearby dwarf galaxies: single dish and interferometric  results	we present results from an extensive survey of molecular gas in nearby dwarfgalaxies. this survey consists of a single-dish search for co emission at theuaso kitt peak 12m telescope and interferometric follow-up using theberkeley-illinois-maryland array. we have detected 41 new sources,approximately doubling the number of detections of such objects in theliterature. in this paper we discuss two results from the survey that lead usto agree with recent suggestions that, above a metallicity of 12+log[o/h]~8.0,there appears to be little variation in the co-to-h2 conversion factor forstar-forming molecular gas. we find two major pieces of evidence for thisresult: 1) the virial mass to molecular mass ratio found from theinterferometer observations in a variety of sources shows no clear trend withmetallicity; and 2) dwarf galaxies appear to exhibit a co-to-radio continuumrelationship that is similar to that observed in larger, presumably metal-rich,galaxies leaving little room for a large systematic variation of the co-to-h2conversion factor with metallicity in the star-forming gas.

astro-ph;0401187	a search for kinematic evidence of radial gas flows in spiral galaxies	co and hi velocity fields of seven nearby spiral galaxies, derived fromradio-interferometric observations, are decomposed into fourier componentswhose radial variation is used to search for evidence of radial gas flows.additional information provided by optical or near-infrared isophotes is alsoconsidered, including the relationship between the morphological and kinematicposition angles. to assist in interpreting the data, we present detailedmodeling that demonstrates the effects of bar streaming, inflow, and a warp onthe observed fourier components. we find in all of the galaxies evidence foreither elliptical streaming or a warped disk over some range in radius, withdeviations from pure circular rotation at the level of ~20-60 km/s. evidencefor kinematic warps is observed in several cases well inside r_{25}. nounambiguous evidence for radial inflows is seen in any of the seven galaxies,and we are able to place an upper limit of ~5-10 km/s (3-5% of the circularspeed) on the magnitude of any radial inflow in the inner regions of ngc 4414,5033 and 5055. we conclude that the inherent non-axisymmetry of spiral galaxiesis the greatest limitation to the direct detection of radial inflows.

astro-ph;0412035	high-resolution measurements of the halos of four dark matter-dominated  galaxies: deviations from a universal density profile	we derive rotation curves for four nearby, low-mass spiral galaxies and usethem to constrain the shapes of their dark matter density profiles. thisanalysis is based on high-resolution two-dimensional halpha velocity fields ofngc 4605, ngc 5949, ngc 5963, and ngc 6689 and co velocity fields of ngc 4605and ngc 5963. in combination with our previous study of ngc 2976, the fullsample of five galaxies contains density profiles that span the range fromalpha_dm = 0 to alpha_dm = 1.20, where alpha_dm is the power law indexdescribing the central density profile. the scatter in alpha_dm from galaxy togalaxy is 0.44, three times as large as in cold dark matter (cdm) simulations,and the mean density profile slope is alpha_dm = 0.73, shallower than thatpredicted by the simulations. these results call into question the hypothesisthat all galaxies share a universal dark matter density profile. we show thatone of the galaxies in our sample, ngc 5963, has a cuspy density profile thatclosely resembles those seen in cdm simulations, demonstrating that whilegalaxies with the steep central density cusps predicted by cdm do exist, theyare in the minority. in spite of these differences between observations andsimulations, the relatively cuspy density profiles we find do not suggest thatthis problem represents a crisis for cdm. improving the resolution of thesimulations and incorporating additional physics may resolve the remainingdiscrepancies. we also find that four of the galaxies contain detectable radialmotions in the plane of the galaxy. we investigate the hypothesis that thesemotions are caused by a triaxial dark matter halo, and place lower limits onthe ellipticity of the orbits in the plane of the disk of 0.043 - 0.175.

astro-ph;0502302	the molecular ism of dwarf galaxies on kiloparsec scales: a new survey  for co in northern, iras-detected dwarf galaxies	we present a new survey for co in dwarf galaxies using the kitt peak 12mtelescope. we observed the central regions of 121 northern dwarfs with irasdetections and no known co emission. we detect co in 28 of these galaxies andmarginally detect another 16, increasing by about 50% the number of suchgalaxies known to have significant co emission. the galaxies we detect arecomparable in mass to the lmc, although somewhat brighter in co and fainter inthe fir. within dwarfs, we find that the co luminosity, l_co, is most stronglycorrelated with the k-band and the far infrared luminosities. there are alsostrong correlations with the radio continuum and b-band luminosities, andlinear diameter. we suggest that l_co and l_k correlate well because thestellar component of a galaxy dominates the midplane gravitational field andthus sets the pressure of the atomic gas, which controls the formation of h_2from hi. we compare our sample with more massive galaxies and find that dwarfsand large galaxies obey the same relationship between co and the 1.4 ghz radiocontinuum (rc) surface brightness. this relationship is well described by aschmidt law with sigma_rc proportional to sigma_co^1.3. therefore, dwarfgalaxies and large spirals exhibit the same relationship between molecular gasand star formation rate (sfr). we find that this result is robust to moderatechanges in the rc-to-sfr and co-to-h_2 conversion factors. our data appear tobe inconsistent with large (order of magnitude) variations in the co-to-h_2conversion factor in the star forming molecular gas.

astro-ph;0602600	giant molecular clouds in local group galaxies	we present the first comparative study of extragalactic gmcs using completedata sets for entire galaxies and a uniform set of reduction and analysistechniques. we present results based on co observations for the lmc, smc, m33,m31, ic10 and the nucleus of m64, and make comparisons with archival milky wayobservations. our sample includes large spirals and dwarf irregulars withmetallicities that vary by an order of magnitude. gmcs in hi rich galaxies areseen to be well-correlated with hi filaments that pervade the galactic disks,suggesting that they form from pre-existing hi structures. virial estimates ofthe ratio of co line strength to h2 column density, xco, suggests that a valueof 4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (k km/s)^-1 is a good value to use in most galaxies (exceptthe smc) if the gmcs are virialized. however, if the clouds are only marginallyself-gravitating, as appears to be the case judging from their appearance, halfthe virial value may be more appropriate. there is no clear trend of xco withmetallicity. the clouds within a galaxy are shown to have the about the same h2surface density and differences between galaxies seem to be no more than afactor of ~2. we show that hydrostatic pressure appears to be the main factorin determining what fraction of atomic gas is turned into molecules. in thehigh-pressure regions often found in galactic centers, the observed propertiesof gmcs appear to be different from those in the found in the local group. fromthe association of tracers of star formation with gmcs in the lmc, we find thatabout 1/4 of the gmcs exhibit no evidence of star formation and we estimatethat the lifetime of a typical gmc in these galaxies is 20--30 myr.

astro-ph;0605035	the role of pressure in gmc formation ii: the h_2 - pressure relation	we show that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas in galaxies is determinedby hydrostatic pressure and that the relation between the two is nearly linear.the pressure relation is shown to be good over three orders of magnitude for 14galaxies including dwarfs, hi-rich, and h_2-rich galaxies as well as the milkyway. the sample spans a factor of five in mean metallicity. the rms scatter ofindividual points of the relation is only about a factor of two for all thegalaxies, though some show much more scatter than others. using these results,we propose a modified star formation prescription based on pressure determiningthe degree to which the ism is molecular. the formulation is different in highand low pressure regimes defined by whether the gas is primarily atomic orprimarily molecular. this formulation can be implemented in simulations andprovides a more appropriate treatment of the outer regions of spiral galaxiesand molecule-poor systems such as dwarf irregulars and damped lyman-alphasystems.

astro-ph;0606570	is there a fundamental line for disk galaxies?	we show that there are strong local correlations between metallicity, surfacebrightness, and dynamical mass-to-light ratio within m33, analogous to thefundamental line of dwarf galaxies identified by prada &amp; burkert (2002). usingnear-infrared imaging from 2mass, the published rotation curve of m33, andliterature measurements of the metallicities of hii regions and supergiantstars, we demonstrate that these correlations hold for points at radialdistances between 140 pc and 6.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy. at a givenmetallicity or surface brightness, m33 has a mass-to-light ratio approximatelyfour times as large as the local group dwarf galaxies; other than this constantoffset, we see broad agreement between the m33 and dwarf galaxy data. we useanalytical arguments to show that at least two of the three fundamental linecorrelations are basic properties of disk galaxies that can be derived fromvery general assumptions. we investigate the effect of supernova feedback onthe fundamental line with numerical models and conclude that while feedbackclearly controls the scatter in the fundamental line, it is not needed tocreate the fundamental line itself, in agreement with our analyticalcalculations. we also compare the m33 data with measurements of a simulateddisk galaxy, finding that the simulation reproduces the trends in the datacorrectly and matches the fundamental line, although the metallicity of thesimulated galaxy is too high, and the surface brightness is lower than that ofm33.

astro-ph;9508140	high resolution bima observations of co, hcn, and 13co in ngc 1068	we present high-resolution co, hcn, and 13co maps of the inner arcminute ofngc 1068 made with the bima interferometer. several features appear in the comap which have not previously been observed: (1) a firm detection of co lineemission from a compact region centered on the nucleus of the galaxy; (2) thedetection of a triplet velocity structure characteristic of kinematicallyindependent regions shown on the spectrum of the unresolved nuclear emission ;and (3) the detection of a molecular bar, the extent and position angle ofwhich are in good agreement with the 2 $\mu$m stellar bar. the most intense coemission is nonnuclear; the structure and kinematics of this emission implythat this gas is distributed along the inner spiral arms and not in a ring. thebar's kinematic influence on the molecular gas in the spiral arms is modest,with typical ordered noncircular motions of \la\ 30 \kms\ in the plane of thegalaxy. interior to the spiral arms, the bar's influence is more dramatic, asreflected by the twisted isovelocity contours in the co and hcn velocityfields. the surface density of molecular gas within the central 100 pc radiusof ngc 1068 is the same as that in the central 200 pc radius in the milky wayto within the uncertainties. there is evidence for an $m= 1$ kinematic mode inngc 1068; we find the kinematic center of rotation to be displaced from theradio continuum center by about 2.9", or 200 pc. the hcn image, in contrast tothe co map, shows a strong concentration of emission centered on the nucleus.the ratio of integrated intensities of the hcn emission to that of co is about0.6 and is the highest ratio measured in the central region of any galaxy.

astro-ph;9610102	dense gas in the milky way	we present a study of dense gas emission in the milky way in order to serveas a basis for comparison with extragalactic results. this study combines newobservations of hcn, cs, and co in individual gmcs and in the milky way planewith published studies of emission from these molecules in the inner 500 pc ofthe milky way. we find a strong trend in the fraction of emission from densegas tracers as a function of location in the milky way: in the bulge,i_{hcn}/i_{co} = 0.081 \pm 0.004, in the plane, i_{hcn}/i_{co} = 0.026 \pm0.008 on average, and over the full extent of nearby gmcs, i_{hcn}/i_{co} =0.014 \pm 0.020. similar trends are seen in i_{cs}/i_{co}. the low intensitiesof the hcn and cs emission in the plane suggests that these lines are producedby gas at moderate densities; they are thus not like the emission produced bythe dense, pc-scale star forming cores in nearby gmcs. the contrast between thebulge and disk ratios in the milky way is likely to be caused by a combinationof higher kinetic temperatures as well as a higher dense gas fraction in thebulge of the milky way.

astro-ph;9610103	synthesis imaging of dense gas in nearby galaxies	we present bima observations of the hcn emission from five nearby spiralgalaxies. the hcn observations comprise the first high-resolution(5--10\arcsec) survey of dense molecular gas from a sample of normal galaxies,rather than galaxies with prolific starburst or nuclear activities. the imagesshow compact structure, demonstrating that the dense gas emission is largelyconfined to the central kiloparsec of the sources. in one of the galaxies, ngc6946, the ratio of hcn to co integrated intensities ranges from 0.05--0.2within the extent of the hcn emission (r = 150 pc), with an average value of0.11 \pm 0.01 over the whole region; the range and average values of the ratiosin ngc 6946 are very similar to what is observed in the central r = 250 pc ofthe milky way. in ngc 6946, ngc 1068 and the milky way, the ratio i{hcn}/i{co}is 5 to 10 times higher in the bulge regions than in their disks; this suggeststhat the physical conditions in their bulges and disks are very different. inngc 4826 and m51, as in the milky way and ngc 1068, there is a linear offset of\sim 100 pc between the dense gas distribution and the peak of the radiocontinuum emission.

astro-ph;9803251	high velocity clouds: building blocks of the local group	we suggest that the high--velocity clouds (hvcs) are large clouds, withtypical diameters of 25 kpc and containing 5e7 solar masses of neutral gas and3e8 solar masses of dark matter, falling onto the local group; altogether thehvcs contain 10$^{11}$ solar masses of neutral gas. our reexamination of thelocal-group hypothesis for the hvcs connects their properties to thehierarchical structure formation scenario and to the gas seen in absorbtiontowards quasars. we begin by showing that at least one hvc complex (besides themagellanic stream) must be extragalactic at a distance &gt; 40 kpc from thegalactic center, with a diameter &gt; 20 kpc and a mass &gt; 1e8 solar masses.  we interpret the more distant hvcs as dark matter ``mini--halos'' movingalong filaments towards the local group. most poor galaxy groups should containhi structures to large distances bound to the group. the hvcs are localanalogues of the lyman--limit clouds  we argue that there is a galactic fountain in the milky way, but that thefountain does not explain the origin of the hvcs. our analysis of the hi dataleads to the detection of a vertical infall of low-velocity gas towards theplane. this implies that the chemical evolution of the galactic disk isgoverned by episodic infall of metal-poor hvc gas that only slowly mixes withthe rest of the interstellar medium.  the local--group infall hypothesis makes a number of testable predictions.the hvcs should have sub-solar metallicities. their h$\alpha $ emission shouldbe less than that seen from the magellanic stream. the clouds should not beseen in absorption to nearby stars. the clouds should be detectable in bothemission and absorption around other groups.

astro-ph;9912503	non-circular gas kinematics and star formation in the ringed galaxy ngc  4736	we analyze the gas kinematics and star formation properties of the nearbyrsab galaxy ngc 4736 using interferometric and single-dish co(1-0) data andpreviously published halpha and hi data. the co morphology is dominated by acentral molecular bar and tightly wound spiral arms associated with a brightring of star formation. strong hi emission is also found in the ring, but hi isabsent from the central regions. comparison of the hi and halpha distributionssuggests that hi in the ring is primarily dissociated h$_2$. modeling of the cokinematics reveals gas motion in elliptical orbits around the central bar, andwe argue that the ring represents both the olr of the bar and the ilr of alarger oval distortion. the hi kinematics show evidence for axisymmetric inflowtowards the ring and are inconsistent with streaming in aligned ellipticalorbits, but the highly supersonic (~40 km/s) inflow velocities required,corresponding to mass inflow rates of ~2 msol/yr, suggest that moresophisticated models (e.g., gas orbiting in precessed elliptical orbits) shouldbe considered. the radial co and halpha profiles are poorly correlated in thevicinity of the nuclear bar, but show a better correlation (in rough agreementwith the schmidt law) at the ring. even along the ring, however, the azimuthalcorrespondence between co and halpha is poor, suggesting that massive starsform more efficiently at some (perhaps resonant) locations than at others.these results indicate that the star formation rate per unit gas mass exhibitsstrong spatial variations and is not solely a function of the available gassupply. the localization of star formation to the ring is broadly consistentwith gravitational instability theory, although the instability parameter $q\sim 3$ on average in the ring, only falling below 1 in localized regions.

0810.2726	resolved properties of extragalactic giant molecular clouds	giant molecular clouds (gmcs) are the major reservoirs of molecular gas ingalaxies, and the starting point for star formation. as such, their propertiesplay a key role in setting the initial conditions for the formation of stars.we present a comprehensive combined inteferometric/single-dish study of theresolved gmc properties in a number of extragalactic systems, including bothnormal and dwarf galaxies. we find that the extragalactic gmc propertiesmeasured across a wide range of environments, characterized by the larsonrelations, are to first order remarkably compatible with those in the milkyway. using these data to investigate trends due to galaxy metallicity, we findthat: 1) these measurements do not accord with simple expectations fromphotoionization-regulated star formation theory, 2) there is no trend in thevirial co-to-h2 conversion factor on the spatial scales studied, and 3) thereare measurable departures from the galactic larson relations in the smallmagellanic cloud -- the object with the lowest metallicity in the sample --where gmcs have velocity dispersions that are too small for their sizes. i willdiscuss the stability of these clouds in the light of our recent far-infraredanalysis of this galaxy, and i will contrast the results of the virial andfar-infrared studies on the issue of the co-to-h2 conversion factor and whatthey tell us about the structure of molecular clouds in primitive galaxies.
