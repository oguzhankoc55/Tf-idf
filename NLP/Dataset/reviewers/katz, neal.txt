0901.1150	structural properties of central galaxies in groups and clusters	using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (cens) from the sdssdr4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members ingroups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (mstar), (2) dark matterhalo mass of the host group (mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. weestablish and thoroughly test a galfit-based pipeline to fit 2d sersic modelsto sdss data. we find that the fitting results are most sensitive to thebackground sky level determination and strongly recommend using the sdss globalvalue. we find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strongcovariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and sersic index(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. we find that n depends strongly onmstar for cens, but only weakly or not at all on mhalo. less (more) massivecens tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full mhalo range. likewise, thereis a clear r50-mstar relation for cens, with separate slopes for disks andspheroids. when comparing cens with satellite galaxies (sats), we find that lowmass (&lt;10e10.75 msun/h^2) sats have larger median n than cens of similar mstar.low mass, late-type sats have moderately smaller r50 than late-type cens of thesame mstar. however, we find no size differences between spheroid-like cens andsats, and no structural differences between cens and sats matched in both massand colour. the similarity of massive sats and cens shows that this distinctionhas no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. we conclude that mstaris the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.the lack of a clear n-mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass forproducing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processesmust occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

0901.1880	galaxies in a simulated $\lambda$cdm universe ii: observable properties  and constraints on feedback	we compare the properties of galaxies that form in a cosmological simulationwithout strong feedback to observations at z=0. we confirm previous findingsthat models without strong feedback overproduce the observed galaxy baryonicmass function, especially at the low and high mass extremes. throughpost-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required toreproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. to mimic an extremeform of "preventive" feedback (e.g., agn radio mode) we remove all baryonicmass that was originally accreted via "hot mode" from shock-heated gas. thisdoes not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreementwith observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed athigh redshift from baryons that originally accreted via "cold mode" onto lowermass progenitors. an efficient "ejective" feedback mechanism, such as supernovadriven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors. feedback must alsoreduce the masses of lower mass z=0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshiftsand have much lower star formation rates. if we monotonically re-map galaxymasses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation'spredicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with theobserved sequence of star-forming galaxies but fail to recover the observedpopulation of passive, low star formation rate galaxies. suppressing all hotmode accretion improves agreement for high mass galaxies but worsens theagreement at intermediate masses. reproducing these z=0 observations requires afeedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction ofgalaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of othergalaxies essentially unchanged.

0907.0704	lyman-alpha emission from cosmic structure i: fluorescence	we present predictions for the fluorescent lyman-alpha emission signaturearising from photoionized, optically thick structures in smoothed particlehydrodynamic (sph) cosmological simulations of a lambda-cdm universe using amonte carlo lyman-alpha radiative transfer code. we calculate the expectedlyman-alpha image and 2-dimensional spectra for gas exposed to a uniformultraviolet ionizing background as well as gas exposed additionally to thephotoionizing radiation from a local quasar, after correcting for theself-shielding of hydrogen. as a test of our numerical methods and forapplication to current observations, we examine simplified analytic structuresthat are uniformly or anisotropically illuminated. we compare these resultswith recent observations. we discuss future observing campaigns on largetelescopes and realistic strategies for detecting fluorescence owing to theambient metagalactic ionization and in regions close to bright quasars. whileit will take hundreds of hours on the current generation of telescopes todetect fluorescence caused by the ultraviolet background (uvb) alone, ourcalculations suggest that of order ten sources of quasar-induced fluorescentlyman-alpha emission should be detectable after a 10 hour exposure in a 10arcmin^2 field around a bright quasar. these observations will help probe thephysical conditions in the densest regions of the intergalactic medium as wellas the temporal light curves and isotropy of quasar radiation.

0909.4078	the nature of sub-millimetre galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamic  simulations	we study the nature of rapidly star-forming galaxies at z=2 in cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations, and compare their properties to observations ofsub-millimetre galaxies (smgs). we identify simulated smgs as the most rapidlystar-forming systems that match the observed number density of smgs. in ourmodels, smgs are massive galaxies sitting at the centres of large potentialwells, being fed by smooth infall and gas-rich satellites at rates comparableto their star formation rates (sfr). they are not typically undergoing majormergers that significantly boost their quiescent sfr, but they still often showcomplex gas morphologies and kinematics. our simulated smgs have stellar massesof log m*/mo~11-11.7, sfrs of ~180-500 mo/yr, a clustering length of 10 mpc/h,and solar metallicities. the sfrs are lower than those inferred from far-irdata by a factor of 3, which we suggest may owe to one or more systematiceffects in the sfr calibrations. smgs at z=2 live in ~10^13 mo halos, and byz=0 they mostly end up as brightest group galaxies in ~10^14 mo halos. wepredict that higher-m* smgs should have on average lower specific sfrs, lessdisturbed morphologies, and higher clustering. we also predict that deeperfar-ir surveys will smoothly join smgs onto the massive end of the sfr-m*relationship defined by lower-mass z=2 galaxies. overall, our simulated rapidstar-formers provide as good a match to available smg data as merger-basedscenarios, offering an alternative scenario that emerges naturally fromcosmological simulations.

0910.0250	pressure support vs. thermal broadening in the lyman-alpha forest ii:  effects of the equation of state on transverse structure	we examine the impact of gas pressure on the transverse coherence ofhigh-redshift (2 &lt;= z &lt;= 4) lyman-alpha forest absorption along neighboringlines of sight that probe the gas jeans scale (projected separation delta r &lt;=500 kpc/h comoving; angular separation delta theta &lt;= 30"). we comparepredictions from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations thathave different photoionization heating rates and thus differenttemperature-density relations in the intergalactic medium (igm). we alsocompare spectra computed from the gas distributions to those computed from thepressureless dark matter. the coherence along neighboring sightlines ismarkedly higher for the hotter, higher pressure simulation, and lower for thedark matter spectra. we quantify this coherence using the fluxcross-correlation function and the conditional distribution of flux decrementsas a function of transverse and line-of-sight (velocity) separation. sightlinesseparated by delta theta &lt;= 15" are ideal for probing this transversecoherence. higher pressure decreases the redshift-space anisotropy of the fluxcorrelation function, while higher thermal broadening increases the anisotropy.in contrast to the longitudinal (line-of-sight) structure of the lya forest,the transverse structure on these scales is dominated by pressure effectsrather than thermal broadening. with the rapid recent growth in the number ofknown close quasar pairs, paired line-of-sight observations offer a promisingnew route to probe the igm temperature-density relation and test theunexpectedly high temperatures that have been inferred from single sightlineanalyses.

0910.0256	pressure support vs. thermal broadening in the lyman-alpha forest i:  effects of the equation of state on longitudinal structure	in the low density intergalactic medium (igm) that gives rise to thelyman-alpha forest, gas temperature and density are tightly correlated. thevelocity scale of thermal broadening and the hubble flow across the gas jeansscale are of similar magnitude (hlambda_j ~ sigma_th). to separate the effectsof gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the lya forest, we comparespectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulationsevolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different jeansscales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolvedparticle distributions. the turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and fluxautocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening ratherthan pressure. however, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from acancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (t ~ rho^{0.6}in our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressuresimulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation,and it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermalbroadening. changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparablyimportant effects on the flux probability distribution (pdf), which respondsdirectly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which itis smooth. tests on a lower resolution simulation show that our statisticalresults are converged even at this lower resolution. while thermal broadeninggenerally dominates the longitudinal structure in the lya forest, we show inpaper ii that pressure support determines the transverse coherence of theforest observed towards close quasar pairs.

0912.0519	feedback and recycled wind accretion: assembling the z=0 galaxy mass  function	we analyse cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that includeobservationally-constrained prescriptions for galactic outflows. if thesesimulated winds accurately represent winds in the real universe, then materialpreviously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for newstar formation at redshifts z&lt;1. this recycled wind accretion, or wind mode,provides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the "hot"and "cold" modes emphasised in recent theoretical studies. because of theinteraction between outflows and gas in and around halos, the recyclingtimescale of wind material (t_rec) is shorter in higher-mass systems, whichreside in denser gaseous environments. in these simulations, this differentialrecycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar massfunction (gsmf). if we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind,then the predicted gsmfs are much steeper than observed; galaxy masses aresuppressed both by the direct removal of gas and by the hydrodynamic heating oftheir surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. with wind recyclingincluded, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven windscalings reproduces the observed gsmf for stellar masses 10^9 &lt; m &lt; 5x10^10msolar. at higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses andexcessive star formation rates relative to observations. in these massivesystems, some quenching mechanism must suppress the re-accretion of gas ejectedfrom star-forming galaxies. in short, as has long been anticipated, the form ofthe gsmf is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulatedwinds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejectedmaterial is re-accreted that governs the gsmf.

1004.2518	a bayesian approach to the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation:  methodology	we believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape theobserved galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions.the semi-analytic model (sam) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensionalparameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides atool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. because of the highdimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitablytackled with a bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constraintheory with data in a statistically rigorous way. in this paper we develop asam in the framework of bayesian inference. we show that, with a parallelimplementation of an advanced markov-chain monte-carlo algorithm, it is nowpossible to rigorously sample the posterior distribution of thehigh-dimensional parameter space of typical sams. as an example, wecharacterise galaxy formation in the current $\lambda$cdm cosmology using thestellar mass function of galaxies as an observational constraint. we find thatthe posterior probability distribution is both topologically complex anddegenerate in some important model parameters, suggesting that thoroughexplorations of the parameter space are needed to understand the models. wealso demonstrate that because of the model degeneracy, adopting a narrow priorstrongly restricts the model. therefore, the inferences based on sams areconditional to the model adopted. using synthetic data to mimic systematicerrors in the stellar mass function, we demonstrate that an accurateobservational error model is essential to meaningful inference.

1005.2421	the intergalactic medium over the last 10 billion years i: lyman alpha  absorption and physical conditions	the intergalactic medium (igm) is the dominant reservoir of baryons at allcosmic epochs. we investigate the evolution of the igm from z=2-0 in 48 mpc/h,110-million particle cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using threeprescriptions for galactic outflows. we focus on the evolution of igm physicalproperties, and how such properties are traced by ly-alpha absorption asdetectable using hst/cos. our results broadly confirm the canonical picturethat most ly-alpha absorbers arise from highly ionized gas tracing filamentarylarge-scale structure. growth of structure causes gas to move from the diffusephotoionized igm into other cosmic phases, namely stars, cold and hot gaswithin galaxy halos, and the unbound and shock-heated warm-hot intergalacticmedium (whim). by today, baryons are roughly equally divided between boundphases (35%), the diffuse igm (41%), and the whim (24%). here we (re)define thewhim as gas with overdensities lower than that in halos and temperatures &gt;10^5k, in order to more closely align it with "missing baryons". when we tune ourphotoionizing background to match the observed evolution of the ly-alpha meanflux decrement, we obtain a line count evolution that broadly agrees withavailable data. we predict a column density distribution slope of -1.70 for ourfavored momentum-driven wind model, in agreement with recent observations, andit becomes shallower with redshift. with improved statistics, the frequency ofstrong lines can be a valuable diagnostic of outflows, and our favored windmodel matches existing data best among our models. the relationship betweencolumn density and physical density is fairly tight from z=2-0, and evolves asrho n_hi^0.74 10^(-0.37z) for diffuse absorbers. linewidths only looselyreflect the temperature of the absorbing gas, which will hamper attempts toquantify the whim using broad ly-alpha absorbers.

1005.4406	intergalactic dust extinction in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations	recently menard et al. detected a subtle but systematic change in the meancolor of quasars as a function of their projected separation from foregroundgalaxies, extending to comoving separations of ~10mpc/h, which they interpretas a signature of reddening by intergalactic dust. we present theoreticalmodels of this remarkable observation, using sph cosmological simulations of a(50mpc/h)^3 volume. our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds andassumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. the predicted galaxy-dustcorrelation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlationfunction, and reproducing the msfr data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of0.24, about half the value in the galactic ism. roughly half of the reddeningarises in dust that is more than 100kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. wealso examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smallerfraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires anunphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the msfr data. in bothmodels, the signal is dominated by sightlines with e(g-i)=0.001-0.1. theno-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddeningto arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 msun. the wind model predicts a meanvisual extinction of a_v ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with asightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could besignificant for future supernova cosmology studies. reproducing the msfrresults in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ism dust surviveits expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.future observational studies that provide higher precision and measure thedependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for modelsof enriched galactic outflows and the survival of ig dust.

1008.1075	on the algorithms of radiative cooling in semi-analytic models	we study the behaviour of multiple radiative cooling algorithms implementedin seven semi-analytic models (sams) of galaxy formation, including a new modelwe propose in this paper. we use versions of the models without feedback andapply them to dark matter haloes growing in a cosmological context, which havefinal masses that range from 10^{11}msun to 10^{14}msun. first, usingsimplified smoothly-growing halo models, we demonstrate that the differentalgorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by afactor of ~5 for massive haloes (&gt;10^{12}msun). the algorithms are in betteragreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore,their cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. however,for less massive haloes, all the sams predict less cooling than corresponding1d hydrodynamic models. second, we study the gas accretion history of thecentral galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. the inclusion ofmergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxieswithin small haloes at early times. for realistic halo models, the dispersionin the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high masshaloes and 0.1 dex for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretionrate is about two times larger. comparing to cosmological sph simulations, wefind that most sams systematically under-predict the gas accretion rates forlow-mass haloes but over-predict the gas accretion rates for massive haloes.although the models all include both "rapid" and "slow" mode accretion, thetransition between the two accretion modes varies between models and alsodiffers from the simulations. finally, we construct a new model that explicitlyincorporates cold halo gas to illustrate that such a class of models can bettermatch the results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

1008.4242	galactic outflows and the kinematics of damped lyman alpha absorbers	the kinematics of damped lyman alpha absorbers (dlas) are difficult toreproduce in hierarchical galaxy formation models, particularly thepreponderance of wide systems. we investigate dla kinematics at z=3 usinghigh-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include aheuristic model for galactic outflows. without outflows, our simulations failto yield enough wide dlas, as in previous studies. with outflows, predicted dlakinematics are in much better agreement with observations. comparing twooutflow models, we find that a model based on momentum-driven wind scalingsprovides the best match to the observed dla kinematic statistics of prochaska &amp;wolfe. in this model, dlas typically arise a few kpc away from galaxies thatwould be identified in emission. narrow dlas can arise from any halo and galaxymass, but wide ones only arise in halos with mass &gt;10^11 mo, from either largecentral or small satellite galaxies. this implies that the success of thisoutflow model originates from being most efficient at pushing gas out fromsmall satellite galaxies living in larger halos. this increases thecross-section for large halos relative to smaller ones, thereby yielding widerkinematics. our simulations do not include radiative transfer effects ordetailed metal tracking, and outflows are modeled heuristically, but theystrongly suggest that galactic outflows are central to understanding dlakinematics. an interesting consequence is that dla kinematics may placeconstraints on the nature and efficiency of gas ejection from high-z galaxies.

1010.1266	new insight on galaxy structure from galphat i. motivation, methodology,  and benchmarks for sersic models	we introduce a new galaxy image decomposition tool, galphat (galaxyphotometric attributes), to provide full posterior probability distributionsand reliable confidence intervals for all model parameters. galphat is designedto yield a high speed and accurate likelihood computation, using gridinterpolation and fourier rotation. we benchmark this approach using anensemble of simulated sersic model galaxies over a wide range of observationalconditions: the signal-to-noise ratio s/n, the ratio of galaxy size to the psfand the image size, and errors in the assumed psf; and a range of structuralparameters: the half-light radius $r_e$ and the sersic index $n$. wecharacterise the strength of parameter covariance in sersic model, whichincreases with s/n and $n$, and the results strongly motivate the need for thefull posterior probability distribution in galaxy morphology analyses and laterinferences.  the test results for simulated galaxies successfully demonstrate that, with acareful choice of markov chain monte carlo algorithms and fast model imagegeneration, galphat is a powerful analysis tool for reliably inferringmorphological parameters from a large ensemble of galaxies over a wide range ofdifferent observational conditions.

1011.4964	testing subhalo abundance matching in cosmological smoothed particle  hydrodynamics simulations	subhalo abundance matching (sham) is a technique for populating simulateddark matter distributions with galaxies, assuming a monotonic relation betweena galaxy's stellar mass or luminosity and the mass of its parent dark matterhalo or subhalo. we examine the accuracy of sham in two cosmological sphsimulations, one of which includes momentum-driven winds. the sph simulationsindeed show a nearly monotonic relation between stellar mass and halo massprovided that, for satellite galaxies, we use the mass of the subhalo at theepoch when it became a satellite. in each simulation, the median relation forcentral and satellite galaxies is nearly identical, though a somewhat largerfraction of satellites are outliers. sham-assigned masses (at z=0-2),luminosities (r-band at z=0), or star formation rates (at z=2) have a 68%scatter of 0.09-0.15 dex relative to the true simulation values. when we applysham to the subhalo population of collisionless n-body simulation with the sameinitial conditions as the sph runs, we find generally good agreement for thehalo occupation distributions and halo radial profiles of galaxy samplesdefined by thresholds in stellar mass. however, because a small fraction of sphgalaxies suffer severe stellar mass loss after becoming satellites, shamslightly overpopulates high mass halos; this effect is more significant for thewind simulation, which produces galaxies that are less massive and morefragile. sham recovers the two-point correlation function of the sph galaxiesin the no-wind simulation to better than 10% at scales 0.1 &lt; r &lt; 10 mpc/h. forthe wind simulation, agreement is better than 15% at r &gt; 2 mpc/h, butoverpopulation of massive halos increases the correlation function by a factorof ~2.5 on small scales.

1106.1444	the intergalactic medium over the last 10 billion years ii: metal-line  absorption and physical conditions	we investigate the metallicity evolution and content of the intergalacticmedium (igm) and galactic halo gas from z=2-&gt;0 using 110-million particlecosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we focus on the detectability andphysical properties of uv resonance metal-line absorbers observable withhubble's cosmic origins spectrograph (cos). we confirm that galactic superwindoutflows are required to enrich the igm to observed levels down to z=0 usingthree wind prescriptions contrasted to a no-wind simulation. our favouredmomentum-conserved wind prescription deposits metals closer to galaxies owingto its moderate energy input, while the more energetic constant wind modelenriches the warm-hot igm 6.4x more. despite these significant differences, allwind models produce metal-line statistics within a factor of two of existingobservations. this is because ovi, civ, siiv, and neviii absorbers primarilyarise from t&lt;10^5 k, photo-ionised gas that is enriched to similar levels inthe three feedback schemes. ovi absorbers trace the diffuse phase withdelta&lt;100, which is enriched to ~1/50 zsol at z=0, although the absorbersthemselves usually exceed 0.3 zsol and arise from inhomogeneously distributed,un-mixed winds. civ and siiv absorbers trace primarily t~10^4 k gas insidehaloes. we predict cos will observe a population of neviii photo-ionisedabsorbers tracing t&lt;10^5 k, delta~10 gas. mgx and sixii are rarely detected incos s/n=30 simulated sight lines although detections trace t=10^(6-7) k halogas. in general, the igm is enriched in an outside-in manner, where wind-blownmetals released at higher redshift reach lower overdensities, resulting inhigher ionisation species tracing lower-density, older metals. at z=0, the 90%of baryons outside of galaxies are enriched to 0.096 zsol, but the 65% ofunbound baryons in the igm have 0.018 zsol and contain only 4% of all metals.

1109.6658	bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the k-band luminosity  function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation	we conduct bayesian model inferences from the observed k-band luminosityfunction of galaxies in the local universe, using the semi-analytic model (sam)of galaxy formation introduced in lu et al (2011). the prior distributions forthe 14 free parameters include a large range of possible models. we find thatsome of the free parameters, e.g. the characteristic scales for quenching starformation in both high-mass and low-mass halos, are already tightly constrainedby the single data set. the posterior distribution includes the modelparameters adopted in other sams. by marginalising over the posteriordistribution, we make predictions that include the full inferentialuncertainties for the colour-magnitude relation, the tully-fisher relation, theconditional stellar mass function of galaxies in halos of different masses, thehi mass function, the redshift evolution of the stellar mass function ofgalaxies, and the global star formation history. using posterior predictivechecking with the available observational results, we find that the modelfamily (i) predicts a tully-fisher relation that is curved; (ii) significantlyover predicts the satellite fraction; (iii) vastly over predicts the hi massfunction; (iv) predicts high-z stellar mass functions that have too many lowmass galaxies and too few high mass ones. and (v) predicts a redshift evolutionof the stellar mass density and the star formation history that are in moderatedisagreement. these results suggest that some important processes are stillmissing in the current model family and we discuss a number of possiblesolutions to solve the discrepancies, such as interactions between galaxies anddark matter halos, tidal stripping, the bimodal accretion of gas, preheating,and a redshift-dependent initial mass function.

1301.3156	a remarkably simple and accurate method for computing the bayes factor  from a markov chain monte carlo simulation of the posterior distribution in  high dimension	weinberg (2012) described a constructive algorithm for computing the marginallikelihood, z, from a markov chain simulation of the posterior distribution.its key point is: the choice of an integration subdomain that eliminatessubvolumes with poor sampling owing to low tail-values of posteriorprobability. conversely, this same idea may be used to choose the subdomainthat optimizes the accuracy of z. here, we explore using the simulateddistribution to define a small region of high posterior probability, followedby a numerical integration of the sample in the selected region using thevolume tessellation algorithm described in weinberg (2012). even more promisingis the resampling of this small region followed by a naive monte carlointegration. the new enhanced algorithm is computationally trivial and leads toa dramatic improvement in accuracy. for example, this application of the newalgorithm to a four-component mixture with random locations in 16 dimensionsyields accurate evaluation of z with 5% errors. this enables bayes-factor modelselection for real-world problems that have been infeasible with previousmethods.

1306.0650	an empirical model for the star formation history in dark matter halos	we develop an empirical approach to infer the star formation rate in darkmatter halos from the galaxy stellar mass function (smf) at different redshiftsand the local cluster galaxy luminosity function (cglf), which has a steeperfaint end relative to the smf of local galaxies. as satellites are typicallyold galaxies which have been accreted earlier, this feature can cast importantconstraint on the formation of low-mass galaxies at high-redshift. theevolution of the smfs suggests the star formation in high mass halos($&gt;10^{12}m_{\odot}h^{-1}$) has to be boosted at high redshift beyond what isexpected from a simple scaling of the dynamical time. the faint end of the cglfimplies a characteristic redshift $z_c\approx2$ above which the star formationrate in low mass halos with masses $&lt; 10^{11}m_{\odot}h^{-1}$ must be enhancedrelative to that at lower z. this is not directly expected from the standardstellar feedback models. also, this enhancement leads to some interestingpredictions, for instance, a significant old stellar population in present-daydwarf galaxies with $m_* &lt; 10^8 m_{\odot}h^{-2}$ and steep slopes of highredshift stellar mass and star formation rate functions.

1309.5951	tracing inflows and outflows with absorption lines in circumgalactic gas	we examine how hi and metal absorption lines within low-redshift galaxy halostrace the dynamical state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted heuristic model forgalactic outflows. we categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas basedon its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. following our earlierwork showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor indetermining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it isalso a governing factor for its dynamical state. low-ionisation metal absorbers(e.g. mgii) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within severalgyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. ovi) generally trace materialthat was deposited by outflows many gyr ago. inflowing gas is dominated byenriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion atlow redshifts is typically substantially enriched. recycling wind material ispreferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-masshalos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itselfagainst infall. low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accretedmaterial, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loadingfactors for lower-mass galaxies. typical hi absorbers trace unenriched ambientmaterial that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger hiabsorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. instantaneous radial velocitymeasures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowingand outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. these resultssuggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailedinformation about the amount and physical conditions of material that isparticipating in the baryon cycle.

1309.5963	torque-limited growth of massive black holes in galaxies across cosmic  time	we combine cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with analytic models toevaluate the role of galaxy-scale gravitational torques on the evolution ofmassive black holes at the centers of star-forming galaxies. we confirm andextend our earlier results to show that torque-limited growth yields blackholes and host galaxies evolving on average along the mbh-mbulge relation fromearly times down to z = 0 and that convergence onto the scaling relation occursindependent of the initial conditions and with no need for mass averagingthrough mergers or additional self-regulation processes. smooth accretiondominates the long-term evolution, with black hole mergers with mass ratios&gt;1:5 representing typically a small fraction of the total growth. winds fromthe accretion disk are required to eject significant mass to suppress blackhole growth, but there is no need for coupling this wind to galactic-scale gasto regulate black holes in a non-linear feedback loop. torque-limited growthyields a close-to-linear relation for the star formation rate and the blackhole accretion rate averaged over galaxy evolution time scales. however, thesfr-agn connection has significant scatter owing to strong variability of blackhole accretion at all resolved time scales. eddington ratios can be describedby a broad lognormal distribution with median value evolving roughly as (1 +z)^1.9, suggesting a main sequence for black hole growth similar to the cosmicevolution of specific sfrs. our results offer an attractive scenario consistentwith available observations in which cosmological gas infall and transport ofangular momentum in the galaxy by gravitational instabilities regulate thelong-term co-evolution of black holes and star-forming galaxies.

1309.6317	the cos-halos survey: rationale, design, and a census of circumgalactic  neutral hydrogen	we present the design and methods of the cos-halos survey, a systematicinvestigation of the gaseous halos of 44 z = 0.15-0.35 galaxies usingbackground qsos observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph aboard the hubblespace telescope. this survey has yielded 39 spectra of z_em ~ 0.5 qsos with s/n~ 10-15 per resolution element. the qso sightlines pass within 150 physical kpcof the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log m* /msun= 9.5 - 11.5. we find that the cgm exhibits strong hi, averaging 1 ang inlya equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100% covering fraction forstar-forming galaxies and 75% covering for passive galaxies. we find goodagreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies oversimilar range of impact parameter. there is weak evidence for a differencebetween early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of hi.kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy,such that &gt;~90% of the detected column density is confined within +/-200 kms^-1 of the galaxies. this material generally exists well below the halo virialtemperatures at t&lt;~ 10^5 k. we evaluate a number of possible origin scenariosfor the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which thebulk of the detected hi arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionizeddiffuse medium that is generic to all l* galaxies and may harbor a totalgaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.

1310.2253	a budget and accounting of metals at z~0: results from the cos-halos  survey	we present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forminggalaxies at $z\sim 0$. we combine empirically derived star formation historieswith updated supernova and agb yields and rates to estimate the total mass ofmetals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of$10^{9.3}$--$10^{11.6} m_{\odot}$. on the accounting side of the ledger, weshow that a surprisingly constant 20--25% mass fraction of produced metalsremain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with littledependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metalsimmediately locked up in remnants). thus, the bulk of metals are outside ofgalaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's $l^*$ galaxies. the cos-halossurvey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalacticmedium (to impact parameters of $&lt; 150$ kpc) of low-redshift $\sim l^*$galaxies. using these data, we map the distribution of cgm metals as traced byboth the highly ionized ovi ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combinedwith constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter x-ray emitting gas out tosimilar impact parameters, we show that $\sim 40$% of metals produced by$m_{\star}\sim 10^{10}m_{\odot}$ galaxies can be easily accounted for out to150 kpc. with the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metalswithin this fixed physical radius. this census provides a crucial boundarycondition for the eventual fate of metals in galaxy evolution models.

1310.6267	the high-ion content and kinematics of low-redshift lyman limit systems	we study the high-ionization phase and kinematics of the circumgalacticmedium around low-redshift galaxies using a sample of 23 lyman limit systems(llss) at 0.08&lt;z&lt;0.93 observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph onboard thehubble space telescope. in lehner et al. (2013), we recently showed that low-zllss have a bimodal metallicity distribution. here we extend that analysis tosearch for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of themetal-poor and metal-rich branches. we find that metal-rich llss tend to showhigher o vi columns and broader o vi profiles than metal-poor llss. the total hi line width (dv90 statistic) in llss is not correlated with metallicity,indicating that the h i kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflowfrom outflow and gas recycling. among the 17 llss with o vi detections, all buttwo show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of o vi-h i centroidoffsets, multiple components, or both. using various scenarios for how themetallicity in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each lls compare, weconstrain the ionized hydrogen column in the o vi phase to lie in the range logn(h ii)~17.6-20. the o vi phase of llss is a substantial baryon reservoir, withm(high-ion)~10^{8.5-10.9}(r/150 kpc)^2 solar masses, similar to the mass in thelow-ion phase. accounting for the o vi phase approximately doubles thecontribution of low-z llss to the cosmic baryon budget.

1311.0047	bayesian inferences of galaxy formation from the k-band luminosity and  hi mass functions of galaxies: constraining star formation and feedback	we infer mechanisms of galaxy formation for a broad family of semi-analyticmodels (sams) constrained by the k-band luminosity function and hi massfunction of local galaxies using tools of bayesian analysis. even with a broadsearch in parameter space the whole model family fails to match to constrainingdata. in the best fitting models, the star formation and feedback parameters inlow-mass haloes are tightly constrained by the two data sets, and the analysisreveals several generic failures of models that similarly apply to otherexisting sams. first, based on the assumption that baryon accretion follows thedark matter accretion, large mass-loading factors are required for haloes withcircular velocities lower than 200 km/s, and most of the wind mass must beexpelled from the haloes. second, assuming that the feedback is powered bytype-ii supernovae with a chabrier imf, the outflow requires more than 25% ofthe available sn kinetic energy. finally, the posterior predictivedistributions for the star formation history are dramatically inconsistent withobservations for masses similar to or smaller than the milky-way mass. theinferences suggest that the current model family is still missing some keyphysical processes that regulate the gas accretion and star formation ingalaxies with masses below that of the milky way.

1403.0947	the cos-halos survey: physical conditions and baryonic mass in the  low-redshift circumgalactic medium	we analyze the physical conditions of the cool, photoionized (t $\sim 10^4$k) circumgalactic medium (cgm) using the cos-halos suite of gas column densitymeasurements for 44 gaseous halos within 160 kpc of $l \sim l^*$ galaxies at $z\sim 0.2$. these data are well described by simple photoionization models, withthe gas highly ionized (n$_{\rm hii}$/n$_{\rm h} \gtrsim 99\%$) by theextragalactic ultraviolet background (euvb). scaling by estimates for thevirial radius, r$_{\rm vir}$, we show that the ionization state (tracked by thedimensionless ionization parameter, u) increases with distance from the hostgalaxy. the ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profilen$_{\rm h}$ = (10$^{-4.2 \pm 0.25}$)(r/r$_{\rm vir})^{-0.8\pm0.3}$. our derivedgas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictionsfrom standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium witha hot, coronal medium expected in virialized halos at this mass scale. applyingthe ionization corrections to the hi column densities, we estimate a lowerlimit to the cool gas mass m$_{\rm cgm}^{\rm cool} &gt; 6.5 \times 10^{10}$m$_{\odot}$ for the volume within r $&lt;$ r$_{\rm vir}$. allowing for anadditional warm-hot, ovi-traced phase, the cgm accounts for at least half ofthe baryons purported to be missing from dark matter halos at the 10$^{12}$m$_{\odot}$ scale.

1404.0402	parametrising star formation histories	we examine the star formation histories (sfhs) of galaxies in smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations, compare them to parametric modelsthat are commonly used in fitting observed galaxy spectral energydistributions, and examine the efficacy of these parametric models as practicaltools for recovering the physical parameters of galaxies. the commonly usedtau-model, with sfr ~ exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the sfh of our sphgalaxies, with a mismatch between early and late star formation that leads tosystematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. aone-parameter lin-exp model, with sfr ~ t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successfulon average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, mostactively star-forming galaxies and the passive, "red and dead" galaxies. weintroduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear rampafter a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. wetest the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1)the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellarpopulation ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full sph starformation histories using the fsps code of conroy et al. (2009). fits withtau-models systematically overestimate m/l by ~ 0.2 dex, overestimatepopulation ages by ~ 1-2 gyr, and underestimate ssfr by ~ 0.05 dex. fits withlin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the bestresults for the full range of galaxies. marginalizing over the free parametersof the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is ourrecommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.

1404.2933	the photon underproduction crisis	we examine the statistics of the low-redshift lyman-alpha forest fromsmoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations in light of recent improvements inthe estimated evolution of the cosmic ultraviolet background (uvb) and recentobservations from the cosmic origins spectrograph (cos). we find that the valueof the metagalactic photoionization rate required by our simulations to matchthe observed properties of the low-redshift lyman-alpha forest is a factor of 5larger than the value predicted by state-of-the art models for the evolution ofthis quantity. this mismatch results in the mean flux decrement of thelyman-alpha forest being underpredicted by at least a factor of 2 (a 10-sigmadiscrepancy with observations) and a column density distribution of lyman-alphaforest absorbers systematically and significantly elevated compared toobservations over nearly two decades in column density. we examine potentialresolutions to this mismatch and find that either conventional sources ofionizing photons (galaxies and quasars) must be significantly elevated relativeto current observational estimates or our theoretical understanding of thelow-redshift universe is in need of substantial revision.

1406.0509	the cos-dwarfs survey: the carbon reservoir around sub-l* galaxies	we report new observations of circumgalactic gas from the cos-dwarfs survey,a systematic investigation of the gaseous halos around 43 low-mass z $\leq$ 0.1galaxies using background qsos observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph.from the projected 1d and 2d distribution of c iv absorption, we find that c ivabsorption is detected out to ~ 0.5 r$_{vir}$ of the host galaxies. the c ivabsorption strength falls off radially as a power law and beyond 0.5 r$_{vir}$,no c iv absorption is detected above our sensitivity limit of ~ 50-100 m$\aa$.we find a tentative correlation between detected c iv absorption strength andstar formation, paralleling the strong correlation seen in highly ionizedoxygen for l~l* galaxies by the cos-halos survey. the data imply a large carbonreservoir in the cgm of these galaxies, corresponding to a minimum carbon massof $\gtrsim$ 1.2$\times 10^6$ $m_\odot$ out to ~ 110 kpc. this mass iscomparable to the carbon mass in the ism and more than the carbon masscurrently in stars of these galaxies. the c iv absorption seen around thesesub-l* galaxies can account for almost two-thirds of all $w_r$&gt; 100 m$\aa$ c ivabsorption detected at low z. comparing the c iv covering fraction withhydrodynamical simulations, we find that an energy-driven wind model isconsistent with the observations whereas a wind model of constant velocityfails to reproduce the cgm or the galaxy properties.

1406.5068	star formation and stellar mass assembly in dark matter halos: from  giants to dwarfs	the empirical model of lu et al. 2014 is updated with recent data and used tostudy galaxy star formation and assembly histories. at $z &gt; 2$, the predictedgalaxy stellar mass functions are steep, and a significant amount of starformation is hosted by low-mass haloes that may be missed in currentobservations. most of the stars in cluster centrals formed earlier than$z\approx 2$ but have been assembled much later. milky way mass galaxies havehad on-going star formation without significant mergers since $z\approx 2$, andare thus free of significant (classic) bulges produced by major mergers. inmassive clusters, stars bound in galaxies and scattered in the halo form ahomogeneous population that is old and with solar metallicity. in contrast, inmilky way mass systems the two components form two distinct populations, withhalo stars being older and poorer in metals by a factor of $\approx 3$. dwarfgalaxies in haloes with $m_{\rm h} &lt; 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ have experienced astar formation burst accompanied by major mergers at $z &gt; 2$, followed by anearly constant star formation rate after $z = 1$. the early burst leaves asignificant old stellar population that is distributed in spheroids.

1408.2531	the impact of environment and mergers on the hi content of galaxies in  hydrodynamic simulations	we quantitatively examine the effects of accretion and environment on the hicontent of galaxies within a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation thatreproduces basic observed trends of hi in galaxies. we show that our modelbroadly reproduces the observed scatter in hi at a given stellar mass asquantified by the hi mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the hirichness versus local galaxy density. this shows that the predicted hifluctuations and environmental effects are roughly consistent with data withfew minor discrepancies. for satellite galaxies in &gt;= 10^12m_* halos, the hirichness distribution is bimodal and drops towards the largest halo masses. thedepletion rate of hi once a galaxy enters a more massive halo is more rapid athigher halo mass, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which showsmuch less variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. this suggeststhat, up to halo mass scales probed here (&lt;= 10^14m_*), star formation ismainly attenuated by starvation, but hi is additionally removed by strippingonce a hot gaseous halo is present. in low mass halos, the hi richness ofsatellites is independent of radius, while in high mass halos they becomegas-poor towards the center. we show that the gas fraction of satellite andcentral galaxies decreases from z=5 to z=0,tracking each other until z~1 afterwhich the satellites' hi content drops much more quickly, particularly for thehighest halo masses. mergers somewhat increase the hi richness and its scatterabout the mean relation, tracking the metallicity in a way consistent witharising from inflow fluctuations, while star formation is significantly boostedrelative to hi.

1503.02084	baryon cycling in the low-redshift circumgalactic medium: a comparison  of simulations to the cos-halos survey	we analyze the low-redshift (z~0.2) circumgalactic medium by comparingabsorption-line data from the cos-halos survey to absorption around a matchedgalaxy sample from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. the modelsinclude different prescriptions for galactic outflows, namely hybridenergy/momentum driven wind (ezw), and constant winds (cw). we extract forcomparison direct observables including equivalent widths, covering factors,ion ratios, and kinematics. both wind models are generally in good agreementwith these observations for hi and certain low ionization metal lines, but showpoorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including siiii and ovithat are well-observed by cos-halos. these discrepancies suggest that both windmodels predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/orthat the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. this may reflect our modelassumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. our ezw simulationincludes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heatingits ism gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to bebroadly consistent with observations, but also substantial ovi absorption thatis inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in thereal universe does not cool. at impact parameters of &lt;50 kpc, recycling windsdominate the absorption of low ions and even hi, while ovi almost always arisesfrom metals ejected longer than 1 gyr ago. the similarity between the windmodels is surprising, since we show that they differ substantially in theirpredicted amount and phase distribution of halo gas. we show that thissimilarity owes mainly to our comparison here at fixed stellar mass rather thanat fixed halo mass in our previous works, which suggests that cgm propertiesare more closely tied to the stellar mass of galaxies rather than halo mass.

(2015): radiative physics +classic sph can produce entropy cores. furthermore, the inclusion/absence ofagn feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellarcontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and afalling central entropy profile. however, agn feedback does strongly affect theoverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducingsensibly the stellar fraction.

1512.01251	the growth and enrichment of the intragroup gas	the thermal and chemical properties of the hot diffuse intragroup medium(igrm) provide important constraints on the feedback processes associated withmassive galaxy formation and evolution. here we explore these constraints via adetailed analysis of the global properties of simulated z&lt;3 galaxy groups froma cosmological simulation that includes a well-constrained prescription forstellar/supernovae-powered galactic outflows but no agn feedback. our aims areto (a) establish a baseline against which we will compare future models; (b)identify model successes due to stellar/supernovae-powered outflows; and (c)pinpoint features that signal the need for, and constrain the nature of, agnfeedback.  our simulation successfully reproduces key observed z=0 group igrmproperties, including the various x-ray lx - tx - entropy scaling relations,for all but the most massive groups. the z&lt;1 redshift evolution of these alsoagree with observations. contrary to expectations, the simulated groups' igrmdoes not suffer catastrophic cooling. yet, the z=0 group stellar mass is ~ 2xtoo large. this is due to the build-up of cold gas in the massive galaxiesbefore they are incorporated inside groups. this in turn indicates that otherfeedback mechanisms must activate in real galaxies once their stellar massesgrow to a few x 10^{10} m_sun. we show that these must be powerful enough toexpel a significant fraction of the gas from the galactic halos. gentlemaintenance-mode (quenching) agn feedback, as seen in galaxy clusters, will notdo. just as importantly, we find that the stellar/supernovae-powered winds areessential for understanding the igrm metal abundances. our simulation is ableto reproduce the observed relationship between the global igrm iron and siliconabundance and the group x-ray temperature, and these results ought to berelatively insensitive to the addition of agn feedback.

astro-ph;0001089	constraints on cosmological parameters from the lyman-alpha forest power  spectrum and cobe-dmr	we combine cobe-dmr measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropywith a recent measurement of the mass power spectrum at redshift z=2.5 from lyaforest data to derive constraints on cosmological parameters and test theinflation+cdm scenario of structure formation. by treating the inflationaryspectral index n as a free parameter, we can find successful fits to the cobeand lya forest constraints in omega_m=1 models with and without massiveneutrinos and in low-omega_m models with and without a cosmological constant.within each class of model, the combination of cobe and the lya forest p(k)constrains a parameter combination of the form (omega_m h^a n^b omega_b^c),with different indices for each case. this new constraint breaks some of thedegeneracies in cosmological parameter determinations from other measurements.the lya forest p(k) provides the first measurement of the slope of the linearmass power spectrum on ~mpc scales, and it confirms a basic prediction of theinflationary cdm scenario: a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primevalfluctuations (n~1) that bends towards k^{n-4} on small scales. consideringadditional observational data, we find that cobe-normalized, omega_m=1 modelsthat match the lya forest p(k) do not match the observed masses of rich galaxyclusters and that a low-omega_m model with a cosmological constant provides thebest overall fit, even without the direct evidence for cosmic acceleration fromsupernovae. modest improvements in the lya forest p(k) measurement couldgreatly restrict the allowable region of parameter space for cdm models,constrain the contribution of tensor fluctuations to cmb anisotropy, andachieve a more stringent test of the current consensus model of structureformation.

astro-ph;0002422	simulating the effects of intergalactic grey dust	using a high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, we present amethod to constrain extinction due to intergalactic grey dust based on theobserved magnitudes of distant type ia supernovae. we apply several simpleprescriptions to relate the intergalactic dust density to the gas density inthe simulation, thereby obtaining dust extinctions that may be directlycompared to the observed distribution of supernova magnitudes. our analysis issensitive to the spatial distribution of grey dust, but is not dependent on itsintrinsic properties such as its opacity or grain size. we present anapplication of our technique to the supernova data of perlmutter et al., whofind that their high redshift sample is ~0.2 magnitudes fainter than theexpectation for a non-accelerating, low-density universe. we find that for greydust to be responsible, it must be distributed quite smoothly, e.g., tracingintergalactic gas. more realistic dust distributions, such as dust tracing themetal density, are inconsistent with observations at the 1.5-2 sigma level.upcoming observations and improved modelling of the dust distribution shouldlead to stronger constraints on intergalactic grey dust extinction.

astro-ph;0005340	high-redshift galaxies in cold dark matter models	we use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations to predict the star formationproperties of high-redshift galaxies (z=2-6) in five variants of theinflationary cold dark matter scenario, paying particular attention to z=3, theredshift of the largest "lyman-break galaxy" (lbg) samples. because we link thestar formation timescale to the local gas density, the rate at which a galaxyforms stars is governed mainly by the rate at which it accretes cooled gas fromthe surrounding medium. at z=3, star formation in most of the simulatedgalaxies is steady on 200 myr timescales, and the instantaneous star formationrate (sfr) is correlated with total stellar mass. however, there is enoughscatter in this correlation that a sample selected above a given sfr thresholdmay contain galaxies with a fairly wide range of masses. the redshift historyand global density of star formation in the simulations depend mainly on theamplitude of mass fluctuations in the underlying cosmological model. the threemodels whose mass fluctuation amplitudes agree with recent analyses of thelyman-alpha forest also reproduce the observed luminosity function of lbgsreasonably well, though the dynamic range of the comparison is small and thetheoretical and observational uncertainties are large. the models with higherand lower amplitudes appear to predict too much and too little star formation,respectively, though they are not clearly ruled out. the intermediate amplitudemodels predict sfr ~ 30-40 msun/yr for galaxies with a surface density 1 perarcmin^2 per unit redshift at z=3. they predict much higher surface densitiesat lower sfr, and significant numbers of galaxies with sfr &gt; 10 msun/yr at z &gt;=5.

astro-ph;0006345	metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium at z=3 by galactic winds	studies of quasar absorption lines reveal that the low density intergalacticmedium at z ~ 3 is enriched to 0.001-0.01 solar metallicity. this enrichmentmay have occurred in an early generation of population iii stars at redshift z&gt;~ 10, by protogalaxies at 6 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 10, or by larger galaxies at 3 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 6.this paper addresses the third possibility by calculating the enrichment of theigm at z &gt;~ 3 by galaxies of baryonic mass &gt;~ 10^8.5 solar masses. we usealready completed cosmological simulations to which we add a prescription forchemical evolution and metal ejection by winds, assuming that the winds haveproperties similar to those observed in local starbursts and lyman-breakgalaxies. results are given for a number of representative models, and we alsoexamine the properties of the galaxies responsible for the enrichment as wellas the physical effects responsible for wind escape and propagation. we findthat winds of velocity &gt;~ 200-300 km/s are capable of enriching the igm to themean level observed, though many low-density regions would remain metal free.calibrated by observations of lyman-break galaxies, our calculations suggestthat most galaxies at z &gt;~ 3 should drive winds that can escape and propagateto large radii. the primary effect limiting the enrichment of low-density iggas in our scenario is then the travel time from high- to low-density regions,implying that the metallicity of low-density gas is a strong function ofredshift.

astro-ph;0006346	enrichment of the intergalactic medium by radiation pressure driven dust  efflux	the presence of metals in hot cluster gas and in ly-alpha absorbers, as wellas the mass-metallicity relation of observed galaxies, suggest that galaxieslose a significant fraction of their metals to the intergalactic medium (igm).theoretical studies of this process have concentrated on metal removal bydynamical processes or supernova-driven winds. here, we investigate theenrichment of the igm by the expulsion of dust grains from galaxies byradiation pressure. we use already completed cosmological simulations, to whichwe add dust assuming that most dust can reach the equilibrium point betweenradiation pressure and gravitational forces. we find that the expulsion of dustand its subsequent (partial) destruction in the igm can plausibly account forthe observed level of c and si enrichment of the z=3 igm. at low-z, dustejection and destruction could explain a substantial fraction of the metals inclusters, but it cannot account for all of the chemical species observed. dustexpelled by radiation pressure could give clusters a visual opacity of up to0.2-0.5 mag in their central regions even after destruction by the hotintracluster medium; this value is interestingly close to limits and claimedobservations of cluster extinction. we also comment on the implications of ourresults for the opacity of the general igm. finally, we suggest a possible`hybrid' scenario in which winds expel gas and dust into galaxy halos butradiation pressure distributes the dust uniformly through the igm.

astro-ph;0007205	cooling radiation and the lyman-alpha luminosity of forming galaxies	we examine the cooling radiation from forming galaxies in hydrodynamicsimulations of the lcdm model (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant),focusing on the ly-alpha line luminosities of high-redshift systems. primordialcomposition gas condenses within dark matter potential wells, forming objectswith masses and sizes comparable to the luminous regions of observed galaxies.as expected, the energy radiated in this process is comparable to thegravitational binding energy of the baryons, and the total cooling luminosityof the galaxy population peaks at z ~= 2. however, in contrast to the classicalpicture of gas cooling from the \sim 10^6 k virial temperature of a typicaldark matter halo, we find that most of the cooling radiation is emitted by gaswith t &lt; 20,000 k. as a consequence, roughly 50% of this cooling radiationemerges in the ly-alpha line. while a galaxy's cooling luminosity is usuallysmaller than the ionizing continuum luminosity of its young stars, the two arecomparable in the most massive systems, and the cooling radiation is producedat larger radii, where the ly-alpha photons are less likely to be extinguishedby dust. we suggest, in particular, that cooling radiation could explain thetwo large (\sim 100 kpc), luminous (l_{ly-alpha} \sim 10^{44} erg s^{-1})``blobs'' of ly-alpha emission found in steidel et al.'s (1999) narrow bandsurvey of a z = 3 proto-cluster. our simulations predict objects of theobserved luminosity at about the right space density, and radiative transfereffects can account for the observed sizes and line widths. we discussobservable tests of this hypothesis for the nature of the ly-alpha blobs, andwe present predictions for the contribution of cooling radiation to thely-alpha luminosity function of galaxies as a function of redshift.

astro-ph;0010345	hydrodynamic simulation of the cosmological x-ray background	(abridged) we use a hydrodynamic simulation of a lambdacdm model to predictthe extragalactic x-ray background (xrb), focussing on emission from theintergalactic medium (igm). we also include x-rays from point sourcesassociated with galaxies in the simulation, and make maps of the angulardistribution of the emission. we find that filaments in the maps are notevident, being diluted by projection. in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, the meanintensity of radiation from intergalactic and cluster gas is 2.3*10^-12ergdeg^-2cm^-2s^-1, 35% of the total soft band emission. this is compatible atthe ~1 sigma level with estimates of the unresolved soft background from rosatand {\it chandra}. only 4% of the hard (2-10 kev) emission is associated withthe igm. relative to agn flux, the igm component peaks at a lower redshift(median z~0.45) so its clustering makes an important contribution to that ofthe total xrb. the angular correlations on 0.1-10 arcmin scales aresignificant, with an amplitude roughly consistent with an extrapolation ofrecent rosat results to small scales. a cross-correlation of the xrb againstnearby galaxies taken from a simulated redshift survey also yields a strongsignal from the igm. although some recent papers have argued that the expectedsoft band intensity from gas in galaxy, group, and cluster halos would exceedxrb limits unless much of the gas is expelled by supernova feedback, we obtainreasonable compatibility with current observations in a simulation thatincorporates cooling, star formation, and only modest feedback. a prediction ofour model is that the unresolved portion of the soft xrb will remain mostlyunresolved.

astro-ph;0012324	towards a precise measurement of matter clustering: lyman-alpha forest  data at redshifts 2-4	we measure the filling factor, correlation function, and power spectrum oftransmitted flux in a large sample of lya forest spectra, comprised of 30 keckhires spectra and 23 keck lris spectra. we infer the linear matter powerspectrum p(k) from the flux power spectrum p_f(k), using an improved version ofthe method of croft et al. (1998) that accounts for the influence of z-spacedistortions, non- linearity, and thermal broadening on p_f(k). the evolution ofthe shape and amplitude of p(k) over the range z= 2-4 is consistent withgravitational instability, implying that non-gravitational fluctuations do notmake a large contribution. our fiducial measurement of p(k) comes from datawith &lt;z&gt; = 2.72. it has amplitude delta^2(k_p)=0.74^0.20_-0.16 at wavenumberk_p=0.03 (km/s)^-1 and is well described by a power-law of index -2.43 +/- 0.06or by a cdm-like power spectrum with shape parameter gamma'=1.3^+0.7_-0.5*10^-3(km/s) at z=2.72. for omega_m=0.4, omega_lam=0.6, the best-fit gamma =0.16(h^-1mpc)^-1, in good agreement with the 2df galaxy redshift survey, and thebest-fit sigma_8=0.82 (gamma/0.15)^-0.44. matching the observed cluster massfunction and our delta^2(k_p) in spatially flat models requiresomega_m=0.38^+0.10_-0.08 + 2.2 (gamma-0.15). matching delta^2(k_p) incobe-normalized, flat cdm models with no tensor fluctuations requires omega_m =(0.29 +/-0.04) n^-2.89 h_65^-1.9. the lya forest complements other probes ofp(k) by constraining a regime of redshift and lengthscale not accessible byother means, and the consistency of these inferred parameters with independentestimates provides further support for inflation, cold dark matter, and vacuumenergy (abridged).

astro-ph;0105065	metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium in cosmological simulations	observations have established that the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm) atz ~ 3 is enriched to ~0.1-1% solar metallicity and that the hot gas in largeclusters of galaxies (icm) is enriched to 1/3-1/2 solar metallicity at z=0.metals in the igm may have been removed from galaxies (in which they presumablyform) during dynamical encounters between galaxies, by ram-pressure stripping,by supernova-driven winds, or as radiation-pressure driven dust efflux. thisstudy develops a method of investigating the chemical enrichment of the igm andof galaxies, using already completed cosmological simulations. to thesesimulations, we add dust and (gaseous) metals, distributing the dust and metalsin the gas according to three simple parameterized prescriptions, one for eachenrichment mechanism. these prescriptions are formulated to capture the basicejection physics, and calibrated when possible with empirical data. our resultsindicate that dynamical removal of metals from &gt;~ 3*10^8 solar mass galaxiescannot account for the observed metallicity of low-column density ly-alphaabsorbers, and that dynamical removal from &gt;~ 3*10^10 solar mass galaxiescannot account for the icm metallicities. dynamical removal also fails toproduce a strong enough mass-metallicity relation in galaxies. in contrast,either wind or radiation-pressure ejection of metals from relatively largegalaxies can plausibly account for all three sets of observations (though it isunclear whether metals can be distributed uniformly enough in the low-densityregions without overly disturbing the igm, and whether clusters can be enrichedquite as much as observed). we investigate in detail how our results changewith variations in our assumed parameters, and how results for the differentejection processes compare.

astro-ph;0106282	the growth of galaxies in cosmological simulations of structure  formation	we use hydrodynamic simulations to examine how the baryonic components ofgalaxies are assembled, focusing on the relative importance of mergers andsmooth accretion in the formation of ~l_* systems. in our primary simulation,which models a (50\hmpc)^3 comoving volume of a lambda-dominated cold darkmatter universe, the space density of objects at our (64-particle) baryon massresolution threshold, m_c=5.4e10 m_sun, corresponds to that of observedgalaxies with l~l_*/4. galaxies above this threshold gain most of their mass byaccretion rather than by mergers. at the redshift of peak mass growth, z~2,accretion dominates over merging by about 4:1. the mean accretion rate pergalaxy declines from ~40 m_sun/yr at z=2 to ~10 m_sun/yr at z=0, while themerging rate peaks later (z~1) and declines more slowly, so by z=0 the ratio isabout 2:1. we cannot distinguish truly smooth accretion from merging withobjects below our mass resolution threshold, but extrapolating our measuredmass spectrum of merging objects, dp/dm ~ m^a with a ~ -1, implies thatsub-resolution mergers would add relatively little mass. the global starformation history in these simulations tracks the mass accretion rate ratherthan the merger rate. at low redshift, destruction of galaxies by mergers isapproximately balanced by the growth of new systems, so the comoving spacedensity of resolved galaxies stays nearly constant despite significant massevolution at the galaxy-by-galaxy level. the predicted merger rate at z&lt;~1agrees with recent estimates from close pairs in the cfrs and cnoc2 redshiftsurveys.

astro-ph;0107290	sub-mm galaxies in cosmological simulations	we study the predicted sub-mm emission from massive galaxies in a lambda-cdmuniverse, using hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. assuming that most ofthe emission from newly formed stars is absorbed and reradiated in therest-frame far-ir, we calculate the number of galaxies that would be detectedin sub-mm surveys conducted with scuba. the predicted number counts arestrongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature and emissivity law. withplausible choices for sed parameters (e.g., t=35 k, beta=1.0), the simulationpredictions reproduce the observed number counts above ~ 1 mjy. the sourceshave a broad redshift distribution with median z ~ 2, in reasonable agreementwith observational constraints. however, the predicted count distribution maybe too steep at the faint end, and the fraction of low redshift objects may belarger than observed.  in this physical model of the sub-mm galaxy population, the objects detectedin existing surveys consist mainly of massive galaxies (several m_*) formingstars fairly steadily over timescales ~ 10^8-10^9 years, at moderate rates ~100msun/yr. the typical descendants of these sub-mm sources are even more massivegalaxies, with old stellar populations, found primarily in dense environments.while the resolution of our simulations is not sufficient to determine galaxymorphologies, these properties support the proposed identification of sub-mmsources with massive ellipticals in the process of formation. the most robustand distinctive prediction of this model, stemming directly from the longtimescale and correspondingly moderate rate of star formation, is that thefar-ir seds of scuba sources have a relative high 850 micron luminosity for agiven bolometric luminosity.

astro-ph;0107293	the infuence of omega_baryon on high-redshift structure	we analyze high-redshift structure in three hydrodynamic simulations thathave identical initial conditions and cosmological parameters and differ onlyin the value of the baryon density parameter, omega_b=0.02, 0.05, 0.125.increasing omega_b does not change the fraction of baryons in the diffuse(unshocked) phase of the intergalactic medium, but it increases cooling ratesand therefore transfers some baryons from the shocked intergalactic phase tothe condensed phase associated with galaxies. predictions of lyman-alpha forestabsorption are almost unaffected by changes of omega_b provided that the uvbackground intensity is adjusted so that the mean opacity of the forest matchesthe observed value. the required uv background intensity scales as omega_b^1.7,and the higher photoionization rate increases the gas temperature in lowdensity regions. damped lyman-alpha absorption and lyman limit absorption bothincrease with increasing omega_b, though the impact is stronger for dampedabsorption and is weaker at z=4 than at z=2-3. the mass of cold gas and starsin high-redshift galaxies increases faster than omega_b but slower thanomega_b^2, and the global star formation rate scales approximately asomega_b^1.5. in the higher omega_b models, the fraction of baryonic materialwithin the virial radius of dark matter halos is usually higher than theuniversal fraction, indicating that gas dynamics and cooling can lead toover-representation of baryons in virialized systems. on the whole, our resultsimply a fairly intuitive picture of the influence of omega_b on high-redshiftstructure, and we provide scalings that can be used to estimate the impact ofomega_b uncertainties on the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations.

astro-ph;0110632	bar-driven dark halo evolution: a resolution of the cusp--core  controversy	simulations predict that the dark matter halos of galaxies should havecentral cusps, while those inferred from observed galaxies do not have cusps.we demonstrate, using both linear perturbation theory and n-body simulations,that a disk bar, which should be ubiquitous in forming galaxies, can producecores in cuspy cdm dark matter profiles within five bar orbital times.simulations of forming galaxies suggest that one of milky way size could have a10 kpc primordial bar; this bar will remove the cusp out to approximately 5 kpcin approximately 1.5 gigayears, while the disk only loses approximately 8% ofits original angular momentum. an inner lindblad-like resonance couples therotating bar to orbits at all radii through the cusp, transferring the barpattern angular momentum to the dark matter cusp, rapidly flattening it. thisresonance disappears for profiles with cores and is responsible for aqualitative difference in bar driven halo evolution with and without a cusp.this bar induced evolution will have a profound effect on the structure andevolution of almost all galaxies. hence, both to understand galaxy formationand evolution and to make predictions from theory it is necessary to resolvethese dynamical processes. unfortunately, correctly resolving these importantdynamical processes in ab initio calculations of galaxy formation is a dauntingtask, requiring at least 4,000,000 halo particles using our scf code, andprobably requiring many times more particles when using noisier tree, directsummation, or grid based techniques, the usual methods employed in suchcalculations.

astro-ph;0203319	x-ray absorption by the low-redshift intergalactic medium: a numerical  study of the lambda cdm model	using a hydrodynamic simulation of a lcdm universe, we investigate the "x-rayforest" absorption imprinted on the spectra of background quasars by theintervening intergalactic medium (igm). in agreement with previous studies, wefind that ovii and oviii produce the strongest absorption features. the strongoxygen absorbers that might be detectable with chandra or xmm-newton arise ingas with t ~ 10^6 k and overdensities delta &gt;~ 100 that are characteristic ofgalaxy groups. future x-ray missions could detect weaker oxygen absorptionproduced by gas with a wider range of temperatures and the lower densities ofunvirialized structures; they could also detect x-ray forest absorption by c,n, ne, fe, and possibly si. if the igm metallicity is 0.1 solar, then thepredicted number of systems strong enough for a ~5\sigma detection with chandraor xmm-newton is extremely low, though scatter in metallicity would increasethe number of strong absorbers even if the mean metallicity remained the same.our simulation reproduces the high observed incidence of ovi absorbers (in theuv), and the most promising strategy for finding the x-ray forest is to searchat the redshifts of known ovi systems, thus reducing the signal-to-noisethreshold required for a significant detection. however, while many oviabsorbers have associated ovii or oviii absorption, the ovi systems trace onlythe low temperature phases of the x-ray forest, and a full accounting of thestrong ovii and oviii systems will require a mission with the anticipatedcapabilities of constellation-x. the large effective area of the xeus satellitewould make it an extremely powerful instrument for studying the igm, measuringx-ray forest absorption by a variety of elements and revealing the shock-heatedfilaments that may be an important reservoir of cosmic baryons.

astro-ph;0209563	lyman break galaxies and the lyman-alpha forest	we use hydrodynamic simulations to predict correlations between lya forestabsorption and galaxies at redshift z~3. the probability distribution function(pdf) of lya flux decrements shifts systematically towards higher values in thevicinity of galaxies, reflecting the overdense environments in which thesegalaxies reside. the predicted signal remains strong in spectra smoothed over50-200 km/s, allowing tests with moderate resolution quasar spectra. the strongbias of high redshift galaxies towards high density regions imprints a clearsignature on the flux pdf, but the predictions are not sensitive to galaxybaryon mass or star formation rate, and they are similar for galaxies and fordark matter halos. the dependence of the flux pdf on galaxy proximity issensitive to redshift determination errors, with rms errors of 150-300 km/ssubstantially weakening the predicted trends. on larger scales, the mean galaxyoverdensity in a cube of 5 or 10 mpc/h (comoving) is strongly correlated withthe mean lya flux decrement on a line of sight through the cube center. theslope of the correlation is ~3 times steeper for galaxies than for dark matteras a result of galaxy bias. the predicted large scale correlation is inqualitative agreement with recently reported observational results. however,observations also show a drop in absorption in the immediate vicinity ofgalaxies, which our models do not predict even if we allow the galaxies or agnswithin them to be ionizing sources. this decreased absorption could be asignature of galaxy feedback on the surrounding igm, perhaps via galacticwinds. peculiar velocities often allow gas at comoving distances ~1.5 mpc/h toproduce saturated absorption at the galaxy redshift, so any feedback mechanismmust suppress neutral hydrogen out to these radii to match the data.

astro-ph;0212355	the galaxy proximity effect in the lyman-alpha forest	hydrodynamic cosmological simulations predict that the average opacity of thely-alpha forest should increase in the neighborhood of galaxies becausegalaxies form in dense environments. recent observations (adelberger et al.2002) confirm this expectation at large scales, but they show a decrease ofabsorption at comoving separations delta_r &lt;~ 1 mpc/h. we show that thisdiscrepancy is statistically significant, especially for the innermost datapoint at delta_r &lt;= 0.5 mpc/h, even though this data point rests on threegalaxy-quasar pairs. galaxy redshift errors of the expected magnitude areinsufficient to resolve the conflict. peculiar velocities allow gas at comovingdistances &gt;~ 1 mpc/h to produce saturated absorption at the galaxy redshift,putting stringent requirements on any ``feedback'' solution. localphotoionization is insufficient, even if we allow for recurrent agn activitythat keeps the neutral hydrogen fraction below its equilibrium value. a simple``wind'' model that eliminates all neutral hydrogen in spheres around theobserved galaxies can marginally explain the data, but only if the winds extendto comoving radii ~1.5 mpc/h.

astro-ph;0212357	the halo occupation distribution and the physics of galaxy formation	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the bias between galaxiesand dark matter by specifying (a) the probability p(n|m) that a halo of virialmass m contains n galaxies of a particular class and (b) the relativedistributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. we calculate predictedhods for a lambda-cdm cosmological model using an sph hydrodynamic simulationand a semi-analytic (sa) galaxy formation model. although the two methodspredict different galaxy mass functions, their hod predictions agree remarkablywell. for mass-selected samples, the mean occupation &lt;n(m)&gt; exhibits a sharpcutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau for &lt;n&gt;~1-2, and a moresteeply rising high occupancy regime. at low &lt;n&gt;, the mean pair and triplecounts are well below poisson expectations, with important consequences forsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. the hod dependsstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxiesand low mass halos by young galaxies. the sph simulation supports severalsimplifying assumptions about hod bias: the most massive galaxy in a halousually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as thedark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of thehalo's larger scale environment. by applying the sph and sa hods to a largevolume n-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight, observabledepartures from a power-law galaxy correlation function. the predicted hods areclosely tied to the underlying galaxy formation physics, they offer usefulguidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be testedempirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys.

astro-ph;0302543	the optical and near-infrared properties of galaxies: i. luminosity and  stellar mass functions	we use a large sample of galaxies from the two micron all sky survey (2mass)and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to calculate galaxy luminosity andstellar mass functions in the local universe. we estimate k-corrections,evolution corrections, and stellar mass-to-light ratios (m/ls) by fitting thegalaxy colors with simple models. our optical and near-infrared luminosityfunctions agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrareddeterminations within the uncertainties. we argue that 2mass is biased againstlow surface brightness galaxies, and use sdss plus our knowledge of stellarpopulations to estimate that the true k-band luminosity function has a steeperfaint end slope than the direct estimate. assuming a universally-applicablestellar initial mass function (imf), we derive the stellar mass function ofgalaxies. the faint end slope slope for the stellar mass function is steeperthan -1.1, reflecting the low stellar m/ls characteristic of low-mass galaxies.we estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universeomega* h = 0.0020+/-0.0006 by assuming an imf as rich in low-mass stars asallowed by observations of galaxy dynamics. finally, we find that thecharacteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than forlater types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than forearlier types. accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at leasthalf, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is inearly-type galaxies. we present also sdss/2mass color-m/l correlations, anupdated discussion of near-infrared stellar m/l estimates, and thevolume-corrected distribution of g and k-band stellar m/ls as a function ofstellar mass.

astro-ph;0303270	on the relationship between cooling flows and bubbles	a common feature of the x-ray bubbles observed in chandra images of some"cooling flow" clusters is that they appear to be surrounded by bright, coolshells. temperature maps of a few nearby luminous clusters reveal that theshells consist of the coolest gas in the clusters -- much cooler than thesurrounding medium. using simple models, we study the effects of this coolemission on the inferred cooling flow properties of clusters. we find that theintroduction of bubbles into model clusters that do not have cooling flowsresults in temperature and surface brightness profiles that resemble those seenin nearby "cooling flow" clusters. they also approximately reproduce the recentxmm-newton and chandra observations of a high minimum temperature of 1-3 kev.hence, bubbles, if present, must be taken into account when inferring thephysical properties of the icm. in the case of some clusters, bubbles mayaccount entirely for these observed features, calling into question theirdesignation as clusters with cooling flows. however, since not all nearby"cooling flow" clusters show bubble-like features, we suggest that there may bea diverse range of physical phenomena that give rise to the same observedfeatures.

astro-ph;0303592	the clustering dipole of the local universe from the two micron all sky  survey	the unprecedented sky coverage and photometric uniformity of the two micronall sky survey (2mass) provides a rich resource for investigating the galaxiespopulating the local universe. a full characterization of the large-scaleclustering distribution is important for theoretical studies of structureformation. 2mass offers an all-sky view of the local galaxy population at 2.15micron, unbiased by young stellar light and minimally affected by dust. we use2mass to map the local distribution of galaxies, identifying the largeststructures in the nearby universe. the inhomogeneity of these structures causesan acceleration on the local group of galaxies, which can be seen in the dipoleof the cosmic microwave background (cmb). we find that the direction of the2mass clustering dipole is 11 degrees from the cmb dipole, confirming that thelocal galaxy distribution accelerates the local group. from the magnitude ofthe dipole we find a value of the linear bias parameter b=1.37 +/- 0.3 in thek_s-band. the 2mass clustering dipole is 19 degrees from the latest measurementof the dipole using galaxies detected by the infrared astronomical satellite(iras) suggesting that bias may be non-linear in some wavebands.

astro-ph;0304005	the galaxy angular correlation functions and power spectrum from the two  micron all sky survey	we calculate the angular correlation function of galaxies in the two micronall sky survey. we minimize the possible contamination by stars, dust, seeingand sky brightness by studying their cross correlation with galaxy density, andlimiting the galaxy sample accordingly. we measure the correlation function atscales between 1-18 arcdegs using a half million galaxies. we find a best fitpower law to the correlation function has a slope of 0.76 and an amplitude of0.11. however, there are statistically significant oscillations around thispower law. the largest oscillation occurs at about 0.8 degrees, correspondingto 2.8 h^{-1} mpc at the median redshift of our survey, as expected in halooccupation distribution descriptions of galaxy clustering.  we invert the angular correlation function using singular value decompositionto measure the three-dimensional power spectrum and find that it too is in goodagreement with previous measurements. a dip seen in the power spectrum at smallwavenumber k is statistically consistent with cdm-type power spectra. a fit ofcdm-type power spectra to k &lt; 0.2 h mpc^{-1} give constraints of\gamma_{eff}=0.116 and \sigma_8=0.96. this suggest a k_s-band linear bias of1.1+/-0.2. this \gamma_{eff} is different from the wmap cmb derived value. onsmall scales the power-law shape of our power spectrum is shallower than thatderived for the sdss. these facts together imply a biasing of these differentgalaxies that might be nonlinear, that might be either waveband or luminositydependent, and that might have a nonlocal origin.

astro-ph;0406633	interpreting the relationship between galaxy luminosity, color and  environment	we study the relationship between galaxy luminosity, color, and environmentin a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation. we compare the predictedrelationship with that found for sdss galaxies and find that the modelsuccessfully predicts most of the qualitative features seen in the data, butalso shows some interesting differences. specifically, the simulation predictsthat the local density around bright red galaxies is a strong increasingfunction of luminosity, but does not depend much on color at fixed luminosity.moreover, we show that this is due to central galaxies in dark matter haloswhose baryonic masses correlate strongly with halo mass. the simulation alsopredicts that the local density around blue galaxies is a strong increasingfunction of color, but does not depend much on luminosity at fixed color. weshow that this is due to satellite galaxies in halos whose stellar agescorrelate with halo mass. finally, the simulation fails to predict theluminosity dependence of environment observed around low luminosity redgalaxies. however, we show that this is most likely due to the simulation'slimited resolution. a study of a higher resolution, smaller volume simulationsuggests that this dependence is caused by the fact that all low luminosity redgalaxies are satellites in massive halos, whereas intermediate luminosity redgalaxies are a mixture of satellites in massive halos and central galaxies inless massive halos.

astro-ph;0407095	how do galaxies get their gas?	we examine the temperature history of gas accreted by forming galaxies in sphsimulations. about half the gas shock heats to roughly the virial temperatureof the galaxy potential well before cooling, condensing, and forming stars, butthe other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lowertemperatures, typically t&lt;10^5 k, and the histogram of maximum gas temperaturesis clearly bimodal. the "cold mode" of gas accretion dominates for low massgalaxies (m_baryon &lt; 10^{10.3}msun or m_halo &lt; 10^{11.4}msun), while theconventional "hot mode" dominates the growth of high mass systems. coldaccretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficientlydraw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. thegalaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence ofcold and hot accretion rates, with cold mode dominating at high redshift and inlow density regions today, and hot mode dominating in group and clusterenvironments at low redshift. star formation rates closely track accretionrates, and we discuss the physics behind the observed environment and redshiftdependence of galactic scale star formation. if we allowed hot accretion to besuppressed by conduction or agn feedback, then the simulation predictions wouldchange in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colors ofellipticals and the cutoff of the galaxy luminosity function. the transitionbetween cold and hot accretion at m_h ~ 10^{11.4}msun is similar to that foundby birnboim &amp; dekel (2003) using 1-d simulations and analytic arguments. thecorresponding baryonic mass is tantalizingly close to the scale at whichkauffmann et al.

astro-ph;0408564	theoretical models of the halo occupation distribution: separating  central and satellite galaxies	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the relation betweengalaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. theproperties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those ofsatellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. using asmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulation and a semi-analytic (sa)galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central andsatellite galaxies to the hod, more specifically to the probability p(n|m) thata halo of virial mass m contains n galaxies of a particular class. in agreementwith earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupationfunction &lt;n&gt; for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximatedby a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, andthat the distribution of satellite numbers is close to poisson at fixed halomass. for galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, thereis a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass mmin required to hosta central galaxy and the mass m1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite,with m1 ~ 14 mmin (sph) or m1 ~ 18 mmin (sa). the mean occupation number ofyoung galaxies exhibits a local minimum at m ~ 10 mmin where halos are toomassive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to hostsatellites. we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halomass cannot be described by a schechter function because central galaxiesproduce a "bump" at high masses. we suggest parameterizations for the hod andthe conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxyclustering. many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent resultsinferred from clustering in the sloan digital sky survey.

astro-ph;0504172	measuring the halo mass of z=3 damped ly-alpha absorbers from the  absorber-galaxy cross-correlation	[abridged] we test the reliability of a method to measure the mean halo massof damped ly-alpha absorbers (dlas). the method is based on measuring the ratioof the cross-correlation between dlas and galaxies to the auto-correlation ofthe galaxies themselves ($w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$), which is (in linear theory)the ratio of their bias factor. this is shown to be true irrespective of thegalaxy redshift distribution, provided that one uses the same galaxies for thetwo correlation functions. the method is applicable to all redshifts. here, wefocus on z=3 dlas and we demonstrate that the method robustly constrains themean dla halo mass using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) cosmologicalsimulations. if we use the bias formalism of mo &amp; white with the dla and galaxymass distributions of these simulations, we predict a bias ratio of 0.771.direct measurement from the simulations of $w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$ st yields aratio of 0.73+/-0.08, in excellent agreement with that prediction.equivalently, inverting the measured correlation ratio to infer a mean dla halomass yields (log. averaging, in solar units) &lt;log(m_dla)&gt; =11.13+/-013, inexcellent agreement with the true value in the simulations: 11.16. the cross-correlation method thus appears to yield a robust estimate of the average hosthalo mass even though the dlas and the galaxies occupy a broad mass spectrum ofhalos, and massive halos contain multiple galaxies with dlas. we show that theinferred mean dla halo mass is independent of the galaxy sub-sample used, i.e.the cross-correlation technique is also reliable. our results imply that thecross-correlation length between dlas and lbgs is predicted to be, at most,2.85 mpc. future observations will soon distinguish models in which dlas are inlow mass halos from those in which dlas are in massive halos.

astro-ph;0506516	preheating by previrialization and its impact on galaxy formation	we use recent observations of the hi-mass function to constrain galaxyformation. the data conflicts with the standard model where most of the gas ina low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas thatis depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the diskbecomes gravitationally stable. a consistent model can be found if low-masshaloes are embedded in a preheated medium, with a specific gas entropy ~ 10kevcm^2. such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxyluminosity function. we propose a preheating model where the medium aroundlow-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking. since gravitationaltidal fields suppress the formation of low-mass haloes while promoting that ofpancakes, the formation of massive pancakes precedes that of the low-masshaloes within them. we demonstrate that the progenitors of present-day darkmatter haloes with m&lt;10^{12}h^{-1}\msun were embedded in pancakes of masses$~5x10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$ at z~2. the formation of such pancakes heats the gas toa temperature of 5x10^5k and compresses it to an overdensity of ~10. such gashas a cooling time that exceeds the age of the universe at z~2, and has aspecific entropy of ~15kev cm^2, almost exactly the amount required to explainthe stellar and hi mass functions.

astro-ph;0508166	the bar--halo interaction--i. from fundamental dynamics to revised  n-body requirements	only through resonances can non-axisymmetric features such as spiral arms andbars exert torques over large scales and change the overall structure of anear-equilibrium galaxy. we describe the resonant interaction mechanism indetail and derive explicit criteria for the particle number required tosimulate these dynamical processes accurately using n-body simulations andillustrate them with numerical experiments. to do this, we perform directnumerical solution of perturbation theory and make detailed comparisons withn-body simulations. the criteria include: sufficient particle coverage in phasespace near the resonance and enough particles to minimize gravitationalpotential fluctuations that will change the dynamics of the resonant encounter.some of our more surprising findings are as follows. first, theinner-lindblad-like resonance (ilr), responsible for coupling the bar to thecentral halo cusp, requires almost 10^9 equal mass particles within the virialradius for a milky-way-like bar in an nfw profile. second, orbits that lingernear the resonance receive more angular momentum than orbits that move throughthe resonance quickly. small-scale fluctuations present in state-of-the-artparticle-particle simulations can knock orbits out of resonance, preventingthem from lingering and, thereby, decrease the torque. the required particlenumbers are sufficiently high for scenarios of interest that apparentconvergence in particle number is misleading: the convergence is in thenoise-dominated regime. state-of-the-art simulations are not adequate to followall aspects of secular evolution driven by the bar-halo interaction. we presenta procedure to test the requirements for individual n-body codes for the actualproblem of interest.

astro-ph;0508624	on the origin of cold dark matter halo density profiles	n-body simulations predict that cdm halo-assembly occurs in two phases: 1) afast accretion phase with a rapidly deepening potential well; and 2) a slowaccretion phase characterised by a gentle addition of mass to the outer halowith little change in the inner potential well. we demonstrate, usingone-dimensional simulations, that this two-phase accretion leads to cdm halosof the nfw form and provides physical insight into the properties of the massaccretion history that influence the final profile. assuming that thevelocities of cdm particles are effectively isotropised by fluctuations in thegravitational potential during the fast accretion phase, we show thatgravitational collapse in this phase leads to an inner profile rho(r) ~ r^{-1}.slow accretion onto an established potential well leads to an outer profilewith rho(r) ~ r^{-3}. the concentration of a halo is determined by the fractionof mass that is accreted during the fast accretion phase. using an ensemble ofrealistic mass accretion histories, we show that the model predictions of thedependence of halo concentration on halo formation time, and hence thedependence of halo concentration on halo mass, and the distribution of haloconcentrations all match those found in cosmological n-body simulations. usinga simple analytic model that captures much of the important physics we showthat the inner r^{-1} profile of cdm halos is a natural result of hierarchicalmass assembly with a initial phase of rapid accretion.

astro-ph;0509007	probing galaxy formation with he ii cooling lines	using high resolution cosmological simulations, we study hydrogen and heliumgravitational cooling radiation. we focus on the heii cooling lines, whicharise from gas with a different temperature history (t_max ~ 10^5k) than hiline emitting gas. we examine whether three major atomic cooling lines, hi1216a, heii 1640a and heii 304a are observable, finding that hi 1216a and heii1640a cooling emission at z=2-3 are potentially detectable with deep narrowband (r&gt;100) imaging and/or spectroscopy from the ground. while the expectedstrength of hi 1216a cooling emission depends strongly on the treatment of theself-shielded phase of the igm in the simulations, our predictions for the heii1640a line are more robust because the heii 1640a emissivity is negligiblebelow t~10^4.5 k and less sensitive to the uv background. although heii 1640acooling emission is fainter than hi 1216a by at least a factor of 10 and,unlike hi 1216a, might not be resolved spatially with current observationalfacilities, it is more suitable to study gas accretion in the galaxy formationprocess because it is optically thin and less contaminated by the recombinationlines from star-forming galaxies. the heii 1640a line can be used todistinguish among mechanisms for powering the so-called "lyman alpha blobs" --including gravitational cooling radiation, photoionization by stellarpopulations, and starburst-driven superwinds -- because (1) heii 1640a emissionis limited to very low metallicity (log(z/z_sun) &lt; -5.3) and population iiistars, and (2) the blob's kinematics are probed unambiguously through the heii1640a line width, which, for cooling radiation, is narrower (sigma &lt; 400 km/s)than typical wind speeds.

astro-ph;0509474	galaxy merger statistics and inferred bulge-to-disk ratios in  cosmological sph simulations	we construct merger trees for galaxies identified in a cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulation and use them to characterize predicted merger ratesas a function of redshift, galaxy mass, and merger mass ratio. at z=0.3, wefind a mean rate of 0.054 mergers per galaxy per gyr above a 1:2 mass ratiothreshold for massive galaxies (baryonic mass above 6.4e10 \msun), but only0.018 / gyr for lower mass galaxies. the mass ratio distribution isproportional to r_merg^-1.2 for the massive galaxy sample, so high mass mergersdominate the total merger growth rate. the predicted rates increase rapidlywith increasing redshift, and they agree reasonably well with observationalestimates. a substantial fraction of galaxies do not experience any resolvedmergers during the course of the simulation, and even for the high mass sampleonly 50% of galaxies experience a greater than 1:4 merger since z=1. typicalgalaxies thus have fairly quiescent merger histories.  we assign bulge-to-disk ratios to simulated galaxies by assuming that mergersabove a mass ratio threshold r_major convert stellar disks into spheroids. withr_major of 1:4, we obtain a fairly good match to the observed dependence ofearly-type fraction on galaxy mass. however, the predicted fraction of trulybulge-dominated systems (f_bulge} &gt; 0.8) is small, and producing a substantialpopulation of bulge-dominated galaxies may require a mechanism that shuts offgas accretion at late times and/or additional processes (besides major mergers)for producing bulges.

astro-ph;0510625	building galaxies with simulations	we present an overview of some of the issues surrounding current models ofgalaxy formation, highlighting recent insights obtained from cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations. detailed examination of gas accretion processes showa hot mode of gas cooling from near the halo's virial temperature, and apreviously underappreciated cold mode where gas flows in along filaments ondynamical timescales, emitting its energy in line radiation. cold modedominates in systems with halo masses slightly smaller than the milky way andbelow, and hence dominates the global accretion during the heydey of galaxyformation. this rapid accretion path enables prompt assembly of massivegalaxies in the early universe, and results in $z\sim 4$ galaxy properties inbroad agreement with observations, with the most massive galaxies being themost rapid star formers. massive galaxies today are forming stars at a muchreduced rate, a trend called downsizing. the trend of downsizing is naturallyreproduced in simulations, owing to a transition from cold mode accretion inthe early growth phase to slower hot mode accretion once their halos growlarge. however, massive galaxies at the present epoch are still observed tohave considerably redder colors than simulations suggest, suggesting that starformation is not sufficiently truncated in models by the transition to hotmode, and that another process not included in current simulations is requiredto suppress star formation.

astro-ph;0601138	the bar-halo interaction - ii. secular evolution and the religion of  n-body simulations	this paper explores resonance-driven secular evolution between a bar anddark-matter halo using n-body simulations. we make direct comparisons to ouranalytic theory (weinberg &amp; katz 2005) to demonstrate the great difficulty thatan n-body simulation has representing these dynamics for realistic astronomicalinteractions. in a dark-matter halo, the bar's angular momentum is coupled tothe central density cusp (if present) by the inner lindblad resonance. owing tothis angular momentum transfer and self-consistent re-equilibration, strongrealistic bars will modify the cusp profile, lowering the central densitieswithin about 30% of the bar radius in a few bar orbits. past results to thecontrary (sellwood 2006, mcmillan &amp; dehnen 2005) may be the result of weak barsor numerical artifacts. the magnitude depends on many factors and we illustratethe sensitivity of the response to the dark-matter profile, the bar shape andmass, and the galaxy's evolutionary history. for example, if the bar length iscomparable to the size of a central dark-matter core, the bar may exchangeangular momentum without changing its pattern speed significantly. we emphasisethat this apparently simple example of secular evolution is remarkably subtlein detail and conclude that an n-body exploration of any astronomical scenariorequires a deep investigation into the underlying dynamical mechanisms for thatparticular problem to set the necessary requirements for the simulationparameters and method (e.g. particle number and poisson solver). simply put,n-body simulations do not divinely reveal truth and hence their results are notinfallible. they are unlikely to provide useful insight on their own,particularly for the study of even more complex secular processes such as theproduction of pseudo-bulges and disk heating.

astro-ph;0604393	baryon dynamics, dark matter substructure, and galaxies	by comparing a collisionless cosmological n-body simulation (dm) to an sphsimulation with the same initial conditions, we investigate the correspondencebetween the dark matter subhalos produced by collisionless dynamics and thegalaxies produced by dissipative gas dynamics in a dark matter background. whengalaxies in the sph simulation become satellites in larger groups, they retainlocal dark matter concentrations (sph subhalos) whose mass is typically fivetimes their baryonic mass. the more massive subhalos of the sph simulation havecorresponding subhalos of similar mass and position in the dm simulation; atlower masses, there is fairly good correspondence, but some dm subhalos are indifferent spatial positions and some suffer tidal stripping or disruption. thehalo occupation statistics of dm subhalos -- the mean number of subhalos,pairs, and triples as a function of host halo mass -- are very similar to thoseof sph subhalos and sph galaxies. gravity of the dissipative baryon componentamplifies the density contrast of subhalos in the sph simulation, making themmore resistant to tidal disruption. relative to sph galaxies and sph subhalos,the dm subhalo population is depleted in the densest regions of the mostmassive halos. the good agreement of halo occupation statistics between the dmsubhalo and sph galaxy populations leads to good agreement of their two-pointcorrelation functions and higher order moments on large scales. the depletionof dm subhalos in dense regions depresses their clustering at r&lt;1 mpc/h. inthese simulations, the "conversation" between dark matter and baryons is mostlyone-way, with dark matter dynamics telling galaxies where to form and how tocluster, but the "back talk" of the baryons influences small scale clusteringby enhancing the survival of substructure in the densest environments.

astro-ph;0604534	on the evolutionary history of stars and their fossil mass and light	the total extragalactic background radiation can be an important test of theglobal star formation history (sfh). using direct observational estimates ofthe sfh, along with standard assumptions about the initial mass function (imf),we calculate the total extragalactic background radiation and the observedstellar density today. we show that plausible sfhs allow a significant range ineach quantity, but that their ratio is very tightly constrained. currentestimates of the stellar mass and extragalactic background are difficult toreconcile, as long as the imf is fixed to the salpeter slope above 1 msun. thejoint confidence interval of these two quantities only agrees with thatdetermined from the allowed range of sfh fits at the 3-sigma level, and for ourbest-fit values the discrepancy is about a factor of two. alternative energysources that contribute to the background, such as active galactic nuclei(agn), population iii stars, or decaying particles, appear unlikely to resolvethe discrepancy. however, changes to the imf allow plausible solutions to thebackground problem. the simplest is an average imf with an increasedcontribution from stars around 1.5--4 msun. a ``paunchy'' imf of this sortcould emerge as a global average if low mass star formation is suppressed ingalaxies experiencing rapid starbursts. such an imf is consistent withobservations of star-forming regions, and would help to reconcile the fossilrecord of star formation with the directly observed sfh.

0809.1430	galaxies in a simulated $\lambda$cdm universe i: cold mode and hot cores	we study the formation of galaxies in a (50 mpc/h)^3 cosmological simulation(2x288^3 particles), evolved using the entropy conserving sph code gadget-2.most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquiredthrough filamentary "cold mode" accretion of gas that was never shock heated toits halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier resultsobtained with a different sph code (keres et al. 2005). atmospheres of hot,virialized gas develop in halos above ~2.5e11 msun, a transition mass that isnearly constant from z=3 to z=0. cold accretion persists in halos above thetransition mass, especially at z&gt;=2. it dominates the growth of galaxies in lowmass halos at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formationhistory. satellite galaxies have accretion rates similar to central galaxies ofthe same baryonic mass at high redshifts, but they have less accretion thancomparable central galaxies at low redshift. relative to our earlier results,the gadget-2 simulations predict much lower rates of "hot mode" accretion fromthe virialized gas component of massive halos. at z&lt;=1, typical hot accretionrates in halos above 5e12 msun are below 1 msun/yr, even though our simulationdoes not include agn heating or other forms of "preventive" feedback. the innerdensity profiles of hot gas in these halos are shallow, with long associatedcooling times. the cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models canoverestimate the accretion rates in these halos by orders of magnitude, so suchmodels may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observedgalaxy masses and colors. a fraction of the massive halos develop cuspyprofiles and significant cooling rates between z=1 and z=0, a redshift trendsimilar to the observed trend in the frequency of cooling flow clusters.

astro-ph;0702353	the dynamics of tidal tails from massive satellites	(abbreviated) we investigate the dynamical mechanisms responsible forproducing tidal tails from dwarf satellites using n-body simulations. weidentify two important dynamical co-conspirators: 1) the points where theattractive force of the host halo and satellite are balanced do not occur atequal distances from the satellite centre or at the same equipotential valuefor massive satellites, breaking the morphological symmetry of the leading andtrailing tails; and 2) the escaped ejecta in the leading (trailing) tailcontinues to be decelerated (accelerated) by the satellite's gravity leading tolarge offsets of the ejecta orbits from the satellite orbit. the effect of thesatellite's self gravity decreases only weakly with a decreasing ratio ofsatellite mass to host halo mass, demonstrating the importance of these effectsover a wide range of subhalo masses. not only will the morphology of theleading and trailing tails for massive satellites be different, but theobserved radial velocities of the tails will be displaced from that of thesatellite orbit; both the displacement and the peak radial velocity isproportional to satellite mass. if the tails are assumed to follow theprogenitor satellite orbits, the tails from satellites with masses greater than0.0001 of the host halo virial mass in a spherical halo will appear to indicatea flattened halo. therefore, a constraint on the milky way halo shape usingtidal streams requires mass-dependent modelling. similarly, we compute the thedistribution of tail orbits both in e_{r}-r^{-2} space and in e-l_{z} space,advocated for identifying satellite stream relics. the acceleration of ejectaby a massive satellite during escape spreads the velocity distribution andobscures the signature of a well-defined ``moving group'' in phase space.

astro-ph;9407059	physically detached "compact groups"	a small fraction of galaxies appear to reside in dense compact groups, whoseinferred crossing times are much shorter than a hubble time. these shortcrossing times have led to considerable disagreement about the dynamical stateof these systems. we suggest that many of the observed groups are notphysically bound but are chance projections of galaxies well-separated alongthe line of sight. unlike earlier similar proposals, ours does not require thatthe galaxies in the compact group be members of a more diffuse, but physicallybound entity. the probability of physically separated galaxies projecting intoan apparent compact group is non-negligible if most galaxies are distributed,as observed, in thin filaments. we illustrate this general point with aspecific example: a simulation of a cold dark matter universe, in whichhydrodynamic effects are included to identify galaxies. the simulated galaxydistribution is filamentary, and end-on views of these filaments produceapparent galaxy associations that have sizes and velocity dispersions similarto those of observed compact groups. the frequency of such projections canexplain the observed space-density of groups in the hickson catalog. we discussthe implications of our proposal for the formation and evolution of groups andelliptical galaxies. the proposal can be tested by using redshift-independentdistance estimators to measure the line-of-sight spatial extent of nearbycompact groups.

astro-ph;9509105	the lyman-alpha forest in the cold dark matter model	cosmological simulations with gas provide a detailed description of theintergalactic medium, making possible predictions of neutral hydrogenabsorption in the spectra of background qsos. we present results from ahigh-resolution calculation of an $\omega=1$ cold dark matter model. oursimulation reproduces many of the observed properties of the \lya forestsurprisingly well. the distribution of hi column densities agrees with existingdata to within a factor of $\sim$ two over most of the range from$10^{14}\cm^{-2}$ to $10^{22}\cm^{-2}$; i.e., from unsaturated \lya forestlines to damped \lya systems. the equivalent width distribution matches theobserved exponential form with a characteristic width $w_* \approx 0.3$angstroms. the distribution of b-parameters appears consistent with thatderived from qso spectra. most of the low column density absorption arises inlarge, flattened structures of moderate or even relatively low overdensity, sothere is no sharp distinction between the \lya forest and the ``gunn-peterson''absorption produced by the smooth intergalactic medium. our results demonstratethat a \lya forest like that observed develops naturally in a hierarchicalclustering scenario with a photoionizing background. comparison betweensimulations and high-resolution qso spectra should open a new regime fortesting theories of cosmic structure formation.

astro-ph;9509106	damped lyman-alpha and lyman limit absorbers in the cold dark matter  model	we study the formation of damped \lya and lyman limit absorbers in ahierarchical clustering scenario using a gas dynamical simulation of an $\omega= 1$, cold dark matter universe. in the simulation, these high column densitysystems are associated with forming galaxies. damped \lya absorption, $n_{hi}\simgt 10^{20.2}\cm^{-2}$, arises along lines of sight that pass near thecenters of relatively massive, dense protogalaxies. lyman limit absorption,$10^{17}\cm^{-2} \simlt n_{hi} \simlt 10^{20.2}\cm^{-2}$, develops on lines ofsight that pass through the outer parts of such objects or near the centers ofsmaller protogalaxies. the number of lyman limit systems is less than observed,while the number of damped \lya systems is quite close to the observedabundance. damped absorbers are typically $\sim 10$ kpc in radius, but thepopulation has a large total cross section because the systems are much morenumerous than present day $l_*$ galaxies. our results demonstrate that highcolumn density systems like those observed arise naturally in a hierarchicaltheory of galaxy formation and that it is now possible to study these absorbersdirectly from numerical simulations.

astro-ph;9509107	cosmological simulations with treesph	we describe numerical methods for incorporating gas dynamics intocosmological simulations and present illustrative applications to the cold darkmatter (cdm) scenario. our evolution code, a version of treesph (hernquist \&amp;katz 1989) generalized to handle comoving coordinates and periodic boundaryconditions, combines smoothed--particle hydrodynamics (sph) with thehierarchical tree method for computing gravitational forces. the lagrangianhydrodynamics approach and individual time steps for gas particles give thealgorithm a large dynamic range, which is essential for studies of galaxyformation in a cosmological context. the code incorporates radiative coolingfor an optically thin, primordial composition gas in ionization equilibriumwith a user-specified ultraviolet background. we adopt a phenomenologicalprescription for star formation that gradually turns cold, dense,jeans-unstable gas into collisionless stars, returning supernova feedbackenergy to the surrounding medium. in cdm simulations, some of the baryons thatfall into dark matter potential wells dissipate their acquired thermal energyand condense into clumps with roughly galactic masses. the resulting galaxypopulation is insensitive to assumptions about star formation; we obtainsimilar baryonic mass functions and galaxy correlation functions fromsimulations with star formation and from simulations without star formation inwhich we identify galaxies directly from the cold, dense gas.

astro-ph;9509128	photoionization and the formation of dwarf galaxies	it has been argued that a uv photoionizing background radiation fieldsuppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies, and may even inhibit the formationof larger galaxies. in order to test this, we present gas-dynamical simulationsof the formation of small objects in a cdm universe with and without aphotoionizing background. the objects are selected from a collisionlesssimulation at a redshift of 2.4, and rerun at higher resolution including theeffects of gas dynamics and using a hierarchical grid of particles. fiveobjects, each with a circular speed of 46 km/sec are simulated. the presence ofthe photoionizing background has only a small effect on the amount of gas thatcollapses in these objects, reducing the amount of cold collapsed gas by atmost 30%. analysis of the smaller objects found in the higher resolutionsimulation indicates that the photoionizing background only significantlyaffects the formation of objects with a virialized halo mass less than 10^9soalr masses and circular speeds less than 23 km/sec. however, the ionizationbalance is greatly changed by the presence of the background radiation field.typical lines of sight through the objects have 4 orders of magnitude lessneutral hydrogen column density when the photoionizing background is included.

astro-ph;9512016	small scale structure and high redshift hi	cosmological simulations with gas dynamics suggest that the lyman-alphaforest is produced mainly by "small scale structure" --- filaments and sheetsthat are the high redshift analog of today's galaxy superclusters. there is nosharp distinction between lyman-alpha clouds and "gunn-peterson" absorptionproduced by the fluctuating igm -- the lyman-alpha forest {\it is} thegunn-peterson effect. lyman limit and damped lyman-alpha absorption arises inthe radiatively cooled gas of forming galaxies. at $z~2-3$, most of the gas isin the photoionized, diffuse medium associated with the lyman-alpha forest, butmost of the {\it neutral} gas is in damped lyman-alpha systems. we discussgeneric evolution of cosmic gas in a hierarchical scenario of structureformation, with particular attention to the prospects for detecting 21cmemission from high redshift hi. a scaling argument based on the present-daycluster mass function suggests that objects with $m_{hi} &gt;~ 5e11 h^{-1} \msun$should be extremely rare at $z~3$, so detections with existing instruments willbe difficult. an instrument like the proposed square kilometer array coulddetect individual damped lyman-alpha systems at high redshift, making itpossible to map structure in the high redshift universe in much the same waythat today's galaxy redshift surveys map the local large scale structure.

astro-ph;9604175	photoionization, numerical resolution, and galaxy formation	using cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics andgravitational forces, we investigate the influence of photoionization by a uvradiation background on the formation of galaxies. in our highest resolutionsimulations, we find that photoionization has essentially no effect on thebaryonic mass function of galaxies at $z=2$, down to our resolution limit of$5e9 m_\sun$. we do, however, find a strong interplay between the massresolution of a simulation and the microphysics included in the computation ofheating and cooling rates. at low resolution, a photoionizing background canappear to suppress the formation of even relatively massive galaxies. however,when the same initial conditions are evolved with a factor of eight better massresolution, this effect disappears. our results demonstrate the need for carein interpreting the results of cosmological simulations that incorporatehydrodynamics and radiation physics. for example, we conclude that a simulationwith limited resolution may yield more realistic results if it ignores somerelevant physical processes, such as photoionization. at higher resolution, thesimulated population of massive galaxies is insensitive to the treatment ofphotoionization and star formation, but it does depend significantly on theamplitude of the initial density fluctuations. by $z=2$, an $\omega=1$ colddark matter model normalized to produce the observed masses of present-dayclusters has already formed galaxies with baryon masses exceeding $1e11m_\sun$.

astro-ph;9609072	the population of damped lyman-alpha and lyman limit systems in the cold  dark matter model	lyman limit and damped lyman-alpha absorption systems probe the distributionof collapsed, cold gas at high redshift. numerical simulations that incorporategravity and gas dynamics can predict the abundance of such absorbers incosmological models. we develop a semi-analytical method to correct thenumerical predictions for the contribution of unresolved low mass halos, and weapply this method to the katz et al. (1996) simulation of the standard colddark matter model ($\omega=1$, $h=0.5$, $\omega_b=0.05$, $\sigma_8=0.7$). usingthis simulation and higher resolution simulations of individual low masssystems, we determine the relation between a halo's circular velocity $v_c$ andits cross section for producing lyman limit or damped absorption. we combinethis relation with the press-schechter formula for the abundance of halos tocompute the number of absorbers per unit redshift. the resolution correctionincreases the predicted abundances by about a factor of two at z=2, 3, and 4,bringing the predicted number of damped absorbers into quite good agreementwith observations. roughly half of the systems reside in halos with circularvelocities $v_c&gt;100\kms$ and half in halos with $35\kms&lt;v_c&lt;100\kms$. haloswith $v_c&gt;150\kms$ typically harbor two or more systems capable of producingdamped absorption. even with the resolution correction, the predicted abundanceof lyman limit systems is a factor of three below observational estimates,signifying either a failure of standard cdm or a failure of these simulationsto resolve the systems responsible for most lyman limit absorption. bycomparing simulations with and without star formation, we find that depletionof the gas supply by star formation affects absorption line statistics at$z&gt;=2$ only for column densities exceeding $n_{hi}=10^{22} cm^{-2}$.

astro-ph;9609115	voigt-profile analysis of the lyman-alpha forest in a cold dark matter  universe	we use an automated voigt-profile fitting procedure to extract statisticalproperties of the ly$\alpha$ forest in a numerical simulation of an $\omega=1$,cold dark matter (cdm) universe. our analysis method is similar to that used inmost observational studies of the forest, and we compare the simulations torecently published results derived from keck hires spectra. with thevoigt-profile decomposition analysis, the simulation reproduces the largenumber of weak lines ($n_{\rm hi}\la 10^{13}\cdunits$) found in the hiresspectra. the column density distribution evolves significantly between $z=3$and $z=2$, with the number of lines at fixed column density dropping by afactor $\sim 1.6$ in the range where line blending is not severe. at $z=3$, the$b$-parameter distribution has a median of $35 \kms$ and a dispersion of $20\kms$, in reasonable agreement with the observed values. the comparison betweenour new analysis and recent data strengthens earlier claims that the \lyaforest arises naturally in hierarchical structure formation as photoionized gasfalls into dark matter potential wells. however, there are two statisticallysignficant discrepancies between the simulated forest and the hires results:the model produces too many lines at $z=3$ by a factor $\sim 1.5-2$, and itproduces more narrow lines ($b&lt;20 \kms$) than are seen in the data. the firstresult is sensitive to our adopted normalization of the mean \lya opticaldepth, and the second is sensitive to our assumption that helium reionizationhas not significantly raised gas temperatures at $z=3$. it is therefore tooearly to say whether these discrepancies indicate a fundamental problem withthe high-redshift structure of the $\omega=1$ cdm model or reflect errors ofdetail in our modeling of the gas distribution or the observational procedure.

astro-ph;9611053	intergalactic helium absorption in cold dark matter models	observations from the hut and the hst have recently detected heii absorptionalong the lines of sight to two high redshift quasars. we use cosmologicalsimulations with gas dynamics to investigate heii absorption in the cold darkmatter (cdm) theory of structure formation. we consider two omega=1 cdm modelswith different normalizations and one omega_0=0.4 cdm model, all incorporatingthe photoionizing uv background spectrum computed by haardt &amp; madau (1996). thesimulated gas distribution, combined with the h&amp;m spectral shape, accounts forthe relative observed values of taubar_hi and taubar_heii, the effective meanoptical depths for hi and heii absorption. if the background intensity is ashigh as h&amp;m predict, then matching the absolute values of taubar_hi andtaubar_heii requires a baryon abundance larger (by factors between 1.5 and 3for the various cdm models) than our assumed value of omega_b h^2=0.0125. thesimulations reproduce the evolution of taubar_heii over the observed redshiftrange, 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.3, if the heii photoionization rate remains roughlyconstant. heii absorption in the cdm simulations is produced by a diffuse,fluctuating, intergalactic medium, which also gives rise to the hi ly-alphaforest. much of the heii opacity arises in underdense regions where the hioptical depth is very low. we compute statistical properties of the heii and hiabsorption that can be used to test the cdm models and distinguish them from analternative scenario in which the heii absorption is caused by discrete,compact clouds. the cdm scenario predicts that a substantial amount of baryonicmaterial resides in underdense regions at high redshift. heii absorption is theonly sensitive probe of such extremely diffuse, intergalactic gas, so it canprovide a vital test of this fundamental prediction.

astro-ph;9701012	a lower bound on the cosmic baryon density	we derive analytic lower bounds on the cosmic baryon density by requiringthat the high-redshift igm contain enough neutral hydrogen to produce theobserved \lya absorption in quasar spectra. the key theoretical assumption isthat absorbing structures are no more extended in redshift space than in realspace. this assumption might not hold if \lya clouds are highly overdense andthermally broadened, but it is likely to hold in the gravitational instabilitypicture for the \lya forest suggested by cosmological simulations,independently of the details of the cosmological model. the other ingredientsin these bounds are an estimate of the uv background from quasars, atemperature $t~10^4k$ for the "warm" photoionized igm that produces most of the\lya absorption, a value of the hubble constant, and observational estimates ofthe mean \lya flux decrement $\dbar$ or, for a more restrictive bound, thedistribution function $p(\tau)$ of \lya optical depths. with plausibleparameter values, the mean decrement bound implies a baryon density parameter$\omb \ga 0.0125/h^2$. with conservative values, the bound weakens to $\omb \ga0.005/h^2$, but the required clustering of the igm is then incompatible withother properties of quasar spectra. a recent observational determination of$p(\tau)$ implies $\omb \ga 0.0125/h^2$ even for a conservative estimate of theuv background, and $\omb \ga 0.018/h^2$ for a more reasonable estimate. thesebounds are consistent with recent low estimates of the primordialdeuterium-to-hydrogen ratio $\dtoh$, which imply $\omb \approx 0.025/h^2$, butthe $p(\tau)$ bound can only be reconciled with high $\dtoh$ estimates byabandoning standard big bang nucleosynthesis or the gravitational instabilitypicture for the origin of the \lya forest.

astro-ph;9701211	morphological transformation from galaxy harassment	galaxy morphologies in clusters have undergone a remarkable transition overthe past several billion years. distant clusters at $z \sim 0.4$ are filledwith small spiral galaxies, many of which are disturbed and show evidence ofmultiple bursts of star-formation. this population is absent from nearbyclusters where spheroidals comprise the faint end of the luminosity function.our numerical simulations follow the evolution of disk galaxies in a richcluster owing to encounters with brighter galaxies and the cluster's tidalfield---galaxy harassment. after a bursting transient phase, they undergo acomplete morphological transformation from "disks" to"spheroidals". we examinethe remnants and find support for our theory in detailed comparisons of thephotometry and kinematics of the spheroidal galaxies in clusters. our modelnaturally accounts for the intermediate age stellar population seen in thesespheroidals as well as the trend in dwarf to giant ratio with cluster richness.the final shapes are typically prolate and are flattened primarily by velocityanisotropy. their mass to light ratios are in the range 3---8 in good agreementwith observations.

astro-ph;9701212	the formation of quasars in low luminosity hosts via galaxy harassment	we have simulated disk galaxies undergoing continual bombardment by othergalaxies in a rich cluster. "galaxy harassment" leads to dramatic evolution ofsmaller disk galaxies and provides an extremely effective mechanism to fuel acentral quasar. within a few billion years after a small disk galaxy enters thecluster environment, up to 90% of its gas can be driven into the inner 500 pc.up to half of the mass can be transferred in a burst lasting just 100-200 myr.this transport of gas to the center of galaxy is far more efficient than anymechanism proposed before. galaxy harassment was first proposed to explain thedisturbed blue galaxies in clusters seen in clusters at ($z \gsim 0.3$), the"butcher-oemler effect". quasars at the same reshifts lie in more clusteredenvironments than those at lower redshift. recent hst observations find thatroughly half of all observed quasar host galaxiess are fainter than \l*, withmany of these less luminous hosts occuring at redshifts $z \gsim 0.3$. weexamine 5 quasars that are claimed to have low luminosity hosts and find that 3are in rich clusters of galaxies, the fourth may be in a cluster but theevidence for this is marginal. the environment of the fifth has not beenstudied.

astro-ph;9705118	testing cosmological models against the abundance of damped lyman-alpha  absorbers	we calculate the number of damped lyman-alpha absorbers expected in variouspopular cosmological models as a function of redshift and compare ourpredictions with observed abundances. the press-schechter formalism is used toobtain the distribution of halos with circular velocity in differentcosmologies, and we calibrate the relation between circular velocity andabsorption cross-section using detailed gas dynamical simulations of a``standard'' cold dark matter (cdm) model. because of this calibration, ourapproach makes more realistic assumptions about the absorption properties ofcollapsed objects than previous, analytic calculations of the dampedlyman-alpha abundance. cdm models with omega_0=1, h_0=50, baryon densityomega_b=0.05, and scale-invariant primeval fluctuations reproduce the observedincidence and redshift evolution of damped lyman-alpha absorption to withinobservational uncertainty, for both cobe normalization (sigma_8=1.2) and alower normalization (sigma_8=0.7) that better matches the observed clusterabundance at z=0. a tilted (n=0.8, sigma_8=0.7) cdm model tends to underproduceabsorption, especially at z=4. with cobe normalization, a cdm model withomega_0=0.4, omega_{lambda}=0.6 gives an acceptable fit to the observedabsorption; an open cdm model is marginally acceptable if omega_0 is at least0.4 and strongly inconsistent with the z=4 data if omega_0=0.3. mixed darkmatter models tend not to produce sufficient absorption, being roughlycomparable to tilted cdm models if omega_{nu} = 0.2 and failing drastically ifomega_{nu} = 0.3.

astro-ph;9708018	recovery of the power spectrum of mass fluctuations from observations of  the lyman-alpha forest	we present a method to recover the shape and amplitude of the power spectrumof mass fluctuations, p(k), from observations of the high redshift \lya forest.the method is motivated by the physical picture of the \lya forest that hasemerged from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations and related semi-analyticmodels, which predicts a tight correlation between the \lya optical depth andthe underlying matter density. we monotonically map the qso spectrum to agaussian density field, measure its 3-d p(k), and normalize by evolvingcosmological simulations with this p(k) until they reproduce the observed powerspectrum of the qso flux. imposing the observed mean \lya opacity as aconstraint makes the derived p(k) normalization insensitive to the choice ofcosmological parameters, ionizing background spectrum, or reionization history.thus, in contrast to estimates of p(k) from galaxy clustering, there are nouncertain "bias parameters" in the recovery of the mass power spectrum. we testthe full procedure on sph simulations of 3 cosmological models and show that itrecovers their true mass power spectra on comoving scales ~1-10/h mpc, theupper scale being set by the size of the simulation boxes. the procedure workseven for noisy (s/n ~ 10), moderate resolution (~40 km/s pixels) spectra. wepresent an illustrative application to q1422+231; the recovered p(k) isconsistent with an \omega=1, \sigma_8=0.5 cdm model. application to large qsosamples should yield the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on small scales atz ~ 2-4.

astro-ph;9708090	the observability of metal lines associated with the lyman-alpha forest	we develop a prescription for characterizing the strengths of metal linesassociated with lyman-alpha forest absorbers (lyfas) of a given neutralhydrogen column density n_hi and metallicity [fe/h]. this line observabilityindex (lox) is line-specific and translates, for weak lines, into a measure ofthe equivalent width. it can be evaluated quickly for thousands of transitionswithin the framework of a given model of the lyman-alpha forest, providing aranking of the lines in terms of their strengths and enabling model builders toselect the lines that should be detectable in observed spectra of a givenresolution and signal-to-noise ratio. we compute the lox for a large number ofelements and transitions in two cosmological models of the lyman-alpha forestat z=3 derived from a hydrodynamic simulation of structure formation, and wediscuss how the lox depends on redshift and on model parameters such as themean baryonic density and radiation field. we find that the ovi (1032,1038)doublet is the best probe of the metallicity in low column density lyfas n_{hi}\approx 10^{14.5} cm^{-2}). metallicities down to [o/h] \sim -3 ([fe/h] \sim-3.5 with the assumed [o/fe] ratio) yield ovi absorption features that shouldbe detectable in current high-quality spectra, provided that the expectedposition of the ovi feature is not contaminated by hi absorption. the strongesttransitions in lower ionisation states of oxygen are ov(630), oiv(788), andoiii(833), and are likely to be detected with next generation uv instruments.of the lines with rest wavelengths \lambda_r &gt; 1216, which can potentially beobserved redwards of the \lya forest, the civ(1548,1551) doublet is expected todominate in all lyfas, regardless of the value of n_hi.

astro-ph;9708213	simulating cosmic structure formation	we describe cosmological simulation techniques and their application tostudies of cosmic structure formation, with particular attention to recenthydrodynamic simulations of structure in the high redshift universe.collisionless n-body simulations with gaussian initial conditions produce apattern of sheets, filaments, tunnels, and voids that resembles the observedlarge scale galaxy distribution. simulations that incorporate gas dynamics anddissipation form dense clumps of cold gas with sizes and masses similar to theluminous parts of galaxies. models based on inflation and cold dark matterpredict a healthy population of high redshift galaxies, including systems withstar formation rates of 20 m_{\sun}/year at z=6. at z~3, most of the baryons inthese models reside in the low density intergalactic medium, which producesfluctuating lyman-alpha absorption in the spectra of background quasars. thephysical description of this ``lyman-alpha forest'' is particularly simple ifthe absorption spectrum is viewed as a 1-dimensional map of a continuous mediuminstead of a collection of lines. the combination of superb observational dataand robust numerical predictions makes the lyman-alpha forest a promising toolfor testing cosmological models.

astro-ph;9709075	metal lines in cosmological models of lyman-alpha absorbers	the metal absorption lines found in association with \lya absorbers ofmoderate to high hi column density contain valuable information about themetallicity and ionization conditions within the absorbers and offer a strongertest of models of the intergalactic medium at \sim 3$ than hi absorption linesalone.  we have developed a method to predict the strengths of metal absorption lineswithin the framework of cosmological models for the \lya forest. the methodconsists of evaluating a quantity, the line observability index, for a databaseof hundreds of candidate metal lines, allowing a comprehensive identificationof the lines the model predicts to be detectable associated with a \lyaabsorber of a given hi column density and metallicity.  applying this technique to a particular class of models at \sim 2-4$, wepredict that the ovi(1032 \aa, 1038 \aa) doublet is the only practical probe ofthe metallicity of low column density absorbers (hi \simlt 10^{14.5} cm^{-2}$),that civ (1548 \aa) is the strongest line with rest wavelength $\lambda_r &gt;1216$ \aa{} regardless of hi$, and that the strongest metal lines should beciii(977 \aa) and siiii(1206.5 \aa), which peak at hi \sim 10^{17} cm^{-2}$.

astro-ph;9709303	hubble flow broadening of the lyman-alpha forest and its implications	lyman-alpha forest lines in qso spectra have typical widths of 20-50 km/s.low column density absorbers in cosmological simulations are large, diffusestructures, and the hubble flow across the spatially extended absorber isusually the dominant contribution to the width of its associated absorptionline. thermal broadening is unimportant over most of the spectrum, and peculiarvelocities tend to make absorption features narrower rather than broader. as aconsequence of hubble flow broadening, there is a close relation between locallyman-alpha optical depth and local neutral hydrogen density, which is wellapproximated by the gunn-peterson formula. the physics that governs theunshocked intergalactic medium leads to a tight correlation between the neutralhydrogen density and the underlying gas and dark matter overdensity. for manypurposes, it is simpler to regard a lyman-alpha forest spectrum as acontinuous, non-linear map of the density field rather than a collection ofdiscrete lines. this continuous field view of the lyman-alpha forest can beapplied to measurement of the baryon density parameter, testing of cosmologicalmodels, and robust determination of the shape and amplitude of the primordialmass power spectrum.

astro-ph;9710043	time stepping n-body simulations	leapfrog integration has been the method of choice in n-body simulationsowing to its low computational cost for a symplectic integrator with secondorder accuracy. we introduce a new leapfrog integrator that allows for variabletimesteps for each particle in large n-body simulations. tests with singleparticles in fixed potentials show that it behaves as a symplectic integrator.  we then examine the results of both standard leapfrog and our temporallyadaptive leapfrog on full n-body integrations of clusters and large scalestructure establishing accuracy criteria for both methods. the adaptive methodshows significant speed-ups over single step integrations---but the integratorno longer appears to be symplectic or, in the case of large scale structuresimulations, accurate. this loss of accuracy appears to be caused by the waythat the timestep is chosen, not by the integrator itself. we present a relatedintegration technique that does retain sufficient accuracy. although it is notsymplectic, it is apparently better than previous implementations and is ourcurrent integrator of choice for large astrophysical simulations. we also notethat the standard leapfrog difference equations used in cosmological n-bodyintegrations in comoving coordinates are not symplectic. we derive animplementation of leapfrog that is in comoving canonical coordinates to correctfor this deficiency.

astro-ph;9803257	constraining the metallicity of the low density lyman-alpha forest using  ovi absorption	we search for ovi absorption in a keck hires spectrum of the z=3.62 quasarq1422+231. comparison of civ measurements to cosmological simulations showsthat \lya forest absorbers with n_hi &gt; 10^{14.5} have [c/h]~=-2.5, for the uvbackground spectrum of haardt &amp; madau (hm). lower column density absorptionarises in lower density gas, where ovi is the most sensitive metal tracer.since ovi lines lie at wavelengths contaminated by lyman series absorption, weinterpret our q1422 results by comparing to artificial spectra drawn from ansph simulation of a lambda-dominated cdm model. a search for deep, narrowfeatures in q1422 yields only a few candidate ovi lines, statisticallyconsistent with the number in artificial spectra with no metals; spectragenerated with the hm background and [o/h] &gt;= -2.5 predict too many narrowlines. however, applying the optical depth ratio technique of songaila (1998),we do find significant ovi associated with civ systems; matching q1422 requires[o/c]~=+0.5, implying [o/h]~=-2.0. taken together these results imply that (a)the metallicity in the low density igm is at least a factor of three below thatin the overdense regions where civ absorption is detectable, and (b) oxygen isoverabundant in these regions, consistent with the enrichment pattern of oldhalo stars. if the uv background is heavily truncated above 4 ry, animplausibly high oxygen overabundance ([o/c]&gt;+2) is required by the data; thusa majority of the volume of the universe must have undergone heliumreionization by z=3.(abridged)

astro-ph;9806257	the clustering of high redshift galaxies in the cold dark matter  scenario	we investigate the clustering of high redshift galaxies in five variants ofthe cold dark matter (cdm) scenario, using hydrodynamic cosmologicalsimulations that resolve the formation of systems with circular velocities $v_c\geq 100 \kms$ ($\omega=1$) or $v_c \geq 70 \kms$ ($\omega=0.4$). although thefive models differ in their cosmological parameters and in the shapes andamplitudes of their mass power spectra, they predict remarkably similar galaxyclustering at $z=2$, 3, and 4. the galaxy correlation functions show almost noevolution over this redshift range, even though the mass correlation functionsgrow steadily in time. despite the fairly low circular velocity threshold ofthe simulations, the high redshift galaxies are usually highly biased tracersof the underlying mass distribution; the bias factor evolves with redshift andvaries from model to model. predicted correlation lengths for the resolvedgalaxy population are $2-3\hmpc$ (comoving) at $z=3$. more massive galaxiestend to be more strongly clustered. these cdm models have no difficulty inexplaining the strong observed clustering of lyman-break galaxies, and some mayeven predict excessive clustering. because the effects of bias obscuredifferences in mass clustering, it appears that lyman-break galaxy clusteringwill not be a good test of cosmological models but will instead provide a toolfor constraining the physics of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9807177	the low redshift lyman alpha forest in cold dark matter cosmologies	we study the physical origin of the low-redshift lyman alpha forest inhydrodynamic simulations of four cdm cosmologies. our main conclusions areinsensitive to the cosmological model but depend on our assumption that the uvbackground declines at low redshift. we find that the expansion of the universedrives rapid evolution of dn/dz (the number of absorbers per unit z) at z &gt;1.7, but that at lower redshift the fading of the uv background counters theinfluence of expansion, leading to slow evolution. at every redshift, weakerlines come primarily from moderate fluctuations of the diffuse, unshocked igm,and stronger lines originate in shocked or radiatively cooled gas of higheroverdensity. however, the neutral hydrogen column density associated withstructures of fixed overdensity drops as the universe expands, so an absorberat z = 0 is dynamically analogous to an absorber with neutral hydrogen columndensity 10 to 50 times higher at z = 2-3. we find no clear distinction betweenlines arising in "galaxy halos" and lines arising in larger scale structures;however, galaxies tend to lie near the dense regions of the igm that producestrong lyman alpha lines. the simulations provide a unified physical picturethat accounts for the most distinctive observed properties of the low redshiftlyman alpha forest: (1) a sharp transition in the evolution of dn/dz at z ~1.7, (2) stronger evolution for absorbers of higher equivalent width, (3) acorrelation of increasing lyman alpha equivalent width with decreasing galaxyimpact parameter, and (4) a tendency for stronger lines to arise in closeproximity to galaxies while weaker lines trace more diffuse large scalestructure.

astro-ph;9809401	the power spectrum of mass fluctuations measured from the lyman-alpha  forest at redshift z=2.5	we measure the linear power spectrum of mass density fluctuations at redshiftz=2.5 from the \lya forest absorption in a sample of 19 qso spectra, using themethod introduced by croft et al. (1998). the p(k) measurement covers the range2\pi/k ~ 450-2350 km/s (2-12 comoving \hmpc for \omega=1). we examine a numberof possible sources of systematic error and find none that are significant onthese scales. in particular, we show that spatial variations in the uvbackground caused by the discreteness of the source population should havenegligible effect on our p(k) measurement. we obtain consistent results fromthe high and low redshift halves of the data set and from an entirelyindependent sample of nine qso spectra with mean redshift z=2.1. a power lawfit to our measured p(k) yields a logarithmic slope n=-2.25 +/- 0.18 and anamplitude \delta^2(k_p) = 0.57^{+0.26}_{-0.18}, where $\delta^2$ is thecontribution to the density variance from a unit interval of lnk and k_p=0.008(km/s)^{-1}. direct comparison of our mass p(k) to the measured clustering oflyman break galaxies shows that they are a highly biased population, with abias factor b~2-5. the slope of the linear p(k), never previously measured onthese scales, is close to that predicted by models based on inflation and colddark matter (cdm). the p(k) amplitude is consistent with some scale-invariant,cobe-normalized cdm models (e.g., an open model with \omega_0=0.4) andinconsistent with others (e.g., \omega=1). even with limited dynamic range andsubstantial statistical uncertainty, a measurement of p(k) that has no unknown``bias factors'' offers many opportunities for testing theories of structureformation and constraining cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;9810011	closing in on omega_0: the amplitude of mass fluctuations from galaxy  clusters and the lyman-alpha forest	we estimate the value of the matter density parameter \omega_0 by combiningconstraints from the galaxy cluster mass function with croft et al.'s recentmeasurement of the mass power spectrum, p(k), from \lya forest data. the keyassumption of the method is that cosmic structure formed by gravitationalinstability from gaussian primordial fluctuations. for a specified value of\omega_0, matching the observed cluster mass function then fixes the value of\sigma_8, the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in 8\hmpc spheres, and it thusdetermines the normalization of p(k) at z=0. the value of \omega_0 alsodetermines the ratio of p(k) at z=0 to p(k) at z=2.5, the central redshift ofthe \lya forest data; the ratio is different for an open universe (\lambda=0)or a flat universe. because the \lya forest measurement only reaches comovingscales 2\pi/k ~ 15-20\hmpc, the derived value of \omega_0 depends on the valueof the power spectrum shape parameter \gamma, which determines the relativecontribution of larger scale modes to \sigma_8. adopting \gamma=0.2, a valuefavored by galaxy clustering data, we find \omega_0 = 0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.10} foran open universe and \omega_0=0.34^{+0.13}_{-0.09} for a flat universe (1\sigmaerrors, not including the uncertainty in cluster normalization).cluster-normalized models with \omega_0=1 predict too low an amplitude for p(k)at z=2.5, while models with \omega_0=0.1 predict too high an amplitude. themore general best fit parameter combination is approximately \omega_0 +0.2\lambda_0 = 0.46 + 1.3(\gamma-0.2). analysis of larger, existing samples ofqso spectra could greatly improve the measurement of p(k) from the \lya forest,allowing a determination of \omega_0 by this method with a precision of ~15%,limited mainly by uncertainty in the cluster mass function.

astro-ph;9810142	cosmology with the lyman-alpha forest	we outline the physical picture of the high-redshift ly-alpha forest that hasemerged from cosmological simulations, describe statistical characteristics ofthe forest that can be used to test theories of structure formation, present apreliminary comparison between simulation results and measurements from keckhires spectra, and discuss a recent determination of the slope and amplitude ofthe linear mass power spectrum p(k) at z=2.5 from moderate resolution spectra.the physical picture is simple if each qso spectrum is viewed as a continuousnon-linear map of the line-of-sight density field rather than a collection ofdiscrete absorption lines. the distribution of flux decrements depends mainlyon the amplitude and pdf (gaussian vs. non-gaussian) of the primordial densityfluctuations. the threshold crossing frequency, analogous to the 3-d genuscurve, responds to the shape and amplitude of p(k) and to the values of omegaand lambda. open and lambda-cdm models agree well with the measured fluxdecrement distribution at smoothing lengths of 25 km/s and 100 km/s and withthe threshold crossing frequency at 100 km/s. discrepancy with the observedthreshold crossing frequency at 25 km/s may reflect the combined effects ofnoise in the data and limited mass resolution of the simulations. the slope ofthe measured p(k) agrees with the predictions of inflation+cdm models.combining the amplitude with cobe normalization imposes a constraint on thesemodels of the form omega h^x n^y omega_b^z = constant. assuming gaussianprimordial fluctuations and a power spectrum shape parameter gamma~0.2,consistency of the measured p(k) with the observed cluster mass function at z=0requires omega=0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.10} for an open universe andomega=0.34^{+0.13}_{-0.09} for a flat universe (1-sigma errors).

astro-ph;9908133	theoretical modeling of the high redshift galaxy population	we review theoretical approaches to the study of galaxy formation, withemphasis on the role of hydrodynamic simulations in modeling the high redshiftgalaxy population. we present new predictions for the abundance of star-forminggalaxies in the lambda + cold dark matter model (omega_m=0.4, omega_l=0.6),combining results from several simulations to probe a wide range of redshift.at a threshold density of one object per arcmin^2 per unit z, these simulationspredict galaxies with star formation rates of 2 msun/yr (z=10), 5 msun/yr(z=8), 20 msun/yr (z=6), 70-100 msun/yr (z=4-2), and 30 msun/yr (z=0.5). forgalaxies selected at a fixed comoving space density n=0.003 h^3 mpc^{-3], a (50mpc/h)^3 simulation predicts a galaxy correlation function (r/5 mpc/h)^{-1.8}in comoving coordinates, essentially independent of redshift from z=4 to z=0.5.different cosmological models predict global histories of star formation thatreflect their overall histories of mass clustering, but robust numericalpredictions of the comoving space density of star formation are difficultbecause the simulations miss the contribution from galaxies below theirresolution limit. the lcdm model appears to predict a star formation historywith roughly the shape inferred from observations, but it produces too manystars at low redshift, predicting omega_* ~ 0.015 at z=0. we conclude with abrief discussion of this discrepancy and three others that suggest gaps in ourcurrent theory of galaxy formation: small disks, steep central halo profiles,and an excess of low mass dark halos. while these problems could fade as thesimulations or observations improve, they could also guide us towards a newunderstanding of galactic scale star formation, the spectrum of primordialfluctuations, or the nature of dark matter.

astro-ph;9911343	simulations of damped lyman-alpha and lyman limit absorbers in different  cosmologies: implications for structure formation at high redshift	we use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations to study damped lyman-alpha(dla) and lyman limit (ll) absorption at redshifts z=2-4 in five variants ofthe cold dark matter scenario. our standard simulations resolve the formationof dense concentrations of neutral gas in halos with circular velocity v_croughly 140 km/s for omega_m=1 and 90 km/s for omega_m=0.4, at z=2; anadditional lcdm simulation resolves halos down to v_c approximately 50 km/s atz=3. we find a clear relation between hi column density and projected distanceto the center of the nearest galaxy, with dla absorption usually confined togalactocentric radii less than 10-15 kpc and ll absorption arising out toprojected separations of 30 kpc or more. detailed examination provides evidenceof non-equilibrium effects on absorption cross-section. if we consider onlyabsorption in the halos resolved by our standard simulations, then all fivemodels fall short of reproducing the observed abundance of dla and ll systemsat these redshifts. if we extrapolate to lower halo masses, we find all fourmodels are consistent with the observed abundance of dla systems if the theextrapolated behavior extends to circular velocities roughly 50-80 km/s, andthey may produce too much absorption if the relation continues to 40 km/s. ourresults suggest that ll absorption is closely akin to dla absorption, arisingin less massive halos or at larger galactocentric radii but not caused byprocesses acting on a radically different mass scale.

0812.0009	the dynamics of satellite disruption in cold dark matter haloes	we investigate the physical mechanisms of tidal heating and satellitedisruption in cold dark matter host haloes using n-body simulations based oncosmological initial conditions. we show the importance of resonant shocks andresonant torques with the host halo to satellite heating. a resonant shock(torque) couples the radial (tangential) motion of a satellite in its orbit toits phase space. for a satellite on a circular orbit, an ilr-like resonancedominates the heating and this heating results in continuous satellite massloss. we estimate the requirements for simulations to achieve these dynamicsusing perturbation theory. both resonant shocks and resonant torques affectsatellites on eccentric orbits. we demonstrate that satellite mass loss is anoutside-in process in energy space; a satellite's stars and gas are thusprotected by their own halo against tidal stripping. we simulate the evolutionof a halo similar to the large magellanic cloud (lmc) in our galactic darkmatter halo and conclude that the lmc stars have not yet been stripped.finally, we present a simple algorithm for estimating the evolution ofsatellite mass that includes both shock heating and resonant torques.

0812.3723	the nature of red dwarf galaxies	using dark matter halos traced by galaxy groups selected from the sloandigital sky survey data release 4, we find that about 1/4 of the faint galaxies($\rmag &gt;-17.05$, hereafter dwarfs) that are the central galaxies in their ownhalo are not blue and star forming, as expected in standard models of galaxyformation, but are red. in contrast, this fraction is about 1/2 for dwarfsatellite galaxies. many red dwarf galaxies are physically associated with moremassive halos. in total, about $\sim 45$% of red dwarf galaxies reside inmassive halos as satellites, while another $\sim 25$% have a spatialdistribution that is much more concentrated towards their nearest massivehaloes than other dwarf galaxies. we use mock catalogs to show that the reddestpopulation of non-satellite dwarf galaxies are distributed within about 3 timesthe virial radii of their nearest massive halos. we suggest that thispopulation of dwarf galaxies are hosted by low-mass halos that have passedthrough their massive neighbors, and that the same environmental effects thatcause satellite galaxies to become red are also responsible for the red colorsof this population of galaxies. we do not find any significant radialdependence of the population of dwarf galaxies with the highest concentrations,suggesting that the mechanisms operating on these galaxies affect color morethan structure. however, over 30% of dwarf galaxies are red and isolated andtheir origin remains unknown.
