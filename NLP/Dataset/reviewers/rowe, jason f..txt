0706.2278	most photometry and ddo spectroscopy of the eclipsing (white dwarf + red  dwarf) binary v471 tau	the hyades k2v+wd system 471 tau is a prototype post-common envelope systemand a likely cataclysmic binary progenitor. we present 10 days of nearlycontinuous optical photometry by the most (microvariability &amp; oscillations ofstars) satellite and partly simultaneous optical spectroscopy from ddo (daviddunlap observatory) of the binary. the photometric data indicate that the spotcoverage of the k dwarf component was less than observed in the past,suggesting that we monitored the star close to a minimum in its activity cycle.despite the low spot activity, we still detected seven flare-like events whoseestimated energies are among the highest ever observed in v471 tau and whosetimes of occurrence do not correlate with the binary orbital phase. a detailedo-c analysis of the times of eclipse over the last ~35 years reveals timingvariations which could be explained in several ways, including perturbations byan as-yet-undetected third body in the system or by a small orbitaleccentricity inducing slow apsidal motion. the ddo spectra result in improveddeterminations of the k dwarf projected rotation velocity, v_k sin i = 92 kms^-1, and the orbital amplitude, k_k=150.5 km s^-1. the spectra also allow usto measure changes in h_alpha emission strength and radial velocity (rv)variations. we measure a larger h_alpha velocity amplitude than foundpreviously suggesting that the source of the emission in v471 tau was lessconcentrated around the sub-white-dwarf point on the k star than had beenobserved in previous studies.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

0709.1137	looking for super-earths in the hd 189733 system: a search for transits  in most space-based photometry	we have made a comprehensive transit search for exoplanets down to ~1.5 - 2earth radii in the hd 189733 system, based on 21-days of nearly uninterruptedbroadband optical photometry obtained with the most (microvariability &amp;oscillations of stars) satellite in 2006. we have searched these data forrealistic limb-darkened transits from exoplanets other than the known hotjupiter, hd 189733b, with periods ranging from about 0.4 days to one week.monte carlo statistical tests of the data with synthetic transits inserted intothe data-set allow us to rule out additional close-in exoplanets with sizesranging from about 0.15 - 0.31 rj (jupiter radii), or 1.7 - 3.5 re (earthradii) on orbits whose planes are near that of hd 189733b. these null resultsconstrain theories that invoke lower-mass hot super-earth and hot neptuneplanets in orbits similar to hd 189733b due to the inward migration of this hotjupiter. this work also illustrates the feasibility of discovering smallertransiting planets around chromospherically active stars.

1102.0543	architecture and dynamics of kepler's candidate multiple transiting  planet systems	about one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in thefirst four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems. thereare 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8with four, and one each with five and six. we characterize the dynamicalproperties of these candidate multi-planet systems. the distribution ofobserved period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs areneither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. nonetheless, there aresmall but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both inresonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularlynear the 2:1 resonance. we find that virtually all candidate systems arestable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radiusrelationship. several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority ofthese multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. using the observedmultiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systemsthat matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number ofsingly-transiting systems. we provide constraints on the true multiplicity andmutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing apopulation of systems with multiple super-earth-size and neptune-size planetswith low to moderate mutual inclinations.

1102.0544	transit timing observations from kepler: i. statistical analysis of the  first four months	the architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraintson models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation oforbital eccentricities and inclinations. nasa's kepler mission has identified1235 transiting planet candidates (borcuki et al 2011). the method of transittiming variations (ttvs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetarysystems (holman et al. 2010; lissauer et al. 2011a). we perform a transittiming analysis of the kepler planet candidates. we find that at least ~12% ofplanet candidates currently suitable for ttv analysis show evidence suggestiveof ttvs, representing at least ~65 ttv candidates. in all cases, the time spanof observations must increase for ttvs to provide strong constraints on planetmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multipletransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). wefind that the fraction of planet candidates showing ttvs in this data set doesnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates perstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with asingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. weanticipate that kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems withmultiple transiting planet candidates via ttvs. thus, ttvs will provide apowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbitaldynamics of low-mass planets. if kepler observations were extended to at leastsix years, then ttvs would provide much more precise constraints on thedynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitiveto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-typestars.

1102.0605	kepler's first rocky planet: kepler-10b	nasa's kepler mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency ofearth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of sun-like stars. the missionreached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rockyplanet, kepler-10b. two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemerist[bjd]=2454964.57375+n*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris t[bjd]=2454971.6761+n*45.29485 days.statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established theviability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-upobservations. forty precision doppler measurements were used to confirm thatthe short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. the parent staris bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. photometry was collected at1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsationfrequencies. modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of thefundamental stellar properties. kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5gyr) but otherwise sun-like main sequence star with teff=5627 +/- 44 k,mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 msun, and rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 rsun. physical modelssimultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision dopplermeasurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of kepler-10b thatspeak to its rocky composition: mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 mearth, rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036rearth, and density=8.8 +/- 2.9 gcc. kepler-10b is the smallest transitingexoplanet discovered to date.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1105.5143	the high albedo of the hot jupiter kepler-7b	hot jupiters are expected to be dark from both observations (albedo upperlimits) and theory (alkali metals and/or tio and vo absorption). however, onlya handful of hot jupiters have been observed with high enough photometricprecision at visible wavelengths to investigate these expectations. the nasakepler mission provides a means to widen the sample and to assess the extent towhich hot jupiter albedos are low. we present a global analysis of kepler-7bbased on q0-q4 data, published radial velocities, and asteroseismologyconstraints. we measure an occultation depth in the kepler bandpass of 44+-5ppm. if directly related to the albedo, this translates to a kepler geometricalbedo of 0.32+-0.03, the most precise value measured so far for an exoplanet.we also characterize the planetary orbital phase lightcurve with an amplitudeof 42+-4 ppm. using atmospheric models, we find it unlikely that the highalbedo is due to a dominant thermal component and propose two solutions toexplain the observed planetary flux. firstly, we interpret the kepler-7b albedoas resulting from an excess reflection over what can be explained solely byrayleigh scattering, along with a nominal thermal component. this excessreflection might indicate the presence of a cloud or haze layer in theatmosphere, motivating new modeling and observational efforts. alternatively,the albedo can be explained by rayleigh scattering alone if na and k aredepleted in the atmosphere by a factor of 10-100 below solar abundances.

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.1048	detection of potential transit signals in the first three quarters of  kepler mission data	we present the results of a search for potential transit signals in the firstthree quarters of photometry data acquired by the kepler mission. the targetsof the search include 151,722 stars which were observed over the full intervaland an additional 19,132 stars which were observed for only 1 or 2 quarters.from this set of targets we find a total of 5,392 detections which meet thekepler detection criteria: those criteria are periodicity of the signal, anacceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and a composition test which rejects spuriousdetections which contain non-physical combinations of events. the detectedsignals are dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratio andby events with relatively short periods. the distribution of estimated transitdepths appears to peak in the range between 40 and 100 parts per million, witha few detections down to fewer than 10 parts per million. the detected signalsare compared to a set of known transit events in the kepler field of view whichwere derived by a different method using a longer data interval; the comparisonshows that the current search correctly identified 88.1% of the known events. atabulation of the detected transit signals, examples which illustrate theanalysis and detection process, a discussion of future plans and open,potentially fruitful, areas of further research are included.

1201.1892	transit timing observations from kepler: vi. transit timing variation  candidates in the first seventeen months from polynomial models	transit timing variations provide a powerful tool for confirming andcharacterizing transiting planets, as well as detecting non-transiting planets.we report the results an updated ttv analysis for 1481 planet candidates(borucki et al. 2011; batalha et al. 2012) based on transit times measuredduring the first sixteen months of kepler observations. we present 39 strongttv candidates based on long-term trends (2.8% of suitable data sets). wepresent another 136 weaker ttv candidates (9.8% of suitable data sets) based onexcess scatter of ttv measurements about a linear ephemeris. we anticipate thatseveral of these planet candidates could be confirmed and perhaps characterizedwith more detailed ttv analyses using publicly available kepler observations.for many others, kepler has observed a long-term ttv trend, but an extendedkepler mission will be required to characterize the system via ttvs. we findthat the occurrence rate of planet candidates that show ttvs is significantlyincreased (~68%) for planet candidates transiting stars with multipletransiting planet candidate when compared to planet candidates transiting starswith a single transiting planet candidate.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5415	transit timing observations from kepler: iv. confirmation of 4 multiple  planet systems by simple physical models	eighty planetary systems of two or more planets are known to orbit starsother than the sun. for most, the data can be sufficiently explained bynon-interacting keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of thesesystems have not been observed. here we present 4 sets of lightcurves from thekepler spacecraft, which each show multiple planets transiting the same star.departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates theplanets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match theforcing frequency of the other planet. this confirms that these objects are inthe same system. next we limit their masses to the planetary regime byrequiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. finally, wereport dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for theplanets' masses and eccentricities. as the timespan of timing data increases,dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,even in cases for which high-precision doppler follow-up is impractical.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1202.6328	architecture of kepler's multi-transiting systems: ii. new  investigations with twice as many candidates	we report on the orbital architectures of kepler systems having multipleplanet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first sixquarters of kepler data and reported by batalha et al. (2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1207.6032	using most to reveal the secrets of the mischievous wolf-rayet binary cv  ser	the wr binary cv serpentis (= wr113, wc8d + o8-9iv) has been a source ofmystery since it was shown that its atmospheric eclipses change with time overdecades, in addition to its sporadic dust production. the first high-precisiontime-dependent photometric observations obtained with the most space telescopein 2009 show two consecutive eclipses over the 29d orbit, with varying depths.a subsequent most run in 2010 showed a seemingly asymmetric eclipse profile. inorder to help make sense of these observations, parallel optical spectroscopywas obtained from the mont megantic observatory (2009, 2010) and from thedominion astrophysical observatory (2009). assuming these depth variations areentirely due to electron scattering in a beta-law wind, an unprecedented 62%increase in mass-loss rate is observed over one orbital period. alternatively,no change in mass-loss rate would be required if a relatively small fraction ofthe carbon ions in the wind globally recombined and coaggulated to form carbondust grains. however, it remains a mystery as to how this could occur. therealso seems to be evidence for the presence of corotating interaction regions(cir) in the wr wind: a cir-like signature is found in the light curves,implying a potential rotation period for the wr star of 1.6 d. finally, a newcircular orbit is derived, along with constraints for the wind collision.

1311.0248	detection of potential transit signals in sixteen quarters of kepler  mission data	we present the results of a search for potential transit signals in fouryears of photometry data acquired by the kepler mission. the targets of thesearch include 111,800 stars which were observed for the entire interval and85,522 stars which were observed for a subset of the interval. we found that9,743 targets contained at least one signal consistent with the signature of atransiting or eclipsing object, where the criteria for detection areperiodicity of the detected transits, adequate signal-to-noise ratio, andacceptance by a number of tests which reject false positive detections. whentargets that had produced a signal were searched repeatedly, an additional6,542 signals were detected on 3,223 target stars, for a total of 16,285potential detections. comparison of the set of detected signals with a set ofknown and vetted transit events in the kepler field of view shows that therecovery rate for these signals is 96.9%. the ensemble properties of thedetected signals are reviewed.

1312.0662	revised stellar properties of kepler targets for the quarter 1-16  transit detection run	we present revised properties for 196,468 stars observed by the nasa keplermission and used in the analysis of quarter 1-16 (q1-q16) data to detect andcharacterize transiting exoplanets. the catalog is based on a compilation ofliterature values for atmospheric properties (temperature, surface gravity, andmetallicity) derived from different observational techniques (photometry,spectroscopy, asteroseismology, and exoplanet transits), which were thenhomogeneously fitted to a grid of dartmouth stellar isochrones. we usebroadband photometry and asteroseismology to characterize 11,532 kepler targetswhich were previously unclassified in the kepler input catalog (kic). we reportthe detection of oscillations in 2,762 of these targets, classifying them asgiant stars and increasing the number of known oscillating giant stars observedby kepler by ~20% to a total of ~15,500 stars. typical uncertainties in derivedradii and masses are ~40% and ~20%, respectively, for stars with photometricconstraints only, and 5-15% and ~10% for stars based on spectroscopy and/orasteroseismology, although these uncertainties vary strongly with spectral typeand luminosity class. a comparison with the q1-q12 catalog shows a systematicdecrease in radii for m dwarfs, while radii for k dwarfs decrease or increasedepending on the q1-q12 provenance (kic or yonsei-yale isochrones). radii off-g dwarfs are on average unchanged, with the exception of newly identifiedgiants. the q1-q16 star properties catalog is a first step towards an improvedcharacterization of all kepler targets to support planet occurrence studies.

1312.5358	planetary candidates observed by kepler iv: planet sample from q1-q8 (22  months)	we provide updates to the kepler planet candidate sample based upon nearlytwo years of high-precision photometry (i.e., q1-q8). from an initial list ofnearly 13,400 threshold crossing events (tces), 480 new host stars areidentified from their flux time series as consistent with hosting transitingplanets. potential transit signals are subjected to further analysis using thepixel-level data, which allows background eclipsing binaries to be identifiedthrough small image position shifts during transit. we also re-evaluate keplerobjects of interest (koi) 1-1609, which were identified early in the mission,using substantially more data to test for background false positives and tofind additional multiple systems. combining the new and previous koi samples,we provide updated parameters for 2,738 kepler planet candidates distributedacross 2,017 host stars. from the combined kepler planet candidates, 472 arenew from the q1-q8 data examined in this study. the new kepler planetcandidates represent ~40% of the sample with rp~1 rearth and represent ~40% ofthe low equilibrium temperature (teq&lt;300 k) sample. we review the known biasesin the current sample of kepler planet candidates relevant to evaluating planetpopulation statistics with the current kepler planet candidate sample.

1401.1240	contamination in the kepler field. identification of 685 kois as false  positives via ephemeris matching based on q1-q12 data	the kepler mission has to date found almost 6,000 planetary transit-likesignals, utilizing three years of data for over 170,000 stars at extremely highphotometric precision. due to its design, contamination from eclipsingbinaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significantnumber of these signals being false positives. this directly affects thedetermination of the occurrence rate of earth-like planets in our galaxy, aswell as other planet population statistics. in order to detect as many of thesefalse positives as possible, we perform ephemeris matching among all transitingplanet, eclipsing binary, and variable star sources. we find that 685 keplerobjects of interest - 12% of all those analyzed - are false positives as aresult of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. of these, 118 havenot previously been identified by other methods. we estimate that ~35% of koisare false positives due to contamination, when performing a first-ordercorrection for observational bias. comparing single-planet candidate kois tomulti-planet candidate kois, we find an observed false positive fraction due tocontamination of 16% and 2.4% respectively, bolstering the existing evidencethat multi-planet kois are significantly less likely to be false positives. wealso analyze the parameter distributions of the ephemeris matches and derive asimple model for the most common type of contamination in the kepler field. wefind that the ephemeris matching technique is able to identify lowsignal-to-noise false positives that are difficult to identify with othervetting techniques. we expect false positive kois to become more frequent whenanalyzing more quarters of kepler data, and note that many of them will not beable to be identified based on kepler data alone.

1401.4195	masses, radii, and orbits of small kepler planets: the transition from  gaseous to rocky planets	we report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 keplerstars. there are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detectedthrough transits and 7 revealed by precise doppler measurements of the hoststars. based on an analysis of the kepler brightness measurements, along withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities for allof the transiting planets (41 of 42 have a false-positive probability under1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. most of the transiting planetsare smaller than 3x the size of earth. for 16 planets, the doppler signal wassecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. for theother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limitsto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rockycomposition. we identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting amostly rocky interior for them. indeed, the only planets that are compatiblewith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 r_earth. larger planetsevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (h, he, and h2o).

1402.6352	validation of kepler's multiple planet candidates. ii: refined  statistical framework and descriptions of systems of special interest	we extend the statistical analysis of lissauer et al.

1402.6534	validation of kepler's multiple planet candidates. iii: light curve  analysis &amp; announcement of hundreds of new multi-planet systems	the kepler mission has discovered over 2500 exoplanet candidates in the firsttwo years of spacecraft data, with approximately 40% of them in candidatemulti-planet systems. the high rate of multiplicity combined with the low rateof identified false-positives indicates that the multiplanet systems containvery few false-positive signals due to other systems not gravitationally boundto the target star (lissauer, j. j., et al., 2012, apj 750, 131). falsepositives in the multi- planet systems are identified and removed, leavingbehind a residual population of candidate multi-planet transiting systemsexpected to have a false-positive rate less than 1%. we present a sample of 340planetary systems that contain 851 planets that are validated to substantiallybetter than the 99% confidence level; the vast majority of these have not beenpreviously verified as planets. we expect ~2 unidentified false-positivesmaking our sample of planet very reliable. we present fundamental planetaryproperties of our sample based on a comprehensive analysis of kepler lightcurves and ground-based spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging. since we donot require spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging for validation, some of ourderived parameters for a planetary system may be systematically incorrect dueto dilution from light due to additional stars in the photometric aperture.none the less, our result nearly doubles the number of verified exoplanets.

1403.7843	most detects corotating bright spots on the mid-o type giant {\xi}  persei	we have used the most (microvariability and oscillations of stars)microsatellite to obtain four weeks of contiguous high-precision broadbandvisual photometry of the o7.5iii(n)((f)) star {\xi} persei in november 2011.this star is well known from previous work to show prominent dacs (discreteabsorption components) on time-scales of about 2 d from uv spectroscopy and nrp(non radial pulsation) with one (l = 3) p-mode oscillation with a period of 3.5h from optical spectroscopy. our most-orbit (101.4 min) binned photometry failsto reveal any periodic light variations above the 0.1 mmag 3-sigma noise levelfor periods of hours, while several prominent fourier peaks emerge at the 1mmag level in the two-day period range. these longer-period variations areunlikely due to pulsations, including gravity modes. from our simulations basedupon a simple spot model, we deduce that we are seeing the photometricmodulation of several co-rotating bright spots on the stellar surface. in ourmodel, the starting times (random) and lifetimes (up to several rotations) varyfrom one spot to another yet all spots rotate at the same period of 4.18 d, thebest-estimated rotation period of the star. this is the first convincingreported case of co-rotating bright spots on an o star, with importantimplications for drivers of the dacs (resulting from cirs - corotatinginteraction regions) with possible bright-spot generation via a breakout at thesurface of a global magnetic field generated by a subsurface convection zone.

1409.1721	a stable quasi-periodic 4.18 d oscillation and mysterious occultations  in the 2011 most light curve of twhya	we present an analysis of the 2011 photometric observations of tw hya by themost satellite; this is the fourth continuous series of this type. thelarge-scale light variations are dominated by a strong, quasi-periodic 4.18 doscillation with superimposed, apparently chaotic flaring activity; the formeris most likely produced by stellar rotation with one large hot spot created bya stable accretion funnel in the stable regime of accretion while the lattermay be produced by small hot spots, created at moderate latitudes by unstableaccretion tongues. a new, previously unnoticed feature is a series ofsemi-periodic, well defined brightness dips of unknown nature of which 19 wereobserved during 43 days of our nearly-continuous observations. re-analysis ofthe 2009 most light curve revealed the presence of 3 similar dips. on the basisof recent theoretical results, we tentatively conclude that the dips mayrepresent occultations of the small hot spots created by unstable accretiontongues by hypothetical optically thick clumps.

1506.04175	terrestrial planet occurrence rates for the kepler gk dwarf sample	we measure planet occurrence rates using the planet candidates discovered bythe q1-q16 kepler pipeline search. this study examines planet occurrence ratesfor the kepler gk dwarf target sample for planet radii, 0.75&lt;rp&lt;2.5 rearth, andorbital periods, 50&lt;porb&lt;300 days, with an emphasis on a thorough explorationand identification of the most important sources of systematic uncertainties.integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of f=0.77planets per star, with an allowed range of 0.3&lt;f&lt;1.9. the allowed range takesinto account both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and values of fbeyond the allowed range are significantly in disagreement with our analysis.we generally find higher planet occurrence rates and a steeper increase inplanet occurrence rates towards small planets than previous studies of thekepler gk dwarf sample. through extrapolation, we find that the one yearorbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate, zeta_1=0.1, with an allowedrange of 0.01&lt;zeta_1&lt;2, where zeta_1 is defined as the number of planets perstar within 20% of the rp and porb of earth. for g dwarf hosts, the zeta_1parameter space is a subset of the larger eta_earth parameter space, thuszeta_1 places a lower limit on eta_earth for g dwarf hosts. from our analysis,we identify the leading sources of systematics impacting kepler occurrence ratedeterminations as: reliability of the planet candidate sample, planet radii,pipeline completeness, and stellar parameters.

1506.07067	the mass of the mars-sized exoplanet kepler-138 b from transit timing	extrasolar planets that pass in front of their host star (transit) cause atemporary decrease in the apparent brightness of the star once per orbit,providing a direct measure of the planet's size and orbital period. in somesystems with multiple transiting planets, the times of the transits aremeasurably affected by the gravitational interactions between neighbouringplanets. in favorable cases, the departures from keplerian orbits implied bythe observed transit times permit planetary masses to be measured, which is keyto determining bulk densities. characterizing rocky planets is particularlydifficult, since they are generally smaller and less massive than gaseousplanets. thus, few exoplanets near earth's size have had their masses measured.here we report the sizes and masses of three planets orbiting kepler-138, astar much fainter and cooler than the sun. we measure the mass of themars-sized inner planet based on on the transit times of its neighbour andthereby provide the first density measurement for an exoplanet smaller thanearth. the middle and outer planets are both slightly larger than earth. themiddle planet's density is similar to that of earth, while the outer planet isless than half as dense, implying that it contains a greater portion of lowdensity components such as h2o and/or h2.

1512.01992	stable and unstable accretion in the classical t tauri stars im lup and  ru lup as observed by most	results of the time variability monitoring of the two classical t tauristars, ru lup and im lup, are presented. three photometric data sets wereutilised: (1) simultaneous (same field) most satellite observations over fourweeks in each of the years 2012 and 2013, (2) multicolour observations at thesaao in april - may of 2013, (3) archival v-filter asas data for nine seasons,2001 - 2009. they were augmented by an analysis of high-resolution,public-domain vlt-ut2 uves spectra from the years 2000 to 2012. from the mostobservations, we infer that irregular light variations of ru lup are caused bystochastic variability of hot spots induced by unstable accretion. in contrast,the most light curves of im lup are fairly regular and modulated with a periodof about 7.19 - 7.58 d, which is in accord with asas observations showing awell defined 7.247+/-0.026 d periodicity. we propose that this is therotational period of im lup and is due to the changing visibility of twoantipodal hot spots created near the stellar magnetic poles during the stableprocess of accretion. re-analysis of ru lup high-resolution spectra with thebroadening function approach reveals signs of a large polar cold spot, which isfairly stable over 13 years. as the star rotates, the spot-induced depressionof intensity in the broadening function profiles changes cyclically with period3.71058 d, which was previously found by the spectral cross-correlation method.

1512.07090	neptune's dynamic atmosphere from kepler k2 observations: implications  for brown dwarf light curve analyses	observations of neptune with the kepler space telescope yield a 49-day lightcurve with 98% coverage at a 1-minute cadence. a significant signature in thelight curve comes from discrete cloud features. we compare results extractedfrom the light curve data with contemporaneous disk-resolved imaging of neptunefrom the keck 10-meter telescope at 1.65 microns and hubble space telescopevisible imaging acquired 9 months later. this direct comparison validates thefeature latitudes assigned to the k2 light curve periods based on neptune'szonal wind profile, and confirms observed cloud feature variability. althoughneptune's clouds vary in location and intensity on short and long time scales,a single large discrete storm seen in keck imaging dominates the k2 and hubblelight curves; smaller or fainter clouds likely contribute to short-termbrightness variability. the k2 neptune light curve, in conjunction with ourimaging data, provides context for the interpretation of current and futurebrown dwarf and extrasolar planet variability measurements. in particular wesuggest that the balance between large, relatively stable, atmospheric featuresand smaller, more transient, clouds controls the character of substellaratmospheric variability. atmospheres dominated by a few large spots may showinherently greater light curve stability than those which exhibit a greaternumber of smaller features.
