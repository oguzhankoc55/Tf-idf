0902.3186	strong gravitational lensing as a probe of gravity, dark-matter and  super-massive black holes	whereas considerable effort has been afforded in understanding the propertiesof galaxies, a full physical picture, connecting their baryonic and dark-mattercontent, super-massive black holes, and (metric) theories of gravity, is stillill-defined. strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probegravity in the central regions of galaxies. it can (1) provide a uniquedetection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detectionexperiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe centralsuper-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxyformation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of thenature and state of dark matter. to seriously address the above questions, aconsiderable increase in the number of strong gravitational-lens systems isrequired. in the timeframe 2010-2020, a staged approach with radio (e.g. evla,e-merlin, lofar, ska phase-i) and optical (e.g. lsst and jdem) instruments canprovide 10^(2-4) new lenses, and up to 10^(4-6) new lens systems fromska/lsst/jdem all-sky surveys around ~2020. follow-up imaging of (radio) lensesis necessary with moderate ground/space-based optical-ir telescopes and with30-50m telescopes for spectroscopy (e.g. tmt, gmt, elt). to answer thesefundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investmentin large radio and optical-ir facilities is therefore critical in the comingdecade. in particular, only large-scale radio lens surveys (e.g. with ska)provide the large numbers of high-resolution and high-fidelity images of lensesneeded for smbh and flux-ratio anomaly studies.

0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1206.0731	microlensing of the broad line region in 17 lensed quasars	when an image of a strongly lensed quasar is microlensed, the differentcomponents of its spectrum are expected to be differentially magnified owing tothe different sizes of the corresponding emitting region. chromatic changes areexpected to be observed in the continuum while the emission lines should bedeformed as a function of the size, geometry and kinematics of the regions fromwhich they originate. microlensing of the emission lines has been reported onlyin a handful of systems so far. in this paper we search for microlensingdeformations of the optical spectra of pairs of images in 17 lensed quasars.this sample is composed of 13 pairs of previously unpublished spectra and fourpairs of spectra from literature. our analysis is based on a spectraldecomposition technique which allows us to isolate the microlensed fraction ofthe flux independently of a detailed modeling of the quasar emission lines.using this technique, we detect microlensing of the continuum in 85% of thesystems. among them, 80% show microlensing of the broad emission lines.focusing on the most common lines in our spectra (ciii] and mgii) we detectmicrolensing of either the blue or the red wing, or of both wings with the sameamplitude. this observation implies that the broad line region is not ingeneral spherically symmetric. in addition, the frequent detection ofmicrolensing of the blue and red wings independently but not simultaneouslywith a different amplitude, does not support existing microlensing simulationsof a biconical outflow. our analysis also provides the intrinsic flux ratiobetween the lensed images and the magnitude of the microlensing affecting thecontinuum. these two quantities are particularly relevant for the determinationof the fraction of matter in clumpy form in galaxies and for the detection ofdark matter substructures via the identification of flux ratio anomalies.

1207.1244	a possible binary system of a stellar remnant in the high magnification  gravitational microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-514	we report the extremely high magnification (a &gt; 1000) binary microlensingevent ogle-2007-blg-514. we obtained good coverage around the double peakstructure in the light curve via follow-up observations from differentobservatories. the binary lens model that includes the effects of parallax(known orbital motion of the earth) and orbital motion of the lens yields abinary lens mass ratio of q = 0.321 +/- 0.007 and a projected separation of s =0.072 +/- 0.001$ in units of the einstein radius. the parallax parameters allowus to determine the lens distance d_l = 3.11 +/- 0.39 kpc and total massm_l=1.40 +/- 0.18 m_sun; this leads to the primary and secondary componentshaving masses of m_1 = 1.06 +/- 0.13 m_sun and m_2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 m_sun,respectively. the parallax model indicates that the binary lens system islikely constructed by the main sequence stars. on the other hand, we used abayesian analysis to estimate probability distributions by the model thatincludes the effects of xallarap (possible orbital motion of the source arounda companion) and parallax (q = 0.270 +/- 0.005, s = 0.083 +/- 0.001). theprimary component of the binary lens is relatively massive with m_1 =0.9_{-0.3}^{+4.6} m_sun and it is at a distance of d_l = 2.6_{-0.9}^{+3.8} kpc.given the secure mass ratio measurement, the companion mass is therefore m_2 =0.2_{-0.1}^{+1.2} m_sun. the xallarap model implies that the primary lens islikely a stellar remnant, such as a white dwarf, a neutron star or a blackhole.

0711.4265	the multiple quasar q2237+0305 under a microlensing caustic	we use the high magnification event seen in the 1999 ogle campaign lightcurve of image c of the quadruply imaged gravitational lens q2237+0305 to studythe structure of the quasar engine. we have obtained g'- and r'-band photometryat the apache point observatory 3.5m telescope where we find that the event hasa smaller amplitude in the r'-band than in the g'- and ogle v-bands. bycomparing the light curves with microlensing simulations we obtain constraintson the sizes of the quasar regions contributing to the g'- and r'-band flux.assuming that most of the surface mass density in the central kiloparsec of thelensing galaxy is due to stars and by modeling the source with a gaussianprofile, we obtain for the gaussian width 1.20 x 10^15 sqrt(m/0.1m_sun)cm &lt;sigma_g' &lt; 7.96 x 10^15 sqrt(m/0.1msun) cm, where m is the mean microlensingmass, and a ratio sigma_r'/sigma_g'=1.25^{+0.45}_{-0.15}. with the limits onthe velocity of the lensing galaxy from gil-merino et al.

1211.3782	moa-2010-blg-073l: an m-dwarf with a substellar companion at the  planet/brown dwarf boundary	we present an analysis of the anomalous microlensing event, moa-2010-blg-073,announced by the microlensing observations in astrophysics survey on2010-03-18.  this event was remarkable because the source was previously known to bephotometrically variable. analyzing the pre-event source lightcurve, wedemonstrate that it is an irregular variable over time scales &gt;200d. itsdereddened color, $(v-i)_{s,0}$, is 1.221$\pm$0.051mag and from our lens modelwe derive a source radius of 14.7$\pm$1.3 $r_{\odot}$, suggesting that it is ared giant star.  we initially explored a number of purely microlensing models for the eventbut found a residual gradient in the data taken prior to and after the event.this is likely to be due to the variability of the source rather than part ofthe lensing event, so we incorporated a slope parameter in our model in orderto derive the true parameters of the lensing system.  we find that the lensing system has a mass ratio of q=0.0654$\pm$0.0006. theeinstein crossing time of the event, $t_{\rm{e}}=44.3$\pm$0.1d, wassufficiently long that the lightcurve exhibited parallax effects. in addition,the source trajectory relative to the large caustic structure allowed theorbital motion of the lens system to be detected. combining the parallax withthe einstein radius, we were able to derive the distance to the lens,$d_l$=2.8$\pm$0.4kpc, and the masses of the lensing objects. the primary of thelens is an m-dwarf with $m_{l,p}$=0.16$\pm0.03m_{\odot}$ while the companionhas $m_{l,s}$=11.0$\pm2.0m_{\rm{j}}$ putting it in the boundary zone betweenplanets and brown dwarfs.

1303.1176	mid-infrared microlensing of accretion disc and dusty torus in quasars:  effects on flux ratio anomalies	multiply-imaged quasars and agns observed in the mid-infrared (mir) range arecommonly assumed to be unaffected by the microlensing produced by the stars intheir lensing galaxy. in this paper, we investigate the validity domain of thisassumption. indeed, that premise disregards microlensing of the accretion discin the mir range, and does not account for recent progress in our knowledge ofthe dusty torus. to simulate microlensing, we first built a simplified image ofthe quasar composed of an accretion disc, and of a larger ring-like torus. themock quasars are then microlensed using an inverse ray-shooting code. wesimulated the wavelength and size dependence of microlensing for differentlensed image types and fraction of compact objects projected in the lens. thisallows us to derive magnification probabilities as a function of wavelength, aswell as to calculate the microlensing-induced deformation of the spectralenergy distribution of the lensed images. we find that microlensing variationsas large as 0.1 mag are very common at 11 microns (observer-frame). the mainsignal comes from microlensing of the accretion disc, which may be significanteven when the fraction of flux from the disc is as small as 5 % of the totalflux. we also show that the torus of sources with lbol &lt;~ 10^45 erg/s isexpected to be noticeably microlensed. microlensing may thus be used to getinsight into the rest near-infrared inner structure of agns. finally, weinvestigate whether microlensing in the mid-infrared can alter the so-calledrcusp relation that links the fluxes of the lensed images triplet produced whenthe source lies close to a cusp macro-caustic. this relation is commonly usedto identify massive (dark-matter) substructures in lensing galaxies. we findthat significant deviations from rcusp may be expected, which means thatmicrolensing can explain part of the flux ratio problem.

astro-ph;0011029	on the probability of microlensing in grb afterglows	the declining lightcurve of the optical afterglow of gamma-ray burstgrb000301c showed rapid variability with one particularly bright feature atabout t-t0=3.8 days. this event was interpreted as gravitational microlensingby garnavich, loeb &amp; stanek (2000) and subsequently used to derive constraintson the structure of the grb optical afterglow. in this paper, we use thesestructural parameters to calculate the probability of such a microlensing eventin a realistic scenario, where all compact objects in the universe areassociated with observable galaxies. for grb000301c at a redshift of z=2.04,the `a posteriori' probability for a microlensing event with an amplitude ofdm&gt;=0.95 mag (as observed) is 0.7% (2.7%) for the most plausible scenario of aflat lambda-dominated frw universe with omega_m=0.3 and a fraction f_*=0.2(1.0) of dark-matter in the form of compact objects. if we lower themagnification threshold to dm&gt;=0.10 mag, the probabilities for microlensingevents of grb afterglows increase to 17% (57%). we emphasise that this lowprobability for a microlensing signature of almost a magnitude does not excludethat the observed event in the afterglow lightcurve of grb000301c was caused bymicrolensing, especially in light of the fact that a galaxy was found within 2arcsec from the grb. in that case, however, a more robust upper limit on the `aposteriori' probability of ~5% is found. it does show, however, that it willnot be easy to create a large sample of strong grb afterglow microlensingevents for statistical studies of their physical conditions on micro-arcsecscales.

astro-ph;0207117	optical monitoring of the gravitationally lensed quasar q2237+0305 from  apo between june 1995 and january 1998	we present a data set of images of the gravitationally lensed quasarq2237+0305, that was obtained at the apache point observatory (apo) betweenjune 1995 and january 1998. although the images were taken under variable,often poor seeing conditions and with coarse pixel sampling, photometry ispossible for the two brighter quasar images a and b with the help of exactquasar image positions from hst observations. we obtain a light curve with 73data points for each of the images a and b. there is evidence for a long (&gt;~100 day) brightness peak in image a in 1996 with an amplitude of about 0.4 to0.5 mag (relative to 1995), which indicates that microlensing has been takingplace in the lensing galaxy. image b does not vary much over the course of theobservation period. the long, smooth variation of the light curve is similar tothe results from the ogle monitoring of the system (wozniak et al. 2000a).

astro-ph;0302189	extrinsic radio variability of jvas/class gravitational lenses	we present flux-ratio curves of the fold and cusp (i.e. close multiple)images of six jvas/class gravitational lens systems. the data were obtainedover a period of 8.5 months in 2001 with the multi-element radio-linkedinterferometer network (merlin) at 5-ghz with 50 mas resolution, as part of amerlin key-project. even though the time delays between the fold and cuspimages are small (&lt;~1 day) compared to the time-scale of intrinsic sourcevariability, all six lens systems show evidence that suggests the presence ofextrinsic variability. in particular, the cusp images of b2045+265 -- regardedas the strongest case of the violation of the cusp relation (i.e. the sum ofthe magnifications of the three cusp images add to zero) -- show extrinsicvariations in their flux-ratios up to ~40 percent peak-to-peak on time scalesof several months. its low galactic latitude of b=-10 degree and aline-of-sight toward the cygnus superbubble region suggest that galacticscintillation is the most likely cause. the cusp images of b1422+231 at b=+69degree do not show strong extrinsic variability. galactic scintillation cantherefore cause significant scatter in the cusp and fold relations of someradio lens systems (up to 10 percent rms), even though these relations remainviolated when averaged over a &lt;~1 year time baseline.

astro-ph;0401071	probing the atmosphere of the bulge g5iii star ogle-2002-bul-069 by  analysis of microlense h alpha line	we discuss high-resolution, time-resolved spectra of the caustic exit of thebinary microlensing event ogle 2002-bul-69 obtained with uves on the vlt. thesource star is a g5iii giant in the galactic bulge. during such events, thesource star is highly magnified, and a strong differential magnification aroundthe caustic resolves its surface. using an appropriate model stellar atmospheregenerated by the nextgen code we obtained a model light curve for the causticexit and compared it with a dense set of photometric observations obtained bythe planet microlensing follow up network. we further compared predictedvariations in the h alpha equivalent width with those measured from ourspectra. while the model and observations agree in the gross features, thereare discrepancies suggesting shortcomings in the model, particularly for the halpha line core, where we have detected amplified emission from the stellarchromosphere as the source star's trailing limb exited the caustic. thisachievement became possible by the provision of the ogle-iii early warningsystem, a network of small telescopes capable of nearly-continuousround-the-clock photometric monitoring, on-line data reduction, dailynear-real-time modelling in order to predict caustic crossing parameters, and afast and efficient response of a 8m-class telescope to a``target-of-opportunity'' observation request.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

astro-ph;0502018	full characterization of binary-lens event ogle-2002-blg-069 from planet  observations	we analyze the photometric data obtained by planet and ogle on thecaustic-crossing binary-lens microlensing event ogle-2002-blg-069. thanks tothe excellent photometric and spectroscopic coverage of the event, we are ableto constrain the lens model up to the known ambiguity between close and widebinary lenses. the detection of annual parallax in combination withmeasurements of extended-source effects allows us to determine the mass,distance and velocity of the lens components for the competing models. whilethe model involving a close binary lens leads to a bulge-disc lens scenariowith a lens mass of m=(0.51 +- 0.15) m_sol and distance of d_l=(2.9 +- 0.4)kpc, the wide binary lens solution requires a rather implausible binaryblack-hole lens (m &gt;=126 m_sol). furthermore we compare currentstate-of-the-art numerical and empirical models for the surface brightnessprofile of the source, a g5iii bulge giant. we find that a linearlimb-darkening model for the atmosphere of the source star is consistent withthe data whereas a phoenix atmosphere model assuming lte and with no freeparameter does not match our observations.

astro-ph;0506163	report by the esa-eso working group on extra-solar planets	various techniques are being used to search for extra-solar planetarysignatures, including accurate measurement of radial velocity and positional(astrometric) displacements, gravitational microlensing, and photometrictransits. planned space experiments promise a considerable increase in thedetections and statistical knowledge arising especially from transit andastrometric measurements over the years 2005-15, with some hundreds ofterrestrial-type planets expected from transit measurements, and many thousandsof jupiter-mass planets expected from astrometric measurements.  beyond 2015, very ambitious space (darwin/tpf) and ground (owl) experimentsare targeting direct detection of nearby earth-mass planets in the habitablezone and the measurement of their spectral characteristics. beyond these, `lifefinder' (aiming to produce confirmatory evidence of the presence of life) and`earth imager' (some massive interferometric array providing resolved images ofa distant earth) appear as distant visions.  this report, to esa and eso, summarises the direction of exo-planet researchthat can be expected over the next 10 years or so, identifies the roles of themajor facilities of the two organisations in the field, and concludes with somerecommendations which may assist development of the field.  the report has been compiled by the working group members and experts overthe period june-december 2004.

astro-ph;0601563	discovery of a cool planet of 5.5 earth masses through gravitational  microlensing	in the favoured core-accretion model of formation of planetary systems, solidplanetesimals accumulate to build up planetary cores, which then accretenebular gas if they are sufficiently massive. around m-dwarf stars (the mostcommon stars in our galaxy), this model favours the formation of earth-mass toneptune-mass planets with orbital radii of 1 to 10 astronomical units (au),which is consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbitm-dwarf host stars. more than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered witha wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of neptune's mass orless have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 au fromnormal stars. here we report the discovery of a 5.5 (+5.5/-2.7) m_earthplanetary companion at a separation of 2.6 (+1.5/-0.6) au from a 0.22(+0.21/-0.11) m_solar m-dwarf star. (we propose to name it ogle-2005-blg-390lb,indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens star of the microlensingevent.) the mass is lower than that of gj876d, although the error bars overlap.our detection suggests that such cool, sub-neptune-mass planets may be morecommon than gas giant planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory.

astro-ph;0607513	a time delay for the largest gravitationally lensed quasar: sdss  j1004+4112	we present 426 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 1000 days fromdecember 2003 to june 2006 for the gravitationally lensed quasar sdssj1004+4112. the time delay between the a and b images is 38.4+/-2.0 days in theexpected sense that b leads a and the overall time ordering is c-b-a-d-e. themeasured delay invalidates all published models. the models failed because theyneglected the perturbations from cluster member galaxies. models including thegalaxies can fit the data well, but strong conclusions about the cluster massdistribution should await the measurement of the longer, and less substructuresensitive, delays of the c and d images. for these images, a cb delay of681+/-15 days is plausible but requires confirmation, while cb and ad delays of&gt;560 days and &gt; 800 days are required. we clearly detect microlensing of thea/b images, with the delay-corrected flux ratios changing from b-a=0.44+/-0.01mag in the first season to 0.29+/-0.01 mag in the second season and 0.32+/-0.01mag in the third season.

astro-ph;9508145	a sharp event in the image a light curve of the double quasar 0957+561  and prediction of the 1996 image b light curve	ccd photometry of the gravitational lens system 0957+561a,b in the g and rbands was obtained on alternate nights, weather permitting, from december 1994through may 1995 using the double imaging spectrograph (dis) on the apachepoint observatory (apo) 3.5-meter telescope. the remote observing and fastinstrument change capabilities of this facility allowed accumulation of lightcurves sampled frequently and consistently. the honeycutt ensemble photometryalgorithm was applied to the data set and yielded typical relative photometricerrors of approximately 0.01 magnitudes. image a exhibited a sharp drop ofabout 0.1 magnitudes in late december 1994; no other strong features wererecorded in either image. this event displays none of the expected genericfeatures of a microlensing-induced flux variation and is likely to be intrinsicto the quasar; if so, it should also be seen in the b image with the lensingdifferential time delay. we give the expected 1996 image b light curves basedon two values of the time delay and brightness ratio which have been proposedand debated in the literature. continued monitoring of the system in the firsthalf of 1996 should easily detect the image b event and thus resolve thetime-delay controversy.

astro-ph;9512136	rosat/pspc observation of the distant cluster cl0939+472	we present results and an analysis of a rosat pspc pointed observation of thegalaxy cluster cl0939+472. this very rich and very distant cluster is known tocontain an unusually high fraction of blue and e+a galaxies, and a lot ofmerging of galaxies is going on. the x-ray properties we find are also quiteunusual. the luminosity in the rosat band (0.1-2.4 kev) is $l_x = (6.7\pm 0.3)\times 10^{44}$erg/s, rather on the low side for such a rich cluster. we find atemperature of 2.9$_{-0.8}^{+1.3}$ kev, which is also relatively low, but hasalso a large uncertainty. the cluster shows indications of substructure, whichresults in a high value for the core radius and a steep drop off outside thecore, if one fits a spherically symmetric $\beta$-model. the lower limit on themass inside a radius of $1.0 h_{50}^{-1}$mpc is $2.6 \times 10^{14} \msol$, andthe upper limit on the gas mass fraction is 50\%. all the unusual properties ofthis cluster can be explained if in fact we see the merging of two clusters ofroughly equal mass, which is also supported by recent optical observations.

astro-ph;9606048	vla observations of the gravitational lens system q2237+0305	we report observations of the four-image gravitational lens system q2237+0305with the vla at 20 cm and 3.6 cm. the quasar was detected at both frequencies(\approx 0.7 mjy) with a flat spectrum. all four lensed images are clearlyresolved at 3.6 cm, and the agreement of the radio and optical image positionsis excellent. no radio emission is detected from the lensing galaxy, and anyfifth lensed quasar image must be fainter than \sim 20% of the a image fluxdensity. since the optical quasar images are variable and susceptible toextinction, radio flux ratios provide the best measurement of the macrolensingmagnification ratios. the radio b/a and c/a image flux ratios are consistentwith the observed range of optical variations, but the d/a ratio isconsistently higher in the radio than in the optical. the radio ratios areconsistent with magnification ratios predicted by lens models, and weakenalternative interpretations for q2237+0305. more accurate radio ratios candistinguish between the models, as well as improve our understanding of bothmicrolensing and extinction in this system.

astro-ph;9805359	ultraviolet images of the gravitationally lensed quadruple quasar  q2237+0305 with the hst	we analyze observations of the quadruple lensed quasar q2237+0305, taken withthe wfpc2 camera in the f336w and f300w bands. 25 exposures were performedwithin 15 hours real time on 3 november 1995. on a timescale of 3--4 hours, weobserve no variation in component a of greater than 0.02 mag. the othercomponents are constant over a period of 10 hours to within about 0.05 mag. inthe final 5 hours there is some evidence (not conclusive) for variation ofcomponent d by about 0.1 mag. component a was brighter than component b byabout 0.3 mag. components c and d were fainter than component a by about 1.3and 1.4 mag. any fifth (central) component was at least 6.5 mag fainter thancomponent a. using the pc chip, we measure the relative distances of the fourcomponents with high accuracy. our values are systematically larger than otherinvestigators' (by 0.1% to 2.0%). the f336w filter had been chosen for theobservations because it could have allowed us to see extended ly-alpha emissionfrom the broad-line region (blr). however, the quasar components are consistentwith a point source. we conclude that there cannot be a ly-alpha feature in theimage plane brighter than about 23.5 mag in f336w and further from the quasarcore than 100 mas. according to a lensing model by rix, scheider &amp; bahcall(1992), this would preclude any such features in the source plane further than20 mas (~ 100 h^{-1} pc, assuming q_0 = 0.5) from the quasar core and brighterthan 25 mag before magnification.

astro-ph;9807335	x-ray observations of the rich cluster cl 0939+4713 and discovery of the  strongly variable source rxj0943.0+4701	recent x-ray observations of the rich galaxy cluster cl 0939+4713 at z = 0.41with the rosat/hri as well as with the asca/gis and asca/sis are presented andanalysed. with the high resolution imaging data we confirm and extend theearlier impression that the cluster has a lot of substructure. two maxima ofthe cluster emission are obvious in the images, each of them shows even someinternal structure. for the total luminosity of the cluster in the rosat bandwe obtain l = 6.4_{-0.3}^{+0.7} 10^{44} erg/s. we perform spectral fits for thetwo asca instruments and for the rosat/pspc simultaneously. the most reliablenumbers for the temperature and metallicity for the intracluster gas are t =7.6^{+2.8}_{-1.6} kev and m = 0.22^{+0.24}_{-0.22} msol, respectively. we finda relatively small total mass, a small gas mass ratio and a small iron mass tolight ratio. these numbers together with relatively low luminosity for such anoptically rich cluster and the pronounced substructure confirm that cl0939+4713 is a young cluster still far away from a virialised state.  in the same rosat/hri image the x-ray emission of a background quasar (z\approx 2) can clearly be identified. with a luminosity of l \approx 1.410^{45} erg/s it belongs to the x-ray brightest quasars. a striking differencebetween the rosat/pspc and the rosat/hri observations (taken almost five yearsapart) is the fainting of one x-ray source rxj0943.0+4701 by at least a factorof ten. we try to identify this source from deep optical data. our bestcandidate is a blue compact object, possibly an agn.
