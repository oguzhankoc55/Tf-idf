0901.1150	structural properties of central galaxies in groups and clusters	using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (cens) from the sdssdr4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members ingroups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (mstar), (2) dark matterhalo mass of the host group (mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. weestablish and thoroughly test a galfit-based pipeline to fit 2d sersic modelsto sdss data. we find that the fitting results are most sensitive to thebackground sky level determination and strongly recommend using the sdss globalvalue. we find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strongcovariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and sersic index(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. we find that n depends strongly onmstar for cens, but only weakly or not at all on mhalo. less (more) massivecens tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full mhalo range. likewise, thereis a clear r50-mstar relation for cens, with separate slopes for disks andspheroids. when comparing cens with satellite galaxies (sats), we find that lowmass (&lt;10e10.75 msun/h^2) sats have larger median n than cens of similar mstar.low mass, late-type sats have moderately smaller r50 than late-type cens of thesame mstar. however, we find no size differences between spheroid-like cens andsats, and no structural differences between cens and sats matched in both massand colour. the similarity of massive sats and cens shows that this distinctionhas no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. we conclude that mstaris the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.the lack of a clear n-mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass forproducing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processesmust occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

0901.4340	the evolution of the scatter of the cosmic average color-magnitude  relation: demonstrating consistency with the ongoing formation of elliptical  galaxies	we present first measurements of the evolution of the scatter of the cosmicaverage early-type galaxy color-magnitude relation (cmr) from z=1 to thepresent day, finding that it is consistent with models in which galaxies areconstantly being added to the red sequence through truncation of star formationin blue cloud galaxies. we used a sample of over 700 red sequence,structurally-selected early-type galaxies (defined to have sersic index &gt;2.5)with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 taken from the extended chandra deep field south (173galaxies) and the sloan digital sky survey (550 galaxies), constructingrest-frame u-v colors accurate to &lt;0.04mag. we find that the scatter of the cmrof cosmic average early-type galaxies is ~0.1mag in rest-frame u-v color at0.05&lt;z&lt;0.75, and somewhat higher at z=1. we compared these observations with amodel in which new red sequence galaxies are being constantly added at the raterequired to match the observed number density evolution, and found that thismodel predicts the correct cmr scatter and its evolution. furthermore, thismodel predicts approximately the correct number density of `blue spheroids' -structurally early-type galaxies with blue colors - albeit with considerablemodel dependence. thus, we conclude that both the evolution of the numberdensity and colors of the early-type galaxy population paint a consistentpicture in which the early-type galaxy population grows significantly betweenz=1 and the present day through the quenching of star formation in blue cloudgalaxies.

0903.3700	history of galaxy interactions and their impact on star formation over  the last 7 gyr from gems	we perform a comprehensive estimate of the frequency of galaxy mergers andtheir impact on star formation over z~0.24--0.80 (lookback time t_b~3--7 gyr)using 3698 (m*&gt;=1e9 msun) galaxies with gems hst, combo-17, and spitzer data.our results are: (1) among 790 high mass (m*&gt;=2.5e10 msun) galaxies, thevisually-based merger fraction over z~0.24--0.80, ranges from 9%+-5% to 8%+-2%.lower limits on the major and minor merger fractions over this interval rangefrom 1.1% to 3.5%, and 3.6% to 7.5%, respectively. this is the firstapproximate empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers at z&lt;1. for avisibility timescale of ~0.5 gyr, it follows that over t_b~3--7 gyr, ~68% ofhigh mass systems have undergone a merger of mass ratio &gt;1/10, with ~16%, 45%,and 7% of these corresponding respectively to major, minor, and ambiguous`major or minor' mergers. the mean merger rate is a few x 1e-4 gyr-1 mpc-3. (2)we compare the empirical merger fraction and rate for high mass galaxies to asuite of lambda cdm-based models: halo occupation distribution models,semi-analytic models, and hydrodynamic sph simulations. we find qualitativeagreement between observations and models such that the (major+minor) mergerfraction or rate from different models bracket the observations, and show afactor of five dispersion. near-future improvements can now start to rule outcertain merger scenarios. (3) among ~3698 m*&gt;=1e9 msun galaxies, we find thatthe mean sfr of visibly merging systems is only modestly enhanced compared tonon-interacting galaxies over z~0.24--0.80. visibly merging systems onlyaccount for less than 30% of the cosmic sfr density over t_b~3--7 gyr. thissuggests that the behavior of the cosmic sfr density over the last 7 gyr ispredominantly shaped by non-interacting galaxies.

0907.3728	less than 10 percent of star formation in z=0.6 massive galaxies is  triggered by major interactions	both observations and simulations show that major tidal interactions ormergers between gas-rich galaxies can lead to intense bursts of starformation.yet, the average enhancement in star formation rate (sfr) in major mergers andthe contribution of such events to the cosmic sfr are not well estimated. herewe use photometric redshifts, stellar masses and uv sfrs from combo-17, 24micron sfrs from spitzer and morphologies from two deep hst cosmological surveyfields (ecdfs/gems and a901/stages) to study the enhancement in sfr as afunction of projected galaxy separation. we apply two-point projectedcorrelation function techniques, which we augment with morphologically-selectedvery close pairs (separation &lt;2 arcsec) and merger remnants from the hstimaging. our analysis confirms that the most intensely star-forming systems areindeed interacting or merging. yet, for massive (m* &gt; 10^10 msun) star-forminggalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8, we find that the sfrs of galaxies undergoing a majorinteraction (mass ratios &lt;1:4 and separations &lt; 40 kpc) are only 1.80 +/- 0.30times higher than the sfrs of non-interacting galaxies when averaged over allinteractions and all stages of the interaction, in good agreement with otherobservational works.  we demonstrate that these results imply that &lt;10% of star formation at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 0.8 is triggered directly by major mergers and interactions; these eventsare not important factors in the build-up of stellar mass since z=1.

0910.5665	the environmental dependence of the stellar mass-size relation in stages  galaxies	we present the stellar mass-size relations for elliptical, lenticular, andspiral galaxies in the field and cluster environments using hst/acs imaging anddata from the space telescope a901/2 galaxy evolution survey (stages). we use alarge sample of ~1200 field and cluster galaxies, and a sub-sample of clustercore galaxies, and quantify the significance of any putative environmentaldependence on the stellar mass-size relation. for elliptical, lenticular, andhigh-mass (log m*/m_sun &gt; 10) spiral galaxies we find no evidence to suggestany such environmental dependence, implying that internal drivers are governingtheir size evolution. for intermediate/low-mass spirals (log m*/m_sun &lt; 10) wefind evidence, significant at the 2-sigma level, for a possible environmentaldependence on galaxy sizes: the mean effective radius a_e for lower-massspirals is ~15-20 per cent larger in the field than in the cluster. this is dueto a population of low-mass large-a_e field spirals that are largely absentfrom the cluster environments. these large-a_e field spirals contain extendedstellar discs not present in their cluster counterparts. this suggests thefragile extended stellar discs of these spiral galaxies may not survive theenvironmental conditions in the cluster. our results suggest that internalphysical processes are the main drivers governing the size evolution ofgalaxies, with the environment possibly playing a role affecting only the discsof intermediate/low-mass spirals.

1002.4193	the merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies	we explore the rate and impact of galaxy mergers on the massive galaxypopulation using the amplitude of the two-point correlation function on smallscales for m &gt; 5e10 m_sun galaxies from the cosmos and combo-17 surveys. usinga pair fraction derived from the sloan digital sky survey as a low-redshiftbenchmark, the large survey area at intermediate redshifts allows us todetermine the evolution of the close pair fraction with unprecedented accuracyfor a mass-selected sample: we find that the fraction of galaxies more massivethan 5e10m_sun in pairs separated by less than 30 kpc in 3d space evolves asf(z) = (0.0130+/-0.0019)x(1+z)^1.21+/-0.25 between z = 0 and z = 1.2. assuminga merger time scale of 0.5 gyrs, the inferred merger rate is such that galaxieswith mass in excess of 1e11 m_sun have undergone, on average, 0.5 (0.7) mergersinvolving progenitor galaxies both more massive than 5e10 m_sun since z = 0.6(1.2). we also study the number density evolution of massive red sequencegalaxies using published luminosity functions and constraints on the m/levolution from the fundamental plane. moreover, we demonstrate that themeasured merger rate of massive galaxies is sufficient to explain this observednumber density evolution in massive red sequence galaxies since z = 1.

1101.2423	the majority of compact massive galaxies at z~2 are disk dominated	we investigate the stellar structure of massive, quiescent galaxies at z~2,based on hubble space telescope/wfc3 imaging from the early release scienceprogram. our sample of 14 galaxies has stellar masses of m* &gt; 10^{10.8} msoland photometric redshifts of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. in agreement with previous work,their half-light radii are &lt;2 kpc, much smaller than equally massive galaxiesin the present-day universe. a significant subset of the sample appears highlyflattened in projection, which implies, considering viewing angle statistics,that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our sample have pronounceddisks. this is corroborated by two-dimensional surface brightness profile fits.we estimate that 65% +/- 15% of the population of massive, quiescent z~2galaxies are disk-dominated. the median disk scale length is 1.5 kpc,substantially smaller than the disks of equally massive galaxies in thepresent-day universe. our results provide strong observational evidence thatthe much-discussed ultra-dense high-redshift galaxies should generally bethought of as disk-like stellar systems with the majority of stars formed fromgas that had time to settle into a disk.

0704.2601	gems: galaxy fitting catalogues and testing parametric galaxy fitting  codes	in the context of measuring structure and morphology of intermediate redshiftgalaxies with recent hst/acs surveys, we tune, test, and compare two widelyused fitting codes (galfit and gim2d) for fitting single-component sersicmodels to the light profiles of both simulated and real galaxy data. we findthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. exponentialdisks are well fit with sersic models and have small measurement errors,whereas fits to de vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to thelarge amount of light at large radii. we find that both codes provide reliablefits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness isabove that of the sky. moreover, both codes return errors that significantlyunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated withsimulations. we find that gim2d suffers significant systematic errors forspheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively maskingout neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to thisimportant systematic in gim2d's current implementation. while this crowdingerror affects only a small fraction of galaxies in gems, it must be accountedfor in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fieldswith gim2d. in contrast, galfit results are robust to the presence of neighborsbecause it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions therebydeblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. we find galfit'srobustness to nearby companions and factor of &gt;~20 faster runtime speed areimportant advantages over gim2d for analyzing large hst/acs datasets. finallywe include our final catalog of fit results for all 41,495 objects detected ingems.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

0710.2157	ongoing assembly of massive galaxies by major merging in large groups  and clusters from the sdss	we investigate the incidence of major mergers creating &gt;10e11 msun galaxiesin present-day groups and clusters more massive than 2.5e13 msun. we identify38 pairs of massive galaxies with mutual tidal interaction signatures selectedfrom &gt;5000 galaxies with &gt;5e10 msun that reside in 845 such groups. we fit theimages of each galaxy pair as the line-of-sight projection of symmetric modelsand identify mergers by the presence of residual asymmetries around eachprogenitor, such as off-center isophotes, broad tidal tails, and dynamicalfriction wakes. at the resolution and sensitivity of the sdss, such mergers arefound in 16% of high-mass, galaxy-galaxy pairs with magnitude differences of&lt;1.5 and &lt;30 kpc projected separations. we find that 90% of these mergers havenearly equal-mass progenitors with red-sequence colors andcentrally-concentrated morphologies, the hallmarks of dissipationless mergersimulations. mergers at group centers are more common than between 2satellites, but both are morphologically indistinguishable and we tentativelyconclude that the latter are likely located at the dynamical centers ofrecently accreted subhalos. the frequency of central and satellite mergingdiminishes with group mass consistent with dynamical friction expectations.based on reasonable assumptions, the centers of these massive halos are growingin stellar mass by 1-9% per gyr, on average. compared to all lrg-lrg mergers,we find a 2-9 times higher rate for their merging when restricted to thesedense environments. our results imply that the massive end of the galaxypopulation continues to evolve hierarchically at a measurable level, and thatthe centers of massive groups are the preferred environment for merger-drivengalaxy assembly.

1109.6828	a new automatic method to identify galaxy mergers i. description and  application to the stages survey	we present an automatic method to identify galaxy mergers using themorphological information contained in the residual images of galaxies afterthe subtraction of a sersic model. the removal of the bulk signal from the hostgalaxy light is done with the aim of detecting the fainter minor mergers. thespecific morphological parameters that are used in the merger diagnosticsuggested here are the residual flux fraction and the asymmetry of theresiduals. the new diagnostic has been calibrated and optimized so that theresulting merger sample is very complete. however, the contamination bynon-mergers is also high. if the same optimization method is adopted forcombinations of other structural parameters such as the cas system, the mergerindicator we introduce yields merger samples of equal or higher statisticalquality than the samples obtained through the use of other structuralparameters. we explore the ability of the method presented here to select minormergers by identifying a sample of visually classified mergers that would nothave been picked up by the use of the cas system, when using its usual limits.given the low prevalence of mergers among the general population of galaxiesand the optimization used here, we find that the merger diagnostic introducedin this work is best used as a negative merger test, i.e., it is very effectiveat selecting non-merging galaxies. as with all the currently availableautomatic methods, the sample of merger candidates selected is contaminated bynon-mergers, and further steps are needed to produce a clean sample. thismerger diagnostic has been developed using the hst/acs f606w images of thea901/02 cluster (z=0.165) obtained by the stages team. in particular, we havefocused on a mass and magnitude limited sample (log m/m_{o}&gt;9.0,r_{vega}&lt;23.5mag)) which includes 905 cluster galaxies and 655 field galaxiesof all morphological types.

0710.3164	the importance of satellite quenching for the build-up of the red  sequence of present day galaxies	in the current paradigm, red sequence galaxies are believed to have formed asblue disk galaxies that subsequently had their star formation quenched. sincered-sequence galaxies typically have an early-type morphology, the transitionfrom the blue to the red sequence also involves a morphological transformation.in this paper we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operateonly on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from thesdss, we compare the colors and concentrations of satellites galaxies to thoseof central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that thelatter are the progenitors of the former. on average, satellites are redder andmore concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass.central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and color,however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that thetransformation mechanisms affect color more than morphology. the color andconcentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completelyindependent of the halo mass of the satellite galaxy, indicating thatsatellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in haloes ofall masses. this strongly favors strangulation as the main quenching mechanismfor satellite galaxies. finally, we determine the relative importance ofsatellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. we find that roughly70 percent of red sequence satellite galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^9 msunhad their star formation quenched as satellites. this drops rapidly to zerowith increasing stellar mass, indicating that a significant fraction of redsatellites were already quenched before they became a satellite.

1401.2455	candels visual classifications: scheme, data release, and first results	we have undertaken an ambitious program to visually classify all galaxies inthe five candels fields down to h&lt;24.5 involving the dedicated efforts of 65individual classifiers. once completed, we expect to have detailedmorphological classifications for over 50,000 galaxies up to z&lt;4 over all thefields. here, we present our detailed visual classification scheme, which wasdesigned to cover a wide range of candels science goals. this scheme includesthe basic hubble sequence types, but also includes a detailed look at mergersand interactions, the clumpiness of galaxies, $k$-corrections, and a variety ofother structural properties. in this paper, we focus on the first field to becompleted -- goods-s. the wide area coverage spanning the full field includes7634 galaxies that have been classified by at least three different people. inthe deep area of the field, 2534 galaxies have been classified by at least fivedifferent people at three different depths. with this paper, we release to thepublic all of the visual classifications in goods-s along with the gui that wedeveloped to classify galaxies. we find that the level of agreement amongclassifiers is good and depends on both the galaxy magnitude and the galaxytype, with disks showing the highest level of agreement and irregulars thelowest. a comparison of our classifications with the sersic index andrest-frame colors shows a clear separation between disk and spheroidpopulations. finally, we explore morphological k-corrections between the v-bandand h-band observations and find that a small fraction (84 galaxies in total)are classified as being very different between these two bands. these galaxiestypically have very clumpy and extended morphology or are very faint in thev-band.

1409.1214	galaxy zoo: candels barred disks and bar fractions	the formation of bars in disk galaxies is a tracer of the dynamical maturityof the population. previous studies have found that the incidence of bars indisks decreases from the local universe to z ~ 1, and by z &gt; 1 simulationspredict that bar features in dynamically mature disks should be extremely rare.here we report the discovery of strong barred structures in massive diskgalaxies at z ~ 1.5 in deep rest-frame optical images from candels. from withina sample of 876 disk galaxies identified by visual classification in galaxyzoo, we identify 123 barred galaxies. selecting a sub-sample within the sameregion of the evolving galaxy luminosity function (brighter than l*), we findthat the bar fraction across the redshift range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 2 (f_bar = 10.7 +6.3-3.5% after correcting for incompleteness) does not significantly evolve. wediscuss the implications of this discovery in the context of existingsimulations and our current understanding of the way disk galaxies have evolvedover the last 11 billion years.

1501.06840	quenching and morphological transformation in semi-analytic models and  candels	we examine the spheroid growth and star formation quenching experienced bygalaxies from z~3 to the present by studying the evolution with redshift of thequiescent and spheroid-dominated fractions of galaxies from the candels andgama surveys. we compare the observed fractions with predictions from asemi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and agnfeedback due to mergers and disk instabilities. we facilitate directmorphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar massratios to sersic indices. we then subdivide our population into the fourquadrants of the ssfr-sersic index plane and study the buildup of each of thesesubpopulations. we find that the fraction of star forming disks declinessteadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time.the fractions of star forming spheroids and quiescent disks are bothnon-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied, atabout 10% and 15-20% respectively. our model is qualitatively successful atreproducing the evolution of the two "main" populations (star formingdisk-dominated galaxies and quiescent spheroid-dominated galaxies), andapproximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predictsa stronger decline in star forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent disks,than seen in the observations. a model with an additional channel for bulgegrowth via disk instabilities agrees better overall with the observations thana model in which bulges may grow only through mergers. we study evolutionarytracks of some individual galaxies as they experience morphologicaltransformation and quenching, and examine the importance of different physicaldrivers of this transformation (major and minor mergers and diskinstabilities). we find that complex histories with multiple transformativeevents are the norm.

0805.0002	satellite ecology: the dearth of environment dependence	using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) galaxy group catalogue of yang etal. (2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellitegalaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and(iii) their group-centric radius. we find that the colours and concentrationsof satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass.in particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations ofsatellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius.we find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes ofall masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centricradii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. in addition, the weakcolour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass issimply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, moremassive satellites. combining these results with the fact that satellitegalaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than centralgalaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxiesbecome redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo(i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). this is a clear manifestation ofenvironment dependence. however, there is no indication that the magnitude ofthe transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxyundergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matterwhether it becomes a satellite of a small (milky way sized) halo, or of amassive cluster. we discuss the implication of this `dearth' of environmentdependence for the physical processes responsible for transforming satellitegalaxies.

1509.03629	are compton-thick agn the missing link between mergers and black hole  growth?	we examine the host morphologies of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei(agn) at $z\sim1$ to test whether obscured supermassive black hole growth atthis epoch is preferentially linked to galaxy mergers. our sample consists of154 obscured agn with $n_{\rm h}&gt;10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $z&lt;1.5$. using visualclassifications, we compare the morphologies of these agn to control samples ofmoderately obscured ($10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $&lt;n_{\rm h}&lt; 10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) andunobscured ($n_{\rm h}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) agn. these control agn are matchedin redshift and intrinsic x-ray luminosity to our heavily obscured agn. we findthat heavily obscured agn at z~1 are twice as likely to be hosted by late-typegalaxies relative to unobscured agn ($65.3^{+4.1}_{-4.6}\%$ vs$34.5^{+2.9}_{-2.7}\%$) and three times as likely to exhibit merger orinteraction signatures ($21.5^{+4.2}_{-3.3}\%$ vs $7.8^{+1.9}_{-1.3}\%$). theincreased merger fraction is significant at the 3.8$\sigma$ level. we also findthat the incidence of point-like morphologies is inversely proportional toobscuration. if we exclude all point sources and consider only extended hosts,we find the correlation between merger fraction and obscuration is stillevident, however at a reduced statistical significance ($2.5\sigma$). the factthat we observe a different disk/spheroid fraction versus obscuration indicatesthat viewing angle cannot be the only thing differentiating our three agnsamples, as a simple unification model would suggest. the increased fraction ofdisturbed morphologies with obscuration supports an evolutionary scenario, inwhich compton-thick agn are a distinct phase of obscured smbh growth followinga merger/interaction event. our findings also suggest that some of themerger-triggered smbh growth predicted by recent agn fueling models may behidden among the heavily obscured, compton-thick population.

astro-ph;0004047	evidence for a black hole and accretion disk in the liner ngc 4203	we present spectroscopic observations from the hubble space telescope thatreveal for the first time the presence of a broad pedestal of balmer-lineemission in the liner galaxy ngc 4203. the emission-line profile is suggestiveof a relativistic accretion disk, and is reminiscent of double-peaked transientbalmer emission observed in a handful of other liners. the very broad lineemission thus constitutes clear qualitative evidence for a black hole, andspatially resolved narrow-line emission in ngc 4203 can be used to constrainits mass, with m_bh less than 6 x 10^6 solar masses at 99.7% confidence. thisvalue implies a ratio of black-hole mass to bulge mass of less thanapproximately 7 x 10^-4 in ngc 4203, which is less by a factor of ~3 - 9 thanthe mean ratio obtained for other galaxies. the availability of an independentconstraint on central black-hole mass makes ngc4203 an important testbed forprobing the physics of weak active galactic nuclei. assuming m_bh near thedetection limit, the ratio of observed luminosity to the eddington luminosityis approximately 10^-4. this value is consistent with advection-dominatedaccretion, and hence with scenarios in which an ion torus irradiates an outeraccretion disk that produces the observed double-peaked line emission.follow-up observations will make it possible to improve the black-hole massestimate and study variability in the nuclear emission.

astro-ph;0004401	double-peaked broad emission lines in ngc 4450 and other liners	spectra taken with hst reveal that ngc 4450 emits balmer emission lines withdisplaced double peaks and extremely high-velocity wings. this characteristicline profile, previously seen in a few nearby liners and in a small fraction ofbroad-line radio galaxies, can be interpreted as a kinematic signature of arelativistic accretion disk. we can reproduce the observed profile with a modelfor a disk with a radial range of 1000-2000 gravitational radii and inclined by27 degrees along the line of sight. the small-aperture hst data also allow usto detect, for the first time, the featureless continuum at optical wavelengthsin ngc 4450; the nonstellar nucleus is intrinsically very faint, with m_b =-11.2 mag for d = 16.8 mpc. we have examined the multiwavelength properties ofngc 4450 collectively with those of other low-luminosity active nuclei whichpossess double-peaked broad lines and find a number of common features. theseobjects are all classified spectroscopically as "type 1" liners or closelyrelated objects. the nuclear luminosities are low, both in absolute terms andrelative to the eddington rates. all of them have compact radio cores, whosestrength relative to the optical nuclear emission places them in the league ofradio-loud active nuclei. the broad-band spectral energy distributions of thesesources are most notable for their deficit of ultraviolet emission compared tothose observed in luminous seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars. the double-peakedbroad-line radio galaxies arp 102b and pictor a have very similar attributes.we discuss how these characteristics can be understood in the context ofadvection-dominated accretion onto massive black holes.

astro-ph;0010240	supermassive black holes in bulges	we present spatially extended gas kinematics at parsec-scale resolution forthe nuclear regions of four nearby disk galaxies, and model them as rotation ofa gas disk in the joint potential of the stellar bulge and a putative centralblack hole. the targets were selected from a larger set of long-slit spectraobtained with the hubble space telescope as part of the survey of nearby nucleiwith stis (sunns). they represents the 4 galaxies (of 24) that displaysymmetric gas velocity curves consistent with a rotating disk. we derive thestellar mass distribution from the stis acquisition images adopting the stellarmass-to-light ratio normalized so as to match ground-based velocity dispersionmeasurements over a large aperture. subsequently, we constrain the mass of aputative black hole by matching the gas rotation curve, following two distinctapproaches. in the most general case we explore all the possible diskorientations, alternatively we constrain the gas disk orientation from thedust-lane morphology at similar radii. in the latter case the kinematic dataindicate the presence of a central black hole for three of the four objects,with masses of 10^7 - 10^8 solar masses, representing up to 0.025 % of the hostbulge mass. for one object (ngc2787) the kinematic data alone provide clearevidence for the presence of a central black hole even without externalconstraints on the disk orientation. these results illustrate directly the needto determine black-hole masses by differing methods for a large number ofobjects, demonstrate that the variance in black hole/bulge mass is much largerthan previously claimed, and reinforce the recent finding that the black-holemass is tightly correlated with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;0301616	a first estimate of the baryonic mass function of galaxies	we estimate the baryonic (stellar+cold gas) mass function of galaxies in thelocal universe by assigning a complete sample of two micron all sky survey andsloan digital sky survey galaxies a gas fraction based on a statistical sampleof the entire population, under the assumption of a universally-applicablestellar initial mass function. the baryonic mass function is similar to thestellar mass function at the high mass end, and has a reasonably steepfaint-end slope owing to the typically high cold gas fractions and low stellarmass-to-light ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. the schechterfunction fit parameters are phi* = 0.0108(6) per cubic mpc per dex of mass, m*= 5.3(3)x10^10 solar masses, and alpha = -1.21(5), with formal error estimatesgiven in parentheses (for a hubble constant of 100 km/s per mpc). we show thatthe neutral and molecular hydrogen mass functions derived using this indirectroute are in agreement with direct estimates, validating our indirect method.integrating under the baryonic mass function and incorporating all sources ofuncertainty, we find that the baryonic (stellar+cold gas) mass density impliedby this estimate is omega_cold baryon = 0.0024+0.0007-0.0014, or 8% +4% -5% ofthe big bang nucleosynthesis expectation.

astro-ph;0302543	the optical and near-infrared properties of galaxies: i. luminosity and  stellar mass functions	we use a large sample of galaxies from the two micron all sky survey (2mass)and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to calculate galaxy luminosity andstellar mass functions in the local universe. we estimate k-corrections,evolution corrections, and stellar mass-to-light ratios (m/ls) by fitting thegalaxy colors with simple models. our optical and near-infrared luminosityfunctions agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrareddeterminations within the uncertainties. we argue that 2mass is biased againstlow surface brightness galaxies, and use sdss plus our knowledge of stellarpopulations to estimate that the true k-band luminosity function has a steeperfaint end slope than the direct estimate. assuming a universally-applicablestellar initial mass function (imf), we derive the stellar mass function ofgalaxies. the faint end slope slope for the stellar mass function is steeperthan -1.1, reflecting the low stellar m/ls characteristic of low-mass galaxies.we estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universeomega* h = 0.0020+/-0.0006 by assuming an imf as rich in low-mass stars asallowed by observations of galaxy dynamics. finally, we find that thecharacteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than forlater types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than forearlier types. accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at leasthalf, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is inearly-type galaxies. we present also sdss/2mass color-m/l correlations, anupdated discussion of near-infrared stellar m/l estimates, and thevolume-corrected distribution of g and k-band stellar m/ls as a function ofstellar mass.

astro-ph;0304005	the galaxy angular correlation functions and power spectrum from the two  micron all sky survey	we calculate the angular correlation function of galaxies in the two micronall sky survey. we minimize the possible contamination by stars, dust, seeingand sky brightness by studying their cross correlation with galaxy density, andlimiting the galaxy sample accordingly. we measure the correlation function atscales between 1-18 arcdegs using a half million galaxies. we find a best fitpower law to the correlation function has a slope of 0.76 and an amplitude of0.11. however, there are statistically significant oscillations around thispower law. the largest oscillation occurs at about 0.8 degrees, correspondingto 2.8 h^{-1} mpc at the median redshift of our survey, as expected in halooccupation distribution descriptions of galaxy clustering.  we invert the angular correlation function using singular value decompositionto measure the three-dimensional power spectrum and find that it too is in goodagreement with previous measurements. a dip seen in the power spectrum at smallwavenumber k is statistically consistent with cdm-type power spectra. a fit ofcdm-type power spectra to k &lt; 0.2 h mpc^{-1} give constraints of\gamma_{eff}=0.116 and \sigma_8=0.96. this suggest a k_s-band linear bias of1.1+/-0.2. this \gamma_{eff} is different from the wmap cmb derived value. onsmall scales the power-law shape of our power spectrum is shallower than thatderived for the sdss. these facts together imply a biasing of these differentgalaxies that might be nonlinear, that might be either waveband or luminositydependent, and that might have a nonlocal origin.

astro-ph;0310440	scaling relations of local spiral galaxies.i. observational foundations	(abridged) this paper presents an exploration of two fundamental scalingrelations of spiral galaxies, the luminosity-rotation speed (or tully-fisher;tf) relation, and the size-luminosity (sl) relation, and the dependences oftheir scatter, at red and ir bands. we verify that the observed virialrelations of disk galaxies are given by vobs \prop l^0.31 and rd \prop l^0.33using distance-redshift surveys of high surface brightness (hsb) and lowsurface brightness (lsb) non-interacting galaxies. thus the galaxy surfacebrightness (sb) is sigma \prop rd \prop vobs \prop mvir^0.33. we derive thefirst extensive j-band tf and sl relations using 2mass data products. the tfresiduals are fully independent of sb and other tested observables. tfrelations (tfrs) for various morphological types have different zero points,but a common slope, such that early-type (redder) disks rotate faster thanlater-types (bluer) of the same luminosity. this dependence of the tfr is adirect consequence of the more fundamental dependence on color, which itself isrelated to the galaxy star formation history. the sl relation scatter is mostlydominated by sb, but color also plays a small role. the tf and sl residuals forhsb and lsb galaxies are weakly correlated, in agreement with the earlier claimby courteau &amp; rix (1999). this suggests that spiral disks of all color,brightness, and barredness are, on average, dominated by dark matter even intheir inner parts. the observed scaling relations of disk galaxies are likelythe result of the simplest scenario of galaxy formation, but their colordependence remains a challenge to hierarchical structure formation models. thescaling relations and their derivatives are contrasted against galaxy formationmodels in our companion paper.

astro-ph;0405030	the u-band galaxy luminosity function of nearby clusters	despite the great potential of the u-band galaxy luminosity function (glf) toconstrain the history of star formation in clusters, to clarify the question ofvariations of the glf across filter bands, to provide a baseline forcomparisons to high-redshift studies of the cluster glf, and to estimate thecontribution of bound systems of galaxies to the extragalactic near-uvbackground, determinations have so far been hampered by the generally lowefficiency of detectors in the u-band and by the difficulty of constructingboth deep and wide surveys. in this paper, we present u-band glfs of threenearby, rich clusters to a limit of m_u=-17.5 (m*_u+2). our analysis is basedon a combination of separate spectroscopic and r-band and u-band photometricsurveys. for this purpose, we have developed a new maximum-likelihood algorithmfor calculating the luminosity function that is particularly useful forreconstructing the galaxy distribution function in multi-dimensional spaces(e.g., the number of galaxies as a simultaneous function of luminosity indifferent filter bands, surface brightness, star formation rate, morphology,etc.), because it requires no prior assumptions as to the shape of thedistribution function.  the composite luminosity function can be described by a schechter functionwith characteristic magnitude m*_u=-19.82+/-0.27 and faint end slopealpha_u=-1.09+/-0.18. the total u-band glf is slightly steeper than the r-bandglf, indicating that cluster galaxies are bluer at fainter magnitudes.quiescent galaxies dominate the cumulative u-band flux for m_u&lt;-14. thecontribution of galaxies in nearby clusters to the u-band extragalacticbackground is &lt;1% gyr^-1 for clusters of masses ~3*10^14 to 2*10^15 m_solar.

astro-ph;0410321	the survey of nearby nuclei with stis (sunns):emission-line nuclei at  hubble space telescope resolution	we present results from a program of optical spectroscopy for 23 nearbygalaxy emission-line nuclei. this investigation takes advantage of the spatialresolution of the hubble space telescope to study the structure and energeticsof the central 10 - 20 pc, and the resulting data have value for quantifyingcentral black hole masses, star formation histories, and nebular properties.this paper provides a description of the experimental design, and new findingsfrom the study of emission lines. the sample targets span a range of nebularspectroscopic class, from hii to seyfert nuclei. the line ratios indicative ofnebular ionization show only modest variations over order-of-magnitudedifferences in radius, and demonstrate in a systematic way that geometricaldilution of the radiation field from a central source cannot be assumed as aprimary driver of ionization structure. comparisons between large- andsmall-aperture measurements for the hii/liner transition objects provide a newtest that challenges conventional wisdom concerning the composite nature ofthese systems. we also list a number of other quantitative results that are ofinterest for understanding galaxy nuclei, including (1) the spatialdistribution/degree of concentration of h-alpha emission as a function ofnebular type; (2) the radial variation in electron density as a function ofnebular type; and (3) quantitative broad h-alpha estimates obtained at a secondepoch for these low-luminosity nuclei. the resulting measurements provide a newbasis for comparing the nuclei of other galaxies with that of the milky way. wefind that the galactic center is representative across a wide span ofproperties as a low-luminosity emission-line nucleus.

astro-ph;0411324	cosmological weak lensing with the hst gems survey	we present our cosmic shear analysis of gems, one of the largest wide-fieldsurveys ever undertaken by the hubble space telescope. imaged with the advancedcamera for surveys (acs), gems spans 795 square arcmin in the chandra deepfield south. we detect weak lensing by large-scale structure in high resolutionf606w gems data from ~60 resolved galaxies per square arcminute. we measure thetwo-point shear correlation function, the top-hat shear variance and the shearpower spectrum, performing an e/b mode decomposition for each statistic. weshow that we are not limited by systematic errors and use our results to placejoint constraints on the matter density parameter omega_m and the amplitude ofthe matter power spectrum sigma_8. we find sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^{0.65}=0.68 +/-0.13 where the 1sigma error includes both our uncertainty on the medianredshift of the survey and sampling variance.  removing image and point spread function (psf) distortions are crucial to allweak lensing analyses. we therefore include a thorough discussion on the degreeof acs psf distortion and anisotropy which we characterise directly from gemsdata. consecutively imaged over 20 days, gems data also allows us toinvestigate psf instability over time. we find that, even in the relativelyshort gems observing period, the acs psf ellipticity varies at the level of afew percent which we account for with a semi-time dependent psf model. ourcorrection for the temporal and spatial variability of the psf is shown to besuccessful through a series of diagnostic tests.

astro-ph;0411772	the evolution of early-type red galaxies with the gems survey:  luminosity-size and stellar mass-size relations since z=1	we combine hst/acs imaging from the gems survey with redshifts and rest-framequantities from combo-17 to study the evolution of morphologically early-typegalaxies with red colors since z=1. we use a new large sample of 728 galaxieswith centrally-concentrated radial profiles (sersic n&gt;2.5) and rest-frame u-vcolors on the red sequence. by appropriate comparison with the local relationsfrom sdss, we find that the luminosity-size (l-r) and stellar mass-size (m-r)relations evolve in a manner that is consistent with the passive aging ofancient stars. by itself, this result is consistent with a completely passiveevolution of the red early-type galaxy population. if instead, as demonstratedby a number of recent surveys, the early-type galaxy population builds up inmass by a factor of 2 since z=1, our results imply that new additions to theearly-type galaxy population follow similar l-r and m-r correlations, comparedto the older subset of early-type galaxies. adding early-type galaxies to thered sequence through disk fading appears to be consistent with the data.through comparison with models, the role of dissipationless merging is limitedto &lt;1 major merger on average since z=1 for the most massive galaxies.predictions from models of gas-rich mergers are not yet mature enough to allowa detailed comparison to our observations. we find tentative evidence that theamount of luminosity evolution depends on galaxy stellar mass, such that theleast massive galaxies show stronger luminosity evolution compared to moremassive early types. this could reflect a different origin of low-massearly-type galaxies and/or younger stellar populations; the present data isinsufficient to discriminate between these possibilities.

astro-ph;0502246	towards an understanding of the rapid decline of the cosmic star  formation rate	we present a first analysis of deep 24 micron observations with the spitzerspace telescope of a sample of nearly 1500 galaxies in a thin redshift slice,0.65&lt;z&lt;0.75. we combine the infrared data with redshifts, rest-frameluminosities, and colors from combo-17, and with morphologies from hubble spacetelescope images collected by the gems and goods projects. to characterize thedecline in star-formation rate (sfr) since z~0.7, we estimate the total thermalinfrared (ir) luminosities, sfrs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in thissample. at z~0.7, nearly 40% of intermediate and high-mass galaxies (withstellar masses &gt;2x10^10 solar masses) are undergoing a period of intense starformation above their past-averaged sfr. in contrast, less than 1% ofequally-massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense starformation activity. morphologically-undisturbed galaxies dominate the totalinfrared luminosity density and sfr density: at z~0.7, more than half of theintensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than\~30% are strongly interacting. thus, a decline in major-merger rate is not theunderlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic sfr since z~0.7. physicalproperties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology - for example, gasconsumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies - appear to beresponsible.

astro-ph;0502416	gems: the size evolution of disk galaxies	we combine hst imaging from the gems survey with photometric redshifts fromcombo-17 to explore the evolution of disk-dominated galaxies since z&lt;1.1. thesample is comprised of all gems galaxies with sersic indices n&lt;2.5, derivedfrom fits to the galaxy images. we account fully for selection effects throughcareful analysis of image simulations; we are limited by the depth of theredshift and hst data to the study of galaxies with absolute magnitudesm(v)&lt;-20, or equivalently stellar masses log(m)&gt;10. we find strong evolution inthe magnitude-size scaling relation for galaxies with m(v)&lt;-20, correspondingto a brightening of 1 mag per sqarcsec in rest-frame v-band by z=1. yet, disksat a given absolute magnitude are bluer and have lower stellar mass-to-lightratios at z=1 than at the present day. as a result, our findings indicate weakor no evolution in the relation between stellar mass and effective disk sizefor galaxies with log(m)&gt;10 over the same time interval. this is stronglyinconsistent with the most naive theoretical expectation, in which disk sizescales in proportion to the halo virial radius, which would predict that disksare a factor of two denser at fixed mass at z=1. the lack of evolution in thestellar mass-size relation is consistent with an ``inside-out'' growth ofgalaxy disks on average (galaxies increasing in size as they grow moremassive), although we cannot rule out more complex evolutionary scenarios.

astro-ph;0504225	the size evolution of galaxies since z~3: combining sdss, gems and fires	we present the evolution of the luminosity-size and stellar mass-sizerelations of luminous (l_v&gt;3.4x10^10h_70^-2l_sun) and of massive(m_*&gt;3x10^10h_70^-2m_sun) galaxies in the last ~11 gyr. we use very deepnear-infrared images of the hubble deep field-south and the ms1054-03 field inthe j_s, h and k_s bands from fires to retrieve the sizes in the opticalrest-frame for galaxies with z&gt;1. we combine our results with those from gemsat 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 and sdss at z~0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the opticalrest-frame size evolution from z=0 to z=3. galaxies are differentiatedaccording to their light concentration using the sersic index n. for lessconcentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3+-0.5(+-2 sigma) times smaller at z~2.5 than those we see today. the stellarmass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was\~2+-0.5 times smaller at z~2.5, evolving proportional to (1+z)^{-0.40+-0.06}.simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in ahierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the errorbars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. the observedluminosity-size evolution out to z~2.5 matches well recent infall modelpredictions for milky-way type objects. for low-n galaxies, the evolution ofthe stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individualgalaxies grow inside-out. for highly concentrated objects, the situation is asfollows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7+-1.1 times smaller atz~2.5 (or put differently, were typically ~2.2+-0.7 mag brighter at a givensize than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolvedproportional to (1+z)^{-0.45+-0.10}.

astro-ph;0506425	dry mergers in gems: the dynamical evolution of massive early-type  galaxies	we have used the 28'x 28' hst image mosaic from the gems (galaxy evolutionfrom morphology and seds) survey in conjunction with the combo-17 photometricredshift survey to constrain the incidence of major mergers betweenspheroid-dominated galaxies with little cold gas (dry mergers) since z = 0.7. aset of n-body merger simulations was used to explore the morphologicalsignatures of such interactions: they are recognizable either as &lt; 5kpcseparation close pairs or because of broad, low surface brightness tidalfeatures and asymmetries. data with the depth and resolution of gems aresensitive to dry mergers between galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5 for z &lt; 0.7; drymergers at higher redshifts are not easily recovered in single-orbit hstimaging. six dry mergers (12 galaxies) with luminosity ratios between 1:1 and4:1 were found from a sample of 379 red early-type galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5and 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. the simulations suggest that the morphological signatures ofdry merging are visible for ~250myr and we use this timescale to convert theobserved merger incidence into a rate. on this basis we find that present dayspheroidal galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5 on average have undergone between 0.5 and2 major dry mergers since z ~ 0.7. we have compared this result with thepredictions of a cold dark matter based semi-analytic galaxy formation model.the model reproduces the observed declining major merger fraction of brightgalaxies and the space density of luminous early-type galaxies reasonably well.the predicted dry merger fraction is consistent with our observational result.hence, hierarchical models predict and observations now show that major drymergers are an important driver of the evolution of massive early-type galaxiesin recent epochs.

astro-ph;0511737	nature and completeness of galaxies detected in the two micron all sky  survey	we cross correlate the well-defined and very complete spectroscopic maingalaxy sample (mgs) of 156,000 bright (r&lt;17.5 mag) galaxies from the sdss with2mass sources to explore the nature and completeness of the 2mass k-bandselection of nearby galaxies. 2mass detects 90% of the mgs brighter than r=17mag. for r&lt;16, 93.1% of the mgs is found in the 2mass extended source catalog(xsc). these detections span the representative range of optical and near-irgalaxy properties, but with a surface brightness-dependent bias topreferentially miss the most blue and low-concentration sources, consistentwith the most morphologically late-type galaxy population. an xsc completenessof 97.5% is achievable at bright magnitudes, with blue lsbs being the onlymajor source of incompleteness, if one follows our careful matching criteriaand weeds out spurious sdss sources. we conclude that the rapid drop in xsccompleteness at r&gt;16 reflects the sharp surface-brightness limit of theextended source detection algorithm in 2mass. as a result, the r&gt;16 galaxiesfound in the xsc are over-representative in red early types andunder-representative in blue latetypes. at r&gt;16 the xsc suffers an additionalselection effect from the 2-3" spatial resolution limit of 2mass. therefore,2mass continues to detect 90% of of the mgs at 16&lt;r&lt;17, but with a growingfraction found in the point source catalog (psc) only. overall, one third ofthe mgs is detected in the 2mass psc but not the xsc. a combined k&lt;13.57 andr&lt;16 selection provides the most representative inventory of galaxies in thelocal cosmos with near-ir and optical measurements, and 90.8% completeness.using data from sdss-dr2, this sample contains 19,156 galaxies with a medianredshift of 0.052.

astro-ph;0512307	studying distant dwarf galaxies with gems and sdss	we study the colors, structural properties, and star formation histories of asample of ~1600 dwarfs over look-back times of ~3 gyr (z=0.002-0.25). thesample consists of 401 distant dwarfs drawn from the galaxy evolution frommorphologies and seds (gems) survey, which provides high resolution hubblespace telescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) images and accurateredshifts, and of 1291 dwarfs at 10-90 mpc compiled from the sloan digitizedsky survey (sdss). we find that the gems dwarfs are bluer than the sdss dwarfs,which is consistent with star formation histories involving starbursts andperiods of continuous star formation. the full range of colors cannot bereproduced by single starbursts or constant star formation alone. we derive thestar formation rates of the gems dwarfs and estimate the mechanicalluminosities needed for a complete removal of their gas. we find that a largefraction of luminous dwarfs are likely to retain their gas, whereas fainterdwarfs are susceptible to a significant gas loss, if they would experience astarburst.

astro-ph;0601561	color, structure, and star formation history of dwarf galaxies over the  last ~3 gyr with gems and sdss	we present a study of the colors, structural properties, and star formationhistories for a sample of ~1600 dwarfs over look-back times of ~3 gyr(z=0.002-0.25). the sample consists of 401 distant dwarfs drawn from the galaxyevolution from morphologies and seds (gems) survey, which provides highresolution hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs)images and accurate redshifts, and of 1291 dwarfs at 10-90 mpc compiled fromthe sloan digitized sky survey (sdss). the sample is complete down to aneffective surface brightness of 22 mag arcsec^-2 in z and includes dwarfs withm_g=-18.5 to -14 mag. rest-frame luminosities in johnson ubv and sdss ugrfilters are provided by the combo-17 survey and structural parameters have beendetermined by s\'ersic fits. we find that the gems dwarfs are bluer than thesdss dwarfs by ~0.13 mag in g-r, which is consistent with the color evolutionover ~2 gyr of star formation histories involving moderate starbursts and longperiods of continuous star formation. the full color range of the samplescannot be reproduced by single starbursts of different masses or long periodsof continuous star formation alone. furthermore, an estimate of the mechanicalluminosities needed for the gas in the gems dwarfs to be completely removedfrom the galaxies shows that a significant number of low luminosity dwarfs aresusceptible to such a complete gas loss, if they would experience a starburst.on the other hand, a large fraction of more luminous dwarfs is likely to retaintheir gas. we also estimate the star formation rates per unit area for the gemsdwarfs and find good agreement with the values for local dwarfs.

astro-ph;0612428	an explanation for the observed weak size evolution of disk galaxies	surveys of distant galaxies with the hubble space telescope and from theground have shown that there is only mild evolution in the relationship betweenradial size and stellar mass for galactic disks from z~1 to the present day.using a sample of nearby disk-dominated galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), and high redshift data from the gems (galaxy evolution frommorphology and seds) survey, we investigate whether this result is consistentwith theoretical expectations within the hierarchical paradigm of structureformation. the relationship between virial radius and mass for dark matterhalos in the lcdm model evolves by about a factor of two over this interval.however, n-body simulations have shown that halos of a given mass have lesscentrally concentrated mass profiles at high redshift. when we compute theexpected disk size-stellar mass distribution, accounting for this evolution inthe internal structure of dark matter halos and the adiabatic contraction ofthe dark matter by the self-gravity of the collapsing baryons, we find that thepredicted evolution in the mean size at fixed stellar mass since z~1 is about15-20 percent, in good agreement with the observational constraints from gems.at redshift z~2, the model predicts that disks at fixed stellar mass were onaverage only 60% as large as they are today. similarly, we predict that therotation velocity at a given stellar mass (essentially the zero-point of thetully-fisher relation) is only about 10 percent larger at z~1 (20 percent atz~2) than at the present day.

0809.2283	environmental effects on satellite galaxies: the link between  concentration, size and colour profile	using the sdss dr4 group catalogue of yang et al. (2007), we investigatesizes, concentrations, colour gradients and surface brightness profiles ofcentral and satellite galaxies. we compare central and satellite galaxies atfixed stellar mass, in order to disentangle environmental from stellar massdependencies. early and late type galaxies are defined according toconcentration. we find that at fixed stellar mass, late type satellite galaxieshave smaller radii and larger concentrations than late type central galaxies.no such differences are found for early-type galaxies. we have also constructedsurface brightness and colour profiles for the central and satellite galaxiesin our sample. we find that late-type satellite galaxies have a lower surfacebrightness and redder colours than late-type central galaxies. we show that allobserved differences between satellite and central galaxies can be explained bya simple fading model, in which the star formation in the disk decreases overtimescales of 2-3 gyr after a galaxy becomes a satellite. processes that inducestrong morphological changes (e.g. harassment) and processes that strip thegalaxy of its entire ism need not to be invoked in order to explain theenvironmental dependencies we find.

0811.3873	the stages view of red spirals and dusty red galaxies: mass-dependent  quenching of star-formation in cluster infall	we investigate the properties of optically passive spirals and dusty redgalaxies in the a901/2 cluster complex at redshift ~0.17 using restframenear-uv-optical seds, 24 micron ir data and hst morphologies from the stagesdataset. the cluster sample is based on combo-17 redshifts with an rmsprecision of sigma_cz~2000 km/sec. we find that 'dusty red galaxies' and'optically passive spirals' in a901/2 are largely the same phenomenon, and thatthey form stars at a substantial rate, which is only 4x lower than that in bluespirals at fixed mass. this star formation is more obscured than in bluegalaxies and its optical signatures are weak. they appear predominantly in thestellar mass range of log m*/msol=[10,11] where they constitute over half ofthe star-forming galaxies in the cluster; they are thus a vital ingredient forunderstanding the overall picture of star formation quenching in clusters. wefind that the mean specific sfr of star-forming galaxies in the cluster isclearly lower than in the field, in contrast to the specific sfr properties ofblue galaxies alone, which appear similar in cluster and field. such a rich redspiral population is best explained if quenching is a slow process andmorphological transformation is delayed even more. at log m*/msol&lt;10, suchgalaxies are rare, suggesting that their quenching is fast and accompanied bymorphological change. we note, that edge-on spirals play a minor role; despitebeing dust-reddened they form only a small fraction of spirals independent ofenvironment.

0811.3890	stages: the space telescope a901/2 galaxy evolution survey	we present an overview of the space telescope a901/2 galaxy evolution survey(stages). stages is a multiwavelength project designed to probe physicaldrivers of galaxy evolution across a wide range of environments and luminosity.a complex multi-cluster system at z~0.165 has been the subject of an 80-orbitf606w hst/acs mosaic covering the full 0.5x0.5 (~5x5 mpc^2) span of thesupercluster. extensive multiwavelength observations with xmm-newton, galex,spitzer, 2df, gmrt, and the 17-band combo-17 photometric redshift surveycomplement the hst imaging. our survey goals include simultaneously linkinggalaxy morphology with other observables such as age, star-formation rate,nuclear activity, and stellar mass. in addition, with the multiwavelengthdataset and new high resolution mass maps from gravitational lensing, we areable to disentangle the large-scale structure of the system. by examining allaspects of environment we will be able to evaluate the relative importance ofthe dark matter halos, the local galaxy density, and the hot x-ray gas indriving galaxy transformation. this paper describes the hst imaging, datareduction, and creation of a master catalogue. we perform sersic fitting on thehst images and conduct associated simulations to quantify completeness. inaddition, we present the combo-17 photometric redshift catalogue and estimatesof stellar masses and star-formation rates for this field. we define galaxy andcluster sample selection criteria which will be the basis for forthcomingscience analyses, and present a compilation of notable objects in the field.finally, we describe the further multiwavelength observations and announcepublic access to the data and catalogues.

0812.3723	the nature of red dwarf galaxies	using dark matter halos traced by galaxy groups selected from the sloandigital sky survey data release 4, we find that about 1/4 of the faint galaxies($\rmag &gt;-17.05$, hereafter dwarfs) that are the central galaxies in their ownhalo are not blue and star forming, as expected in standard models of galaxyformation, but are red. in contrast, this fraction is about 1/2 for dwarfsatellite galaxies. many red dwarf galaxies are physically associated with moremassive halos. in total, about $\sim 45$% of red dwarf galaxies reside inmassive halos as satellites, while another $\sim 25$% have a spatialdistribution that is much more concentrated towards their nearest massivehaloes than other dwarf galaxies. we use mock catalogs to show that the reddestpopulation of non-satellite dwarf galaxies are distributed within about 3 timesthe virial radii of their nearest massive halos. we suggest that thispopulation of dwarf galaxies are hosted by low-mass halos that have passedthrough their massive neighbors, and that the same environmental effects thatcause satellite galaxies to become red are also responsible for the red colorsof this population of galaxies. we do not find any significant radialdependence of the population of dwarf galaxies with the highest concentrations,suggesting that the mechanisms operating on these galaxies affect color morethan structure. however, over 30% of dwarf galaxies are red and isolated andtheir origin remains unknown.
