0906.5154	probing x-ray irradiation in the nucleus of ngc 1068 with observations  of high-j lines of dense gas tracers	with the incorporation of high-j molecular lines, we aim to constrain thephysical conditions of the dense gas in the central region of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and to determine signatures of the agn or the starburstcontribution.  we used the james clerk maxwell telescope to observe the j=4-3 transition ofhcn, hnc, and hco+, as well as the cn n_j=2_{5/2}-1_{3/2} andn_j=3_{5/2}-2_{5/2}, in ngc 1068.  we estimate the excitation conditions of hcn, hnc, and cn, based on the lineintensity ratios and radiative transfer models.  we find that the bulk emission of hcn, hnc, cn, and the high-j hco+ emergefrom dense gas n(h_2)&gt;=10^5 cm^-3). however, the low-j hco+ lines (dominatingthe hco+ column density) trace less dense (n(h_2)&lt;10^5 cm^-3) and colder(t_k&lt;=20 k) gas, whereas the high-j hco+ emerges from warmer (&gt;30 k) gas thanthe other molecules.  the hco+ j=4-3 line intensity, compared with the lower transition lines andwith the hcn j=4-3 line, support the influence of a local xdr environment. theestimated n(cn)/n(hcn)~1-4 column density ratios are indicative of an xdr/agnenvironment with a possible contribution of grain-surface chemistry induced byx-rays or shocks.

0909.2267	dissecting an intermediate-mass (im) protostar: chemical differentiation  in ic1396n	we have carried out high-angular resolution (1.4") observations in thecontinuum at 3.1mm and in the n2h+ 1-0, ch3cn 5_k-4_k and 13cs 2-1 lines usingthe plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) towards the intermediate mass (im)protostar iras21391+5802 (ic1396n). in addition, we have merged the pdbi imageswith previous bima (continuum data at 1.2mm and 3.1mm) and single-dish (n2h+1-0) data to have a comprehensive description of the region. the combination ofour data with bima and 30m data show that the bipolar outflow associated hascompletely eroded the initial molecular globule. the 1.2mm and 3.1mm continuumemissions are extended along the outflow axis tracing the warm walls of thebiconical cavity. most of the molecular gas, however, is located in anelongated feature in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. a strongchemical differentiation is detected across the molecular toroid, with the n2h+1-0 emission absent in the inner region.this chemical differentiation can beunderstood in terms of the different gas kinetic temperature. the[ch3cn]/[n2h+] ratio increases by 5 orders of magnitude with gas temperature,for temperatures between 20k and 100k. the ch3cn abundance towards iram 2a, themost massive protostellar core, is similar to that found in hot corinos andlower than that expected towards im and high mass hot cores. this couldindicate that iram 2a is a low mass or at most herbig ae star (iram 2a) insteadof the precursor of a massive be star. alternatively, the low ch3cn abundancecould also be the consequence of iram 2a being a class 0/i transition objectwhich has already formed a small photodissociation region (pdr).

0910.3935	mid-infrared pah and h2 emission as a probe of physical conditions in  extreme pdrs	mid-infrared (ir) observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) andmolecular hydrogen emission are a potentially powerful tool to derive physicalproperties of dense environments irradiated by intense uv fields. we presentnew, spatially resolved, \emph{spitzer} mid-ir spectroscopy of the highuv-field and dense photodissocation region (pdr) around monoceros r2, theclosest ultracompact \hii region, revealing the spatial structure of ionizedgas, pahs and h$_2$ emissions. using a pdr model and pah emission featurefitting algorithm, we build a comprehensive picture of the physical conditionsprevailing in the region. we show that the combination of the measurement ofpah ionization fraction and of the ratio between the h$_2$ 0-0 s(3) and s(2)line intensities, respectively at 9.7 and 12.3 $\mu$m, allows to derive thefundamental parameters driving the pdr: temperature, density and uv radiationfield when they fall in the ranges $t = 250-1500 $k, $n_h=10^4-10^6$cm$^{-3}$,$g_0=10^3-10^5$ respectively. these mid-ir spectral tracers thus provide a toolto probe the similar but unresolved uv-illuminated surface of protoplanetarydisks or the nuclei of starburst galaxies.

1004.2822	chemical study of intermediate-mass (im) class 0 protostars. co  depletion and n2h+ deuteration	we are carrying out a physical and chemical study of the protostellarenvelopes in a representative sample of im class 0 protostars. in our firstpaper (crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. here, westudy the co depletion and n2h+ deuteration. we observed the millimeter linesof c18o, c17o, n2h+ and n2d+ toward the protostars using the iram 30mtelescope. based on these observations, we derived the c18o, n2h+ and n2d+radial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfercode. in addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. allthe c18o 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the c18o abundance decreasesinwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the coevaporation temperature, 20-25k, where the co is released back to the gasphase. the n2h+ deuterium fractionation in class 0 ims is[n2d+]/[n2h+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental[d/h] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than inpre-stellar clumps. chemical models account for the c18o and n2h+ observationsif we assume the co abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in theinner envelope. this could be the consequence of the co being converted intoch3oh on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or thephotodissociation of co by the stellar uv radiation. the deuteriumfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. this discrepancy is very likelycaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry andneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and uvradiation from the star. more important, the deuterium fractionation isdependent on the ortho-to-para h2 ratio, which is not likely to reach thesteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.

1005.0947	physical structure of the envelopes of intermediate-mass protostars	context: intermediate mass protostars provide a bridge between low- andhigh-mass protostars. furthermore, they are an important component of the uvinterstellar radiation field. despite their relevance, little is known abouttheir formation process. aims: we present a systematic study of the physicalstructure of five intermediate mass, candidate class 0 protostars. our twogoals are to shed light on the first phase of intermediate mass star formationand to compare these protostars with low- and high-mass sources. methods: wederived the dust and gas temperature and density profiles of the sample. weanalysed all existing continuum data on each source and modelled the resultingsed with the 1d radiative transfer code dusty. the gas temperature was thenpredicted by means of a modified version of the code cht96. results: we foundthat the density profiles of five out of six studied intermediate massenvelopes are consistent with the predictions of the "inside-out" collapsetheory.we compared several physical parameters, like the power law index of thedensity profile, the size, the mass, the average density, the density at 1000au and the density at 10 k of the envelopes of low-, intermediate, andhigh-mass protostars. when considering these various physical parameters, thetransition between the three groups appears smooth, suggesting that theformation processes and triggers do not substantially differ.

1005.1263	molecular gas chemistry in agn. ii. high-resolution imaging of sio  emission in ngc1068: shocks or xdr?	this paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from themolecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (cnd) of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068.single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of siliconmonoxide(sio) in the cnd of ngc1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude withrespect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in thegalaxy. we aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the sio enhancement. wehave imaged with the iram plateau de bure interferometer the emission of thesio(2-1) and cn(2--1) lines in ngc1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,respectively. we have also obtained complementary iram 30m observations of hncoand methanol (ch3oh) lines. sio is detected in a disk of 400pc size around theagn. sio abundances in the cnd of (1-5)xe-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitudeabove those measured in the starburst ring. the overall abundance of cn in thecnd is high: (0.2-1)xe-07. the abundances of sio and cn are enhanced at theextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the agn(r&lt;70pc). abundances measured for cn and sio, and the correlation of cn/co andsio/co ratios with hard x-ray irradiation, suggest that the cnd of ngc1068 hasbecome a giant x-ray dominated region (xdr). the extreme properties ofmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of ngc1068 result from theinterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.whereas xdr chemistry offers a simple explanation for cn and sio in ngc1068,the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. the inclusion of dust grainchemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of othermolecular species, like hcn, which are under-predicted by xdr models.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1007.4370	variations in h2o+/h2o ratios toward massive star-forming regions	early results from the herschel space observatory revealed the water cationh2o+ to be an abundant ingredient of the interstellar medium. here we presentnew observations of the h2o and h2o+ lines at 1113.3 and 1115.2 ghz using theherschel space observatory toward a sample of high-mass star-forming regions toobservationally study the relation between h2o and h2o+ . nine out of tensources show absorption from h2o+ in a range of environments: the molecularclumps surrounding the forming and newly formed massive stars, brighthigh-velocity outflows associated with the massive protostars, and unrelatedlow-density clouds along the line of sight. column densities per velocitycomponent of h2 o+ are found in the range of 10^12 to a few 10^13 cm-2 . thehighest n(h2o+) column densities are found in the outflows of the sources. theratios of h2o+/h2o are determined in a range from 0.01 to a few and are foundto differ strongly between the observed environments with much lower ratios inthe massive (proto)cluster envelopes (0.01-0.1) than in outflows and diffuseclouds. remarkably, even for source components detected in h2o in emission,h2o+ is still seen in absorption.

1007.4691	first detection of nd in the solar-mass protostar iras16293-2422	in the past decade, much progress has been made in characterising theprocesses leading to the enhanced deuterium fractionation observed in the ismand in particular in the cold, dense parts of star forming regions such asprotostellar envelopes. very high molecular d/h ratios have been found forsaturated molecules and ions. however, little is known about the deuteriumfractionation in radicals, even though simple radicals often represent anintermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. theimidogen radical nh is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesisin the gas phase. herschel/hifi represents a unique opportunity to study thedeuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observablefrom the ground. we searched here for the deuterated radical nd in order todetermine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuterationmechanism of this species. we observed the solar-mass class 0 protostariras16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument hifi as part of the herschel keyprogramme chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions). thedeuterated form of the imidogen radical nd was detected and securely identifiedwith 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorptionagainst the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. the 3groups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart nh were alsodetected in absorption. we derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an[nd]/[nh] ratio of between 30 and 100%. the deuterium fractionation of imidogenis of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggeststhat an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. we discuss twopossible formation pathways for nd, by means of either the reaction of n+ withhd, or deuteron/proton exchange with nh.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1008.1254	herschel-hifi spectroscopy of the intermediate mass protostar ngc7129  firs 2	herschel-hifi observations of water from the intermediate mass protostarngc7129 firs 2 provide a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in thisstar formation environment. six spectral settings, covering four h216o and twoh218o lines, were observed and all but one h218o line were detected. the fourh2 16 o lines discussed here share a similar morphology: a narrower, \approx 6km/s, component centered slightly redward of the systemic velocity of ngc7129firs 2 and a much broader, \approx 25 km/s component centered blueward andlikely associated with powerful outflows. the narrower components areconsistent with emission from water arising in the envelope around theintermediate mass protostar, and the abundance of h2o is constrained to \approx10-7 for the outer envelope. additionally, the presence of a narrowself-absorption component for the lowest energy lines is likely due toself-absorption from colder water in the outer envelope. the broader component,where the h2o/co relative abundance is found to be \approx 0.2, appears to betracing the same energetic region that produces strong co emission at high j.

1009.5597	molecular content of the circumstellar disk in ab aur: first detection  of so in a circumstellar disk	very few molecular species have been detected in circumstellar diskssurrounding young stellar objects. we are carrying out an observational studyof the chemistry of circumstellar disks surrounding t tauri and herbig aestars. first results of this study are presented in this note. we used the emirreceivers recently installed at the iram 30m telescope to carry a sensitivesearch for molecular lines in the disks surrounding ab aur, dm tau, and lkca15. we detected lines of the molecules hco+, cn, h2co, so, cs, and hcn towardab aur. in addition, we tentatively detected dco+ and h2s lines. the lineprofiles suggest that the cn, hcn, h2co, cs and so lines arise in the disk.this makes it the first detection of so in a circumstellar disk. we haveunsuccessfully searched for so toward dm tau and lkca 15, and for c-c3h2 towardab aur, dm tau, and lkca 15. our upper limits show that contrary to all themolecular species observed so far, so is not as abundant in dm tau as it is inab aur. our results demonstrate that the disk associated with ab aur is rich inmolecular species. our chemical model shows that the detection of so isconsistent with that expected from a very young disk where the molecularadsorption onto grains does not yet dominate the chemistry.

0712.0582	evidence of enhanced star formation efficiency in luminous and  ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present new observations made with the iram 30m telescope of the j=1-0 and3-2 lines of hcn and hco^+ used to probe the dense molecular gas content in asample of 17 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs). these observations have allowed us to derive an updated version of thepower law describing the correlation between the fir luminosity (l_fir) and thehcn(1-0) luminosity (l'_hcn(1-0)) of local and high-redshift galaxies. wepresent the first clear observational evidence that the star formationefficiency of the dense gas (sfe_dense), measured as the l_fir/l'_hcn(1-0)ratio, is significantly higher in lirgs and ulirgs than in normal galaxies, aresult that has also been found recently in high-redshift galaxies. this mayimply a statistically significant turn upward in the kennicutt-schmidt lawderived for the dense gas at l_fir &gt;= 10^11 l_sun. we have used a one-phaselarge velocity gradient (lvg) radiative transfer code to fit the threeindependent line ratios derived from our observations. the results of thisanalysis indicate that the [hcn]/[hco^+] abundance ratios could be up to oneorder of magnitude higher than normal in a significant number of lirgs andulirgs of our sample. an overabundance of hcn at high l_fir implies that thereported trend in the l_fir/l'_hcn ratio as a function of l_fir would beunderestimating a potentially more dramatic change of the sfe_dense. resultsobtained with two-phase lvg models corroborate that the l'_hcn(1-0)-to-m_denseconversion factor must be lowered at high l_fir. we discuss the implications ofthese findings for the use of hcn as a tracer of the dense molecular gas inlocal and high-redshift luminous infrared galaxies.

1211.3359	herschel/hifi observations of [cii] and [13cii] in pdrs	recently, we introduced detailed isotopic chemistry into the kosma-tau modelfor photon-dominated regions (pdrs) to give theoretical predictions for theabundance of the carbon isotopologues as a function of pdr parameters. combinedwith radiative transfer computations for specific geometries, we estimated thepossible intensity ratio of the [cii]/[13cii] lines. here, we compare thesepredictions with new observations.  we performed herschel/hifi observations of the [cii] 158micron line in anumber of pdrs. in all sources we observed at least two hyperfine components ofthe [13cii] transition allowing to determine the [cii]/[13cii] intensity ratio,after some revision of the intrinsic hyperfine ratios. comparing the intensityratios with the results from the updated kosma-tau model, we identify casesdominated by chemical fractionation and cases dominated by the optical depth ofthe main isotopic line.  an observable enhancement of the [cii]/[13cii] intensity ratio due tochemical fractionation depends mostly on geometry and velocity structure, andless on the gas density and radiation field. in our observations the[cii]/[13cii] ratio for the integrated line intensity was always dominated bythe optical depth of the main isotopic line. however, an enhanced intensityratio is found for particular velocity components in a few sources: thered-shifted material in the ultracompact hii region mon r2, the wings of theturbulent profile in the orion bar, and possibly a blue wing in ngc7023. themapping of the [13cii] lines in the orion bar allows to derive a c+ columndensity map confirming the temperature stratification of the c+ layer, inagreement with the chemical stratification of the bar. the c+ column densitiesfor all sources show that at the position of the [cii] peak emission, adominant fraction of the gas-phase carbon is in the form of c+.

1303.4984	spatial distribution of small hydrocarbons in the neighborhood of the  ultra compact hii region monoceros r2	we study the chemistry of small hydrocarbons in the photon-dominated regions(pdrs) associated with the ultra-compact hii region mon r2. our goal is todetermine the variations of the abundance of small hydrocarbons in a high-uvirradiated pdr and investigate their chemistry. we present an observationalstudy of ch, cch and c-c$_3$h$_2$ in mon r2 combining data obtained with theiram 30m telescope and herschel. we determine the column densities of thesespecies, and compare their spatial distributions with that of polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (pah). we compare the observational results with differentchemical models to explore the relative importance of gas-phase, grain-surfaceand time-dependent chemistry in these environments. the emission of the smallhydrocarbons show different patterns. the cch emission is extended while ch andc-c$_3$h$_2$ are concentrated towards the more illuminated layers of the pdr.the ratio of the column densities of c-c$_3$h$_2$ and cch shows spatialvariations up to a factor of a few, increasing from$n(c-c$_3$h$_2$)/n(cch)\approx0.004$ in the envelope to a maximum of$\sim0.015-0.029$ towards the 8$\mu$m emission peak. comparing these resultswith other galactic pdrs, we find that the abundance of cch is quite constantover a wide range of g$_0$, whereas the abundance of c-c$_3$h$_2$ is higher inlow-uv pdrs. in mon r2, the gas-phase steady-state chemistry can accountrelatively well for the abundances of ch and cch in the most exposed layers ofthe pdr, but falls short by a factor of 10 to reproduce c-c$_3$h$_2$.  in the molecular envelope, time-dependent effects and grain surface chemistryplay a dominant role in determining the hydrocarbons abundances. our studyshows that cch and c-c$_3$h$_2$ present a complex chemistry in which uvphotons, grain-surface chemistry and time dependent effects contribute todetermine their abundances.

1405.4639	the hot core towards the intermediate mass protostar ngc7129 firs 2:  chemical similarities with orion kl	ngc 7129 firs 2 (hereafter firs 2) is an intermediate-mass (2 to 8 msun)protostar located at a distance of 1250 pc. high spatial resolutionobservations are required to resolve the hot core at its center. we present amolecular survey from 218200 mhz to 221800 mhz carried out with the iramplateau de bure interferometer. these observations were complemented with along integration single-dish spectrum taken with the iram 30m telescope. weused a local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) single temperature code to modelthe whole dataset. the interferometric spectrum is crowded with a total of ~300lines from which a few dozens remain unidentified yet. the spectrum has beenmodeled with a total of 20 species and their isomers, isotopologues anddeuterated compounds. complex molecules like methyl formate (ch3ocho), ethanol(ch3ch2oh), glycolaldehyde (ch2ohcho), acetone (ch3coch3), dimethyl ether(ch3och3), ethyl cyanide (ch3ch2cn) and the agg' conformer of ethylene glycol(agg'-(ch2oh)_2) are among the detected species. the detection of vibrationallyexcited lines of ch3cn, ch3ocho, ch3oh, ocs, hc3n and ch3cho proves theexistence of gas and dust at high temperatures. in fact, the gas kinetictemperature estimated from the vibrational lines of ch3cn, ~405 k, is similarto that measured in massive hot cores. our data allow an extensive comparisonof the chemistry in firs~2 and the orion hot core. we find a quite similarchemistry in firs 2 and orion. most of the studied fractional molecularabundances agree within a factor of 5. larger differences are only found forthe deuterated compounds d2co and ch2doh and a few molecules (ch3ch2cn, so2,hnco and ch3cho). since the physical conditions are similar in both hot cores,only different initial conditions (warmer pre-collapse phase in the case oforion) and/or different crossing time of the gas in the hot core can explainthis behavior.

1412.0417	the chemistry and spatial distribution of small hydrocarbons in  uv-irradiated molecular clouds: the orion bar pdr	we study the spatial distribution and chemistry of small hydrocarbons in theorion bar pdr. we used the iram-30m telescope to carry out a millimetre linesurvey towards the orion bar edge, complemented with ~2'x2' maps of the c2h andc-c3h2 emission. we analyse the excitation of the detected hydrocarbons andconstrain the physical conditions of the emitting regions with non-lteradiative transfer models. we compare the inferred column densities withupdated gas-phase photochemical models including 13cch and c13ch isotopomerfractionation. ~40% of the lines in the survey arise from hydrocarbons (c2h,c4h, c-c3h2, c-c3h, c13ch, 13cch, l-c3h and l-h2c3). we detect new lines froml-c3h+ and improve its rotational spectroscopic constants. anions or deuteratedhydrocarbons are not detected: [c2d]/[c2h]&lt;0.2%, [c2h-]/[c2h]&lt;0.007% and[c4h-]/[c4h]&lt;0.05%. our gas-phase models can reasonably match the observedcolumn densities of most hydrocarbons (within factors &lt;3). since the observedspatial distribution of the c2h and c-c3h2 emission is similar but does notfollow the pah emission, we conclude that, in high uv-flux pdrs,photodestruction of pahs is not a necessary requirement to explain the observedabundances of the smallest hydrocarbons. instead, gas-phase endothermicreactions (or with barriers) between c+, radicals and h2 enhance the formationof simple hydrocarbons. observations and models suggest that the [c2h]/[c-c3h2]ratio (~32 at the pdr edge) decreases with the uv field attenuation. theobserved low cyclic-to-linear c3h column density ratio (&lt;3) is consistent witha high electron abundance (xe) pdr environment. in fact, the poorly constrainedxe gradient influences much of the hydrocarbon chemistry in the moreuv-shielded gas. we propose that reactions of c2h isotopologues with 13c+ and hatoms can explain the observed [c13ch]/[13cch]=1.4(0.1) fractionation level.

1506.07043	probing non polar interstellar molecules through their protonated form:  detection of protonated cyanogen (nccnh+)	cyanogen (nccn) is the simplest member of the series of dicyanopolyynes. ithas been hypothesized that this family of molecules can be importantconstituents of interstellar and circumstellar media, although the lack of apermanent electric dipole moment prevents its detection throughradioastronomical techniques. here we present the first solid evidence of thepresence of cyanogen in interstellar clouds through the detection of itsprotonated form toward the cold dark clouds tmc-1 and l483. protonated cyanogen(nccnh+) has been identified through the j=5-4 and j=10-9 rotationaltransitions using the 40m radiotelescope of yebes and the iram 30m telescope.we derive beam averaged column densities for nccnh+ of (8.6+/-4.4)e10 cm-2 intmc-1 and (3.9+/-1.8)e10 cm-2 in l483, which translate to fairly low fractionalabundances relative to h2, in the range (1-10)e-12. the chemistry of protonatedmolecules in dark clouds is discussed, and it is found that, in general terms,the abundance ratio between the protonated and non protonated forms of amolecule increases with increasing proton affinity. our chemical model predictsan abundance ratio nccnh+/nccn of 1e-4, which implies that the abundance ofcyanogen in dark clouds could be as high as (1-10)e-8 relative to h2, i.e.,comparable to that of other abundant nitriles such as hcn, hnc, and hc3n.

astro-ph;0010182	warm h2 in the galactic center region	we present iso observations of several h2 pure-rotational lines (from s(0) tos(5)) towards a sample of 16 molecular clouds distributed along the central ~500 pc of the galaxy. we also present c18o and 13co j=1-&gt;0 and j=2-&gt;1observations of these sources made with the iram-30m telescope. with the codata we derive h2 densities of 10e(3.5-4.0) cm-3 and h2 column densities of afew 10e22 cm-2. we have corrected the h2 data for ~ 30 magnitudes of visualextinction using a self-consistent method. in every source, we find that the h2emission exhibits a large temperature gradient. the s(0) and s(1) lines tracetemperatures (t) of ~150 k while the s(4) and s(5) lines indicate temperaturesof ~ 600k. the warm h2 column density is typically ~1-2 x 10e22 cm-2, and ispredominantly gas with t=150 k. this is the first direct estimate of the totalcolumn density of the warm molecular gas in the galactic center region. thesewarm h2 column densities represent a fraction of ~ 30 % of the gas traced bythe co isotopes emission. the cooling by h2 in the warm component is comparableto that by co. comparing our h2 and co data with available ammonia nh3observations from literature one obtains relatively high nh3 abundances of afew 10e(-7) in both the warm and the cold gas. a single shock orphoto-dissociation region (pdr) cannot explain all the observed h2 lines.alternatives for the heating mechanisms are discussed.

astro-ph;0110701	cometary molecular clouds around rno6. on-going star formation near the  double cluster h and chi persei	we present molecular line observations of the star-forming cloud around rno6along with a newly discovered nearby molecular cloud that we name rno6nw. bothclouds display striking similarities in their cometary structures and overallkinematics. by using 13co line observations, we estimate that these clouds havesimilar sizes (~4.5 pc) and masses (~200 solar masses). both molecular cloudsrno6 and rno6nw are active in star formation. from new high resolution near-irnarrowband images, we confirm that rno6 hosts an embedded ir cluster thatincludes a herbig be star. a conspicuous h2 filament is found to delineate thedense cometary head of the globule. rno6nw hosts at least two ir sources and abipolar molecular outflow of ~0.9 pc of length and ~0.5 solar masses. we showthat the cometary structure of both clouds has been created by the uv radiationfrom numerous ob stars lying ~1.5 degree to the north. such ob stars areassociated with the double cluster h and chi persei, and are probably membersof the perob1 association. thus star formation inside these clouds has beenvery likely triggered by the radiation driven implosion (rdi) mechanism. fromcomparison to rdi theoretical models, we find that the similar kinematics andmorphology of both clouds is well explained if they are at a re-expansionphase. triggered sequential star formation also explains the observed spatialdistribution of the members of the near-ir cluster inside the rno6 cloud, andthe morphology of the h2 filament. we conclude that the rno6 and rno6nw cloudsare high-mass counterparts to the cometary globules of smaller masses whichhave been studied up to now. thus our observations demonstrate that the rdimechanism can produce, not only low mass stars in small globules, but alsointermediate mass stars and clusters in massive clouds.

astro-ph;0201009	sio chimneys and supershells in m82	in this letter we present the first images of the emission of sio and h13co+in the nucleus of the starburst galaxy m82. contrary to other molecular speciesthat mainly trace the distribution of the star-forming molecular gas within thedisk, the sio emission extends noticeably out of the galaxy plane. the bulk ofthe sio emission is restricted to two major features. the first feature,referred to as the sio supershell, is an open shell of 150 pc diameter, located120 pc west from the galaxy center.  the sio supershell represents the inner front of a molecular shell expandingat 40 km/s, produced by mass ejection around a supercluster of young starscontaining supernova remnant snr 41.95+57.5. the second feature is a verticalfilament, referred to as the sio chimney, emanating from the disk at 200 pceast from the galaxy center. the sio chimney reaches a 500 pc vertical height,and it is associated with the most prominent chimney identified in radiocontinuum maps. the kinematics, morphology, and fractional abundances of thesio gas features in m82 can be explained in the framework of shocked chemistrydriven by local episodes of gas ejection from the starburst disk.

astro-ph;0207313	widespread hco emission in the m82's nuclear starburst	we present a high-resolution (~ 5'') image of the nucleus of m82 showing thepresence of widespread emission of the formyl radical (hco). the hco map, thefirst obtained in an external galaxy, reveals the existence of a structureddisk of ~ 650 pc full diameter. the hco distribution in the plane mimics thering morphology displayed by other molecular/ionized gas tracers in m82. moreprecisely, rings traced by hco, co and hii regions are nested, with the hcoring lying in the outer edge of the molecular torus. observations of hco ingalactic clouds indicate that the abundance of hco is strongly enhanced in theinterfaces between the ionized and molecular gas. the surprisingly high overallabundance of hco measured in m82 (x(hco) ~ 4x10^{-10}) indicates that itsnuclear disk can be viewed as a giant photon dominated region (pdr) of ~ 650 pcsize. the existence of various nested gas rings, with the highest hco abundanceoccurring at the outer ring (x(hco) ~ 0.8x10^{-9}), suggests that pdr chemistryis propagating in the disk. we discuss the inferred large abundances of hco inm82 in the context of a starburst evolutionary scenario, picturing the m82nucleus as an evolved starburst.

astro-ph;0402556	molecular gas chemistry in agn i. the iram survey of ngc1068	there is observational evidence that nuclear winds and x-rays can heavilyinfluence the physical conditions and chemical abundances of molecular gas inthe circumnuclear disks (cnd) of active galactic nuclei (agn). in this paper weprobe the chemical status of molecular gas in the cnd of ngc1068, aprototypical seyfert 2 galaxy. precedent claims that the chemistry of moleculargas in the nucleus of ngc1068 is abnormal by galactic standards were based onthe high hcn/co luminosity ratio measured in the cnd. results from newobservations obtained in this survey have served to derive abundances ofmolecular species such as sio, cn, hco+, hoc+, h13co+ and hco. these estimatesare complemented by a re-evaluation of molecular abundances for hcn, cs and co,based on previously published single-dish and interferometer observations ofngc1068. we report on the first detection of sio emission in the cnd ofngc1068. the estimated large abundance of sio in the cnd, x(sio)~5-10x10^{-9},cannot be attributed to shocks related to star formation, as there is littleevidence of a recent starburst in the nucleus of ngc1068. alternatively, wepropose that silicon chemistry is driven by intense x-ray processing ofmolecular gas. we also report on the first extragalactic detection of thereactive ion hoc+. most remarkably, the estimated hco+/hoc+ abundance ratio inthe nucleus of ngc1068, ~30-80, is the smallest ever measured in molecular gas.the abundances derived for all molecules that have been the subject of thissurvey are compared with the predictions of models invoking eitheroxygen-depletion or x-ray chemistry in molecular gas. our conclusions favour anoverall scenario where the cnd of ngc1068 has become a giant x-ray dominatedregion (xdr).

astro-ph;0407479	iso observations of the galactic center interstellar medium: neutral gas  and dust	the 500 central pc of the galaxy (hereafter gc) exhibit a widespread gascomponent with a kinetic temperature of 100-200 k. the bulk of this gas is notassociated to the well-known thermal radio continuum or far infrared sourceslike sgr a or sgr b. how this gas is heated has been a longstanding problem.with the aim of studying the thermal balance of the neutral gas and dust in thegc, we have observed 18 molecular clouds located at projected distances farfrom thermal continuum sources with the infrared space observatory (iso). inthis paper we present observations of several fine structure lines and the fullcontinuum spectra of the dust between 40 and 190 microns. a warm dust componentwith a temperature between 27 and 42 k is needed to fit the spectra. we havecompared the gas and the dust emission with the predictions from j-type andc-type shocks and photodissociation region (pdrs) models. we conclude that thedust and the fine structure lines observations are best explained by a pdr witha density of 10$^3$ cm^-3 and an incident far-ultraviolet field 10$^3$ timeshigher than the local interstellar radiation field. pdrs can naturally explainthe discrepancy between the gas and the dust temperatures. however, these pdrscan only account for 10-30% of the total h2 column density with a temperatureof ~ 150 k. we discuss other possible heating mechanisms (short version).

astro-ph;0411602	chemical evolution in the environment of intermediate mass young stellar  objects: ngc7129--firs2 and lkh$\alpha$234	we have carried out a molecular survey of the class 0 im protostar ngc 7129-- firs 2 (hereafter firs 2) and the herbig be star lkh$\alpha$ 234 with theaim of studying the chemical evolution of the envelopes of intermediate-mass(im) young stellar objects (ysos). both objects have similar luminosities (~500lsun) and are located in the same molecular cloud which minimizes the chemicaldifferences due to different stellar masses or initial cloud conditions.moreover, since they are located at the same distance, we have the same spatialresolution in both objects. a total of 17 molecular species (including rarerisotopes) have been observed in both objects and the structure of theirenvelopes and outflows is determined with unprecedent detail.  our results show that the protostellar envelopes are dispersed and warmed upduring the evolution to become a pre-main sequence star. in fact, the envelopemass decreases by a factor &gt;5 from firs 2 to lkh$\alpha$234, while the kinetictemperature increases from ~13k to 28k. on the other hand, there is nomolecular outflow associated with lkh$\alpha$234. the molecular outflow seemsto stop before the star becomes visible. these physical changes strongly affectthe chemistry of their envelopes.  based on our results in firs2 and lkh$\alpha$ 234, we propose some abundanceratios that can be used as chemical clocks for the envelopes of im ysos. thesio/cs, cn/n2h+, hcn/n2h+, dco+/hco+ and d2co/dco+ ratios are good diagnosticsof the protostellar evolutionary stage.

astro-ph;0508311	insights into the carbon chemistry of mon r2	aiming to learn about the chemistry of the dense pdr around the ultracompact(uc) hii region in mon r2, we have observed a series of mm-wavelengthtransitions of c3h2 and c2h. in addition, we have traced the distribution ofother molecules, such as h13co+, sio, hco, and hc3n. these data, together withthe reactive ions recently detected, have been considered to determine thephysical conditions and to model the pdr chemistry. we then identified two kindof molecules. the first group, formed by the reactive ions (co+, hoc+) andsmall hydrocarbons (c2h, c3h2), traces the surface layers of the pdr and ispresumably exposed to a high uv field (hence we called it as "high uv", orhuv). huv species is expected to dominate for visual absorptions 2 &lt; av &lt; 5mag. a second group (less exposed to the uv field, and hence called "low uv",or luv) includes hco and sio, and is mainly present at the edges of the pdr (av&gt; 5 mag). while the abundances of the huv molecules can be explained by gasphase models, this is not the case for the studied luv ones. although someefficient gas-phase reactions might be lacking, grain chemistry sounds like aprobable mechanism able to explain the observed enhancement of hco and sio.within this scenario, the interaction of uv photons with grains produces animportant effect on the molecular gas chemistry and constitutes the firstevidence of an ionization front created by the uc hii region carving its hostmolecular cloud. the physical conditions and kinematics of the gas layer whichsurrounds the uc hii region were derived from the huv molecules. molecularhydrogen densities &gt; 4 10^6 cm^(-3) are required to reproduce the observations.such high densities suggest that the hii region could be pressure-confined bythe surrounding high density molecular gas.

astro-ph;0510290	large-scale molecular shocks in galaxies: the sio interferometer map of  ic342	(abridged) we present the first high-resolution (5.6''x5.1'') images of theemission of silicon monoxide (sio) in the nearby spiral ic342, obtained withthe iram plateau de bure interferometer. we have mapped the emission of thesio(2-1) and h13co+(1-0) lines in a 0.9kpcx1.3kpc region around the nucleus ofic342. the bulk of the line emission comes from a 290pc spiral arm and a r~80pcnuclear ring. the distribution of sio clouds is mostly anticorrelated with thecontinuum emission at 87ghz, dominated by thermal free-free bremsstrahlung. thesio/h13co+ intensity ratio increases by an order of magnitude from the nuclearring to the spiral arm. furthermore the gas kinematics show significantdifferences between sio and h13co+ over the spiral arm, where the linewidths ofsio are 2 times larger than that of h13co+. the average abundance of sio in theinner r~320pc, x(sio)&gt;2x10^{-10}, evidences that shock chemistry is at work inic342. we have compared the emission of sio with another tracer of molecularshocks: the emission of methanol (ch3oh). the significant difference of thex(sio) measured between the spiral arm (~a few 10^{-9}) and the nuclear ring(~10^{-10}) is not echoed by a comparable variation in the sio/ch3oh intensityratio. this implies that the typical shock velocities should be similar in bothregions. in contrast, the fraction of shocked molecular gas should be 5-7 timeslarger in the spiral arm (up to ~10% of the available molecular gas mass overthe arm region) compared to the nuclear ring. we conclude that the large-scaleshocks revealed by the sio map of ic342 are mostly unrelated with starformation and arise instead in a pre-starburst phase. shocks are driven bycloud-cloud collisions along the potential well of the ic342 bar. the generalimplications for the current understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.

0810.0832	on the chemistry and distribution of hoc+ in m82: more evidence for  extensive pdrs	the molecular gas composition in the inner 1 kpc disk of the starburst galaxym82 resembles that of galactic photon dominated regions (pdrs). in particular,large abundances of the reactive ions hoc+ and co+ have been measured in thenucleus of this galaxy. to investigate the origin of the large abundances ofreactive ions in m82, we have completed our previous 30m hoc+ j=1-0observations with the higher excitation hco+ and hoc+ j=4-3 and 3-2 rotationallines. in addition, we have obtained with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer (pdbi) a 4" resolution map of the hoc+ 1-0 emission, the firstever obtained in a galactic or extragalactic source. our hoc+ interferometricimage shows that the emission of the hoc+ 1-0 line is mainly restricted to thenuclear disk, with the maxima towards the e. and w. molecular peaks. inaddition, line excitation calculations imply that the hoc+ emission arises indense gas. therefore, the hoc+ emission is arising in the dense pdrs embeddedin the m82 nuclear disk, rather than in the intercloud phase and/or wind. wehave improved our previous chemical model of m82 by (i) using the new versionof the meudon pdr code, (ii) updating the chemical network, and (iii)considering two different types of clouds (with different thickness). mostmolecular observations (hco+, hoc+, co+, cn, hcn, h3o+) are well explainedassuming that ~ 87 % of the mass of the molecular gas is forming small clouds(av=5 mag) while only ~ 13 % of the mass is in large molecular clouds (av=50mag). such small number of large molecular clouds suggests that m82 is an oldstarburst, where star formation has almost exhausted the molecular gasreservoir.

0811.2372	what can we learn about protoplanetary disks from analysis of  mid-infrared carbonaceous dust emission?	in this paper we analyze the mid-infrared (mid-ir) emission of very smalldust particles in a sample of 12 protoplanetary disks to see how they areconnected to interstellar dust particles and to investigate the possibilitythat their emission can be used as a probe of the physical conditions andevolution of the disk. we define a basis made of three mid-ir template spectrapah$^0$, pah$^+$ and vsgs that were derived from the analysis of reflectionnebulae, and an additional pah$^x$ spectrum that was introduced by joblin etal. (2008) for the analysis of the spectra of planetary nebulae. from theoptimization of the fit of 12 star+disk spectra, using a linear combination ofthe 4 template spectra, we found that an additional small grain component witha broad feature at 8.3 $\mu$m is needed. we find that the fraction of vsgemission in disks decreases with increasing stellar temperature. vsgs appear tobe destroyed by uv photons at the surface of disks, thus releasing free pahmolecules, which are eventually ionized as it is observed in photodissociationregions. on the opposite, we observe that the fraction of pah$^x$ increaseswith increasing star temperature except in the case of b stars where they areabsent. we argue that this is compatible with the identification of pah$^x$ aslarge ionized pahs, most likely emitting in regions of the disk that are closeto the star. finally, we provide a uv-dependant scheme to explain the evolutionof pahs and vsgs in protoplanetary disks. we show that a stars modify the sizespectrum of pahs and vsgs in favor of large pahs while b stars destroy even thelargest pahs up to large radii in the disk. these results allow us to put newconstrains on the properties of two sources: irs 48 and "gomez's hamburger"which are poorly characterized.

0812.1636	circumstellar disks around herbig be stars	we completed a search for circumstellar disks around herbig be stars usingthe nrao very large array (vla) and the iram plateau de bure (pdb)interferometers. we present our new vla and pdbi data for the three objects mwc297, z cma, and lkha 215. we constructed the sed from near-ir to centimeterwavelengths by adding our millimeter and centimeter data to the available dataat other wavelengths, mainly spitzer images. the entire sed was fitted using adisk+envelope model. in addition, we compiled all the disk millimeterobservations in the literature and completed a statistical analysis of all thedata. we show that the disk mass is usually only a small percentage (less than10%) of the mass of the entire envelope in hbe stars. for the disks, there arelarge source-to-source variations. two disks in our sample, r mon and z cma,have similar sizes and masses to those found in t tauri and herbig ae stars.the disks around mwc 1080 and mwc 297 are, however, smaller (rout&lt;100 au). wedid not detect the disks towards mwc 137 and lkha 215 at millimeterwavelengths, which limits the mass and the size of the possible circumstellardisks. a comparison between our data and previous results for t tauri andherbig ae stars indicates that although massive disks (0.1 msun) are found inyoung objects (10^4 yr), the masses of the disks around herbig be stars areusually 5-10 times lower than those around lower mass stars. we propose thatdisk photoevaporation is responsible for this behavior. in herbig be stars, theuv radiation disperses the gas in the outer disk on a timescale of a few 10^5yr. once the outer part of the disk has vanished, the entire gaseous disk isphotoevaporated on a very short timescale (10^5 yr) and only a small, dustydisk consisting of large grains remains.
