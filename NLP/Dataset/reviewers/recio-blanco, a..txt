0903.2072	a lack of close binaries among hot horizontal branch stars in globular  clusters - m80 and ngc5986	recent investigations have revealed a surprising lack of close binaries amongextreme horizontal branch (ehb) stars in the globular cluster ngc6752, atvariance with the analogous sdb field stars. another puzzling result concernsthe derived spectroscopic masses for some ehb stars. the present paper extendsour study of ngc6752 to m80 and ngc5986. twenty-one horizontal branch stars(out of which 5 ehbs) in ngc5986 and 31 in m80 (11 ehbs) were observed duringfour consecutive nights. we measured radial velocity variations, temperatures,gravities, and helium abundances. by means of a statistical analysis, wedetected one ehb close binary candidate per cluster. in m80, the best estimateof the close binary ehb fraction is f=12%, and even the lowest estimate of thebinary fraction among field sdb stars can be ruled out within a 90% confidencelevel. because of the small observed sample, no strong conclusions can be drawnon the close ehb binary fraction for ngc5986, although our best estimate israther low (f=25%). for the discrepancy in spectroscopic derived masses withtheoretical models observed in ngc6752, our analysis of m80 ehb stars shows asimilar trend. for the first time, we report a clear trend in surface heliumabundance with temperature. our results show that the deficiency of closebinaries among ehb stars is now confirmed in two, and possibly three, globularclusters. this feature is therefore not a peculiarity of ngc6752. our analysisalso proves that the strangely high spectroscopic masses among ehb stars arenow confirmed in at least a second cluster. our results confirm that f could bea function of the age of the sdb star population, but we find that recentmodels have some problem reproducing all observations.

0909.2938	na-o anticorrelation and hb. vii. the chemical composition of first and  second-generation stars in 15 globular clusters from giraffe spectra	we present abundances of fe, na, and o for 1409 red giant stars in 15galactic globular clusters, derived from the homogeneous analysis of highresolution flames/giraffe spectra. combining the present data with previousresults, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largestand most homogeneous database of this kind to date. our gcs have [fe/h] from-2.4 to -0.4, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of thehorizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc). for all clusters we find the na-oanticorrelation, the classical signature of proton-capture reactions inh-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,now extinct. using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension ofthe na-o anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar populationin gcs: a primordial component (p) of first-generation stars, and 2 componentsof second-generation stars (intermediate i and extreme e populations from theirdifferent chemical composition). the p component is present in all gcs, and itsfraction is almost constant at about one third. the i component represents thebulk of the cluster population. the e component is not present in all gcs, andit is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. wediscuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in oursample and in two additional clusters (m3 and m13) from the literature. we alsofind that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum o andmaximum na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that isrepresented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity.this second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of pollutersand cluster mass.

0708.1521	spectroscopy of horizontal branch stars in ngc6752 - anomalous results  on atmospheric parameters and masses	we used the eso vlt-fors2 facility to collect low-resolution spectra of 51targets distributed along the horizontal branch. we determined atmosphericparameters by comparison with theoretical models through standard fittingroutines, and masses by basic equations. results are in general in goodagreement with previous works, although not always with theoreticalexpectations for cooler stars (teff&lt;15000 k). the calculated color excess issystematically lower than literature values, pointing towards a possibleunderestimation of effective temperatures. moreover, we find two groups ofstars at teff=14000 k and at teff=27000$ k that present anomalies with respectto the general trend and expectations. we suppose that the three peculiarbright stars at teff=14000 k are probably affected by an enhanced stellar wind.for the eight extreme horizontal branch stars at teff=27000 k which showunusually high masses we find no plausible explanation. while most of ourresults agree well with the predictions of standard horizontal branchevolution, we still have problems with the low masses we derive in certaintemperature ranges. we believe that kurucz atlas9 lte model atmospheres withsolar-scaled abundances are probably inadequate for these temperature ranges.concerning the group of anomalous stars at teff=27000 k, a kolmogorov-smirnovtest indicates that there is only an 8.4% probability that these stars arerandomly drawn from the general distribution in the color-magnitude diagram.this is not conclusive but points out that these stars could be both (andindependently) spectroscopically and photometrically peculiar with respect tothe general extreme horizontal branch population.

1009.4951	an overview of the rotational behavior of metal--poor stars	the present paper describes the behavior of the rotational velocity inmetal--poor stars ([fe/h]&lt;-0.5 dex) in different evolutionary stages, based onvsini values from the literature. our sample is comprised of stars in the fieldand some galactic globular clusters, including stars on the main sequence, thered giant branch (rgb), and the horizontal branch (hb). the metal--poor starsare, mainly, slow rotators, and their vsini distribution along the hr diagramis quite homogeneous. nevertheless, a few moderate to high values of vsini arefound in stars located on the main sequence and on the hb. we show that theoverall distribution of vsini values is basically independent of metallicityfor the stars in our sample. in particular, the fast-rotating main sequencestars in our sample present similar rotation rates as their metal-richcounterparts, suggesting that some of them may actually be fairly young, inspite of their low metallicity, or else that at least some of them would bebetter classified as blue straggler stars. we do not find significant evidenceof evolution in vsini values as a function of position on the rgb; inparticular, we do not confirm previous suggestions that stars close to the rgbtip rotate faster than their less evolved counterparts. while the presence offast rotators among moderately cool blue hb stars has been suggested to be dueto angular momentum transport from a stellar core that has retained significantangular momentum during its prior evolution, we find that any such transportmechanisms must likely operate very fast as the star arrives on the zero-age hb(zahb), since we do not find a link between evolution off the zahb and vsinivalues.  we present an extensive tabulation of all quantities discussed in this paper,including rotation velocities, temperatures, gravitie

1011.5335	stellar characterization of corot/exoplanet fields with matisse	the homogeneous spectroscopic determination of the stellar parameters is amandatory step for transit detections from space. knowledge of which populationthe planet hosting stars belong to places constraints on the formation andevolution of exoplanetary systems. we used the flames/giraffe multi-fiberinstrument at eso to spectroscopically observe samples of stars in threecorot/exoplanet fields, namely the lra01, lrc01, and src01 fields, andcharacterize their stellar populations. we present accurate atmosphericparameters, teff, logg, [m/h], and [$\alpha$/fe]\ derived for 1227 stars inthese fields using the \matisse algorithm. the latter is based on the spectralsynthesis methodology and automatically provides stellar parameters for largesamples of observed spectra. we trained and applied this algorithm to \flamesobservations covering the mg \textsc{i} b spectral range. it was calibrated onreference stars and tested on spectroscopic samples from other studies in theliterature. the barycentric radial velocities and an estimate of the vsinivalues were measured using cross-correlation techniques. we corrected oursamples in the lrc01 and lra01 corot fields for selection effects tocharacterize their fgk dwarf stars population, and compiled the first unbiasedreference sample for the in-depth study of planet metallicity relationship inthese corot fields. we conclude that the fgk dwarf population in these fieldsmainly exhibit solar metallicity. we show that for transiting planet findingmissions, the probability of finding planets as a function of metallicity couldexplain the number of planets found in the lra01 and lrc01 corot fields. thisstudy demonstrates the potential of multi-fiber observations combined with anautomated classifier such as matisse for massive spectral classification.

1107.1625	the first fluorine abundance determinations in extragalactic agb carbon  stars	fluorine (19f) abundances (or upper limits) are derived in six extragalacticagb carbon stars from the hf(1-0) r9 line at 2.3358 mu in high resolutionspectra. the stars belong to the local group galaxies lmc, smc and carina dwarfspheroidal, spanning more than a factor 50 in metallicity. this is the firststudy to probe the behaviour of f with metallicity in intrinsic extragalacticc-rich agb stars. fluorine could be measured only in four of the target stars,showing a wide range in f-enhancements. our f abundance measurements togetherwith those recently derived in galactic agb carbon stars show a correlationwith the observed carbon and s-element enhancements. the observed correlationshowever, display a different dependence on the stellar metallicity with respectto theoretical predictions in low mass, low metallicity agb models. we brieflydiscuss the possible reasons for this discrepancy. if our findings areconfirmed in a larger number of metal-poor agbs, the issue of f production inagb stars will need to be revisited.

1109.6237	automatic stellar spectra parameterisation in the ir caii triplet region	(abridged) galactic archaeology aims to determine the evolution of the galaxyfrom the chemical and kinematical properties of its stars. the analysis ofcurrent large spectroscopic surveys (thousands of stars) and future ones(millions of stars) require automated analysis techniques to obtain robustestimates of the stellar parameters. several on-going and planned spectroscopicsurveys have selected their wavelength region to contain the ir caii tripletand this paper focuses on the automatic analysis of such spectra.  we investigated two algorithms, matisse and degas, both of which compare theobserved spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra, but each uses a differentmathematical approach for finding the optimum match and hence the best stellarparameters.  we identified degeneracies in different regions of the hr diagram: hot dwarfsand giants share the same spectral signatures. furthermore, the surface gravityof cooler dwarfs is difficult to determine accurately. these effects areintensified when the information decreases (e.g. metal-poor stars or low snrspectra). our results show that the local projection method matisse ispreferred for high snr spectra, whereas the decision-tree method degas ispreferred for noisier spectra. we therefore propose a hybrid approach of bothmethods and show that sufficiently accurate results for the purposes ofgalactic archaeology are retrieved down to snr~20 for typical thin or thickdisc stars, and down to snr~50 for the more metal-poor halo giants.  if unappreciated, degeneracies in stellar parameters can introduce biases inderived quantities for target stars such as distances and full space motions.these biases can be minimised using the knowledge gained by thorough testing ofthe proposed algorithm, which in turn lead to robust automated methods for thecoming extensive stellar spectroscopic surveys in the local group.

1110.5221	a spectroscopic survey of thick disc stars outside the solar  neighbourhood	we performed a spectroscopic survey of nearly 700 stars probing the galacticthick disc far from the solar neighbourhood towards the galactic coordinates(l~277, b~47). the derived effective temperatures, surface gravities andoverall metallicities were then combined with stellar evolution isochrones,radial velocities and proper motions to derive the distances, kinematics andorbital parameters of the sample stars. the targets belonging to each galacticcomponent (thin disc, thick disc, halo) were selected either on theirkinematics or according to their position above the galactic plane, and thevertical gradients were also estimated. we present here atmospheric parameters,distances and kinematics for this sample, and a comparison of our kinematic andmetallicity distributions with the besancon model of the milky way. the thickdisc far from the solar neighbourhood is found to differ only slightly from thethick disc properties as derived in the solar vicinity. for regions where thethick disc dominates, we measured vertical velocity and metallicity trends ofd(v_phi)/dz = 19 +/- 8 km/s/kpc and d[m/h]/dz = -0.14 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc,respectively. these trends can be explained as a smooth transition between thedifferent galactic components, although intrinsic gradients could not beexcluded. in addition, a correlation d(v_phi)/d[m/h] = -45 +/- 12 km/s/dexbetween the orbital velocity and the metallicity of the thick disc is detected.this gradient is inconsistent with the sdss photometric survey analysis, whichdid not detect any such trend, and challenges radial migration models of thickdisc formation. estimations of the scale heights and scale lengths fordifferent metallicity bins of the thick disc result in consistent values, withhr~3.4 \pm 0.7 kpc, and hz~694 \pm 45 pc, showing no evidence of relics ofdestroyed massive satellites.

1201.3193	fluorine abundances in dwarf stars of the solar neighbourhood	in spite of many observational efforts aiming to characterize the chemicalevolution of our galaxy, not much is known about the origin of fluorine (f).models suggest that the f found in the galaxy might have been produced mainlyin three different ways, namely, type ii supernovae, asymptotic giant branchnucleosynthesis, or in the core of wolf-rayet stars. only a few observationalmeasurements of f abundances are available in the literature and mostly forobjects whose characteristics might hamper an accurate determination offluorine abundance (e.g.,complex mixing and nucleosynthesis processes,external/internal contamination). we derive the f abundances for a set of ninecool main-sequence dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood, based on an unblendedline of the hf molecule at 2.3 microns. in addition, we study the s-processelements of five of these stars. we acquire data using the high-resolutionir-spectrograph crires and gather feros data from the european southernobservatory archive. several of the analysed stars seem to be slightly fluorineenhanced with respect to the sun, although no correlation is found between thef abundance and the iron content. in addition, the most fluorine enriched starsare also yttrium and zirconium enriched, which suggests that agb fluorinenucleosynthesis is the dominant source of fluorine production for the observedstars. nevertheless, the correlation between [f/fe] and the s-elements israther weak and possibly masked by the uncertainties in the f abundancemeasurements. finally, we compare our derived f abundances to previousmeasurements of alpha-element and iron-peak element abundances. type ii corecollapse supernovae do not appear to be the main site of f production for ourtargets, as no correlation seems to exist between the [f/fe] and the [alpha/fe]ratios.

1204.1041	the ambre project: stellar parameterisation of the eso:feros archived  spectra	the ambre project is a collaboration between the european southernobservatory (eso) and the observatoire de la cote d'azur (oca) that has beenestablished in order to carry out the determination of stellar atmosphericparameters for the archived spectra of four eso spectrographs.  the analysis of the feros archived spectra for their stellar parameters(effective temperatures, surface gravities, global metallicities, alpha elementto iron ratios and radial velocities) has been completed in the first phase ofthe ambre project. from the complete eso:feros archive dataset that wasreceived, a total of 21551 scientific spectra have been identified, coveringthe period 2005 to 2010. these spectra correspond to ~6285 stars.  the determination of the stellar parameters was carried out using the stellarparameterisation algorithm, matisse (matrix inversion for spectral synthesis),which has been developed at oca to be used in the analysis of large scalespectroscopic studies in galactic archaeology. an analysis pipeline has beenconstructed that integrates spectral reduction and radial velocity correctionprocedures with matisse in order to automatically determine the stellarparameters of the feros spectra.  stellar atmospheric parameters (teff, log g, [m/h] and [alpha/fe]) weredetermined for 6508 (30.2%) of the feros archived spectra (~3087 stars). radialvelocities were determined for 11963 (56%) of the archived spectra. 2370 (11%)spectra could not be analysed within the pipeline. 12673 spectra (58.8%) wereanalysed in the pipeline but their parameters were discarded based on qualitycriteria and error analysis determined within the automated process. themajority of these rejected spectra were found to have broad spectral featuresindicating that they may be hot and/or fast rotating stars, which are notconsidered within the adopted reference synthetic spectra grid of fgkm stars.

1205.2270	the ambre project: a new synthetic grid of high-resolution fgkm stellar  spectra	large grids of synthetic spectra covering a widespread range of stellarparameters are mandatory for different stellar and (extra-)galactic physicsapplications. such large grids can be used for the automatic parametrisation ofstellar spectra such as that performed within the ambre project for which themain goal is the stellar atmospheric parameters determination for the fewhundreds of thousands of archived spectra of four eso spectrographs. to fulfilthe needs of ambre and future similar projects, we have computed a grid ofsynthetic spectra over the whole optical domain for cool to very cool stars ofany luminosity with metallicities varying from 10-5 to 10 times the solarmetallicity, and considering large variations in the chemical content of the{\alpha}-elements. new generation marcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrumcode for radiative transfer have been used. we have also taken into account ascomplete as possible atomic and molecular linelists. a new grid of 16783 highresolution spectra over the wavelength range 3000 to 12000 {\aa} has beencomputed with a spectral resolution always larger than 150000. normalised andabsolute flux versions are available over a wide range of stellar atmosphericparameters for stars of fgkm spectral types. the covered parameters are2500k\leqteff\leq8000k, -0.5\leqlog(g)\leq5.5dex, -5.0\leq[m/h]\leq+1.0 dex andfive different values of the enrichment in {\alpha}-elements have beenconsidered (0.0, \pm0.2 dex and \pm0.4 dex around the standard values). thisgrid is made publicly available through the pollux database (about 50% of thespectra are already included in this database) and in fits format upon requestto the authors.

1209.2656	comparative modelling of the spectra of cool giants	our ability to extract information from the spectra of stars depends onreliable models of stellar atmospheres and appropriate techniques for spectralsynthesis. various model codes and strategies for the analysis of stellarspectra are available today. we aim to compare the results of deriving stellarparameters using different atmosphere models and different analysis strategies.the focus is set on high-resolution spectroscopy of cool giant stars. spectrarepresenting four cool giant stars were made available to various groups andindividuals working in the area of spectral synthesis, asking them to derivestellar parameters from the data provided. the results were discussed at aworkshop in vienna in 2010. most of the major codes currently used in theastronomical community for analyses of stellar spectra were included in thisexperiment. we present the results from the different groups, as well as anadditional experiment comparing the synthetic spectra produced by various codesfor a given set of stellar parameters. similarities and differences of theresults are discussed. several valid approaches to analyze a given spectrum ofa star result in quite a wide range of solutions. the main causes for thedifferences in parameters derived by different groups seem to lie in thephysical input data and in the details of the analysis method. this clearlyshows how far from a definitive abundance analysis we still are.

1301.0111	characterisation of the galactic thin disc with corot targets	we use kinematical and chemical properties of 754 corot stars to characterisethe stellar populations of the milky way disc in three beams close the galacticplane. from the atmospheric parameters derived in gazzano et al. (2010) withthe matisse algorithm, we derived stellar distances using isochrones. combiningthese data with proper motions, we provide the complete kinematical descriptionof stars in three corot fields. finally, we used kinematical criteria toidentify the galactic populations in our sample and study theircharacteristics, particularly their chemistry. comparing our kinematics withthe besancon galactic model, we show that, within 3-sigma, simulated andobserved kinematical distributions are in good agreement. we study thecharacteristics of the thin disc, finding a correlation that is significant ata value of 2-sigma between the v-velocity component and the metallicity for twodifferent radial distance bins (8-9kpc and 9-10kpc; but not for the most innerbin 7-8kpc, probably because of the uncertainties in the abundances) whichcould be interpreted as radial migration evidence. we also measured a radialmetallicity gradient value of -0.097+/-0.015dex/kpc with giant stars, and-0.053+/-0.015dex/kpc with dwarfs. finally, we identified metal-rich stars withpeculiar high [alpha/fe] values in the directions pointing to the inner part ofthe galaxy. applying the same methodology to the planet-hosting stars detectedby corot shows that they mainly belong to the thin disc population with normalchemical and kinematical properties.

1305.6145	through thick and thin: structure of the galactic thick disc from  extragalactic surveys	we aim to understand the accretion history of the milky way by exploring thevertical and radial properties of the galactic thick disc.  we study the chemical and kinematic properties of roughly a thousand spectraof faint magnitude foreground galactic stars observed serendipitously duringextra-galactic surveys in four lines-of-sight: three in the southern galactichemisphere (surveys of the carina, fornax and sculptor dwarf spheroidalgalaxies) and one in the northern galactic hemisphere (a survey of the sextansdwarf spheroidal galaxy). the foreground stars span distances up to 3kpc fromthe galactic plane and galactocentric radii up to 11kpc.  only three lines-of-sight have a sufficient number of foreground stars for arobust analysis. towards sextans in the northern galactic hemisphere andsculptor in the south, we measure a consistent decrease in mean metallicitywith height from the galactic plane, suggesting a chemically symmetric thickdisc. this decrease can either be due to an intrinsic thick disc metallicitygradient, or simply due to a change in the thin disc/thick disc populationratio and no intrinsic metallicity gradients for the thick disc. we favour thelatter explanation. in contrast, we find evidence of an unpredicted metal-poorpopulation in the direction of carina. this population was earlier detected bywyse et al. (2006), but our more detailed analysis provides robust estimates ofits location (|z|&lt;1kpc), metallicity (-2&lt;[m/h]&lt;-1 dex) and azimuthal orbitalvelocity (v_phi ~120 km/s).  given the chemo-dynamical properties of the over-density towards the carinaline-of-sight, we suggest that it represents the metal-poor tail of thecanonical thick disc. in spite of the small number of stars available, wesuggest that this metal-weak thick disc follows the often suggested thick discvelocity-metallicity correlation of dv_phi/d[m/h]~40-50km/s/dex.

1306.4528	fluorine abundances and the puzzle of globular cluster chemical history	the abundance of fluorine in a few galactic globular clusters is known tostrongly vary from star-to-star. these unexpected chemical properties are anadditional confirmation of the chemical inhomogeneities already found inseveral gc, and probably caused by the first generations of stars formed inthese systems. the aim of this article is to complement our understanding ofthe f-behaviour in gc stars and to look for new constraints on the formationhistories of their multiple stellar populations. we have collected near-irspectra of 15 rgb stars belonging to gc spanning a wide range of metallicity:47 tuc, m4, ngc6397 and m30. f, na and fe abundances have been estimated byspectral synthesis. no anticorrelation between f and na abundances are foundfor the most metal-rich cluster of the sample (47 tuc). in this gc, rgb starsindeed exhibit rather small differences in [f/fe] unlike the larger ones foundfor the [na/fe] ratios. this reveals a rather inhomogeneous stellar system anda complex chemical evolution history for 47 tuc . in m4, one star of our studyconfirms the previous na-f distribution reported by another group in 2005. forthe two very metal-poor gc (ngc6397 and m30), only upper limits of f abundanceshave been derived. we show that f abundances could be estimated in suchmetal-poor gc with current telescopes and spectrographs only if unexpectedf-rich giants are found and/or exceptional observational conditions are met.the distribution of the f and na abundances in gc reveal that their rgb membersseem to belong to two well-separated regions. all the rgb stars analysed so farin the different gc are indeed found to be either f-rich na-poor or f-poorna-rich. such well-separated bimodal regimes are consistent with the separateformation episodes suspected in most galactic gc.

1311.4380	revisited fluorine abundances in the globular cluster m22 (ngc 6656)	fluorine is a fairly good tracer of formation histories of multiple stellarpopulations in globular clusters as already revealed by several studies. largevariations in fluorine abundance in red giant stars of the globular cluster m22have been recently reported by two different groups. futhermore, one of thesestudies claims that the abundance of fluorine is anti-correlated with sodiumabundances in this cluster, leading to strong conclusions on the chemicalhistory of m22. to validate this important finding, we re-examine the fabundance determinations of some of the previously studied stars. we have thusreanalysed some high-resolution vlt/crires spectra of rgb stars found in m22 inorder to re-estimate their fluorine abundance from the spectral synthesis ofthe hf line at 2.336microns. unlike what has been previously estimated, we showthat only upper limits or doubtful fluorine abundances with large uncertaintiesin m22 rgb stars can be derived. this is probably caused by an incorrectidentification of continuum fluctuations as the hf signature combined with awrong correction of the stellar radial velocity. such continuum fluctuationscould be the consequences of telluric residuals that are still present in theanalysed spectra. therefore, no definitive conclusions on the chemicalpollution caused by the m22 first stellar generation can presently be drawnfrom the fluorine content of this cluster.

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1312.6472	the gaia-eso survey: abundance ratios in the inner-disk open clusters  trumpler 20, ngc 4815, ngc 6705	open clusters are key tools to study the spatial distribution of abundancesin the disk and their evolution with time. using the first release of stellarparameters and abundances of the gaia-eso survey, we analyse the chemicalproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely ngc6705, ngc 4815, and trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the galacticdisk at galactocentric radius r$_{gc}\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving theirhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. we study theabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosyntheticchannels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. the main results can besummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable[el/fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metalcontent [el/h], with ngc 4815 having the lowest metallicity. their [el/fe]ratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, bothin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing theabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and withfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of mg,ni, ca in ngc 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequentvariation of its r$_{gc}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbitdetermination. the full dataset of the gaia-eso survey will be a superlativetool to constrain the chemical evolution of our galaxy by disentanglingdifferent formation and evolution scenarios.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1401.4979	the gaia-eso survey: kinematic structure in the gamma velorum cluster	context: a key science goal of the gaia-eso survey (ges) is to use thekinematics of low-mass stars in young clusters to probe their dynamicalhistories and how they populate the field as they become unbound. theclustering of low-mass stars around the massive w-r binary gamma^2 velorum wasone of the first ges targets. aims: to empirically determine the radialvelocity (rv) precision of ges data, construct a kinematically unbiased sampleof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. methods: targetswere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolutionspectroscopy used to derive rvs and assess membership from the strength of theli6708a line. the rv distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihoodtechnique that accounts for unresolved binaries. results: the ges rv precisionis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-masspopulation around gamma^2 vel. the structure is well fitted by two kinematiccomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsicdispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. the secondhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by~2km/s. the first population is older by 1-2myr based on a greater level of lidepletion seen among its m-stars and is probably more centrally concentratedaround gamma^2 vel. conclusions: we consider several formation scenarios,concluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of theoriginal, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 vel, and a dispersed populationfrom the wider vela ob2 association, of which gamma^2 vel is the most massivemember. the apparent youth of gamma^2 vel compared to the older (&gt;=10myr)low-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binaryformed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of thelow-mass stars.[abridged]

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7451	the gaia-eso survey: properties of the intermediate age open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a populous ~500 myr open cluster at a galactocentric radius of 7kpc observed in the first six months of the gaia-eso survey. located in theinner galactic disk, ngc 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,where few intermediate age open clusters are found. we use the survey derivedradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elementalabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry outan analysis of cluster properties. the radial velocity distribution of stars inthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derivelikely cluster membership for stars observed by the gaia-eso survey. weinvestigate the distributions of fe and fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, andthe light elements na and al and characterize the cluster's internal chemicalhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram isanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,distance, and age. ngc 4815 is found to have a mean [fe/h]=+0.03. elementalabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, withinternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

(2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1502.03223	the gaia-eso survey: tracing interstellar extinction	large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computationof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. such maps are complementaryto 3d maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of thedust properties. our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic surveygaia-eso in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellarextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and thegalactocentric position. we use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than5000 stars, obtained from the gaia-eso survey second internal data release, andcombine them with optical (sdss) and near-infrared (vista) photometry as wellas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances. the extinction coefficients are thencompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellarparameters and position in the galaxy. within the errors of our method, ourwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinctioncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. we do not find anyevidence of the variation of e(j-h)/e(j-k) with the angle from the galacticcentre nor with galactocentric distance. this suggests that we are dealing witha uniform extinction law in the sdss ugriz bands and the near-ir jhks bands.therefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constantextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

1505.07019	the gaia-eso survey: empirical determination of the precision of stellar  radial velocities and projected rotation velocities	the gaia-eso survey (ges) is a large public spectroscopic survey at theeuropean southern observatory very large telescope. a key aim is to provideprecise radial velocities (rvs) and projected equatorial velocities (v sin i)for representative samples of galactic stars, that will complement informationobtained by the gaia astrometry satellite. we present an analysis toempirically quantify the size and distribution of uncertainties in rv and v sini using spectra from repeated exposures of the same stars. we show that theuncertainties vary as simple scaling functions of signal-to-noise ratio (s/n)and v sin i, that the uncertainties become larger with increasing photospherictemperature, but that the dependence on stellar gravity, metallicity and age isweak. the underlying uncertainty distributions have extended tails that arebetter represented by student's t-distributions than by normal distributions.parametrised results are provided, that enable estimates of the rv precisionfor almost all ges measurements, and estimates of the v sin i precision forstars in young clusters, as a function of s/n, v sin i and stellar temperature.the precision of individual high s/n ges rv measurements is 0.22-0.26 km/s,dependent on instrumental configuration.

1507.08066	the gaia-eso survey: characterisation of the [alpha/fe] sequences in the  milky way discs	we investigate, using the gaia-eso survey internal data-release 2, theproperties of the double sequence of the milky way discs (defined chemically asthe high-alpha and low-alpha populations), and discuss their compatibility withdiscs defined by other means such as metallicity, kinematics or positions.  this investigation uses two different approaches: in velocity space for starslocated in the extended solar neighbourhood, and in chemical space for stars atdifferent ranges of galactocentric radii and heights from the plane. theseparation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novelmanner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifyingthem with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of theirmetallicity distribution functions. then, using the separation in chemicalspace, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/fe] -[fe/h] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relativeproportions of the two discs change across the galaxy.  we find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [fe/h]~ +0.2and the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [fe/h]~ -0.8. radialand vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, withmild spatial variations in its [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths, whereas for the thickdisc we do not detect any such spatial variations.  the small variations in the spatial [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths of the thindisc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.on the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/fe] - [fe/h]variations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for themixing of the metals in the young galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration orturbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin discstarted forming.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

1512.03835	the gaia-eso survey: separating disk chemical substructures with cluster  models	(abridged) recent spectroscopic surveys have begun to explore the galacticdisk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.in this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporalvariations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. we used agaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, toseparate in the [mg/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane a clean disk star subsample from thegaia-eso survey internal data release 2. we find that the sample is separatedinto five groups associated with major galactic components; the metal-rich endof the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.this is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) survey. the twometal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition([fe/h]&gt;-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. thisholds true at different radial regions. the distribution of galactocentricradial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([fe/h]&lt;-0.25 dex) isshifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. moreover,the metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale heightintermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and itdisplays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. these stars might haveformed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formationtaking place in the internal thin disk. their enhancement levels might be dueto their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or theinner halo. the smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distributionwith respect to the plane, in particular) with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] suggested bythe data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.

astro-ph;0305461	why hot horizontal branch stars can appear redder than red giants	in this paper we report on a curious feature in the v, (u-b) color-magnitudediagrams of globular clusters. in our database, we find that a considerablefraction of blue horizontal branch stars, hotter than the instability strip andcooler than the grundahl et al. (1999) jump (i.e., 6000 &lt;~ t_eff k &lt;~ 10000),have (u-b) colors redder than their red giant progenitors. this red incursionis not expected on theoretical grounds, as horizontal branch stars (whoseconvective regions are less extended than in red giant structures) should not``appear'' cooler than a red giant. analyzing data from different telescopes weshow that: 1) the horizontal branch red incursion is strongly dependent on theshape of the adopted u filter and to a lesser extent, on the b filter; 2) thephotometry done with u filters which do not encompass the balmer jump, do notshow the blue horizontal branch red incursion; 3) the occurrence of thisfeature is also due to the peculiar dependence of the u and b magnitudes onstars effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity; 4) theoretical trackscan reproduce the observed horizontal branch morphology, provided that theappropriate (i.e. exactly responding to the filters effectively used in theobservations) transmission curve efficiencies are used for deriving color-t_efftransformations; 5) the red incursion extent depends on metallicity.

0812.3103	fluorine in agb carbon stars revisited	a reanalysis of the fluorine abundance in three galactic agb carbon stars (txpsc, aq sgr and r scl) has been performed from the molecular hf (1-0) r9 lineat 2.3358 $\mu$m. high-resolution (r$\sim 50000$) and high signal to noisespectra obtained with the crires spectrograph and the vlt telescope or from thenoao archive (for tx psc) have been used. our abundance analysis uses thelatest generation of marcs model atmospheres for cool carbon rich stars. usingspectral synthesis in lte we derive for these stars fluorine abundances thatare systematically lower by $\sim 0.8$ dex in average with respect to the soleprevious estimates by jorissen, smith &amp; lambert (1992). the possible reasons ofthis discrepancy are explored. we conclude that the difference may rely on theblending with c-bearing molecules (cn and c$_2$) that were not properly takeninto account in the former study. the new f abundances are in better agreementwith the prediction of full network stellar models of low mass agb stars. thesemodels also reproduce the $s$-process elements distribution in the sampledstars. this result, if confirmed in a larger sample of agb stars, mightalleviate the current difficulty to explain the largest [f/o] ratios found byjorissen et al. in particular, it may not be necessary to search foralternative nuclear chains affecting the production of f in agb stars.
