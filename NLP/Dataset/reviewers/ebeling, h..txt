0901.2144	a spectacular giant arc in the massive cluster lens macsj1206.2-0847	we discuss the x-ray and optical properties of the massive galaxy clustermacsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.4385), discovered in the massive cluster survey (macs).our chandra observation of the system yields a total x-ray luminosity of 2.4 x10^45 erg/s (0.1-2.4 kev) and a global gas temperature of (11.6 +/- 0.7) kev,very high values typical of macs clusters. in both optical and x-ray imagesmacsj1206 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced x-ray peakat the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg); we interpret thisfeature as the remnant of a cold core. a spectacular giant gravitational arc,15" in length, bright (v~21) and unusually red (r-k=4.3), is seen 20" west ofthe bcg; we measure a redshift of z=1.036 for the lensed galaxy. from our hstimage of the cluster we identify the giant arc and its counter image as aseven-fold imaged system. an excess of x-ray emission in the direction of thearc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of aminor merger with a group of galaxies. we derive estimates of the total clustermass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using x-ray, dynamical, andgravitational-lensing techniques. for the mass enclosed by the giant arc (r&lt;119kpc) our strong-lensing analysis based on hst imaging yields a very high valueof 1.1 x 10^14 m_sun, inconsistent with the much lower x-ray estimate of 0.5 x10^14 m_sun. similarly, the virial estimate of 4 x 10^15 m_sun for the totalcluster mass, derived from multi-object spectroscopy of 38 cluster members, issignificantly higher than the corresponding x-ray estimate of 1.7 x 10^15m_sun. we take the discrepant mass estimates to be indicative of substructurealong the line of sight during an ongoing merger event, an interpretation thatis supported by the system's very high velocity dispersion of 1580 km/s.

0910.4958	a new measurement of the bulk flow of x-ray luminous clusters of  galaxies	we present new measurements of the large-scale bulk flows of galaxy clustersbased on 5-year wmap data and a significantly expanded x-ray cluster catalogue.our method probes the flow via measurements of the kinematic sunyaev-zeldovich(sz) effect produced by the hot gas in moving clusters. it computes the dipolein the cosmic microwave background (cmb) data at cluster pixels, whichpreserves the sz component while integrating down other contributions. ourimproved catalog of over 1,000 clusters enables us to further investigatepossible systematic effects and, thanks to a higher median cluster redshift,allows us to measure the bulk flow to larger scales. we present a correctederror treatment and demonstrate that the more x-ray luminous clusters, whilefewer in number, have much larger optical depth, resulting in a higher dipoleand thus a more accurate flow measurement. this results in the observedcorrelation of the dipole derived at the aperture of zero monopole with themonopole measured over the cluster central regions. this correlation isexpected if the dipole is produced by the sz effect and cannot be caused byunidentified systematics (or primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies).we measure that the flow is consistent with approximately constant velocity outto at least 800 mpc. the significance of the measured signal peaks around 500mpc, most likely because the contribution from more distant clusters becomesprogressively more diluted by the wmap beam. we can, however, at present notrule out that these more distant clusters simply contribute less to the overallmotion.

0911.4125	macsj1423.8+2404: gravitational lensing by a massive, relaxed cluster of  galaxies at z=0.54	we present results of a gravitational-lensing and optical study of macs,j1423.8+2404 (z=0.545, macs, j1423). our analysis uses high-resolution imagestaken with the hubble space telescope in the f555w and f814w passbands, groundbased imaging in eight optical and near-infrared filters obtained with subaruand cfht, as well as extensive spectroscopic data gathered with the kecktelescopes. at optical wavelengths the cluster exhibits no sign of substructureand is dominated by a cd galaxy that is 2.1 magnitudes (k-band) brighter thanthe second brightest cluster member, suggesting that macs, j1423 is close to befully virialized. analysis of the redshift distribution of 140 cluster membersreveals a gaussian distribution, mildly disturbed by the presence of a loosegalaxy group that may be falling into the cluster along the line of sight.combining strong-lensing constraints from two spectroscopically confirmedmultiple-image systems near the cluster core with a weak-lensing measurement ofthe gravitational shear on larger scales, we derive a parametric mass model forthe mass distribution. all constraints can be satisfied by a uni-modal massdistribution centred on the cd galaxy and exhibiting very little substructure.the derived projected mass of m(&lt;65\arcsec [415 kpc])=(4.3\pm0.6)\times 10^{14}m_sun is about 30% higher than the one derived from x-ray analyses assumingspherical symmetry, suggesting a slightly prolate mass distribution consistentwith the optical indication of residual line-of-sight structure. the similarityin shape and excellent alignment of the centroids of the total mass, k-bandlight, and intra-cluster gas distributions add to the picture of a highlyevolved system [abridged]

1001.1261	the error budget of the dark flow measurement	we analyze the uncertainties and possible systematics associated with the"dark flow" measurements using the cumulative sunyaev-zeldovich effect combinedwith all-sky catalogs of clusters of galaxies. filtering of all-sky cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) maps is required to remove the intrinsiccosmological signal down to the limit imposed by cosmic variance. contributionsto the errors come from the remaining cosmological signal, that integrates downwith the number of clusters, and the instrumental noise, that scales with thenumber of pixels; the latter decreases with integration time and is subdominantfor the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 5-year data. it is proven bothanalytically and numerically that the errors for 5-year wmap data are $\simeq15\sqrt{3/n_{\rm clusters}} \mu$k per dipole component. the measured bulk flowvelocity is significant at up to the $&gt;99.95%$ confidence level, depending onthe cluster sample. we discuss different methods to compute error bars anddemonstrate that they have biases that would overpredict the errors, as is thecase in a recent reanalysis of our earlier results. if the signal is caused bysystematic effects present in the data, such systematics must have a dipolepattern, which correlates with cluster x-ray luminosity and is present only atcluster positions. only contributions from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect couldprovide such contaminants via several potential effects. we discuss suchcandidates apart from the bulk-motion of the cluster samples and demonstratethat their contributions to our measurements are negligible.

1003.2631	the impact of a major cluster merger on galaxy evolution in  macs\,j0025.4-1225	we present results of an extensive morphological, spectroscopic, andphotometric study of the galaxy population of macs j0025.4$-$1225 (z=0.586), amajor cluster merger with clear segregation of dark and luminous matter, toexamine the impact of mergers on galaxy evolution. based on 436 galaxy spectraobtained with keck deimos, we identified 212 cluster members within 4 mpc ofthe cluster centre, and classified them using three spectroscopic types; wefind 111 absorption-line, 90 emission-line (including 23 e(a) and 11 e(b)), and6 e+a galaxies. the fraction of absorption(emission)-line galaxies is amonotonically increasing(decreasing) function of both projected galaxy densityand radial distance to the cluster center. more importantly, the 6 observed e+acluster members are all located between the dark-matter peaks of the clusterand within ~0.3mpc radius of the x-ray flux peak, unlike the e+a galaxies inother intermediate-redshift clusters which are usually found to avoid the coreregion. in addition, we use hubble space telescope imaging to classify clustermembers according to morphological type. we find the global fraction of spiraland lenticular galaxies in macs j0025 to be among the highest observed to datein clusters at z&gt;0.5. the observed e+a galaxies are found to be of lenticulartype with sersic indices of ~2, boosting the local fraction of s0 to 70 percent between the dark-matter peaks. combing the results of our analysis of thespatial distribution, morphology, and spectroscopic features of the galaxypopulation, we propose that the starburst phase of these e+a galaxies was bothinitiated and terminated during the first core-passage about 0.5--1gyr ago, andthat their morphology has already been transformed into s0 due to ram pressureand/or tidal forces near the cluster core. by contrast, ongoing starbursts areobserved predominantly in infalling galaxies, and thus appears to be unrelatedto the cluster merger.

1004.4683	the x-ray brightest clusters of galaxies from the massive cluster survey	we present a statistically complete sample of very x-ray luminous galaxyclusters detected in the massive cluster survey (macs). this second macsrelease comprises all 34 macs clusters with nominal x-ray fluxes in excess of2x10^(-12) erg/s/cm^2 (0.1-2.4 kev) in the rosat bright source catalogue; twothirds of them are new discoveries. extending over the redshift range from 0.3to 0.5, this subset complements the complete sample of the 12 most distant macsclusters (z&gt;0.5) published in 2007 and further exemplifies the efficacy ofx-ray selection for the compilation of samples of intrinsically massive galaxyclusters. extensive follow-up observations with chandra/acis led to threeadditional macs cluster candidates being eliminated as (predominantly) x-raypoint sources. for another four clusters --- which, however, remain in oursample of 34 --- the point-source contamination was found to be about 50%. themedian x-ray luminosity of 1.3x10^45 erg/s (0.1-2.4 kev, chandra, within r_500)of the clusters in this subsample demonstrates the power of the macs surveystrategy to find the most extreme and rarest clusters out to significantredshift. a comparison of the optical and x-ray data for all clusters in thisrelease finds a wide range of morphologies with no obvious bias in favour ofeither relaxed or merging systems.

1009.1163	the morphology-density relation of galaxies around macsj0717.5+3745	we use an 18' x 9' mosaic of acs images covering the entire large-scalestructure around the x-ray luminous cluster macsj0717.5 (z=0.545) to study themorphology of galaxies at the cluster redshift. we find the global fraction ofmorphological types of galaxies to be consistent with results in theliterature. interestingly, we find that the fraction of s0s also correlateswith local galaxy density, in contrast to the findings of a study of the coresof 10 clusters at similar redshift by dressler et al. we suggest that thisapparent inconsistency is due to differences in the spatial coverage aroundclusters, which is supported by the fact that the correlation disappears fors0s within a radius of 0.6r_200 of macsj0717. we interpret this result asevidence of the morphology-density relation being caused by a combination ofmorphological transformation triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions, andeffects related to the formation and evolution of large-scale structure. inenvironments of low to intermediate density, where galaxy-galaxy interactionsare frequent and efficient, the observed pronounced morphology-density relationfor s0s reflects the density dependence of the interaction cross section. inclusters, however, the correlation disappears for s0s, as the much highergalaxy velocities in clusters not only lower the interaction cross section, butalso cause a spatial redistribution of galaxies that all but destroys such acorrelation. this argument does not hold for elliptical galaxies in clusterswhich, having formed much earlier, have settled into the large-scale clusterpotential; hence the morphology-density relation for cluster ellipticals mayreflect primarily the state of advanced dynamical relaxation of this populationwithin the cluster rather than a causal link to the environment responsible forthe morphological transformation of galaxies.

1012.3214	measuring the dark flow with public x-ray cluster data	we present new results on the "dark flow" from a measurement of the dipole inthe distribution of peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters, applying themethodology proposed and developed by us earlier. our latest measurement isconducted using new, low-noise 7-yr wmap data as well as an all-sky sample ofx-ray selected galaxy clusters compiled exclusively from published catalogs.our analysis of the cmb signature of the kinematic sunyaev-zeldovich (sz)effect finds a statistically significant dipole at the location of galaxyclusters. the residual dipole outside the cluster regions is small, renderingour overall measurement 3-4 sigma significant. the amplitude of the dipolecorrelates with cluster properties, being larger for the most x-ray luminousclusters, as required if the signal is produced by the sz effect. since it ismeasured at zero monopole, the dipole can not be due to the thermal sz effect.our results are consistent with those obtained earlier by us from 5-yr wmapdata and using a proprietary cluster catalog. in addition, they are robust toquadrupole removal, demonstrating that quadrupole leakage contributesnegligibly to the signal. the lower noise of the 7-yr wmap also allows us, forthe first time, to obtain tentative empirical confirmation of our earlierconjecture that the adopted filtering flips the sign of the ksz effect forrealistic clusters and thus of the deduced direction of the flow. the latter isconsistent with our earlier measurement in both the amplitude and direction.assuming the filtering indeed flips the sign of the ksz effect from theclusters, the direction agrees well also with the results of independent workusing galaxies as tracers at lower distances. we make all maps and clustertemplates derived by us from public data available to the scientific communityto allow independent tests of our method and findings.

0709.4294	new constraints on dark energy from the observed growth of the most  x-ray luminous galaxy clusters	we present constraints on the mean matter density, omega_m, the normalizationof the density fluctuation power spectrum, sigma_8, and the dark-energyequation-of-state parameter, w, obtained from measurements of the x-rayluminosity function of the largest known galaxy clusters at redshifts z&lt;0.7, ascompiled in the massive cluster survey (macs) and the local bcs and reflexgalaxy cluster samples. our analysis employs an observed mass-luminosityrelation, calibrated by hydrodynamical simulations, including corrections fornon-thermal pressure support and accounting for the presence of intrinsicscatter. conservative allowances for all known systematic uncertainties areincluded, as are standard priors on the hubble constant and mean baryondensity. we find omega_m=0.28 +0.11 -0.07 and sigma_8=0.78 +0.11 -0.13 for aspatially flat, cosmological-constant model, and omega_m=0.24 +0.15 -0.07,sigma_8=0.85 +0.13 -0.20 and w=-1.4 +0.4 -0.7 for a flat, constant-w model.future work improving our understanding of redshift evolution and observationalbiases affecting the mass--x-ray luminosity relation have the potential tosignificantly tighten these constraints. our results are consistent with thosefrom recent analyses of type ia supernovae, cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies, the x-ray gas mass fraction of relaxed galaxy clusters, baryonacoustic oscillations and cosmic shear. combining the new x-ray luminosityfunction data with current supernova, cosmic microwave background and clustergas fraction data yields the improved constraints omega_m=0.269 +- 0.016,sigma_8=0.82 +- 0.03 and w=-1.02 +- 0.06.

1109.3301	strong lensing by a node of the cosmic web. the core of macs  j0717.5+3745 at z=0.55	we present results of a strong-lensing analysis of macs j0717.5+3745(hereafter macs j0717), an extremely x-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=0.55.observations at different wavelengths reveal a complex and dynamically veryactive cluster, whose core is connected to a large scale filament extended overseveral mpc. using multi-passband imaging data obtained with the hubble spacetelescope advanced camera for surveys (acs), we identify 15 multiply imagedsystems across the full field of view of acs, five of which we confirmedspectroscopically in groundbased follow-up observations with the kecktelescope. we use these multiply imaged systems to constrain a parametric modelof the mass distribution in the cluster core, employing a new parallelizedversion of the lenstool software. the main result is that the most probabledescription of the mass distribution comprises four cluster-scale dark matterhaloes. the total mass distribution follows the light distribution but stronglydeviates from the distribution of the intra-cluster gas as traced by the x-raysurface brightness. this confirms the complex morphology proposed by previousstudies. we interpret this segregation of collisional and collisionless matteras strong evidence of multiple mergers and ongoing dynamical activity. macsj0717 thus constitutes one of the most disturbed clusters presently known and,featuring a projected mass within the acs field of view (r=150"=960 kpc) of2.11 +- 0.23 x 10^{15} m_{sun}, the system is also one of the most massiveknown.

1202.0717	measuring bulk motion of x-ray clusters via the kinematic  sunyaev-zeldovich effect: summarizing the "dark flow" evidence and its  implications	in this review we present a comprehensive discussion of peculiar velocityfield measured recently on very large scales with a novel method using x-raygalaxy clusters as tracers. the measurement is based on the kinematic componentof the sunyaev-zeldovich (ksz) effect produced by compton scattering of cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) photons off the hot intracluster gas, and uses alarge catalog of x-ray selected clusters and all-sky cmb maps obtained with thewmap satellite. the method probes the dipole of the cmb temperature fieldevaluated at the cluster positions and within the apertures in which the cmbmonopole contribution vanishes, thereby isolating the signal remaining from theksz effect produced by coherently moving clusters. the detection of a highlysignificant dipole out to the depth of at least ~ 800 mpc casts doubt on thenotion that gravitational instability from the observed mass distribution isthe sole -- or even dominant -- cause of the detected motions. rather itappears that the flow may extend across the entire observable universe.possible implications include the possibility to constrain the primevalpreinflationary structure of space-time and its landscape, and/or the need formodifications of presently known physics (e.g. arising from ahigher-dimensional structure of gravity). we review these possibilities inlight of the measurements described here and specifically discuss the prospectsof future measurements and the issues they should resolve. we address theconsistency of these large-scale velocity measurements with those obtained onsmaller scales by studies using galaxies as tracers, and resolve thediscrepancies with two recent claims based on modified cmb analysis schemes.

1206.6102	discovery of radio halos and double-relics in distant macs galaxy  clusters: clues to the efficiency of particle acceleration	we have performed 323 mhz observations with the giant metrewave radiotelescope of the most promising candidates selected from the macs catalog. theaim of the work is to extend our knowledge of the radio halo and relicpopulations to z&gt;0.3, the epoch in which massive clusters formed. inmacsj1149.5+2223 and macsj1752.1+4440, we discovered two double-relic systemswith a radio halo, and in macsj0553.4-3342 we found a radio halo. archival verylarge array observations and westerbork synthesis radio telescope observationshave been used to study the polarization and spectral index properties. theradio halo in macsj1149.5+2223 has the steepest spectrum ever found so far inthese objects (alpha &gt; 2). the double relics in macsj1149.5+2223 are peculiarin their position that is misaligned with the main merger axis. the relics arepolarized up to 30% and 40% in macsj1149.5+2223 and macsj1752.040+44,respectively. in both cases, the magnetic field is roughly aligned with therelics' main axes. the spectra in the relics in macsj1752.040+44 steepentowards the cluster centre, in agreement with model expectations. x-ray data onmacsj0553.4-3342 suggests that this cluster is undergoing a major merger, withthe merger axis close to the plane of the sky. the cores of the disruptedclusters have just passed each other, but no radio relic is detected in thissystem. if turbulence is responsible for the radio emission, we argue that itmust develop before the core passage. a comparison of double relic plus halosystem with cosmological simulations allows a simultaneous estimate of theacceleration efficiencies at shocks (to produce relics) and of turbulence (toproduce the halo).

1209.5741	hubble space telescope h-alpha imaging of star-forming galaxies at z =  1-1.5: evolution in the size and luminosity of giant hii regions	we present hst/wfc3 narrowband imaging of the h-alpha emission in a sample ofeight gravitationally-lensed galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5. the magnification causedby the foreground clusters enables us to obtain a median source plane spatialresolution of 360pc, as well as providing magnifications in flux ranging from~10x to ~50x. this enables us to identify resolved star-forming hii regions atthis epoch and therefore study their h-alpha luminosity distributions forcomparisons with equivalent samples at z ~ 2 and in the local universe. we findevolution in the both luminosity and surface brightness of hii regions withredshift. the distribution of clump properties can be quantified with an hiiregion luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with an exponentialbreak at some cut-off, and we find that the cut-off evolves with redshift. wetherefore conclude that `clumpy' galaxies are seen at high redshift because ofthe evolution of the cut-off mass; the galaxies themselves follow similarscaling relations to those at z = 0, but their hii regions are larger andbrighter and thus appear as clumps which dominate the morphology of the galaxy.a simple theoretical argument based on gas collapsing on scales of the jeansmass in a marginally unstable disk shows that the clumpy morphologies of high-zgalaxies are driven by the competing effects of higher gas fractions causingperturbations on larger scales, partially compensated by higher epicyclicfrequencies which stabilise the disk.

1211.4345	cosmic microwave background filters and the dark-flow measurement	recent measurements of large-scale peculiar velocities from the cumulativekinematic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect using wmap data and x-ray selected clustersfrom rosat have identified a bulk flow of galaxy clusters at $\sim 600-1,000$km s$^{-1}$ on scales of $\sim0.5-1$ gpc, roughly aligned with the all-skycosmic microwave background (cmb) dipole. the flow is inferred from thedetection of a residual dipole generated by cmb fluctuations exclusively in thedirection of galaxy clusters, and measured within apertures containing zeromonopole. consistent with this interpretation, the amplitude of the dipolecorrelates with the x-ray luminosity of the clusters. to enable thismeasurement, the cmb data need to be filtered to remove the primary cmb,thereby increasing the data's signal-to-noise ratio. filtering cannot imprint asignal with the mentioned properties at cluster positions; however, aninadequately designed filter can greatly suppress such a signal. we show herethat recent studies that failed to detect a large-scale flow with variousfilters indeed adopted flawed implementations; when correctly implemented,these alternative filters lead to results that are in fact consistent with thedark flow signal. the discrepancies can be traced to the likely presence ofresidual dipoles caused by the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect, toassumptions about cluster profiles incompatible with the data as well asfailure to compute dipoles at the zero monopole aperture. planck maps, withtheir large frequency coverage and a 217 ghz channel, will be instrumental toprobe bulk flows, to remove spurious dipole signals and to help identifyfiltering schemes appropriate for this measurement.

1211.5606	the rapid evolution of agn feedback in brightest cluster galaxies:  switching from quasar-mode to radio-mode feedback	we present an analysis of the 2-10 kev x-ray emission associated with theactive galactic nuclei (agns) in brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). our sampleconsists of 32 bcgs that lie in highly x-ray luminous cluster of galaxies(l_x-ray (0.1-2.4 kev) &gt; 3*10^44 erg/s) in which agn-jetted outflows arecreating and sustaining clear xray cavities. our sample covers the redshiftrange 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 and reveals strong evolution in the nuclear x-rayluminosities, such that the black holes in these systems have become on averageat least 10 times fainter over the last 5 gyrs. mindful of potential selectioneffects, we propose two possible scenarios to explain our results: 1) eitherthat the agns in bcgs with x-ray cavities are steadily becoming fainter, ormore likely, 2) that the fraction of these bcgs with radiatively efficientnuclei is decreasing with time from roughly 60 per cent at z=0.6 to 30 per centat z=0.1. based on this strong evolution, we predict that a significantfraction of bcgs in z=1 clusters may host quasars at their centres, potentiallycomplicating the search for such clusters at high redshift. in analogy withblack-hole binaries and based on the observed eddington ratios of our sources,we further propose that the evolving agn population in bcgs with x-ray cavitiesmay be transiting from a canonical low/hard state, analogous to that of x-raybinaries, to a quiescent state over the last 5 gyrs.

1405.1033	star formation in shocked cluster spirals and their tails	recent observations of ram pressure stripped spiral galaxies in clustersrevealed details of the stripping process, i.e., the truncation of allinterstellar medium (ism) phases and of star formation (sf) in the disk, andmultiphase star-forming tails. some stripped galaxies, in particular in mergingclusters, develop spectacular star-forming tails, giving them a jellyfish-likeappearance. in merging clusters, merger shocks in the intra-cluster medium(icm) are thought to have overrun these galaxies, enhancing the ambient icmpressure and thus triggering sf, gas stripping and tail formation. we presentidealised hydrodynamical simulations of this scenario, including standarddescriptions for sf and stellar feedback. to aid the interpretation of recentand upcoming observations, we focus on particular structures and dynamics in sfpatterns in the remaining gas disk and in the near tails, which are easiest toobserve. the observed jellyfish morphology is qualitatively reproduced for,both, face-on and edge-on stripping. in edge-on stripping, the interplaybetween the icm wind and the disk rotation leads to asymmetries along the icmwind direction and perpendicular to it. the apparent tail is still part of ahighly deformed gaseous and young stellar disk. in both geometries, sf takesplace in knots throughout the tail, such that the stars in the tails show noordered age gradients. significant sf enhancement in the disk occurs only atradii where the gas will be stripped in due course.

1405.3303	mass and magnification maps for the hubble space telescope frontier  fields clusters: implications for high redshift studies	extending over three hubble space telescope (hst) cycles, the hubble frontierfields (hff) initiative constitutes the largest commitment ever of hst time tothe exploration of the distant universe via gravitational lensing by massivegalaxy clusters. we here present models of the mass distribution in the six hffcluster lenses, derived from a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis anchoredby a total of 88 multiple-image systems identified in existing hst data. theresulting maps of the projected mass distribution and of the gravitationalmagnification effectively calibrate the hff clusters as gravitationaltelescopes. allowing the computation of search areas in the source plane, thesemaps are provided to the community to facilitate the exploitation offorthcoming hff data for quantitative studies of the gravitationally lensedpopulation of background galaxies. our models of the gravitationalmagnification afforded by the hff clusters allow us to quantify thelensing-induced boost in sensitivity over blank-field observations and predictthat galaxies at $z&gt;10$ and as faint as m(ab)=32 will be detectable, up to 2magnitudes fainter than the limit of the hubble ultra deep field.

0705.1720	separation of the visible and dark matter in the einstein ring lbg  j213512.73-010143	we model the mass distribution in the recently discovered einstein ring lbgj213512.73-010143 (the `cosmic eye') using archival hubble space telescopeimaging. we reconstruct the mass density profile of the z=0.73 lens and thesurface brightness distribution of the z=3.07 source and find that the observedring is best fit with a dual-component lens model consisting of a baryonicsersic component nested within a dark matter halo. the dark matter halo has aninner slope of 1.42+/-0.23, consistent with cdm simulations after allowing forbaryon contraction. the baryonic component has a b-band mass-to-light ratio of1.71+0.28-0.38 (solar units) which when evolved to the present day is inagreement with local ellipticals. within the einstein radius of 0.77'' (5.6kpc), the baryons account for (46+/-11)% of the total lens mass. external shearfrom a nearby foreground cluster is accurately predicted by the model. thereconstructed surface brightness distribution in the source plane clearly showstwo peaks. through a generalisation of our lens inversion method, we concludethat the redshifts of both peaks are consistent with each other, suggestingthat we are seeing structure within a single galaxy.

1502.06707	constraining the redshift evolution of the cosmic microwave background  black-body temperature with planck data	we constrain the deviation of adiabatic evolution of the universe using thedata on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature anisotropies measuredby the {\it planck} satellite and a sample of 481 x-ray selected clusters withspectroscopically measured redshifts. to avoid antenna beam effects, we bringall the maps to the same resolution. we use a cmb template to subtract thecosmological signal while preserving the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (tsz)anisotropies; next, we remove galactic foreground emissions around each clusterand we mask out all known point sources. if the cmb black-body temperaturescales with redshift as $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$, we constrain deviations ofadiabatic evolution to be $\alpha=-0.007\pm 0.013$, consistent with thetemperature-redshift relation of the standard cosmological model. this resultcould suffer from a potential bias $\delta\alpha$ associated with the cmbtemplate, that we quantify it to be $|\delta\alpha|\le 0.02$ and with the samesign than the measured value of $\alpha$, but is free from those biasesassociated with using tsz selected clusters; it represents the best constraintto date of the temperature-redshift relation of the big-bang model using onlycmb data, confirming previous results.

1505.05560	frontier fields clusters: chandra and jvla view of the pre-merging  cluster macs j0416.1-2403	merging galaxy clusters leave long-lasting signatures on the baryonic andnon-baryonic cluster constituents, including shock fronts, cold fronts, x-raysubstructure, radio halos, and offsets between the dark matter and the gascomponents. using observations from chandra, the jansky very large array, thegiant metrewave radio telescope, and the hubble space telescope, we present amultiwavelength analysis of the merging frontier fields cluster macsj0416.1-2403 (z=0.396), which consists of a ne and a sw subclusters whose coresare separated on the sky by ~250 kpc. we find that the ne subcluster has acompact core and hosts an x-ray cavity, yet it is not a cool core.approximately 450 kpc south-south west of the sw subcluster, we detect adensity discontinuity that corresponds to a compression factor of ~1.5. thediscontinuity was most likely caused by the interaction of the sw subclusterwith a less massive structure detected in the lensing maps sw of thesubcluster's center. for both the ne and the sw subclusters, the dark matterand the gas components are well-aligned, suggesting that macs j0416.1-2403 is apre-merging system. the cluster also hosts a radio halo, which is unusual for apre-merging system. the halo has a 1.4 ghz power of (1.06 +/- 0.09) x 10^{24} whz^{-1}, which is somewhat lower than expected based on the x-ray luminosity ofthe cluster. we suggest that we are either witnessing the birth of a radiohalo, or have discovered a rare ultra-steep spectrum halo.

1509.02536	radio halos in sz-selected clusters of galaxies: the making of a halo?	radio halos are synchrotron radio sources detected in some massive galaxyclusters. their mpc-size indicates that (re)acceleration processes are takingplace in the host cluster. x-ray catalogues of galaxy clusters have been usedin the past to search for radio halos and to understand their connection withcluster-cluster mergers and with the thermal component of the intra-clustermedium. more recently, the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect has been proven to be abetter route to search for massive clusters in a wider redshift range. with theaim of discovering new radio halos and understanding their connection withcluster-cluster mergers, we have selected from the planck early source catalogthe most massive clusters, and we have observed with the giant metrewave radiotelescope at 323 mhz those objects for which deep observations were notavailable. we have discovered new peculiar radio emission in three of theobserved clusters finding: (i) a radio halo in the cluster rxcj0949.8+1708;(ii) extended emission in abell 1443 that we classify as a radio halo plus aradio relic, with a bright filament embedded in the radio halo; (iii) low-powerradio emission is found in ciza j1938.3+5409 which is ten times below the radio- x-ray correlation, and represents the first direct detection of the radioemission in the "upper-limit" region of the radio - x-ray diagram. we discussthe properties of these new radio halos in the framework of theoretical modelsfor the radio emission.

1512.00846	flash spectroscopy: emission lines from the ionized circumstellar  material around $&lt;10$-day-old type ii supernovae	supernovae (sne) embedded in dense circumstellar material (csm) may showprominent emission lines in their early-time spectra ($\leq 10$ days after theexplosion), owing to recombination of the csm ionized by the shock-breakoutflash. from such spectra ("flash spectroscopy"), we can measure variousphysical properties of the csm, as well as the mass-loss rate of the progenitorduring the year prior to its explosion. searching through the palomar transientfactory (ptf and iptf) sn spectroscopy databases from 2009 through 2014, wefound 12 type ii sne showing flash-ionized (fi) signatures in their firstspectra. all are younger than 10 days. these events constitute 14\% of all 84sne in our sample having a spectrum within 10 days from explosion, and 18\% ofsne~ii observed at ages $&lt;5$ days, thereby setting lower limits on the fractionof fi events. we classified as "blue/featureless" (bf) those events having afirst spectrum which is similar to that of a black body, without any emissionor absorption signatures. it is possible that some bf events had fi signaturesat an earlier phase than observed, or that they lack dense csm around theprogenitor. within 2 days after explosion, 8 out of 11 sne in our sample areeither bf events or show fi signatures. interestingly, we found that 19 out of21 sne brighter than an absolute magnitude $m_r=-18.2$ belong to the fi or bfgroups, and that all fi events peaked above $m_r=-17.6$ mag, significantlybrighter than average sne~ii.

astro-ph;0003191	the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs) - iv. the extended sample	we present a low-flux extension of the x-ray selected rosat brightest clustersample (bcs) published in paper i of this series. like the original bcs andemploying an identical selection procedure, the bcs extension is compiled fromrosat all-sky survey (rass) data in the northern hemisphere (dec &gt; 0 deg) andat high galactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 20 deg). it comprises 100 x-ray selectedclusters of galaxies with measured redshifts z &lt; 0.3 (as well as seven more atz &gt; 0.3) and total fluxes between 2.8 x 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 and 4.4 x 10-12 ergcm-2 s-1 in the 0.1-2.4 kev band (the latter value being the flux limit of theoriginal bcs). the extension can be combined with the main sample published in1998 to form the homogeneously selected extended bcs (ebcs), the largest andstatistically best understood cluster sample to emerge from the rosat all-skysurvey to date.  the nominal completeness of the combined sample (defined with respect to apower law fit to the bright end of the bcs log n-log s distribution) isrelatively low at 75 per cent (compared to 90 per cent for the high-flux sampleof paper i). however, just as for the original bcs, this incompleteness can beaccurately quantified, and thus statistically corrected for, as a function ofx-ray luminosity and redshift.  in addition to its importance for improved statistical studies of theproperties of clusters in the local universe, the low-flux extension of the bcsis also intended to serve as a finding list for x-ray bright clusters in thenorthern hemisphere which we hope will prove useful in the preparation ofcluster observations with the next generation of x-ray telescopes such aschandra or xmm-newton.

astro-ph;0009101	macs: a quest for the most massive galaxy clusters in the universe	we describe the design and current status of a new x-ray cluster survey aimedat the compilation of a statistically complete sample of very x-ray luminous(and thus, by inference, massive), distant clusters of galaxies. the primarygoal of the massive cluster survey (macs) is to increase the number of knownmassive clusters at z&gt;0.3 from a handful to hundreds. upon completion of thesurvey, the macs cluster sample will greatly improve our ability to studyquantitatively the physical and cosmological parameters driving clusterevolution at redshifts and luminosities poorly sampled by all existing surveys.  to achieve these goals we apply an x-ray flux and x-ray hardness-ratio cut toselect distant cluster candidates from the rosat bright source catalogue.starting from a list of more than 5,000 x-ray sources within the survey area of22,735 square degrees we use positional cross-correlations with publiccatalogues of galactic and extragalactic objects, reference to apm colours,visual inspection of digitized sky survey images, extensive ccd imaging, andfinally spectroscopic observations with the university of hawaii's 2.2m and thekeck 10m telescopes to compile the final cluster sample.  we discuss in detail the x-ray selection procedure and the resultingselection function, and present model predictions for the number of distantclusters expected to emerge from macs. at the time of this writing the macscluster sample comprises 101 spectroscopically confirmed clusters at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6;more than two thirds of these are new discoveries. our preliminary sample isalready 15 times larger than that of the emss in the same redshift and x-rayluminosity range.

astro-ph;0304257	the nature and space density of fossil groups of galaxies	we describe the properties of a sample of galaxy groups with very unusualdistributions of galaxy luminosities. the most extreme example has an x-rayluminosity similar to that of the virgo cluster but has a very low richness,with only one galaxy brighter than l*, compared with six in virgo. that onegalaxy, however, is optically more luminous than any galaxy in virgo and has anoptical luminosity as bright as many of the central cd galaxies in rich abellclusters. the characteristic feature of the fossil groups we study is that mostof the light arises from one dominant, central galaxy. we define a fossilsystem and, based on this definition, construct a small x-ray selected,flux-limited sample of fossil groups with well known selection criteria. weconfirm that these systems are indeed groups of galaxies, but dominated by onecentral luminous giant elliptical galaxy and with few, or no, l* galaxies. wefind that fossil systems represent 8%-20% of all systems of the same x-rayluminosity. fossil groups are at least as numerous as all poor and richclusters combined, and are thus a possible site for the formation of luminouscentral cluster galaxies before infall into clusters occurs. the fossil systemsin our sample have significantly higher x-ray luminosities than normal groupsof similar total optical luminosities (or similar x-ray temperature, where thelatter can be measured). these enhanced x-ray luminosities may be due torelatively cool gas in the innermost regions or due to a low central gasentropy. we interpret fossil groups as old, undisturbed systems which haveavoided infall into clusters, but where galaxy merging of most of the l*galaxies has occurred. an early formation epoch, before that of most groups,could explain low central gas entropies and high x-ray luminosities.

astro-ph;0403521	an xmm-newton observation of the massive, relaxed galaxy cluster  clj1226.9+3332 at z=0.89	a detailed x-ray analysis of an xmm-newton observation of the high-redshift(z=0.89) galaxy cluster clj1226.9+3332 is presented. the x-ray temperature isfound to be 11.5{+1.1}{-0.9}kev, the highest x-ray temperature of any clusterat z&gt;0.6. in contrast to ms1054-0321, the only other very hot cluster currentlyknown at z&gt;0.8, clj1226.9+3332 features a relaxed x-ray morphology, and itshigh overall gas temperature is not caused by one or several hot spots. thesystem thus constitutes a unique example of a high redshift, high temperature,relaxed cluster, for which the usual hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, andthe x-ray mass is most reliable. a temperature profile is constructed (for thefirst time at this redshift) and is consistent with the cluster beingisothermal out to 45% of the virial radius. within the virial radius(corresponding to a measured overdensity of a factor of 200), a total mass of(1.4+/-0.5)*10^15 m_solar is derived, with a gas mass fraction of 12+/-5%. thebolometric x-ray luminosity is (5.3+/-0.2)*10^45 erg/s. the probabilities offinding a cluster of this mass within the volume of the discovery x-ray surveyare 8*10^{-5} for omega_m=1 and 0.64 for omega_m=0.3, making omega_m=1 highlyunlikely. the entropy profile suggests that entropy evolution is beingobserved. the metal abundance (of z=0.33{+0.14}{-0.10} z_solar), gas massfraction, and gas distribution are consistent with those of local clusters;thus the bulk of the metals were in place by z=0.89.

astro-ph;0503455	the evolution of the cluster x-ray scaling relations in the warps sample  at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0	the x-ray properties of a sample of 11 high-redshift (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0) clustersobserved with chandra and/or xmm are used to investigate the evolution of thecluster scaling relations. the observed evolution of the l-t and m-l relationsis consistent with simple self-similar predictions, in which the properties ofclusters reflect the properties of the universe at their redshift ofobservation. when the systematic effect of assuming isothermality on thederived masses of the high-redshift clusters is taken into account, thehigh-redshift m-t and mgas-t relations are also consistent with self-similarevolution. under the assumption that the model of self-similar evolution iscorrect and that the local systems formed via a single spherical collapse, thehigh-redshift l-t relation is consistent with the high-z clusters having formedat a significantly higher redshift than the local systems. the data are alsoconsistent with the more realistic scenario of clusters forming via thecontinuous accretion of material. the slope of the l-t relation athigh-redshift (b=3.29+/-0.38) is consistent with the local relation, andsignificantly steeper then the self-similar prediction of b=2. this suggeststhat the non-gravitational processes causing the steepening occurred at z&gt;1 orin the early stages of the clusters' formation, prior to their observation. theproperties of the intra-cluster medium at high-redshift are found to be similarto those in the local universe. the mean surface-brightness profile slope forthe sample is 0.66+/-0.05, the mean gas mass fractions within r2500 and r200are 0.073+/-0.010 and 0.12+/-0.02 respectively, and the mean metallicity of thesample is 0.28+/-0.16 solar.

astro-ph;0601306	asmooth: a simple and efficient algorithm for adaptive kernel smoothing  of two-dimensional imaging data	an efficient algorithm for adaptive kernel smoothing (aks) of two-dimensionalimaging data has been developed and implemented using the interactive datalanguage (idl). the functional form of the kernel can be varied (top-hat,gaussian etc.) to allow different weighting of the event counts registeredwithin the smoothing region. for each individual pixel the algorithm increasesthe smoothing scale until the signal-to-noise ratio (s.n.r.) within the kernelreaches a preset value. thus, noise is suppressed very efficiently, while atthe same time real structure, i.e. signal that is locally significant at theselected s.n.r. level, is preserved on all scales. in particular, extendedfeatures in noise-dominated regions are visually enhanced. the asmoothalgorithm differs from other aks routines in that it allows a quantitativeassessment of the goodness of the local signal estimation by producingadaptively smoothed images in which all pixel values share the samesignal-to-noise ratio above the background.  we apply asmooth to both real observational data (an x-ray image of clustersof galaxies obtained with the chandra x-ray observatory) and to a simulateddata set. we find the asmoothed images to be fair representations of the inputdata in the sense that the residuals are consistent with pure noise, i.e. theypossess poissonian variance and a near-gaussian distribution around a mean ofzero, and are spatially uncorrelated.

astro-ph;0609782	truncation of galaxy dark matter halos in high density environments	our aim is to constrain the properties of dark matter halos inhabiting highdensity environments, such as is the case in massive galaxy clusters. we usegalaxy-galaxy lensing techniques that utilize a maximum likelihood method toconstrain the parameters of the lenses. it has been demonstrated that such atechnique provides strong constraints on the parameters that characterize agalaxy halo, as well as on the aperture mass of these halos. in this analysis,we only use weak shear data and do not include strong lensing constraints. wepresent the results of a study of galaxy-galaxy lensing in a homogeneous sampleof massive x-ray luminous clusters at z~0.2. these have been observed in threebands with the cfh12k instrument. we find dark matter halos in these clustersto be compact compared to those inferred around isolated field galaxies ofequivalent luminosity at this redshift: the half mass radius is found to besmaller than 50 kpc, with a mean total mass of order 0.2 10^{12} m_sun. this isin good agreement with previous galaxy-galaxy lensing results and withnumerical simulations, in particular with the tidal stripping scenario. we thusprovide a strong confirmation of tidal truncation from a homogeneous sample ofgalaxy clusters. moreover, it is the first time that cluster galaxies areprobed successfully using galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques from ground baseddata.

astro-ph;9507092	a 2572 and hcg 94 - galaxy clusters but not as we know them. an x-ray  case study of optical misclassifications	we present the results of a spectral-imaging analysis of x-ray data obtainedwith the position sensitive proportional counter aboard the rosat observatoryin a 32 ks pointed observation of hickson's compact group (hcg) #94. besideshcg94, a2572, a richness class 0 abell cluster, is also contained in thecentral region of the field of view.  both systems are at a redshift of z~0.04 and are falling toward each other ata velocity of about 1000 km/s. their three-dimensional spatial separation isprobably of the order of an abell radius; however, as yet, no clear signs ofdynamical interaction are discernible in the x-ray.  we find hcg94's gas temperature and unabsorbed x-ray luminosity to be far toohigh for a galaxy group thereby confirming the claim of ebeling, voges &amp;b"ohringer (1994) that hcg94 should be classified as a galaxy cluster. theopposite is true for the abell cluster a2572, the optical richness of which hasbeen overestimated due to the inclusion of hcg94. in the x-ray, a2572 appearsat first sight like the prototypical binary cluster with two equally massiveand x-ray bright subclusters in the process of merging. however, the availablex-ray, optical, and radio data strongly suggest that a2572 proper is in factmerely a loose group of galaxies, while the second component is a much richerand more distant cluster seen in superposition.  a deprojection analysis shows hcg94 to host a moderate cooling flow; thispicture is supported by a radial increase in the column density of absorbingmaterial and a decrease in the gas temperature toward the cluster centre.hcg94's total gravitating mass is much higher than what could be anticipatedfrom its appearance in the optical. our findings hence underline the need for

astro-ph;9608200	the warps x-ray survey of galaxies, groups and clusters i: method and  first results	we have embarked on a survey of rosat pspc archival data with the aim ofdetecting all significant surface brightness enhancements due to sources in theinnermost 15 arcmin of the pspc field of view (0.5-2.0 kev). this project ispart of the wide angle rosat pointed survey (warps) and is designed primarilyto measure the low luminosity, high redshift, x-ray luminosity function ofgalaxy clusters and groups. the approach we have chosen for source detection[voronoi tessellation and percolation (vtp)] represents a significant advanceover conventional methods and is particularly suited for the detection andaccurate quantification of extended and/or low surface brightness emission. inan extensive optical follow-up programme we are identifying galaxies, groupsand clusters at redshifts ranging from z~0.1 to z~0.7. we present first resultsfor an initial 17.2 deg^2 at detected fluxes &gt; 3.5 x 10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2. wefind the sky density of extended objects to be in the range 2.8 to 4.0 (+- 0.4)deg^-2. a comparison with a point source detection algorithm demonstrates thatour vtp approach typically finds 1-2 more objects deg^-2 to this detected fluxlimit. the surface brightness limit of the warps cluster survey is ~1x10^-15erg sec^-1 cm^-2 arcmin^-2, approximately 6 times lower than the emss. thewarps logn-logs shows a significant excess over previous measurements for s &gt; 8x 10^-14 erg sec^-1 cm^-2.

astro-ph;9709189	the warps survey - ii: the log(n)-log(s) relation and the x-ray  evolution of low luminosity clusters of galaxies	x-ray selected surveys of clusters of galaxies can distinguish betweenhierarchical models of the growth of structure in the universe. here we presentthe first results from an x-ray selected, flux and surface brightness limiteddeep survey for high redshift clusters and groups of galaxies based on rosatpspc pointed data. the log(n)-log(s) relation of all clusters in this survey isconsistent with that from most previous surveys but occupies a flux range notpreviously covered. at high redshifts (z&gt;0.3) the cluster luminosities are inthe range 4e43 to 2e44 erg/s, the luminosities of poor clusters. the number ofhigh redshift, low luminosity clusters is consistent with no evolution of thex-ray luminosity function between redshifts of z=0.4 and z=0, and places alimit of a factor of &lt;1.7 (at 90% confidence) on the amplitude of any purenegative density evolution of clusters of these luminosities, in contrast withthe factor of approx 3 (corresponding to number density evolution proportionalto (1+z)^{-2.5}) found in the emss survey at similar redshifts but higherluminosities. taken together, these results support hierarchical models inwhich there is mild negative evolution of the most luminous clusters at highredshift but little or no evolution of the less luminous but more common,optically poor clusters. models involving preheating of the x-ray gas at anearly epoch fit the observations, at least for omega_0=1.

astro-ph;9812394	the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs) - i. the compilation of the  sample and the cluster log n-log s distribution	we present a 90 per cent flux-complete sample of the 201 x-ray brightestclusters of galaxies in the northern hemisphere (dec &gt; 0 deg), at high galacticlatitudes (|b| &gt; 20 deg), with measured redshifts z &lt; 0.3 and fluxes higherthan 4.4 x 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^{-1) in the 0.1-2.4 kev band. the sample,called the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs), is selected from rosat all-skysurvey data and is the largest x-ray selected cluster sample compiled to date.in addition to abell clusters, which form the bulk of the sample, the bcs alsocontains the x-ray brightest zwicky clusters and other clusters selected fromtheir x-ray properties alone. effort has been made to ensure the highestpossible completeness of the sample and the smallest possible contamination bynon-cluster x-ray sources. x-ray fluxes are computed using an algorithmtailored for the detection and characterization of x-ray emission from galaxyclusters. these fluxes are accurate to better than 15 per cent (mean 1 sigmaerror).  we find the cumulative log n-log s distribution of clusters to follow a powerlaw k s^(-alpha) with alpha=1.31 (+0.06)(-0.03) (errors are the 10th and 90thpercentiles) down to fluxes of 2 x 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1), i.e.considerably below the bcs flux limit. although our best-fitting slopedisagrees formally with the canonical value of -1.5 for a euclideandistribution, the bcs log n-log s distribution is consistent with anon-evolving cluster population if cosmological effects are taken into account.

astro-ph;9903057	the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs): -- iii. optical spectra of the  central cluster galaxies	we present new spectra of dominant galaxies in x-ray selected clusters, whichcombine with our previously published spectra to form a sample of 256 dominantgalaxies in 215 clusters; 177 of these are members of the rosat brightestcluster sample. 27% of the central dominant galaxies have emission-linespectra, all but 5 with line intensity ratios typical of cooling flow nebulae.a further 6% show only [nii] with h-alpha in absorption. we find no evidencefor an increase in the frequency of line emission with x-ray luminosity. purelyx-ray selected clusters at low redshift have a higher probability of containingline emission. the more h-alpha luminous galaxies have larger emission-lineregions and show a higher ratio of balmer to forbidden line emission, althoughthere is a continuous trend of ionization behaviour across four decades inh-alpha luminosity. galaxies with the more luminous line emission show asignificantly bluer continuum, whereas lower-luminosity and [nii]-only lineemitters have continua that differ little from those of non-line emittingdominant galaxies. values of the balmer decrement in the more luminous systemscommonly imply intrinsic reddening of e(b-v)~0.3, and when this is correctedfor, the excess blue light can be characterized by a population of massiveyoung stars, which can also provide sufficient photoionization to produce theobserved h-alpha luminosity. the lower h-alpha luminosity systems show a higherionization state and few massive stars, requiring instead the introduction of aharder source of photoionization.

0809.3733	a measurement of large-scale peculiar velocities of clusters of  galaxies: technical details	this paper presents detailed analysis of large-scale peculiar motions derivedfrom a sample of ~ 700 x-ray clusters and cosmic microwave background (cmb)data obtained with wmap. we use the kinematic sunyaev-zeldovich (ksz) effectcombining it into a cumulative statistic which preserves the bulk motioncomponent with the noise integrated down. such statistic is the dipole of cmbtemperature fluctuations evaluated over the pixels of the cluster catalog(kashlinsky &amp; atrio-barandela 2000). to remove the cosmological cmbfluctuations the maps are wiener-filtered in each of the eight wmap channels(q, v, w) which have negligible foreground component. our findings are asfollows: the thermal sz (tsz) component of the clusters is described well bythe navarro-frenk-white profile expected if the hot gas traces the dark matterin the cluster potential wells. such gas has x-ray temperature decreasingrapidly towards the cluster outskirts, which we demonstrate results in thedecrease of the tsz component as the aperture is increased to encompass thecluster outskirts. we then detect a statistically significant dipole in the cmbpixels at cluster positions. arising exclusively at the cluster pixels thisdipole cannot originate from the foreground or instrument noise emissions andmust be produced by the cmb photons which interacted with the hot intraclustergas via the sz effect. the dipole remains as the monopole component, due to thetsz effect, vanishes within the small statistical noise out to the maximalaperture where we still detect the tsz component. we demonstrate withsimulations that the mask and cross-talk effects are small for our catalog andcontribute negligibly to the measurements. the measured dipole thus arises fromthe ksz effect produced by the coherent large scale bulk flow motion.

astro-ph;9905321	the warps survey: iii. the discovery of an x-ray luminous galaxy cluster  at z=0.833 and the impact of x-ray substructure on cluster abundance  measurements	the warps team reviews the properties and history of discovery ofclj0152.7-1357, an x-ray luminous, rich cluster of galaxies at z=0.833. at l_x= 8 x 10^44 h^(-2) erg/s (0.5-2.0 kev) clj0152.7-1357 is the most x-rayluminous cluster known at redshifts z&gt;0.55. the high x-ray luminosity of thesystem suggests that massive clusters may begin to form at redshiftsconsiderably greater than unity. this scenario is supported by the high degreeof optical and x-ray substructure in clj0152.7-1357, which is similarly complexas that of other x-ray selected distant clusters and consistent with thepicture of cluster formation by mass infall along large-scale filaments. x-rayemission from clj0152.7-1357 was detected already in 1980 with the einsteinipc. however, because the complex morphology of the emission caused itssignificance to be underestimated, the corresponding source was not included inthe emss cluster sample and hence not previously identified. simulations of theemss source detection and selection procedure suggest a general bias of theemss against x-ray luminous clusters with pronounced substructure. if highlyunrelaxed, merging clusters are common at high redshift, they could create abias in some samples as the morphological complexity of mergers may cause themto fall below the flux limit of surveys that assume a unimodal spatial sourcegeometry. conversely, the enhanced x-ray luminosity of mergers might cause themto, temporarily, rise above the flux limit. either effect could lead toerroneous conclusions about the evolution of the comoving cluster spacedensity. a high fraction of morphologically complex clusters at high redshiftwould also call into question the validity of cosmological studies that assumethat the systems under investigation are virialized.

astro-ph;9911521	zw 1718.1-0108: a highly disturbed galaxy cluster at low galactic  latitude	we report the discovery of highly distorted x-ray emission associated withthe nearby cluster zw1718.1-0108, one of whose dominant members is the powerfulradio galaxy 3c353. this cluster has been missed by previous x-ray clustersurveys because of its low galactic latitude (b = 19.5deg), despite itsbrightness in the hard x-ray band (2-10 kev flux of 1.2e-11 erg/s/cm2). ouroptical ccd image of the central part of the cluster reveals many membergalaxies which are dimmed substantially by heavy galactic extinction. we havemeasured redshifts of three bright galaxies near the x-ray emission peak andthey are all found to be around z=0.028. the asca gis and rosat hri images showthree aligned x-ray clumps embedded in low surface-brightness x-ray emissionextended by about 30 arcmin. the averaged temperature measured with asca iskt=4.3+/-0.2 kev, which appears to be hot for the bolometric luminosity 1.1e+44erg/s, when compared to the temperature-luminosity correlation of galaxyclusters. the irregular x-ray morphology and evidence for a non-uniformtemperature distribution suggest that the system is undergoing a merger ofsubstructures. since the sizes and luminosities of the individual clumps areconsistent with those of galaxy groups, zw1718.1-0108 is interpreted as anon-going merger of galaxy groups in a dark matter halo forming a cluster ofgalaxies and thus is in a transition phase of cluster formation.

0706.0033	improved constraints on dark energy from chandra x-ray observations of  the largest relaxed galaxy clusters	we present constraints on the mean matter density, omega_m, dark energydensity, omega_de, and the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, usingchandra measurements of the x-ray gas mass fraction (fgas) in 42 hot (kt&gt;5kev),x-ray luminous, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range0.05&lt;z&lt;1.1. using only the fgas data for the 6 lowest redshift clusters atz&lt;0.15, for which dark energy has a negligible effect on the measurements, wemeasure omega_m=0.28+-0.06 (68% confidence, using standard priors on the hubbleconstant, h_0, and mean baryon density, omega_bh^2). analyzing the data for all42 clusters, employing only weak priors on h_0 and omega_bh^2, we obtain asimilar result on omega_m and detect the effects of dark energy on thedistances to the clusters at ~99.99% confidence, with omega_de=0.86+-0.21 for anon-flat lcdm model. the detection of dark energy is comparable in significanceto recent snia studies and represents strong, independent evidence for cosmicacceleration. systematic scatter remains undetected in the fgas data, despite aweighted mean statistical scatter in the distance measurements of only ~5%. fora flat cosmology with constant w, we measure omega_m=0.28+-0.06 andw=-1.14+-0.31. combining the fgas data with independent constraints from cmband snia studies removes the need for priors on omega_bh^2 and h_0 and leads totighter constraints: omega_m=0.253+-0.021 and w=-0.98+-0.07 for the sameconstant-w model. more general analyses in which we relax the assumption offlatness and/or allow evolution in w remain consistent with the cosmologicalconstant paradigm. our analysis includes conservative allowances for systematicuncertainties. the small systematic scatter and tight constraints bode well forfuture dark energy studies using the fgas method.
