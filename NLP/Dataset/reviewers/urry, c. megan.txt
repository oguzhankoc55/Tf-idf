0901.1663	do moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei suppress star formation?	the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies are thought tobe linked, but the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is stillpoorly understood. both observations and simulations of galaxy formationsuggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (agn), as the centralsupermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellarmaterial and suppresses star formation. in this letter, we show that most hostgalaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universehave intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioningfrom star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to betrue for all agn independent of obscuration. the intermediate colors suggestthat star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 myr ago. thisresult indicates that either the agn are very long-lived, accreting for morethan 1 gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a ~100 myr time delaybetween the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. thefirst explanation is unlikely given current estimates for agn lifetimes, solow-lumiosity agn must shut down star formation before substantial black holeaccretion activity is detected. the scarcity of agn host galaxies in the bluecloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation andblack hole growth are coeval. lastly, these observations also strongly supportthe `unified model' of agn as the host galaxy colors are independent ofobscuration towards the central engine.

0902.0608	the space density of compton thick agn and the x-ray background	we constrain the number density and evolution of compton-thick activegalactic nuclei (agn). in the local universe we use the wide area surveys fromthe swift and integral satellites, while for high redshifts we explorecandidate selections based on a combination of x-ray and mid-ir parameters. wefind a significantly lower space density of compton-thick agn in the localuniverse than expected from published agn population synthesis models toexplain the x-ray background. this can be explained by the numerousdegeneracies in the parameters of those models; we use the high-energy surveysdescribed here to remove those degeneracies. we show that only directobservations of ct agn can currently constrain the number of heavily-obscuredsupermassive black holes. at high redshift, the inclusion of ir-selectedcompton-thick agn candidates leads to a much higher space density, implying (a)a different (steeper) evolution for these sources compared to less-obscuredagn, (b) that the ir selection includes a large number of interlopers, and/or(c) that there is a large number of reflection-dominated agn missed in theintegral and swift observations. the contribution of ct agn to the x-raybackground is small, ~9%, with a comparable contribution to the total cosmicaccretion, unless reflection-dominated ct agn significantly outnumbertransmission-dominated ct agn, in which case their contribution can be muchhigher. using estimates derived here for the accretion luminosity over cosmictime we estimate the local mass density in supermassive black holes and find agood agreement with available constraints for an accretion efficiency of ~10%.transmission-dominated ct agn contribute only ~8% to total black hole growth.

1001.3141	galaxy zoo: the fundamentally different co-evolution of supermassive  black holes and their early- and late-type host galaxies	we use data from the sloan digital sky survey and visual classifications ofmorphology from the galaxy zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearbyuniverse (z &lt; 0.05) and to break down the agn host galaxy population by color,stellar mass and morphology. we find that black hole growth at luminositiesl_oiii &gt;1e40 erg/s in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different.agn host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses(1e10-1e11 msun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram andtheir central black holes have median masses around 1e6.5 msun. however, bycomparing early- and late-type agn host galaxies to their non-activecounterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it ispreferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that aregrowing, while late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive}blackholes that are growing. the duty cycle of agn in early-type galaxies isstrongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1e10 msun) of thered sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloudprogenitors. the duty cycle of agn in late-type galaxies on the other handpeaks in massive (1e11 msun) green and red late-types which generally do nothave a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. at high eddingtonratios (l/l_edd &gt; 0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of agnare the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. finally, the milky waylikely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the agn dutycycle of late-type galaxies is highest. we discuss the implications of theseresults for our understanding of the role of agn in the evolution of galaxies

1003.4018	the role of mergers in early-type galaxy evolution and black hole growth	models of galaxy formation invoke the major merger of gas-rich progenitorgalaxies as the trigger for significant phases of black hole growth and theassociated feedback that suppresses star formation to create red spheroidalremnants. however, the observational evidence for the connection betweenmergers and active galactic nucleus (agn) phases is not clear. we analyze asample of low-mass early-type galaxies known to be in the process of migratingfrom the blue cloud to the red sequence via an agn phase in the green valley.using deeper imaging from sdss stripe 82, we show that the fraction of objectswith major morphological disturbances is high during the early starburst phase,but declines rapidly to the background level seen in quiescent early-typegalaxies by the time of substantial agn radiation several hundred myr after thestarburst. this observation empirically links the agn activity in low-redshiftearly-type galaxies to a significant merger event in the recent past. the largetime delay between the merger-driven starburst and the peak of agn activityallows for the merger features to decay to the background and hence may explainthe weak link between merger features and agn activity in the literature.

1008.2971	dust-corrected colors reveal bimodality in agn host galaxy colors at z~1	using new, highly accurate photometric redshifts from the musyc medium-bandsurvey in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdf-s), we fit syntheticstellar population models to compare agn host galaxies to inactive galaxies at0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. we find that agn host galaxies are predominantly massivegalaxies on the red sequence and in the green valley of the color-mass diagram.because both passive and dusty galaxies can appear red in optical colors, weuse rest-frame near-infrared colors to separate passively evolving stellarpopulations from galaxies that are reddened by dust. as with the overall galaxypopulation, ~25% of the `red' agn host galaxies and ~75% of the `green' agnhost galaxies have colors consistent with young stellar populations reddened bydust. the dust-corrected rest-frame optical colors are the blue colors ofstar-forming galaxies, which implies that these agn hosts are not passivelyaging to the red sequence. at z~1, agn activity is roughly evenly split betweentwo modes of black hole growth: the first in passively evolving host galaxies,which may be heating up the galaxy's gas and preventing future episodes of starformation, and the second in dust-reddened young galaxies, which may beionizing the galaxy's interstellar medium and shutting down star formation.

1009.2501	heavily obscured agn in high redshift luminous infrared galaxies	we take advantage of the rich multi-wavelength data available in the chandradeep field south (cdf-s), including the 4 msec chandra observations (thedeepest x-ray data to date), in order to search for heavily-obscuredlow-luminosity agn among infrared-luminous galaxies. in particular, we obtaineda stacked rest-frame x-ray spectrum for samples of galaxies binned in terms oftheir ir luminosity or stellar mass. we detect a significant signal at e~1 to 8kev, which we interpret as originating from a combination of emissionassociated with star-formation processes at low energies combined with aheavily-obscured agn at e&gt;5 kev. we further find that the relative strength ofthis agn signal decays with decreasing ir luminosity, indicating a higher agnfraction for more luminous ir sources. together, these results strongly suggestthe presence of a large number of obscured agn in ir-luminous galaxies. usingsamples binned in terms of stellar mass in the host galaxy, we find asignificant excess at e=6-7 kev for sources with m&gt;10^{11} msun, consistentwith a large obscured agn population in high mass galaxies. in contrast, nostrong evidence of agn activity was found for less-massive galaxies. theintegrated intensity at high energies indicates that a significant fraction ofthe total black hole growth, ~22%, occurs in heavily-obscured systems that arenot individually detected in even the deepest x-ray observations. there arealso indications that the number of low-luminosity, heavily-obscured agn doesnot evolve significantly with redshift, in contrast to the strong evolutionseen in higher luminosity sources.

1012.1855	hst wfc3/ir observations of active galactic nucleus host galaxies at  z~2: supermassive black holes grow in disk galaxies	we present the rest-frame optical morphologies of active galactic nucleus(agn) host galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;3, using near-infrared imaging from the hubblespace telescope wide field camera 3, the first such study of agn host galaxiesat these redshifts. the agn are x-ray selected from the chandra deep fieldsouth and have typical luminosities of 1e42 &lt; l_x &lt; 1e44 erg/s. accreting blackholes in this luminosity and redshift range account for a substantial fractionof the total space density and black hole mass growth over cosmic time; theythus represent an important mode of black hole growth in the universe. we findthat the majority (~80%) of the host galaxies of these agn have low sersicindices indicative of disk-dominated light profiles, suggesting that secularprocesses govern a significant fraction of the cosmic growth of black holes.that is, many black holes in the present-day universe grew much of their massin disk-dominated galaxies and not in early-type galaxies or major mergers. theproperties of the agn host galaxies are furthermore indistinguishable fromtheir parent galaxy population and we find no strong evolution in eithereffective radii or morphological mix between z~2 and z~0.05.

1103.0276	accretion rate and the physical nature of unobscured active galaxies	we show how accretion rate governs the physical properties of a sample ofunobscured broad-line, narrow-line, and lineless active galactic nuclei (agns).we avoid the systematic errors plaguing previous studies of agn accretion rateby using accurate accretion luminosities (l_int) from well-sampledmultiwavelength seds from the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), and accurateblack hole masses derived from virial scaling relations (for broad-line agns)or host-agn relations (for narrow-line and lineless agns). in general, broademission lines are present only at the highest accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &gt;0.01), and these rapidly accreting agns are observed as broad-line agns orpossibly as obscured narrow-line agns. narrow-line and lineless agns at lowerspecific accretion rates (l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01) are unobscured and yet lack abroad line region. the disappearance of the broad emission lines is caused byan expanding radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf) at the inner radiusof the accretion disk. the presence of the riaf also drives l_int/l_edd &lt; 10^-2narrow-line and lineless agns to 10 times higher ratios of radio to optical/uvemission than l_int/l_edd &gt; 0.01 broad-line agns, since the unbound nature ofthe riaf means it is easier to form a radio outflow. the ir torus signaturealso tends to become weaker or disappear from l_int/l_edd &lt; 0.01 agns, althoughthere may be additional mid-ir synchrotron emission associated with the riaf.together these results suggest that specific accretion rate is an importantphysical "axis" of agn unification, described by a simple model.

0712.1041	supermassive black holes in deep multiwavelength surveys	in recent years deep x-ray and infrared surveys have provided an efficientway to find accreting supermassive black holes, otherwise known as activegalactic nuclei (agn), in the young universe. such surveys can, unlike opticalsurveys, find agn obscured by high column densities of gas and dust. in thosecases, deep optical data show only the host galaxy, which can then be studiedin greater detail than in unobscured agn. some years ago the hard spectrum ofthe x-ray "background" suggested that most agn were obscured. now goods, musyc,cosmos and other surveys have confirmed this picture and given importantquantitative constraints on agn demographics. specifically, we show that mostagn are obscured at all redshifts and the amount of obscuration depends on bothluminosity and redshift, at least out to redshift z~2, the epoch of substantialblack holes and galaxy growth. larger-area deep infrared and hard x-ray surveyswill be needed to reach higher redshifts and to probe fully the co-evolution ofgalaxies and black holes.

1302.2631	on the star formation-agn connection at $z \lesssim 0.3$	using the spectra of a sample of $\sim$28,000 nearby obscured active galaxiesfrom data release 7 of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we probe theconnection between agn activity and star formation over a range of radialscales in the host galaxy. we use the extinction-corrected luminosity of the[oiii] 5007 \aa\ line as a proxy of intrinsic agn power and supermassive blackhole (smbh) accretion rate. the star formation rates (sfrs) are taken from thempa-jhu value-added catalog and are measured through the 3$^{\prime\prime}$sdss aperture. we construct matched samples of galaxies covering a range inredshifts. with increasing redshift, the projected aperture size encompassesincreasing amounts of the host galaxy. this allows us to trace the radialdistribution of star-formation as a function of agn luminosity. we find thatthe star formation becomes more centrally concentrated with increasing agnluminosity and eddington ratio. this implies that such circumnuclear starformation is associated with agn activity, and that it increasingly dominatesover omnipresent disk star formation at higher agn luminosities, placingcritical constraints on theoretical models that link host galaxy star formationand smbh fueling. we parametrize this relationship and find that the starformation on radial scales $&lt;$1.7 kpc, when including a constant diskcomponent, has a sub-linear dependence on smbh accretion rate: $sfr \propto\dot{m}^{0.36}$, suggesting that angular momentum transfer through the disklimits accretion efficiency rather than the supply from stellar mass loss.

1402.4814	the green valley is a red herring: galaxy zoo reveals two evolutionary  pathways towards quenching of star formation in early- and late-type galaxies	we use sdss+\textit{galex}+galaxy zoo data to study the quenching of starformation in low-redshift galaxies. we show that the green valley between theblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxiesin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through whichmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. rather, an analysis that takesmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blueearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologiesare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.in contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation ratesdecline very slowly. we summarize a range of observations that lead to theseconclusions, including uv-optical colours and halo masses, which both show astriking dependence on morphological type. we interpret these results in termsof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. we conclude thatlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply ofgas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustionof the remaining gas over several gyr, driven by secular and/or environmentalprocesses. in contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gassupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapidquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.this gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, andmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly agnfeedback.

1408.1090	inter-comparison of radio-loudness criteria for type 1 agns in the  xmm-cosmos survey	limited studies have been performed on the radio-loud fraction in x-rayselected type 1 agn samples. the consistency between various radio-loudnessdefinitions also needs to be checked. we measure the radio-loudness of the 407type 1 agns in the xmm-cosmos quasar sample using nine criteria from theliterature (six defined in the rest-frame and three defined in the observedframe): $r_l=\log(l_{5ghz}/l_b)$, $q_{24}=\log(l_{24\mu m}/l_{1.4ghz})$,$r_{uv}=\log(l_{5ghz}/l_{2500\aa})$, $r_{i}=\log(l_{1.4ghz}/l_i)$,$r_x=\log(\nu l_{\nu}(5ghz)/l_x)$, $p_{5ghz}=\log(p_{5ghz}(w/hz/sr))$,$r_{l,obs}=\log(f_{1.4ghz}/f_b)$ (observed frame),$r_{i,obs}=\log(f_{1.4ghz}/f_i)$ (observed frame), and $q_{24,obs}=\log(f_{24\mu m}/f_{1.4ghz})$ (observed frame). using any single criteriondefined in the rest-frame, we find a low radio-loud fraction of $\lesssim 5\%$in the xmm-cosmos type 1 agn sample, except for $r_{uv}$. requiring that anytwo criteria agree reduces the radio-loud fraction to $\lesssim 2\%$ for about3/4 of the cases. the low radio-loud fraction cannot be simply explained by thecontribution of the host galaxy luminosity and reddening. the$p_{5ghz}=\log(p_{5ghz}(w/hz/sr))$ gives the smallest radio-loud fraction. twoof the three radio-loud fractions from the criteria defined in the observedframe without k-correction ($r_{l,obs}$ and $r_{i,obs}$) are much larger thanthe radio-loud fractions from other criteria.

1408.5159	hst imaging of fading agn candidates i: host-galaxy properties and  origin of the extended gas	we present narrow- and medium-band hst imaging, with additional supportingground-based data, for 8 galaxies identified as hosting fading agn. these haveagn-ionized gas projected &gt;10 kpc from the nucleus, and significant shortfallof ionizing radiation between the distant gas and the agn, indicating fadingagn on ~50,000-year timescales. every system shows evidence of ongoing or pastinteractions; a similar sample of obscured agn with extended ionized cloudsshares this incidence of disturbances. several systems show multiple dust lanesin different orientations, broadly fit by differentially precessing disks ofaccreted material ~1.5 gyr after initial arrival. the gas has lower metallicitythan the nuclei; three systems have abundances uniformly well below solar,consistent with an origin in tidally disrupted low-luminosity galaxies, whilesome systems have more nearly solar abundances (accompanied by such signaturesas multiple doppler components), which may suggest redistribution of gas byoutflows within the host galaxies themselves. these aspects are consistent witha tidal origin for the extended gas in most systems, although the ionized gasand stellar tidal features do not always match closely. in contrast to cloudsnear radio-loud agn, these are dominated by rotation, in some cases in warpeddisks. outflows are important only in localized regions near some of the agn.in ugc 7342 and ugc 11185, luminous star clusters are seen within projectedionization cones, potentially triggered by outflows. as in the discoveryexample hanny's voorwerp/ic 2497, some clouds lack a strong correlation betweenh-alpha surface brightness and ionization parameter, indicating unresolved finestructure. together with thin coherent filaments spanning several kpc,persistence of these structures over their orbital lifetimes may require a rolefor magnetic confinement.

1411.0670	nustar spectroscopy of multi-component x-ray reflection from ngc 1068	we report on observations of ngc1068 with nustar, which provide the bestconstraints to date on its $&gt;10$~kev spectral shape. we find no strongvariability over the past two decades, consistent with its compton-thick agnclassification. the combined nustar, chandra, xmm-newton, and swift-batspectral dataset offers new insights into the complex reflected emission. thecritical combination of the high signal-to-noise nustar data and a spatialdecomposition with chandra allow us to break several model degeneracies andgreatly aid physical interpretation. when modeled as a monolithic (i.e., asingle n_h) reflector, none of the common compton-reflection models are able tomatch the neutral fluorescence lines and broad spectral shape of the comptonreflection. a multi-component reflector with three distinct column densities(e.g., n_h~1.5e23, 5e24, and 1e25 cm^{-2}) provides a more reasonable fit tothe spectral lines and compton hump, with near-solar fe abundances. in thismodel, the higher n_h components provide the bulk of the compton hump fluxwhile the lower n_h component produces much of the line emission, effectivelydecoupling two key features of compton reflection. we note that ~30% of theneutral fe kalpha line flux arises from &gt;2" (~140 pc), implying that asignificant fraction of the &lt;10 kev reflected component arises from regionswell outside of a parsec-scale torus. these results likely have ramificationsfor the interpretation of poorer signal-to-noise observations and/or moredistant objects [abridged].

1506.04758	optical detection of the pictor a jet and tidal tail: evidence against  an ic/cmb jet	new images from the hubble space telescope of the frii radio galaxy pictor areveal a previously undiscovered tidal tail, as well as a number of jet knotscoinciding with a known x-ray and radio jet. the tidal tail is approximately 5"wide (3 kpc projected), starting 18" (12 kpc) from the center of pictor a, andextends more than 90" (60 kpc). the knots are part of a jet observed to beabout 4' (160 kpc) long, extending to a bright hotspot. these images are thefirst optical detections of this jet, and by extracting knot flux densitiesthrough three filters we set constraints on emission models. while the radioand optical flux densities are usually explained by synchrotron emission, thereare several emission mechanisms which might be used to explain the x-ray fluxdensities. our data rule out doppler boosted inverse compton scattering as asource of the high energy emission. instead, we find that the observed emissioncan be well described by synchrotron emission from electrons with a low energyindex ($p\sim2$) that dominates the radio band, while a high energy index($p\sim3$) is needed for the x-ray band and the transition occurs in theoptical/infrared band. this model is consistent with a continuous electroninjection scenario.

astro-ph;0103145	on the parent population of radio galaxies and the fr i--ii dichotomy	the possibility of radio galaxies being random sample of otherwise normalelliptical galaxies is tested. starting with the observed optical luminosityfunctions for elliptical galaxies, it is shown that the probability of anelliptical forming a radio source is a continuous, increasing function ofoptical luminosity, precisely proportional to square of the optical luminosityof the galaxy. once the probability function is fixed, the luminosity functionof normal elliptical galaxies is used as input for monte carlo simulations thatreproduce the distribution of radio galaxies in the radio-optical luminosityplane. our results show that radio galaxies are luminosity biased, butotherwise random sample of elliptical galaxies. this unified view of radio andnon-radio ellipticals also explains the well known difference of 0.5 mag inaverage optical luminosity between fri and frii radio galaxies as a simpleselection effect. specifically, frii appear preferentially in smaller galaxiesbecause both radio and optical luminosity functions are steep, so there is anegligible probability of observing a powerful radio source associated with abright galaxy; no intrinsic physical differences between fri and frii hostgalaxies is required.

astro-ph;0108310	variability time scales of tev blazars observed in the asca continuous  long-look x-ray monitoring	three uninterrupted, long (lasting respectively 7, 10, and 10 days) ascaobservations of the well-studied tev-bright blazars mrk 421, mrk 501 and pks2155-304 all show continuous strong x-ray flaring. despite the relatively faintintensity states in 2 of the 3 sources, there was no identifiable quiescentperiod in any of the observations. structure function analysis shows that allblazars have a characteristic time scale of ~ a day, comparable to therecurrence time and to the time scale of the stronger flares. on the otherhand, examination of these flares in more detail reveals that each of thestrong flares is not a smooth increase and decrease, but exhibits substructuresof shorter flares having time scales of ~10 ks. we verify via simulations thatin order to explain the observed structure function, these shorter flares("shots") are unlikely to be fully random, but in some way are correlated witheach other. the energy dependent cross-correlation analysis shows thatinter-band lags are not universal in tev blazars. this is important since inthe past, only positive detections of lags were reported. in this work, wedetermine that the sign of a lag may differ from flare to flare; significantlags of both signs were detected from several flares, while no significant lagwas detected from others. however, we also argue that the nature of theunderlying component can affect these values. the facts that all flares arenearly symmetric and that fast variability shorter than the characteristic timescale is strongly suppressed, support the scenario where the light crossingtime dominates the variability time scales of the day-scale flares.

astro-ph;0201412	a survey of extended radio jets in agn with chandra and hst: first  results	we present the first results from an x-ray and optical survey of a sample ofagn radio jets with chandra and hst. we focus here on the first six sourcesobserved at x-rays, in four of which a bright x-ray jet was detected for thefirst time. in three out of four cases optical emission from the jet is alsodetected in our hst images. we compare the x-ray morphology with the radio asderived from improved processing of archival vla data and we construct spectralenergy distributions (sed) for the most conspicuous emission knots. in mostcases the seds, together with the similarity of the x-ray and radiomorphologies, favor an inverse compton origin of the x-rays. the most likelyorigin of the seed photons is the cosmic microwave background, implying thejets are still relativistic on kiloparsec scales. however, in the first knot ofthe pks 1136-135 jet, x-rays are likely produced via the synchrotron process.in all four cases bulk lorentz factors of a few are required. the radio maps ofthe two jets not detected by either chandra or hst suggest that they are lessbeamed at large scales than the other four detected sources. our resultsdemonstrate that, at the sensitivity and resolution of chandra, x-ray emissionfrom extragalactic jets is common, yielding essential information on theirphysical properties.

astro-ph;0207249	agn black hole masses and bolometric luminosities	black hole mass, along with mass accretion rate, is a fundamental property ofactive galactic nuclei. black hole mass sets an approximate upper limit to agnenergetics via the eddington limit. we collect and compare all agn black holemass estimates from the literature; these 177 masses are mostly based on thevirial assumption for the broad emission lines, with the broad-line region sizedetermined from either reverberation mapping or optical luminosity. weintroduce 200 additional black hole mass estimates based on properties of thehost galaxy bulges, using either the observed stellar velocity dispersion orusing the fundamental plane relation to infer $\sigma$; these methods assumethat agn hosts are normal galaxies. we compare 36 cases for which black holemass has been generated by different methods and find, for individual objects,a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. the less direct themethod, the larger the discrepancy with other estimates, probably due to thelarge scatter in the underlying correlations assumed. using published fluxes,we calculate bolometric luminosities for 234 agns and investigate the relationbetween black hole mass and luminosity. in contrast to other studies, we findno significant correlation of black hole mass with luminosity, other than thoseinduced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. theeddington limit defines an approximate upper envelope to the distribution ofluminosities, but the lower envelope depends entirely on the sample of agnincluded. for any given black hole mass, there is a range in eddington ratio ofup to three orders of magnitude.

astro-ph;0207597	the host galaxies of radio-loud agn: the black hole--galaxy connection	we have studied the host galaxies of a sample of radio-loud agn spanning morethan four decades in the energy output of the nucleus. the core sample includes40 low-power sources (bl lac objects) and 22 high-power sources (radio-loudquasars) spanning the redshift range z~0.15 to z~0.5, all imaged with the highspatial resolution of hst. all of the sources are found to lie in luminouselliptical galaxies, which follow the kormendy relation for normal ellipticals.a very shallow trend is detected between nuclear brightness (corrected forbeaming) and host galaxy luminosity. black hole masses are estimated for theentire sample, using both the bulge luminosity--black hole mass and thevelocity dispersion--black hole mass relations for local galaxies. the latterinvolves a new method, using the host galaxy morphological parameters, mu_e andr_e, to infer the velocity dispersion, sigma, via the fundamental planecorrelation. both methods indicate that the entire sample of radio-loud agn arepowered by very massive central black holes, with m_{black hole} ~ 10^8 to10^10 m_{sun}$. eddington ratios range from l/l_{eddington} ~ 2 x 10^-4 to ~1,with the high- power sources having higher eddington ratios than the low-powersources. overall, radio-loud agn appear to span a very large range in accretionefficiency, which is all but independent of the mass of the host galaxy.

0808.2391	star formation rates in lyman break galaxies: radio stacking of lbgs in  the cosmos field and the sub-$\mu$jy radio source population	we present an analysis of the radio properties of large samples of lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at $z \sim 3$, 4, and 5 from the cosmos field. the medianstacking analysis yields a statistical detection of the $z \sim 3$ lbgs (u-banddrop-outs), with a 1.4 ghz flux density of $0.90 \pm 0.21 \mu$jy. the stackedemission is unresolved, with a size $&lt; 1"$, or a physical size $&lt; 8$kpc. thetotal star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is $31\pm 7$$m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, based on the radio-fir correlation in low redshift starforming galaxies. the star formation rate derived from a similar analysis ofthe uv luminosities is 17 $m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for uvdust attenuation. the simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factoris 1.8 at uv wavelengths. however, this factor is considerably smaller than thestandard attenuation factor $\sim 5$, normally assumed for lbgs. we discusspotential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dustattenuation factor at $z \ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. conversely,the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematicallylower at very high redshift. two possible causes for a suppressed radioluminosity are: (i) increased inverse compton cooling of the relativisticelectron population due to scattering off the increasing cmb at high redshift,or (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. the radiodetections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud agn fractionof 0.3%. one source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a'submm galaxy').

astro-ph;0512007	spitzer number counts of agn in the goods fields	we present mid-infrared observations of agn in the goods fields, performedwith the spitzer space telescope. these are the deepest infrared and x-rayfields to date and cover a total area of ~0.1 square degrees. agn are selectedon the basis of their hard (2-8 kev) x-ray emission. the median agn infraredluminosity is at least 10 times larger than the median for normal galaxies withthe same redshift distribution, suggesting that the infrared emission isdominated by the central nucleus. the x-ray to infrared luminosity ratios ofgoods agn, most of which are at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5, are similar to the values obtainedfor agn in the local universe. the observed infrared flux distribution has anintegral slope of ~1.5 and there are 1000 sources per square degree brighterthan ~50 ujy at 3-6 microns. the counts approximately match the predictions ofmodels based on agn unification, in which the majority of agn are obscured.this agreement confirms that the faintest x-ray sources, which are dominated bythe host galaxy light in the optical, are obscured agn. using these spitzerdata, the agn contribution to the extragalactic infrared background light iscalculated by correlating the x-ray and infrared catalogues. this is likely tobe a lower limit given that the most obscured agn are missed in x-rays. weestimate the contribution of agn missed in x-rays, using a population synthesismodel, to be ~45% of the observed agn contribution, making the agn contributionto the infrared background at most ~2-10% in the 3-24 micron range, dependingon wavelength, lower than most previous estimates. the agn contribution to theinfrared background remains roughly constant with source flux in the irac bandsbut decreases with decreasing flux in the mips 24 um band, where the galaxypopulation becomes more important.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.

astro-ph;0612612	the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc): deep near-infrared  imaging and the selection of distant galaxies	we present deep near-infrared jhk imaging of four 10'x10' fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the multiwavelength survey byyale-chile (musyc) with ispi on the ctio 4m telescope. the typical point sourcelimiting depths are j~22.5, h~21.5, and k~21 (5sigma; vega). the effectiveseeing in the final images is ~1.0". we combine these data with musyc ubvrizimaging to create k-selected catalogs that are unique for their uniform size,depth, filter coverage, and image quality. we investigate the rest-frameoptical colors and photometric redshifts of galaxies that are selected usingcommon color selection techniques, including distant red galaxies (drgs),star-forming and passive bzks, and the rest-frame uv-selected bm, bx, and lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs). these techniques are effective at isolating largesamples of high redshift galaxies, but none provide complete or uniform samplesacross the targeted redshift ranges. the drg and bm/bx/lbg criteria identifypopulations of red and blue galaxies, respectively, as they were designed todo. the star-forming bzks have a very wide redshift distribution, a wide rangeof colors, and may include galaxies with very low specific star formationrates. in comparison, the passive bzks are fewer in number, have a differentdistribution of k magnitudes, and have a somewhat different redshiftdistribution. by combining these color selection criteria, it appears possibleto define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit overspecific redshift ranges. however, the redshift dependence of both thecompleteness and sampled range of rest-frame colors poses an ultimate limit tothe usefulness of these techniques.

astro-ph;9506063	unified schemes for radio-loud active galactic nuclei	the appearance of active galactic nuclei (agn) depends so strongly onorientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by randompointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. light fromthe centers of many agn is obscured by optically thick circumnuclear matter andin radio-loud agn, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit light that isrelativistically beamed along the jet axes. understanding the origin andmagnitude of radiation anisotropies in agn allows us to unify different classesof agn; that is, to identify each single, underlying agn type that gives riseto different classes through different orientations.  this review describes the unification of radio-loud agn, which include radiogalaxies, quasars, and blazars. we describe the classification and propertiesof agn and summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission. we outline the twomost plausible unified schemes for radio-loud agn, one linking quasars andluminous radio galaxies and another linking bl~lac objects and less luminousradio galaxies. using the formalism appropriate to samples biased byrelativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are inaccordance with available data. we analyze the possible connections betweenlow- and high-luminosity radio-loud agn. we review potential difficulties withunification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. wediscuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realisticphysical considerations; these will be important to consider when morecomprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. we concludewith a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in thisfield.

astro-ph;9706300	multiwavelength monitoring of the bl lacertae object pks 2155-304 in may  1994. ii. the iue campaign	pks 2155-304, the brightest bl lac object in the ultraviolet sky, wasmonitored with the iue satellite at ~1 hour time-resolution for ten nearlyuninterrupted days in may 1994. the campaign, which was coordinated with euve,rosat, and asca monitoring, along with optical and radio observations from theground, yielded the largest set of spectra and the richest short time scalevariability information ever gathered for a blazar at uv wavelengths. thesource flared dramatically during the first day, with an increase by a factor~2.2 in an hour and a half. in subsequent days, the flux maintained a nearlyconstant level for ~5 days, then flared with ~35% amplitude for two days. thesame variability was seen in both short- and long-wavelength iue light curves,with zero formal lag (~&lt;2 hr), except during the rapid initial flare, when thevariations were not resolved. spectral index variations were small and notclearly correlated with flux. the flux variability observed in the presentmonitoring is so rapid that for the first time, based on the uv emission alone,the traditional delta l/delta t limit indicating relativistic beaming isexceeded. the most rapid variations, under the likely assumption of synchrotronradiation, lead to a lower limit of 1 g on the magnetic field strength in theuv emitting region. these results are compared with earlier intensivemonitoring of pks 2155-304 with iue in november 1991, when the uv fluxvariations had completely different characteristics.

astro-ph;9709086	monitoring ly alpha emission from the blazar 3c 279	the blazar 3c 279 is well studied and shows frequent large continuum flaresfrom radio to gamma-ray wavelengths. there have been a number ofmulti-wavelength observations of 3c 279, and hence there are many ultravioletdata for this object available in the uv archives. in this paper we present lyalpha emission line measurements for 3c 279 using all the archival iue swpspectra from 1988 to 1996 and all archival hst/fos g190h spectra from 1992 to1996. individual archival iue spectra of 3c 279 show weak ly alpha emission at~1868 a (z = 0.536), which is easily seen in the co-added data. the ly alphaemission is observed in all the hst/fos spectra. the strength of ly alpha isnearly constant (~5e-14 erg/cm2/s), while the 1750 a continuum varies by afactor of ~50, from ~0.6 to 31.6e-15 erg/cm2/s/a. the behavior of the ly alphaemission line flux and continuum flux is similar to that of the only other wellobserved blazar, 3c 273, which shows constant line flux while the continuumvaries by a factor of ~3. this near-constancy of emission line flux in the twobest-studied blazars, suggests that the highly variable beamed continuum is nota significant source of photoionization for the gas. some other source, such asthermal emission from an accretion disk, must be providing a significantfraction of the photoionizing flux in these objects. the large amplitudevariability seen at gamma-ray energies must be due to changes in the energeticelectrons in the jet rather than changes in the external photon field.

astro-ph;9710331	bepposax observations of unprecedented synchrotron activity in the bl  lac object mkn 501	the bl lac object mkn 501, one of the only three extragalactic sources (withmkn 421 and 1es 2344+514) so far detected at tev energies, was observed withthe bepposax satellite on 7, 11, and 16 april 1997 during a phase of highactivity at tev energies, as monitored with the whipple, hegra and catcherenkov telescopes. over the whole 0.1-200 kev range the spectrum wasexceptionally hard (alpha =&lt; 1, with f_nu ~ nu^{-alpha}) indicating that thex-ray power output peaked at (or above) ~100 kev. this represents a shift of atleast two orders of magnitude with respect to previous observations of mkn 501,a behavior never seen before in this or any other blazar. the overall x-rayspectrum hardens with increasing intensity and, at each epoch, it is softer atlarger energies. the correlated variability from soft x-rays to the tev bandpoints to models in which the same population of relativistic electronsproduces the x-ray continuum via synchrotron radiation and the tev emission byinverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photons or other seed photons.for the first time in any blazar the synchrotron power is observed to peak athard x-ray energies. the large shift of the synchrotron peak frequency withrespect to previous observations of mkn 501 implies that intrinsic changes inthe relativistic electron spectrum caused the increase in emitted power. due tothe very high electron energies, the inverse compton process is limited by theklein-nishina regime. this implies a quasi-linear (as opposed to quadratic)relation of the variability amplitude in the tev and hard x-ray ranges (for thessc model) and an increase of the inverse compton peak frequency smaller thanthat of the synchrotron peak frequency.

(1997). in addition, we have analyzed in the sameway hst images of three x-ray-selected bl lacs observed by jannuzi et al.(1997). the ensemble of 9 bl lac objects spans the redshift range from z=0.19to ~1. host galaxies are clearly detected in seven cases, while the other two,at z~0.258 (redshift highly uncertain) and z=0.997, are not resolved. the hstimages constitute a homogeneous data set with unprecedented morphologicalinformation between a few tenths of an arcsecond and several arcseconds fromthe nucleus, allowing us in 6 of the 7 detected host galaxies to rule outdefinitively a pure disk light profile. the host galaxies are luminousellipticals with an average absolute magnitude of m_i~-24.6 mag (withdispersion 0.7 mag), more than a magnitude brighter than l* and comparable tobrightest cluster galaxies. the morphologies are generally smooth and havesmall ellipticities (epsilon&lt;0.2). given such roundness, there is no obviousalignment with the more linear radio structures. in the six cases for which wehave hst wfpc2 images in two filters, the derived color profiles show no strongspatial gradients and are as expected for k-corrected passively evolvingelliptical galaxies. the host galaxies of the radio-selected and x-ray-selectedbl lacs for this very limited sample are comparable in both morphology andluminosity.

astro-ph;9812420	bl lac objects and blazars: past, present, and future	the past 20 years have seen phenomenal progress in our understanding of bllac objects. they form part of the blazar class, which are radio-loud agn whoserelativistic jets are aligned along our line of sight. several criticalmilestones have helped establish this picture, first proposed at the pittsburghbl lac meeting 20 years ago, most recently the egret and tev detections ofbeamed gamma-ray emission. the spectral energy distributions are double peakedand follow a self-similar sequence in luminosity, which can be explained byelectron cooling on ambient photons. this simple paradigm has yet to be tested,and further questions remain, notably about physical conditions in blazar jets--- the kinetic power, magnetic energy density, acceleration time scales,proton content, etc. --- and how this energy is transported in the innermostregions. some clues are available from multiwavelength monitoring campaignsalthough better sampling over longer periods is clearly called for. recent workon the host galaxies of bl lac objects supports their unification withlow-power, aligned fri radio galaxies. nature makes jets with a large range ofkinetic powers, but the relative number densities of low-luminosity ("blue" bllacs) or high-luminosity ("red" bl lacs and fsrq) blazars --- is highlyuncertain. since according to unified schemes blazars are representative of allradio-loud agn, their jet properties have broad implications. future euv/x-rayobservations will illuminate the circumnuclear structure, especially the hot,highly ionized, high velocity gas on sub-parsec scales, which could play a rolein jet dynamics and could possibly affect the formation of fri vs. frii typejets. the study of blazars may also help us eventually understand thedifference between radio-quiet and radio-loud agn.

astro-ph;9903189	multiwavelength properties of blazars	blazar spectral energy distributions (seds) are double peaked and follow aself-similar sequence in luminosity. the so-called "blue" blazars, whose firstsed component peaks at x-ray energies, are tev sources, although with arelatively small fraction of their bolometric luminosities. the "red" blazars,with sed peaks in the infrared-optical range, appear to emit relatively morepower in the gamma-ray component but at much lower energies (gev and below).correlated variations across the seds (of both types) are consistent with thepicture that a single electron population gives rise to the high-energy partsof both sed components, via synchrotron at low energies and compton-scatteringat high energies. in this scenario, the trends of sed shape with luminosity canbe explained by electron cooling on ambient photons. with simple assumptions,we can make some estimates of the physical conditions in blazar jets of each"type" and can predict which blazars are the most likely tev sources. upperlimits from a mini-survey of candidate tev sources indicate that only ~10% oftheir bolometric luminosity is radiated in gamma-rays, assuming the two sedcomponents peak near 1 kev and 1 tev. finally, present blazar samples are tooshallow to indicate what kinds of jets nature prefers, i.e., whether thelow-luminosity "blue" blazars or the high-luminosity "red" blazars are morecommon.

astro-ph;9911109	the hst survey of bl lacertae objects. ii. host galaxies	we have used the hst wfpc2 camera to survey 132 bl lac objects comprisingseven complete radio-, x-ray-, and optically-selected samples. we obtaineduseful images for 110 targets spanning the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. in twothirds of the bl lac images, host galaxies are detected, including nearly allfor z &lt; 0.5 (58 of 63). the highest redshift host galaxy detected is in a bllac object at z=0.664. in 58 of the 72 resolved host galaxies, a de vaucouleursprofile is significantly preferred, at &gt;99% confidence, over a pure exponentialdisk; the two fits are comparable in the remaining 14 cases. these resultslimit the number of disk systems to at most 8% of bl lacs (at 99% confidence),and are consistent with all bl~lac host galaxies being ellipticals. thedetected host galaxies are luminous ellipticals with a median absolutek-corrected magnitude of m_r= -23.7 +- 0.6 mag, at least one magnitude brighterthan m* and comparable to brightest cluster galaxies. the galaxy morphologiesare generally smooth and undisturbed, with small or negligible ellipticities(&lt;0.2). there is no correlation between host galaxy and observed nuclearmagnitude or estimated jet power corrected for beaming. if black hole mass iscorrelated linearly with bulge mass in general, this implies a large range ineddington ratio. present data strongly support the unification picture with fri galaxies constituting the bulk of the parent population of bl lac objects.

astro-ph;9912273	testing the blazar paradigm: asca observations of fsrqs with steep soft  x-ray spectra	we present the first observations at medium-hard x-rays with asca in 1998august--november of four flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), characterized byunusually steep soft x-ray spectra (photon index, \gamma_{0.2-2.4 kev} \sim2-2.5), as previously measured with rosat. such steep x-ray slopes are similarto those observed in synchrotron-dominated bl lacs and are unexpected in thecontext of the recent blazar paradigm, where sources with strong emission lines(such as fsrqs) are dominated in soft x-rays by a flat inverse compton tail. wefind that the asca spectra of the four fsrqs are consistent with a power lawmodel with \gamma_{2-10 kev} \sim 1.8, flatter than their rosat spectra. thisindicates the onset of an inverse compton component at energies \gtrsim 2 kev,in agreement with the blazar unification scheme. however, these objects arestill anomalous within the blazar class for their steep soft x-ray continuawhich, together with non-simultaneous data at longer wavelengths, hint at thepossibility that the synchrotron emission extends to soft x-rays. this wouldimply an anomalously high synchotron peak frequency for a quasar with luminousbroad lines, challenging current blazar unification schemes. alternatively, aplausible explanation for the steep optical-to-soft x-ray continua of the fourfsrqs is thermal emission from the accretion disk, similar to the blazars3c~273 and 3c~345. in the appendix, we present fits to the sis data in aneffort to contribute to the ongoing calibration of the the time-dependence ofthe sis response at low energies.
