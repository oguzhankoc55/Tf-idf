0903.2814	on the peculiar momentum of baryons after reionization	the peculiar motion of ionized baryons is known to introduce temperatureanisotropies in the cmb by means of the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect(ksz). in this work, we present an all sky computation of angular powerspectrum of the temperature anisotropies introduced by ksz momentum of allbaryons in the universe during and after reionization. in an attempt to studythe bulk flows of the missing baryons not yet detected, we address separatelythe contribution from all baryons in the igm and those baryons located incollapsed structures like groups and clusters of galaxies. in the first case,our approach provides a complete, all sky computation of the ksz in secondorder of cosmological perturbation theory (also known as the ostriker-vishniaceffect, ov). most of the power of ov is generated during reionization, althoughit has a non-negligible tail at low redshifts, when the bulk of the kszpeculiar momentum of the halo (cluster + group) population arises. if gasoutside halos is comoving with clusters as the theory predicts, then thesignature of the bulk flows of the missing baryons should be recovered by across-correlation analysis of future cmb data sets with ksz estimates inclusters of galaxies. for an act or spt type of cmb experiment, all sky kszestimates of all clusters above $2\times 10^{14} h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ shouldprovide a detection of {\it dark} flows with signal to noise ratio (s/n) of$\sim 10$, (s/n $\sim 2.5-5$ for 2,000 - 10,000 square degrees). improving kszestimates with data from large scale structure surveys should enable a deeperconfrontation of the theoretical predictions for bulk flows with observations.the combination of future cmb and optical data should shed light on the darkflows of the nearby, so far undetected, diffuse baryons.

0903.2845	finding the missing baryons using cmb as a backlight	we present a new method for detecting the missing baryons by generating atemplate for the kinematic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. the template is computedfrom the product of a reconstructed velocity field with a galaxy field; we findthat the combination of a galaxy redshift survey such as sdss and a cmb surveysuch as act and planck can detect the ksz, and thus the ionized gas, atsignificant signal-to-noise. unlike other techniques that look for hot gas ormetals, this approach directly detects the electrons in the igm through theirsignature on the cmb. the estimated signal-to-noise for detecting thegalaxy-momentum ksz cross-correlation is 4, 9, and 12 for act (with survey areaof 2000 $\mathrm{deg}^2$) with sdss-dr4, sdss3 and adept respectively. theestimated signal-to-noise for planck with sdss-dr4, sdss3 and adept is 11, 23,and 32.  our method provides a new mean for determining properties of the ionized gasin the universe. we provide galaxy momentum templates constructed from sloandigital sky survey online at our website athttp://www.astro.princeton.edu/~shirley/sz/sz.html. the predicted correlationcoefficients are provided along with the momentum maps. one can download themomentum templates and cross-correlate directly with cmb maps from act andplanck to detect the missing baryons.

0906.2414	the acoustic peak in the lyman alpha forest	we present the first simulation of the signature of baryonic acousticoscillations (bao) in lyman alpha forest data containing 180,000 mock quasarsight-lines. we use eight large dark-matter only simulations onto which wepaint the lyman alpha field using the fluctuating gunn-peterson approximation.we argue that this approach should be sufficient for the mean signature on thescales of interest. our results indicate that lyman alpha flux provides a goodtracer of the underlying dark matter field on large scales and that redshiftspace distortions are well described by a simple linear theory prescription. wecompare fourier and configuration space approaches to describing the signal andargue that configuration space statistics provide useful data compression. wealso investigate the effect of a fluctuating photo-ionizing background using asimplified model and find that such fluctuations do add smooth power on largescales. the acoustic peak position is, however, unaffected for small amplitudefluctuations (&lt;10%). larger amplitude fluctuations make the recovery of the baosignal more difficult and may degrade the achievable significance of themeasurement.

1003.4738	the posterior distribution of sin(i) values for exoplanets with m_t  sin(i) determined from radial velocity data	radial velocity (rv) observations of an exoplanet system giving a value ofm_t sin(i) condition (i.e. give information about) not only the planet's truemass m_t but also the value of sin(i) (where i is the orbital inclinationangle). thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observedvalue of m_t sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a uniformdistribution between zero and unity (corresponding to an isotropic idistribution). the actual distribution from which it is drawn depends on theintrinsic distribution of m_t for the exoplanet population being studied. wegive a simple bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several"toy models" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of m_t. theresults show that the effect can be an important one. for example, even forsimple power-law distributions of m_t, the median value of sin(i) in anobserved rv sample can vary between 0.25 and 0.71 (as compared to the 0.5 valuefor an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the quiteplausible range between -2 and -0.5, respectively. over the same range ofindicies, the 95% confidence upper bound on m_t ranges from 4.5 to 400 timeslarger than m_t sin(i), respectively, due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. morecomplex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of m_t yield still morecomplicated and less intuitive $sin(i)$ distributions. in particular, if them_t distribution contains any characteristic mass scale m_c, the sin(i)distribution will depend on the ratio of m_t sin(i) to $m_c$, often in anon-trivial way. our qualitative conclusion is that rv studies of exoplanets,both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)factor as more than a "numerical constant of order unity" with simple and wellunderstood statistical properties.

1104.5244	the lyman-alpha forest in three dimensions: measurements of large scale  flux correlations from boss 1st-year data	using a sample of approximately 14,000 z&gt;2.1 quasars observed in the firstyear of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), we measure thethree-dimensional correlation function of absorption in the lyman-alpha forest.the angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (f = exp(-tau)) issecurely detected out to comoving separations of 60 mpc/h, the first detectionof flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. a quadrupoledistortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities,the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in thelyman-alpha forest, is also detected at high significance. we obtain a good fitto the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias ofthe transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard lcdmcosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmologicalconstant). at 95% confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16&lt;b&lt;0.24 andredshift-distortion parameter 0.44&lt;beta&lt;1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, witha well constrained combination b(1+\beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. the errors on betaare asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. thevalue of beta is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and ourtests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectationsfor the lyman-alpha forest alone) by the presence of high column densitysystems and metal line absorption. these results set the stage for cosmologicalparameter determinations from three-dimensional structure in the lyman-alphaforest, including anticipated constraints on dark energy from baryon acousticoscillations.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1211.5146	the boss lyman-alpha forest sample from sdss data release 9	we present the boss lyman-alpha (lya) forest sample from sdss data release 9,comprising 54,468 quasar spectra with zqso &gt; 2.15 suitable for lya forestanalysis. this data set probes the intergalactic medium with absorptionredshifts 2.0 &lt; z_alpha &lt; 5.7 over an area of 3275 square degrees, andencompasses an approximate comoving volume of 20 h^-3 gpc^3. with eachspectrum, we have included several products designed to aid in lya forestanalysis: improved sky masks that flag pixels where data may be unreliable,corrections for known biases in the pipeline estimated noise, masks for thecores of damped lya systems and corrections for their wings, and estimates ofthe unabsorbed continua so that the observed flux can be converted to afractional transmission. the continua are derived using a principal componentfit to the quasar spectrum redwards of restframe lya (lambda &gt; 1216 ang),extrapolated into the forest region and normalized by a linear function to fitthe expected evolution of the lya forest mean-flux. the estimated continuumerrors are ~5% rms. we also discuss possible systematics arising from uncertainspectrophotometry and artifacts in the flux calibration; global corrections forthe latter are provided. our sample provides a convenient starting point forusers to analyze clustering in boss lya forest data, and it provides a fiducialdata set that can be used to compare results from different analyses of baryonacoustic oscillations in the lya forest. the full data set is available fromthe sdss-iii dr9 web site.

1212.1211	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: luminosity and color dependence and redshift evolution	we measure the luminosity and color dependence and the redshift evolution ofgalaxy clustering in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey ninth data release. we focus on the projected two-pointcorrelation function (2pcf) of subsets of its cmass sample, which includesabout 260,000 galaxies over ~3,300 sq. deg in the redshift range 0.43&lt;z&lt;0.7. tominimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-definedluminosity and color subsamples by carefully accounting for the cmass galaxyselection cuts. the 2pcf of the whole cmass sample, if approximated by apower-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\pm0.06mpc/h and an index of\gamma=1.85\pm0.01. clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are foundfor the projected 2pcf in all redshift bins, with more luminous and reddergalaxies generally exhibiting stronger clustering and steeper 2pcf. the colordependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within the red sequence,consistent with the behavior of sdss-ii main sample galaxies at lowerredshifts. at a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution ofthe projected 2pcfs with redshift is detected for red sequence galaxies. wealso construct galaxy samples of fixed number density at different redshifts,using redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. the clustering of these galaxiesin the cmass redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted bypassive evolution. our measurements of the luminosity and color dependence andredshift evolution of galaxy clustering will allow for detailed modeling of therelation between galaxies and dark matter halos and new constraints on galaxyformation and evolution.

1301.3459	measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lyman-alpha forest  fluctuations in boss data release 9	we use the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9(dr9) to detect and measure the position of the baryonic acoustic oscillation(bao) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the lyman-alphaforest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. the feature is clearly detectedat significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model andmethod of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent withpredictions of the standard lcdm model. we assess the biases in our method,stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. wefit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple thebroadband and acoustic scale information. for an isotropic dilation factor, wemeasure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0(syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits)with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flatlcdm with omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). when fitting separately for the radial andtransversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1)= -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2} (stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). the dilationfactor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlationcoefficient of ~ -0.55. errors become significantly non-gaussian for deviationsover 3 standard deviations from best fit value. because of the data cuts andanalysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previousbao analysis of the boss dr9 lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an importantconsistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.

1303.1055	a first look at creating mock catalogs with machine learning techniques	we investigate machine learning (ml) techniques for predicting the number ofgalaxies (n_gal) that occupy a halo, given the halo's properties. these typesof mappings are crucial for constructing the mock galaxy catalogs necessary foranalyses of large-scale structure. the ml techniques proposed here distinguishthemselves from traditional halo occupation distribution (hod) modeling as theydo not assume a prescribed relationship between halo properties and n_gal. inaddition, our ml approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (likehod methods), which are advantageous over subhalo-based approaches asidentifying subhalos correctly is difficult. we test 2 algorithms: supportvector machines (svm) and k-nearest-neighbour (knn) regression. we takegalaxies and halos from the millennium simulation and predict n_gal by trainingour algorithms on the following 6 halo properties: number of particles, m_200,\sigma_v, v_max, half-mass radius and spin. for millennium, our predicted n_galvalues have a mean-squared-error (mse) of ~0.16 for both svm and knn. ourpredictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and thegalaxy correlation function at large scales to ~5-10%. in addition, wedemonstrate a feature selection algorithm to isolate the halo parameters thatare most predictive, a useful technique for understanding the mapping betweenhalo properties and n_gal. lastly, we investigate these ml-based approaches inmaking mock catalogs for different galaxy subpopulations (e.g. blue, red, highm_star, low m_star). given its non-parametric nature as well as its powerfulpredictive and feature selection capabilities, machine learning offers aninteresting alternative for creating mock catalogs.

0801.0642	correlation of cmb with large-scale structure: i. isw tomography and  cosmological implications	we cross-correlate large scale structure (lss) observations from a number ofsurveys with cmb anisotropies from wmap to investigate the integratedsachs-wolfe (isw) effect as a function of redshift, covering z~0.1-2.5. ourmain goal is to go beyond reporting detections towards developing a reliablelikelihood analysis that allows one to determine cosmological constraints fromisw observations. with this in mind we spend a considerable amount of effort indetermining the redshift-dependent bias and redshift distribution b(z)*dn/dz ofthese samples by matching with spectroscopic observations where available, andanalyzing auto-power spectra and cross-power spectra between the samples. thedata sets we use are 2-micron all sky survey (2mass) samples, sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) photometric luminous red galaxies, sdss photometric quasars andnrao vla sky survey (nvss) radio sources. we make a joint analysis of allsamples constructing a full covariance matrix, which we subsequently use forcosmological parameter fitting. we report a 3.7 sigma detection of iswcombining all the datasets. we combine the isw likelihood function with weaklensing of cmb and cmb power spectrum to constrain the equation of state ofdark energy and the curvature of the universe. while isw does not significantlyimprove the constraints in the simplest 6-parameter flat lambda cdm model, itimproves constraints on 7-parameter models with curvature by a factor of 3.2(relative to wmap alone) to omega_k=-0.004^{+0.014}_{-0.020}, and with darkenergy equation of state by 15% to w=-1.01^{+0.30}_{-0.40}.

1306.5896	the one-dimensional ly-alpha forest power spectrum from boss	we have developed two independent methods to measure the one-dimensionalpower spectrum of the transmitted flux in the lyman-$\alpha$ forest. the firstmethod is based on a fourier transform, and the second on a maximum likelihoodestimator. the two methods are independent and have different systematicuncertainties. the determination of the noise level in the data spectra wassubject to a novel treatment, because of its significant impact on the derivedpower spectrum.  we applied the two methods to 13,821 quasar spectra from sdss-iii/boss dr9selected from a larger sample of over 60,000 spectra on the basis of their highquality, large signal-to-noise ratio, and good spectral resolution. the powerspectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelveredshift bins from $&lt;z&gt; = 2.2$ to $&lt;z&gt; = 4.4$, and scales from 0.001$\rm(km/s)^{-1}$ to $0.02 \rm(km/s)^{-1}$. we determine the methodological andinstrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements.  we provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurementsusing available hydrodynamical simulations. the improvement in precision overpreviously published results from sdss is a factor 2--3 for constraints onrelevant cosmological parameters. for a $\lambda$cdm model and using aconstraint on $h_0$ that encompasses measurements based on the local distanceladder and on cmb anisotropies, we infer $\sigma_8 =0.83\pm0.03$ and $n_s=0.97\pm0.02$ based on \ion{h}{i} absorption in the range $2.1&lt;z&lt;3.7$.

1309.2954	characterizing unknown systematics in large scale structure surveys	photometric large scale structure (lss) surveys probe the largest volumes inthe universe, but are inevitably limited by systematic uncertainties. imperfectphotometric calibration leads to biases in our measurements of the densityfields of lss tracers such as galaxies and quasars, and as a result incosmological parameter estimation. earlier studies have proposed usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices or cross-correlationsbetween different surveys to reduce the effects of such systematics. in thispaper we develop a method to characterize unknown systematics. we demonstratethat while we do not have sufficient information to correct for unknownsystematics in the data, we can obtain an estimate of their magnitude. wedefine a parameter to estimate contamination from unknown systematics usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices and propose discardingbins in the angular power spectrum that lie outside a certain contaminationtolerance level. we show that this method improves estimates of the bias usingsimulated data and further apply it to photometric luminous red galaxies in thesloan digital sky survey as a case study.

1309.7660	the large-scale distribution of cool gas around luminous red galaxies	we present a measurement of the correlation function between luminous redgalaxies and cool gas traced by mg ii \lambda \lambda 2796, 2803 absorption, onscales ranging from about 30 kpc to 20 mpc. the measurement is based oncross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at z~0.5 andthe flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 10^5 background quasarsfrom the sloan digital sky survey. we find that: (i) this galaxy-gascorrelation reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 mpc, consistent withthe expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to aregime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. assuming that,on average, the distribution of mg ii gas follows that of dark matter up to agas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accuratedescription of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale.within this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous redgalaxies to be about 10^{13.5} m_solar, in agreement with other methods. wealso find the mg ii gas-to-mass ratio around lrgs to be consistent with thecosmic value estimated on mpc scales. combining our galaxy-gas correlation andthe galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses we candirectly measure the mg ii gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reachthe same conclusion. (ii) from line-width estimates, we show that the velocitydispersion of the gas clouds also shows the expected 1- and 2-halo behaviors.on large scales the gas distribution follows the hubble flow, whereas on smallscales we observe the velocity dispersion of the mg ii gas clouds to be lowerthan that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo. thisis in line with the fact that cool clouds are subject to the pressure of thevirialized hot gas.

(2014) to the clustering ofphotometrically classified quasars. we carefully apply our methodology tomitigate known observational systematics and further remove angular bins thatare contaminated by unknown systematics. combining quasar data with thephotometric luminous red galaxy (lrg) sample of ross et al.

(2006). we measure themultipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in thesense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and theintegral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic powerspectrum and without the need to split the survey into sub-regions. the maincosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acousticoscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which aredistorted by the alcock-paczynski effect. together, these signals allow us toconstrain the distance ratio $d_v(z_{\rm eff})/r_s(z_d) = 13.89\pm 0.18$, thealcock-paczynski parameter $f_{\rm ap}(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.679\pm0.031$ and thegrowth rate of structure $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.419\pm0.044$at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. we did not find significantsystematic uncertainties for $d_v/r_s$ or $f_{\rm ap}$ but include a systematicerror for $f\sigma_8$ of $3.1\%$. combining our dataset with planck to testgeneral relativity (gr) through the simple $\gamma$-parameterisation, reveals a$\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the data and the prediction by gr. the tensionbetween our result and gr can be traced back to a tension in the clusteringamplitude $\sigma_8$ between cmass and planck.

1312.4841	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: including covariance matrix errors	we present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in theerror budget of baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) galaxyclustering measurements, revisiting data release 9 (dr9) analyses, anddescribing a method that is used in dr10/11 analyses presented in companionpapers. the precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important,due to the precision that boss can now reach: even using as many as 600 mockcatalogues to estimate covariance of 2-point clustering measurements can stilllead to an increase in the errors of ~20%, depending on how the cosmologicalparameters of interest are measured. in this paper we extend previous work onthis contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured byintegrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitparameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix.both are situations that previous analyses of boss have considered. we applythe formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) and redshift-spacedistortion (rsd) measurements from boss in our companion papers. to further aidthese analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for 2-pointmeasurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for bao,and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function foranisotropic-bao and rsd measurements.

1312.4854	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: cosmological implications of the full shape of the  clustering wedges in the data release 10 and 11 galaxy samples	we explore the cosmological implications of the angle-averaged correlationfunction, xi(s), and the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s) and xi_para(s), of thelowz and cmass galaxy samples from data release 10 and 11 of the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. our results show no significantevidence for a deviation from the standard lcdm model. the combination of theinformation from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmicmicrowave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the universeto omega_k = 0.0010 +- 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to sum m_nu &lt; 0.23 ev(95% confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species ton_eff=3.31 +- 0.27, and the dark energy equation of state to w_de = -1.051 +-0.076. these limits are further improved by adding information from type iasupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. in particular,this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent darkenergy equation of state, in which case we find w_de=-1.024 +- 0.052. weexplore the constraints on the growth-rate of cosmic structures assumingf(z)=omega_m(z)^gamma and obtain gamma=0.69 +- 0.15, in agreement with thepredictions from general relativity of gamma=0.55.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1312.4899	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey (boss): measuring growth rate and geometry with  anisotropic clustering	we use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 11 cmass sample to measurethe linear growth rate of structure, the hubble expansion rate and the comovingdistance scale. our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses an effectivevolume of 6.0 ${\rm gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. wefind $f\sigma_8 = 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $h = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}$ and $d_{\rm a} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm mpc}$when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. when we fix thebackground expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\lambda$cdm modelin agreement with recent planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$(6 per cent accuracy). while our measurements are generally consistent with thepredictions of $\lambda$cdm and general relativity, they mildly favor models inwhich the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what ispredicted by general relativity. combining our measurements with recent cosmicmicrowave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmologicalparameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. separatelyvarying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent accuracy)and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equationof state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. bothconstraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of $w=-1$ and$\gamma = 0.554$.

1312.4996	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: analysis of potential  systematics in fitting of baryon acoustic feature	extraction of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) to percent levelaccuracy is challenging and demands an understanding of many potentialsystematic to an accuracy well below 1 per cent, in order ensure that they donot combine significantly when compared to statistical error of the baomeasurement. sloan digital sky survey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) sdss data release eleven (dr11) reaches a distancemeasurement with $\sim 1\%$ statistical error and this prompts an extensivesearch for all possible sub-percent level systematic errors which could besafely ignored previously. in this paper, we analyze the potential systematicsin bao fitting methodology using mocks and data from boss dr10 and dr11. wedemonstrate the robustness of the fiducial multipole fitting methodology to beat $0.1\%-0.2\%$ level with a wide range of tests in mock galaxy catalogs pre-and post-reconstruction. we also find the dr10 and dr11 data from boss to berobust against changes in methodology at similar level. this systematic errorbudget is incorporated into the the error budget of baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) dr10 and dr11 bao measurements. of the wide rangeof changes we have investigated, we find that when fitting pre-reconstructeddata or mocks, the following changes have the largest effect on the best fitvalues of distance measurements both parallel and perpendicular to the line ofsight: (a) changes in non-linear correlation function template; (b) changes infitting range of the correlation function; (c) changes to the non-lineardamping model parameters. the priors applied do not matter in the estimates ofthe fitted errors as long as we restrict ourselves to physically meaningfulfitting regions.[abridged]

1408.1348	efficient reconstruction of linear baryon acoustic oscillations in  galaxy surveys	reconstructing an estimate of linear baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) froman evolved galaxy field has become a standard technique in recent analyses. bypartially removing non-linear damping caused by bulk motions, the real-spacebao peak in the correlation function is sharpened, and oscillations in thepower spectrum are visible to smaller scales. in turn these lead to strongermeasurements of the bao scale. future surveys are being designed assuming thatthis improvement has been applied, and this technique is therefore of criticalimportance for future bao measurements. a number of reconstruction techniquesare available, but the most widely used is a simple algorithm that decorrelateslarge-scale and small-scale modes approximately removing the bulk-flowdisplacements by moving the overdensity field (eisenstein et al. 2007;padmanabhan, white &amp; cohn 2009). we consider the practical implementation ofthis algorithm, looking at the efficiency of reconstruction as a function ofthe assumptions made for the bulk-flow scale, the shot noise level in a randomcatalogue used to quantify the mask and the method used to estimate thebulk-flow shifts. we also examine the efficiency of reconstruction againstexternal factors including galaxy density, volume and edge effects, andconsider their impact for future surveys. throughout we make use of the mockscatalogues created for the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) daterelease 11 samples covering 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 (cmass) and 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 (lowz),to empirically test these changes.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1412.4454	probing gravity at large scales through cmb lensing	we describe a methodology to probe gravity with the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) lensing convergence $\kappa$, specifically by measuring $e_g$,the ratio of the laplacian of the gravitational scalar potential differencewith the velocity divergence. using cmb lensing instead of galaxy-galaxylensing avoids intrinsic alignments while also lacking a hard limit on the lensredshift and significant uncertainties in the source plane. we model $e_g$ forgeneral relativity and modified gravity, finding that $e_g$ for $f(r)$ gravityshould be scale-dependent due to the scale-dependence of the growth rate $f$.next, we construct an estimator for $e_g$ in terms of the galaxy-cmb lensingand galaxy clustering angular power spectra, along with the rsd parameter$\beta$. we also forecast statistical errors for $e_g$ from the current planckcmb lensing map and the spectroscopic galaxy and quasar samples from the sloandigital sky survey data release 11, being 9% with galaxies and 8% when quasarsare included. we also find that upcoming spectroscopic and photometric surveys,combined with the final planck lensing map, can measure precisely the redshift-and scale-dependence of $e_g$ out to redshifts $z=2$ and higher, withphotometric surveys having an advantage due to their high number densities.advanced actpol's lensing map will increase the $e_g$ sensitivity even further.finally, we find that advanced actpol cross-correlated with spectroscopic(photometric) surveys can differentiate between general relativity and $f(r)$gravity at the level of $3\sigma$ ($13\sigma$). performing a $&lt;1$% measurementof $e_g$ requires a 10% precision in $\beta$ from euclid or lsst, currentlyachievable with a spectroscopic survey but difficult with only a photometricsurvey.

1501.05303	cosmic web reconstruction through density ridges: method and algorithm	the detection and characterization of filamentary structures in the cosmicweb allows cosmologists to constrain parameters that dictates the evolution ofthe universe. while many filament estimators have been proposed, they generallylack estimates of uncertainty, reducing their inferential power. in this paper,we demonstrate how one may apply the subspace constrained mean shift (scms)algorithm (ozertem and erdogmus (2011); genovese et al.

1504.02100	testing general relativity with growth rate measurement from sloan  digital sky survey iii baryon oscillations spectroscopic survey galaxies	the measured redshift ($z$) of an astronomical object is a combination ofhubble recession, gravitational redshift and peculiar velocity. the line ofsight distance to a galaxy inferred from redshift is affected by the peculiarvelocity component of galaxy redshift, which is observed as an anisotropy inthe correlation function. this anisotropy allows us to measure the lineargrowth rate of matter ($f\sigma_8$). we measure the $f\sigma_8$ at $z=0.57$using the cmass sample from data release 11 of sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss iii) baryon oscillations spectroscopic survey (boss). the galaxy sampleconsists of 690,826 massive galaxies in the redshift range 0.43-0.7 covering8498 deg$^2$. here we report the first simultaneous measurement of $f\sigma_8$and background cosmological parameters using convolution lagrangianperturbation theory (clpt) with gaussian streaming model (gsrsd). we arrive ata constraint of $f\sigma_8=0.462\pm0.041$ (9\% accuracy) at effective redshift($\bar{z}=0.57$) when we include planck cmb likelihood while marginalizing overall other cosmological parameters. we also measure $b\sigma_8=1.19\pm0.03$,$h(z=0.57)=89.2\pm3.6$ km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$ and $d_a(z=0.57)=1401\pm23$ mpc.our analysis also improves the constraint on $\omega_c h^2=0.1196\pm0.0009$ bya factor of 3 when compared to the planck only measurement($\omega_c h^2=0.1196\pm 0.0031$). our results are consistent with planck $\lambda$cdm-gr predictionand all other cmass measurements, even though our theoretical models are fairlydifferent. this consistency suggests that measurement of $f\sigma_8$ fromredshift space distortions at multiple redshifts will be a sensitive probe ofthe theory of gravity that is largely model independent, allowing us to placemodel-independent constraints on alternative models of gravity.

1505.00782	robust new statistic for fitting the baryon acoustic feature	we investigate the utility and robustness of a new statistic,$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$, for analyzing baryon acoustic oscillations(bao). we apply $\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$, introduced in xu et al.(2010), to mocks and data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)-iii baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) included in the sdss data releaseeleven (dr11). we fit the anisotropic clustering using the monopole andquadrupole of the $\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic in a mannersimilar to conventional multipole fitting methods using the correlationfunction as detailed in (xu et al. 2012). to test the performance of the$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic we compare our results to thoseobtained using the multipoles. the results are in agreement. we also conduct abrief investigation into some of the possible advantages of using the$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic for bao analysis. the$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ analysis matches the stability of themultipoles analysis in response to artificially introduced distortions in thedata, without using extra nuisance parameters to improve the fit. when appliedto data with systematics, the $\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic againmatches the performance of fitting the multipoles without using nuisanceparameters. in all the analyzed circumstances, we find that fitting the$\omega_{\ell}\left(r_{c}\right)$ statistic removes the requirement for extranuisance parameters.

0805.3580	constraints on local primordial non-gaussianity from large scale  structure	recent work has shown that the local non-gaussianity parameter f_nl induces ascale-dependent bias, whose amplitude is growing with scale. here we firstrederive this result within the context of peak-background split formalism andshow that it only depends on the assumption of universality of mass function,assuming halo bias only depends on mass. we then use extended press-schechterformalism to argue that this assumption may be violated and the scale dependentbias will depend on other properties, such as merging history of halos. inparticular, in the limit of recent mergers we find the effect is suppressed.next we use these predictions in conjunction with a compendium of large scaledata to put a limit on the value of f_nl. when combining all data assuming thathalo occupation depends only on halo mass, we get a limit of -29 ~ (-65)&lt; f_nl&lt; +70 ~(+93) at 95% (99.7%) confidence. while we use a wide range of datasets,our combined result is dominated by the signal from the sdss photometric quasarsample. if the latter are modeled as recent mergers then the limits weaken to-31 ~(-96) &lt; f_nl &lt; +70 ~ (+96) . these limits are comparable to the strongestcurrent limits from the wmap 5 year analysis, with no evidence of a positivesignal in f_nl. while the method needs to be thoroughly tested against largescale structure simulations with realistic quasar and galaxy formation models,our results indicate that this is a competitive method relative to cmb andshould be further pursued both observationally and theoretically.

1509.05034	testing deviations from $\lambda$cdm with growth rate measurements from  6 large scale structure surveys at $\mathbf{z=0.06}$ to 1	we use measurements from the planck satellite mission and galaxy redshiftsurveys over the last decade to test three of the basic assumptions of thestandard model of cosmology, $\lambda$cdm: the spatial curvature of theuniverse, the nature of dark energy and the laws of gravity on large scales. weobtain improved constraints on several scenarios that violate one or more ofthese assumptions. we measure $w_0=-0.94\pm0.17$ (18\% measurement) and$1+w_a=1.16\pm0.36$ (31\% measurement) for models with a time-dependentequation of state, which is an improvement over current best constraints\citep{aubourg2014}. in the context of modified gravity, we consider popularscalar tensor models as well as a parametrization of the growth factor. in thecase of one-parameter $f(r)$ gravity models with a $\lambda$cdm background, weconstrain $b_0 &lt; 1.36 \times 10^{-5} $ (1$\sigma$ c.l.), which is animprovement by a factor of 4 on the current best \citep{xu2015}. we provide thevery first constraint on the coupling parameters of general scalar-tensortheory and stringent constraint on the only free coupling parameter ofchameleon models. we also derive constraints on extended chameleon models,improving the constraint on the coupling by a factor of 6 on the current best\citep{hojjati2011} . we also measure $\gamma = 0.612 \pm 0.072$ (11.7\%measurement) for growth index parametrization. we improve all the currentconstraints by combining results from various galaxy redshift surveys in acoherent way, which includes a careful treatment of scale-dependence introducedby modified gravity.

1509.06376	detecting effects of filaments on galaxy properties in the sloan digital  sky survey iii	we study the effects of filaments on galaxy properties in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data release 12 using filaments from the `cosmic webreconstruction' catalogue (chen et al. 2015a), a publicly available filamentcatalogue for sdss. since filaments are tracers of medium-to-high densityregions, we expect that galaxy properties associated with the environment aredependent on the distance to the nearest filament. our analysis demonstrates ared galaxy or a high-mass galaxy tend to reside closer to filaments than a blueor low-mass galaxy. after adjusting the effect from stellar mass, on average,late-forming galaxies or large galaxies have a shorter distance to filamentsthan early-forming galaxies or small galaxies. for the main galaxy sample, allsignals are very significant ($&gt; 5\sigma$). for the lowz and cmass samples,most of the signals are significant (with $&gt; 3\sigma$). the filament effects weobserve persist until z = 0.7 (the edge of the cmass sample). comparing ourresults to those using the galaxy distances from redmapper galaxy clusters as areference, we find a similar result between filaments and clusters. ourfindings illustrate the strong correlation of galaxy properties with proximityto density ridges, strongly supporting the claim that density ridges are goodtracers of filaments.

1509.06443	cosmic web reconstruction through density ridges: catalogue	we construct a catalogue for filaments using a novel approach called scms(subspace constrained mean shift; ozertem &amp; erdogmus 2011; chen et al. 2015).scms is a gradient-based method that detects filaments through density ridges(smooth curves tracing high-density regions). a great advantage of scms is itsuncertainty measure, which allows an evaluation of the errors for the detectedfilaments. to detect filaments, we use data from the sloan digital sky survey,which consist of three galaxy samples: the nyu main galaxy sample (mgs), thelowz sample and the cmass sample. each of the three dataset covers differentredshift regions so that the combined sample allows detection of filaments upto z = 0.7. our filament catalogue consists of a sequence of two-dimensionalfilament maps at different redshifts that provide several useful statistics onthe evolution cosmic web. to construct the maps, we select spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxies within 0.050 &lt; z &lt; 0.700 and partition them into 130 bins.for each bin, we ignore the redshift, treating the galaxy observations as a 2-ddata and detect filaments using scms. the filament catalogue consists of 130individual 2-d filament maps, and each map comprises points on the detectedfilaments that describe the filamentary structures at a particular redshift. wealso apply our filament catalogue to investigate galaxy luminosity and itsrelation with distance to filament. using a volume-limited sample, we findstrong evidence (6.1$\sigma$ - 12.3$\sigma$) that galaxies close to filamentsare generally brighter than those at significant distance from filaments.

1509.06529	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey data release 12: galaxy  target selection and large scale structure catalogues	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), part of the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) iii project, has provided the largest survey of galaxyredshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshiftsmeasured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. keyto analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurementsis understanding the detailed properties of this sample. potential issuesinclude variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in thetargeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern ofspectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for whichredshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due toobservational systematics. we document here the target selection algorithmsused to create the galaxy samples that comprise boss. we also present thealgorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final datarelease (dr12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify thesurvey mask. the algorithms are an evolution of those used by the boss team toconstruct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accuratelyquantify the galaxy sample. the code used, designated mksample, is releasedwith this paper.

1510.06442	evidence for the kinematic sunyaev-ze\v{l}dovich effect with actpol and  velocity reconstruction from boss	we use microwave temperature maps from two seasons of data from the atacamacosmology telescope (actpol) at 146 ghz, together with the constant mass cmassgalaxy sample from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey to measure thekinematic sunyaev-ze\v{l}dovich (ksz) effect over the redshift range z = 0.4 -0.7. we use galaxy positions and the continuity equation to obtain areconstruction of the line-of-sight velocity field. we stack the cosmicmicrowave background temperature at the location of each halo, weighted by thecorresponding reconstructed velocity. the resulting best fit ksz model ispreferred over the no-ksz hypothesis at 3.3sigma and 2.9sigma for twoindependent velocity reconstruction methods, using 25,537 galaxies over 660square degrees. the effect of foregrounds that are uncorrelated with the galaxyvelocities is expected to be well below our signal, and residual thermalsunyaev-ze\v{l}dovich contamination is controlled by masking the most massiveclusters. finally, we discuss the systematics involved in converting ourmeasurement of the ksz amplitude into the mean free electron fraction of thehalos in our sample.

1512.06859	mapping the most massive overdensities through hydrogen (mammoth) i:  methodology	modern cosmology predicts that a galaxy overdensity is associated to a largereservoir of the intergalactic gas, which can be traced by the ly$\alpha$forest absorption. we have undertaken a systematic study of the relationbetween coherently strong intergalactic ly$\alpha$ absorption systems (coslas),which have highest optical depth ($\tau$) in $\tau$ distribution, and massoverdensities on the scales of $\sim$ 10 - 20 $h^{-1}$ comoving mpc. on suchlarge scales, our cosmological simulations show a strong correlation betweenthe effective optical depth ($\tau_{\rm{eff}}$) of the coslas and the 3-d massoverdensities. in moderate signal-to-noise spectra, however, the profiles ofcoslas can be confused with high column density absorbers. for $z&gt;2.6$, wherethe corresponding ly$\beta$ is redshifted to the optical, we have developed thetechnique to differentiate between these two alternatives. we have applied thistechnique to sdss-iii quasar survey at $z = 2.6$ - 3.3, and we present a sampleof five cosla candidates with $\tau_{\rm{eff}}$ on 15 $h^{-1}$ mpc greater than$4.5\times$ the mean optical depth. at lower redshifts of $z &lt; 2.6$, where thebackground quasar density is higher, the overdensity can be traced byintergalactic absorption groups using multiple sight lines. our overdensitysearches fully utilize the current and next generation of ly$\alpha$ forestsurveys which cover a survey volume of $&gt; (1\ h^{-1}$ gpc)$^3$. in addition,systems traced by coslas will build a uniform sample of the most massiveoverdensities at $z &gt; 2$ to constrain the models of structure formation, andoffer a unique laboratory to study the interactions between galaxyoverdensities and the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0511776	cluster ellipticities as a cosmological probe	we investigate the dependence of ellipticities of clusters of galaxies oncosmological parameters using large-scale cosmological simulations. wedetermine cluster ellipticities out to redshift unity for lcdm models withdifferent mean densities $\omega_m$ and amplitudes of mass fluctuation$\sigma_{8,0}$. the mean ellipticity increases monotonically with redshift forall models. larger values of $\sigma_{8,0}$, i.e., earlier cluster formationtime, produce lower ellipticities. the dependence of ellipticity on $\omega_m$is relatively weak in the range $0.2 \leq \omega_m \leq 0.5$ for high massclusters. the mean ellipticity $\bar{e}(z)$ decreases linearly with theamplitude of fluctuations at the cluster redshift $z$, nearly independent of$\omega_m$; on average, older clusters are more relaxed and are thus lesselliptical. the distribution of ellipticities about the mean is approximated bya gaussian, allowing a simple characterization of the evolution of ellipticitywith redshift as a function of cosmological parameters. at $z=0$, the meanellipticity of high mass clusters is approximated by $\bar{e}(z=0) =0.248-0.069 \sigma_{8,0} + 0.013 \omega_{m,0}$. this relation opens up thepossibility that, when compared with future observations of large clustersamples, the mean cluster ellipticity and its evolution could be used as a new,independent tool to constrain cosmological parameters, especially the amplitudeof mass fluctuations, $\sigma_{8,0}$.

0706.0520	constraints on the merging timescale of luminous red galaxies, or, where  do all the halos go?	in the lcdm cosmology dark matter halos grow primarily through the accretionof smaller halos. much of the mass in a halo of 10^14msun comes in throughaccretion of ~10^13msun halos. if each such halo hosted one luminous red galaxy(lrg) then the accretion of so many halos is at odds with the observed numberof lrgs in clusters unless these accreted lrgs merge or disrupt on relativelyshort timescales (~2gyr). these timescales are consistent with classicaldynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 lrgs have merged or disruptedwithin each halo more massive than 10^14msun by z=0. the total amount ofstellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent withobservations once the intracluster light (icl) is included. if disrupted lrgsbuild up the icl, then the hierarchical growth of massive halos implies that asubstantial amount of icl should also surround satellite lrgs, as suggested byrecent observations of the virgo cluster. finally, we point out that theseresults are entirely consistent with a non-evolving clustering strength andhalo occupation distribution, and note that observations of the latter in factsupport the hypothesis that merging/disruption of massive galaxies does indeedtake place at late times.

0706.0727	luminous red galaxy population in clusters at $0.2\le z\le 0.6$	we investigate statistical properties of lrgs in a sample of x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters at intermediate redshift ($0.2\le z\le0.6$). the lrgs areselected based on carefully designed color criteria, and the cluster membershipis assessed via photometric redshifts. as clusters and lrgs are both viewed aspromising tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution, understanding thedistribution of lrgs within clusters is an important issue.  our main findings include:  1. the halo occupation distribution of lrgs inside our cluster sample is$n(m) = k\times (m/10^{14})^{a}$ where $a=0.620\pm 0.105 $ and $k=1.425\pm0.285$ assuming a poisson distribution for $n(m)$.  2. the halo occupation distribution of lrgs ($n(m)$) and the satellitedistribution of lrgs ($n-1(m)$) are both consistent with being poisson. to bemore quantitative, we find $var(n)/&lt;n&gt;= 1.428\pm 0.351$ and $var(n-1)/&lt;n-1&gt; =1.823 \pm 0.496$  3. the radial profile of lrgs within clusters when fitted with a nfw profilegives a concentration of $17.5^{+7.1}_{-4.3}$ ($6.0^{+3.2}_{-1.9}$) including(excluding) blrgs (brightest lrgs).  we also discuss the implications of these observations on the evolution ofmassive galaxies in clusters.
