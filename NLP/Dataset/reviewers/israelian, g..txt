0902.3374	chemical abundances of 451 stars from the harps gto planet search  program: thin disc, thick disc, and planets	we present a uniform study of the chemical abundances of 12 elements (si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, co, ni, na, mg, and al) derived from the spectra of 451stars observed as part of one of the harps gto planet search programs. sixtyeight of these are planet-bearing stars. the main goals of our work are: i) theinvestigation of possible differences between the abundances of stars with andwithout planets; ii) the study of the possible differences in the abundances ofstars in the thin and the thick disc. we confirm that there is a systematicallyhigher metallicity in planet host stars, when compared to non planet-hosts,common to all studied species. we also found that there is no difference in thegalactic chemical evolution trends of the stars with and without planets. starsthat harbour planetary companions simply appear to be in the high metallicitytail of the distribution. we also confirm that neptunian and super-earth classplanets may be easier to find at lower metallicities. a statisticallysignificative abundance difference between stars of the thin and the thick discwas found for [fe/h] $&lt;$ 0. however, the populations from the thick and thethin disc cannot be clearly separated.

0909.0285	a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of host stars of transiting planets	the analysis of transiting extra-solar planets provides an enormous amount ofinformation about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. a preciseknowledge of the host stars is necessary to derive the planetary propertiesaccurately. the properties of the host stars, especially their chemicalcomposition, are also of interest in their own right. information about planetformation is inferred by, among others, correlations between differentparameters such as the orbital period and the metallicity of the host stars.the stellar properties studied should be derived as homogeneously as possible.the present work provides new, uniformly derived parameters for 13 host starsof transiting planets. effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulenceparameter, and iron abundance were derived from spectra of both highsignal-to-noise ratio and high resolution by assuming iron excitation andionization equilibria. for some stars, the new parameters differ from previousdeterminations, which is indicative of changes in the planetary radii. asystematic offset in the abundance scale with respect to previous assessmentsis found for the tres and hat objects. our abundance measurements areremarkably robust in terms of the uncertainties in surface gravities. the ironabundances measured in the present work are supplemented by all previousdeterminations using the same analysis technique. the distribution of ironabundance then agrees well with the known metal-rich distribution of planethost stars. to facilitate future studies, the spectroscopic results of thecurrent work are supplemented by the findings for other host stars oftransiting planets, for a total dataset of 50 objects.

1104.0512	beryllium abundances in stars with planets:extending the sample	context: chemical abundances of light elements as beryllium in planet-hoststars allow us to study the planet formation scenarios and/or investigatepossible surface pollution processes. aims: we present here an extension ofprevious beryllium abundance studies. the complete sample consists of 70 starshosting planets and 30 stars without known planetary companions. the aim ofthis paper is to further assess the trends found in previous studies with lessnumber of objects. this will provide more information on the processes ofdepletion and mixing of light elements in the interior of late type stars, andwill provide possible explanations for the abundance differences between starsthat host planets and "single" stars. methods: using high resolution uvesspectra, we measure beryllium abundances of 26 stars that host planets and 1"single" star mainly using the lambda 3131.065 a be ii line, by fittingsynthetic spectra to the observational data. we also compile berylliumabundance measurements of 44 stars hosting planets and 29 "single" stars fromthe literature, resulting in a final sample of 100 objects. results: we confirmthat the beryllium content is roughly the same in stars hosting planets and in"single" stars at temperatures teff &gt; 5700k. the sample is still small for teff&lt; 5500k, but it seems that the scatter in be abundances of dwarf stars isslightly higher at these cooler temperatures. conclusions: we search fordistinctive characteristics of planet hosts through correlations of beabundance versus li abundance, age, metallicity and oxygen abundance. thesecould provide some insight in the formation and evolution of planetary systems,but we did not find any clear correlation.

1201.3193	fluorine abundances in dwarf stars of the solar neighbourhood	in spite of many observational efforts aiming to characterize the chemicalevolution of our galaxy, not much is known about the origin of fluorine (f).models suggest that the f found in the galaxy might have been produced mainlyin three different ways, namely, type ii supernovae, asymptotic giant branchnucleosynthesis, or in the core of wolf-rayet stars. only a few observationalmeasurements of f abundances are available in the literature and mostly forobjects whose characteristics might hamper an accurate determination offluorine abundance (e.g.,complex mixing and nucleosynthesis processes,external/internal contamination). we derive the f abundances for a set of ninecool main-sequence dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood, based on an unblendedline of the hf molecule at 2.3 microns. in addition, we study the s-processelements of five of these stars. we acquire data using the high-resolutionir-spectrograph crires and gather feros data from the european southernobservatory archive. several of the analysed stars seem to be slightly fluorineenhanced with respect to the sun, although no correlation is found between thef abundance and the iron content. in addition, the most fluorine enriched starsare also yttrium and zirconium enriched, which suggests that agb fluorinenucleosynthesis is the dominant source of fluorine production for the observedstars. nevertheless, the correlation between [f/fe] and the s-elements israther weak and possibly masked by the uncertainties in the f abundancemeasurements. finally, we compare our derived f abundances to previousmeasurements of alpha-element and iron-peak element abundances. type ii corecollapse supernovae do not appear to be the main site of f production for ourtargets, as no correlation seems to exist between the [f/fe] and the [alpha/fe]ratios.

1205.6670	overabundance of alpha-elements in exoplanet host stars	we present the results for a chemical abundance analysis betweenplanet-hosting and stars without planets for 12 refractory elements for a totalof 1111 nearby fgk dwarf stars observed within the context of the harps gtoprograms. of these stars, 109 are known to harbour high-mass planetarycompanions and 26 stars are hosting exclusively neptunians and super-earths. wefound that the [x/fe] ratios for mg, al, si, sc, and ti both for giant andlow-mass planet hosts are systematically higher than those of comparison starsat low metallicities ([fe/h] &lt; from -0.2 to 0.1 dex depending on the element).the most evident discrepancy between planet-hosting and stars without planetsis observed for mg. our data suggest that the planet incidence is greater amongthe thick disk population than among the thin disk for mettallicities bellow-0.3 dex. after examining the [alpha/fe] trends of the planet host and non-hostsamples we conclude that a certain chemical composition, and not the galacticbirth place of the stars, is the determinating factor for that. the inspectionof the galactic orbital parameters and kinematics of the planet-hosting starsshows that neptunian hosts tend to belong to the "thicker" disk compared totheir high-mass planet-hosting counterparts.we also found that neptunian hostsfollow the distribution of high-alpha stars in the uw vs v velocities space,but they are more enhanced in mg than high-alpha stars without planetarycompanions. our results indicate that some metals other than iron may also havean important contribution to planet formation if the amount of iron is low.these results may provide strong constraints for the models of planetformation, especially for planets with low mass.

1207.2388	chemical abundances of 1111 fgk stars from the harps gto planet search  program.galactic stellar populations and planets	we performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12 refractoryelements (na, mg, al, si, ca, ti, cr, ni, co, sc, mn and v) for a sample of1111 fgk dwarf stars from the harps gto planet search program. 109 of thesestars are known to harbour giant planetary companions and 26 stars are hostingexclusively neptunians and super-earths. the main goals of this paper are i) toinvestigate whether there are any differences between the elemental abundancetrends for stars of different stellar populations; ii) to characterise theplanet host and non-host samples in term of their [x/h]. the extensive study ofthis sample, focused on the abundance differences between stars with andwithout planets will be presented in a parallel paper. the equivalent widths ofspectral lines are automatically measured from harps spectra with the arescode. the abundances of the chemical elements are determined using a lteabundance analysis relative to the sun, with the 2010 revised version of thespectral synthesis code moog and a grid of kurucz atlas9 atmospheres. toseparate the galactic stellar populations we applied both a purely kinematicalapproach and a chemical method. we found that the chemically separated (basedon the mg, si, and ti abundances) thin and thick discs are also chemicallydisjunct for al, sc, co and ca. some bifurcation might also exist for na, v,ni, and mn, but there is no clear boundary of their [x/fe] ratios. we confirmthat an overabundance in giant-planet host stars is clear for all the studiedelements.we also confirm that stars hosting only neptunian-like planets may beeasier to detect around stars with similar metallicities as non-planet hosts,although for some elements (particulary alpha-elements) the lower limit of[x/h] are very abrupt.

1209.6272	exploring the alpha-enhancement of metal-poor planet-hosting stars. the  kepler and harps samples	recent studies showed that at low metallicities doppler-detectedplanet-hosting stars have preferably high alpha-content and belong to the thickdisk. we used the reconnaissance spectra of 87 kepler planet candidates anddata available from the harps planet search survey to explore this phenomena.using the traditional spectroscopic abundance analysis methods we derived ti,ca, and cr abundances for the kepler stars. in the metallicity region -0.65 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; -0.3 dex the fraction of ti-enhanced thick-disk harps planet harboringstars is 12.3 +/- 4.1 % and for their thin-disk counterparts this fraction is2.2 +/- 1.3 %. the binomial statistics gives a probability of 0.008 that thiscould have occurred by chance. combining the two samples (harps + kepler)reinforces the significance of this result (p ~ 99.97 %). since most of thesestars are harboring small-mass/size planets we can assume that, althoughterrestrial planets can be found at low-iron regime, they are mostly enhancedby alpha-elements. this implies that early formation of rocky planets could getstarted in the galactic thick disk, where the chemical conditions for theirformation were more favorable.

1307.7870	new and updated stellar parameters for 71 evolved planet hosts. on the  metallicity - giant planet connection	it is still being debated whether the well-known metallicity - giant planetcorrelation for dwarf stars is also valid for giant stars. for this reason,having precise metallicities is very important. different methods can providedifferent results that lead to discrepancies in the analysis of planet hosts.to study the impact of different analyses on the metallicity scale for evolvedstars, we compare different iron line lists to use in the atmospheric parameterderivation of evolved stars. therefore, we use a sample of 71 evolved starswith planets. with these new homogeneous parameters, we revisit the metallicity- giant planet connection for evolved stars. a spectroscopic analysis based onkurucz models in local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) was performed throughthe moog code to derive the atmospheric parameters. two different iron linelist sets were used, one built for cool fgk stars in general, and the other forgiant fgk stars. masses were calculated through isochrone fitting, using thepadova models. kolmogorov-smirnov tests (k-s tests) were then performed on themetallicity distributions of various different samples of evolved stars and redgiants. all parameters compare well using a line list set, designedspecifically for cool and solar-like stars to provide more accuratetemperatures. all parameters derived with this line list set are preferred andare thus adopted for future analysis. we find that evolved planet hosts aremore metal-poor than dwarf stars with giant planets. however, a bias in giantstellar samples that are searched for planets is present. because of a colourcut-off, metal-rich low-gravity stars are left out of the samples, making ithard to compare dwarf stars with giant stars. furthermore, no metallicityenhancement is found for red giants with planets ($\log g &lt; 3.0$\,dex) withrespect to red giants without planets.

1311.2417	orbital and physical properties of planets and their hosts: new insights  on planet formation and evolution	we explore the relations between physical and orbital properties of planetsand properties of their host stars to identify the main observable signaturesof the formation and evolution processes of planetary systems. we use a largesample of fgk dwarf planet hosts with stellar parameters derived in ahomogeneous way from the sweet-cat database to study the relation betweenstellar metallicity and position of planets in the period-mass diagram. in thesecond part we use all the rv-detected planets orbiting fgk stars to explorethe role of planet-disk and planet-planet interaction on the evolution oforbital properties of planets with masses above 1mjup. we show that planetsorbiting metal-poor stars have longer periods than those in metal-rich systems.this trend is valid for masses at least from 10mearth to 4mjup. earth-likeplanets orbiting metal-rich stars always show shorter periods (fewer than 20days) than those orbiting metal-poor stars. we also found statisticallysignificant evidence that very high mass giants have on average more eccentricorbits than giant planets with lower mass.finally, we show that theeccentricity of planets with masses higher than 4mjup tends to be lower forplanets with shorter periods. our results suggest that the planets in the p-mpdiagram are evolving differently because of a mechanism that operates over awide range of planetary masses. this mechanism is stronger or weaker dependingon the metallicity of the respective system. one possibility is that planets inmetal-poor disks form farther out from their central star and/or they formlater and do not have time to migrate as far as the planets in metal-richsystems. the trends and dependencies obtained for very high mass planetarysystems suggest that planet-disk interaction is a very important andorbit-shaping mechanism for planets in the high-mass domain. shortened.

1404.0824	chemical abundances of stars with brown-dwarf companions	it is well-known that stars with giant planets are on average more metal-richthan stars without giant planets, whereas stars with detected low-mass planetsdo not need to be metal-rich. with the aim of studying the weak boundary thatseparates giant planets and brown dwarfs (bds) and their formation mechanism,we analyze the spectra of a sample of stars with already confirmed bdcompanions both by radial velocity and astrometry. we employ standard andautomatic tools to perform an ew-based analysis and to derive chemicalabundances from coralie spectra of stars with bd companions. we compare theseabundances with those of stars without detected planets and with low-mass andgiant-mass planets. we find that stars with bds do not have metallicities andchemical abundances similar to those of giant-planet hosts but they resemblethe composition of stars with low-mass planets. the distribution of meanabundances of $\alpha$-elements and iron peak elements of stars with bdsexhibit a peak at about solar abundance whereas for stars with low-mass andhigh-mass planets the [x$_\alpha$/h] and [x$_{\rm fe}$/h] peak abundancesremain at $\sim -0.1$~dex and $\sim +0.15$~dex, respectively. we display theseelement abundances for stars with low-mass and high-mass planets, and bdsversus the minimum mass, $m_c \sin i$, of the most-massive substellar companionin each system, and we find a maximum in $\alpha$-element as well as fe-peakabundances at $m_c \sin i \sim 1.35\pm 0.20$ jupiter masses. we discuss theimplication of these results in the context of the formation scenario of bds incomparison with that of giant planets.

1404.4514	on the origin of stars with and without planets. tc trends and clues to  galactic evolution	we explore a sample of 148 solar-like stars to search for a possiblecorrelation between the slopes of the abundance trends versus condensationtemperature (known as the tc slope) with stellar parameters and galacticorbital parameters in order to understand the nature of the peculiar chemicalsignatures of these stars and the possible connection with planet formation. wefind that the tc slope significantly correlates (at more than 4sigma) with thestellar age and the stellar surface gravity. we also find tentative evidencethat the tc slope correlates with the mean galactocentric distance of the stars(rmean), suggesting that those stars that originated in the inner galaxy havefewer refractory elements relative to the volatiles. while the average tc slopefor planet-hosting solar analogs is steeper than that of their counterpartswithout planets, this difference probably reflects the difference in their ageand rmean. we conclude that the age and probably the galactic birth place aredeterminant to establish the star's chemical properties. old stars (and starswith inner disk origin) have a lower refractory-to-volatile ratio.

1410.7594	stars with and without planets: where do they come from?	a long and thorough investigation of chemical abundances of planet-hostingstars that lasted for more than a decade has finally beared fruit. we explore asample of 148 solar-like stars to search for a possible correlation between theslopes of the abundance trends versus condensation temperature (known as the tcslope) both with stellar parameters and galactic orbital parameters in order tounderstand the nature of the peculiar chemical signatures of these stars andthe possible connection with planet formation. we find that the tc slopecorrelates at a significant level (at more than 4sigma) with the stellar ageand the stellar surface gravity. we also find tentative evidence that the tcslope correlates with the mean galactocentric distance of the stars (rmean),suggesting that stars that originated in the inner galaxy have fewer refractoryelements relative to the volatile ones. we found that the chemicalpeculiarities (small refractory-to-volatile ratio) of planet-hosting stars ismerely a reflection of their older age and their inner galaxy origin. weconclude that the stellar age and probably galactic birth place are key toestablish the abundances of some specific elements.

1412.2980	chemical abundances of the secondary star in the neutron star x-ray  binary cygnus x-2	we present ues@wht high-resolution spectra of the low-mass x-ray binary(lmxb) cygnus x-2. we have derived the stellar parameters of the secondary starusing $\chi^{2}$ minimisation procedure, and taking into account any possibleveiling from the accretion disk. we determine a metallicity higher than solar([fe/h]$=0.27\pm0.19$), as seen also in the neutron star x-ray binary centaurusx-4. the high-quality of the secondary's spectrum allow us to determine thechemical abundances of o, mg, si, ca, s, ti, fe and ni. we found that some$\alpha$-elements (mg, si, s, ti) are enhanced, consistent with a scenario ofcontamination of the secondary star during the supernova event. surprisinglyoxygen appears to be under-abundant, whereas enhanced abundances of fe and niare measured. assuming that these abundances come from matter that has beenprocessed in the sn and then captured by the secondary star, we exploredifferent sn explosion scenarios with diverse geometries. a non-sphericallysymmetric sn explosion, with a low mass cut, seems to reproduce better theobserved abundance pattern of the secondary star compared to the sphericalcase.

1412.4618	li abundances in f stars: planets, rotation and galactic evolution	we find that hot jupiter host stars within the t$_\mathrm{eff}$ range5900-6300k show lower li abundances, by 0.14 dex, than stars without detectedplanets. this offset has a significance at the level 7$\sigma$, pointing to astronger effect of planet formation on li abundances when the planets are moremassive and migrate close to the star. however, we also find that the average v\textit{sin}i of (a fraction of) stars with hot jupiters is higher on averagethan for single stars in the same t$_\mathrm{eff}$ region, suggesting thatrotationally-induced mixing (and not the presence of planets) might be thecause for a greater depletion of li. we confirm that the mass-metallicitydependence of the li dip is extended towards [fe/h] $\sim$ 0.4 dex (beginningat [fe/h] $\sim$ -0.4 dex for our stars) and that probably reflects themass-metallicity correlation of stars of the same t$_\mathrm{eff}$ on the mainsequence. we find that for the youngest stars ($&lt;$ 1.5 gyr) around the li dip,the depletion of li increases with v \textit{sin}i values, as proposed byrotationally-induced depletion models. this suggests that the li dip consistsof fast rotators at young ages whereas the most li-depleted old stars showlower rotation rates (probably caused by the spin-down during their longlifes). we have also explored the li evolution with [fe/h] taking advantage ofthe metal-rich stars included in our sample. we find that li abundance reachesits maximum around solar metallicity but decreases in the most metal-richstars, as predicted by some models of li galactic production.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1503.02556	determination of the spectroscopic stellar parameters for 257 field  giant stars	the study of stellar parameters of planet-hosting stars, such as metallicityand chemical abundances, help us to understand the theory of planet formationand stellar evolution. here, we present a catalogue of accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and iron abundances for a sample of 257 k and g fieldevolved stars that are being surveyed for planets using preciseradial--velocity measurements as part of the coralie programme to search forplanets around giants. the analysis was done using a set of high--resolutionand high--signal-to-noise ultraviolet and visible echelle spectrograph spectra.the stellar parameters were derived using fe i and ii ionization and excitationequilibrium methods. to take into account possible effects related to thechoice of the lines on the derived parameters, we used three different ironline-list sets in our analysis, and the results differ among themselves by asmall factor for most of stars. {for those stars with previous literatureparameter estimates, we found very good agreement with our own values.} in thepresent catalogue we are providing new precise spectroscopic measurements ofeffective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence, and metallicity for190 stars for which it has not been found or published in previous articles.

1503.08346	chemical abundances and kinematics of 257 g-, k-type field giants.  setting a base for further analysis of giant-planet properties orbiting  evolved stars	we performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12 refractoryelements (na, mg, al, si, ca, ti, cr, ni, co, sc, mn, and v) for a sample of257 g- and k-type evolved stars from the coralie planet search program. todate, only one of these stars is known to harbor a planetary companion. weaimed to characterize this large sample of evolved stars in terms of chemicalabundances and kinematics, thus setting a solid base for further analysis ofplanetary properties around giant stars. this sample, being homogeneouslyanalyzed, can be used as a comparison sample for other planet-related studies,as well as for different type of studies related to stellar and galaxyastrophysics. the abundances of the chemical elements were determined using anlte abundance analysis relative to the sun, with the spectral synthesis codemoog and a grid of kurucz atlas9 atmospheres. to separate the galactic stellarpopulations both a purely kinematical approach and a chemical method wereapplied. we confirm the overabundance of na in giant stars compared to thefield fgk dwarfs. this enhancement might have a stellar evolutionary character,but departures from lte may also produce a similar enhancement. our chemicalseparation of stellar populations also suggests a "gap" in metallicity betweenthe thick-disk and high-alpha metal-rich stars, as previously observed indwarfs sample from harps. the present sample, as most of the giant starsamples, also suffers from the b - v colour cut-off, which excludes low-log gstars with high metallicities, and high-logg star with low-[fe/h]. for futurestudies of planet occurrence dependence on stellar metallicity around theseevolved stars we suggest to use a sub-sample of stars in a "cut-rectangle" inthe logg - [fe/h] diagram to overcome the aforementioned issue.

1508.04970	from stellar to planetary composition: galactic chemical evolution of  mg/si mineralogical ratio	the main goal of this work is to study element ratios that are important forthe formation of planets of different masses. we study potential correlationsbetween the existence of planetary companions and the relative elementalabundances of their host stars. we use a large sample of fgk-type dwarf starsfor which precise mg, si, and fe abundances have been derived using harpshigh-resolution and high-quality data. a first analysis of the data suggeststhat low-mass planet host stars show higher [mg/si] ratios, while giant planethosts present [mg/si] that is lower than field stars. however, we found thatthe [mg/si] ratio significantly depends on metallicity through galacticchemical evolution. after removing the galactic evolution trend only thedifference in the [mg/si] elemental ratio between low-mass planet hosts andnon-hosts was present in a significant way. these results suggests thatlow-mass planets are more prevalent around stars with high [mg/si]. our resultsdemonstrate the importance of galactic chemical evolution and indicate that itmay play an important role in the planetary internal structure and composition.

1509.02419	identifying the best iron-peak and $\alpha$-capture elements for  chemical tagging: the impact of the number of lines on measured scatter	the main goal of this work is to explore which elements carry the mostinformation about the birth origin of stars and as such that are best suitedfor chemical tagging. we explored different techniques to minimize the effectof outlier value lines in the abundances by using ni abundances derived for1111 fgk type stars.we evaluated how the limited number of spectral lines canaffect the final chemical abundance. then we were able to make an efficienteven footing comparison of the [x/fe] scatter between the elements that havedifferent number of observable spectral lines in the studied spectra. we foundthat the most efficient way of calculating the average abundance of elementswhen several spectral lines are available is to use a weighted mean (wm) whereas a weight we considered the distance from the median abundance. this methodcan be effectively used without removing suspected outlier lines.we showed thatwhen the same number of lines is used to determine chemical abundances, the[x/fe] star-to-star scatter for iron group and $\alpha$-capture elements isalmost the same. on top of this, but at a lower level the largest scatter wasobserved for al and the smallest for cr and ni. we recommend caution whencomparing [x/fe] scatters among elements that have a different number ofspectral lines available. a meaningful comparison is necessary to identifyelements that show the largest intrinsic scatter and can be thus used forchemical tagging.

0705.2693	the black hole binary nova scorpii 1994 (gro j1655-40): an improved  chemical analysis	the chemical analysis of secondary stars of low mass x-ray binaries providesan opportunity to study the formation processes of compact objects, eitherblack holes or neutron stars. following the discovery of overabundances of$\alpha$-elements in the hires/keck spectrum of the secondary star of novascorpii 1994 (israelian et al. 1999), we obtained uves/vlt high-resolutionspectroscopy with the aim of performing a detailed abundance analysis of thissecondary star. using a $\chi2$-minimization procedure and a grid of syntheticspectra, we derive the stellar parameters and atmospheric abundances of o, mg,al, ca, ti, fe and ni, using a new uves spectrum and the hires spectrum.theabundances of al, ca, ti, fe and ni seem to be consistent with solar values,whereas na, and especially o, mg, si and s are significantly enhanced incomparison with galactic trends of these elements. a comparison withspherically and non-spherically symmetric supernova explosion models mayprovide stringent constraints to the model parameters as mass-cut and theexplosion energy, in particular from the relative abundances of si, s, ca, ti,fe and ni. most probably the black hole in this system formed in a hypernovaexplosion of a 30--35 \msun progenitor star with a mass-cut in the range 2--3.5\msun. however, these models produce abundances of al and na almost ten timeshigher than the observed values.

astro-ph;0003361	a theory of gamma-ray bursts	we present a specific scenario for the link between grb and hypernovae, basedon blandford-znajek extraction of black-hole spin energy. such a mechanismrequires a high angular momentum in the progenitor object. the observedassociation of gamma-ray bursts with type ibc supernovae leads us to considermassive helium stars that form black holes at the end of their lives asprogenitors. we combine the numerical work of macfadyen &amp; woosley with analyticcalculations, to show that about 1e53 erg each are available to drive the fastgrb ejecta and the supernova. the grb ejecta are driven by the power outputthrough the open field lines, whereas the supernova is powered by closed filedlines and jet shocks. we also present a much simplified approximate derivationof these energetics.  helium stars that leave massive black-hole remnants in special ways, namelyvia soft x-ray transients or very massive wnl stars. since binaries naturallyhave high angular momentum, we propose a link between black-hole transients andgamma-ray bursts. recent observations of one such transient, gro j1655-40/novascorpii 1994, explicitly support this connection: its high space velocityindicates that substantial mass was ejected in the formation of the black hole,and the overabundance of alpha-nuclei, especially sulphur, indicates that theexplosion energy was extreme, as in sn 1998bw/grb 980425.

astro-ph;0101032	oxygen in the very early galaxy	oxygen abundances in a sample of ultra-metal-poor subdwarfs have been derivedfrom measurements of the oxygen triplet at 7771--5 a and oh lines in the nearuv performed in high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra obtained withwht/ues, kecki/hires, and vlt/uves. our fe abundances were derived in lte andthen corrected for nlte effects following thevenin and idiart (1999). the newoxygen abundances confirm previous findings for a progressive linear rise inthe oxygen-to-iron ratio with a slope -0.33+-0.02 from solar metallicity to[fe/h] -3. a slightly higher slope would be obtained if the fe nlte correctionswere not considered. below [fe/h]= -2.5 our stars show [o/fe] ratios as high as~ 1.17 (g64-12), which can be interpreted as evidence for oxygen overproductionin the very early epoch of the formation of the halo, possibly associated withsupernova events with very massive progenitor stars. we show that the argumentsagainst this linear trend given by fulbright and kraft (1999), based on the ltefe analysis of two metal-poor stars cannot be sustained when an nlte analysisis performed. using 1-d models our analysis of three oxygen indicatorsavailable for bd +23 3130 gives consistent abundances within 0.16 dex andaverage [o/fe] ratio of 0.91.

astro-ph;0105216	the metal-rich nature of stars with planets	with the goal of confirming the metallicity "excess" present in stars withplanetary-mass companions, we present in this paper a high-precisionspectroscopic study of a sample of dwarfs included in the coralie extrasolarplanet survey. the targets were chosen according to the basic criteria that 1)they formed part of a limited volume and 2) they did not present the signatureof a planetary host companion. a few stars with planets were also observed andanalysed; namely, hd 6434, hd 13445, hd 16141, hd 17051, hd 19994, hd 22049, hd28185, hd 38529, hd 52265, hd 190228, hd 210277 and hd 217107. for some ofthese objects there had been no previous spectroscopic studies. thespectroscopic analysis was done using the same technique as in previous work onthe metallicity of stars with planets, thereby permitting a direct comparisonof the results. the work described in this paper thus represents the firstuniform and unbiased comparison between stars with and without planetary-masscompanions in a volume-limited sample. the results show that 1) stars withplanets are significantly metal-rich, and 2) that the source of the metallicityis most probably "primordial". the results presented here may impose seriousconstraints on planetary system formation and evolution models.

astro-ph;0408109	beryllium anomalies in solar-type field stars	we present a study of beryllium (be) abundances in a large sample of fieldsolar-type dwarfs and sub-giants spanning a large range of effectivetemperatures. the analysis shows that be is severely depleted for f stars, asexpected by the light-element depletion models. however, we also show thatberyllium abundances decrease with decreasing temperature for stars cooler than$\sim$6000 k, a result that cannot be explained by current theoretical modelsincluding rotational mixing, but that is, at least in part, expected from themodels that take into account internal wave physics. in particular, the lightelement abundances of the coolest and youngest stars in our sample suggest thatbe, as well as lithium (li), has already been burned early during theirevolution. furthermore, we find strong evidence for the existence of a be-gapfor solar-temperature stars. the analysis of li and be abundances in thesub-giants of our sample also shows the presence of one case that has stilldetectable amounts of li, while be is severely depleted. finally, we comparethe derived be abundances with li abundances derived using the same set ofstellar parameters. this gives us the possibility to explore the temperaturesfor which the onset of li and be depletion occurs.

astro-ph;0502455	on the kinematics of the neutron star low mass x-ray binary cen x-4	we present the first determination of the proper motion of the neutron starlow mass x-ray binary {cen x-4} measured from relative astrometry of thesecondary star using optical images at different epochs. we determine thegalactic space velocity components of the system and find them to besignificantly different from the mean values that characterize the kinematicsof stars belonging to the halo, and the thin and the thick disc of the galaxy.the high metallicity of the secondary star of the system rules out a haloorigin and indicates that the system probably originated in the galactic disc.a statistical analysis of the galactocentric motion revealed that this binarymoves in a highly eccentric ($e\simeq 0.85\pm0.1$) orbit with an inclination of$\simeq 110^\circ$ to the galactic plane. the large galactic space velocitycomponents strongly support that a high natal kick as a result of a supernovaexplosion could have propelled the system into such an orbit from a birth placein the galactic disc. the high li abundance in the secondary, comparable tothat of stars in star forming regions and young stellar clusters like thepleiades, may suggest a relatively recent formation of the system. followingthe orbit backwards in time, we found that the system could have been in theinner regions of the galactic disc $\sim$100--200 myr ago. the neutron starmight have formed at that moment. however, we cannot rule out the possibilitythat the system formed at a much earlier time if a li production mechanismexists in this lmxb.

astro-ph;0504157	abundances of na, mg and al in stars with giant planets	we present na, mg and al abundances in a set of 98 stars with known giantplanets, and in a comparison sample of 41 ``single'' stars. the results showthat the [x/h] abundances (with x = na, mg and al) are, on average, higher instars with giant planets, a result similar to the one found for iron. however,we did not find any strong difference in the [x/fe] ratios, for a fixed [fe/h],between the two samples of stars in the region where the samples overlap.finally, the data was used to study the galactic chemical evolution trends forna, mg and al, and to discuss the possible influence of planets on thisevolution. the results, in general similar to the ones obtained by otherauthors, show that the [x/fe] ratios all decrease as a function of metallicityup to solar values. while for mg and al this trend then becomes relativelyconstant, for na we find indications of an upturn up to [fe/h] values close to0.25dex. for metallicities above this value the [na/fe] becomes constant.

astro-ph;0504341	outbursts on normal stars. fh leo misclassified as a novalike variable	we present high resolution spectroscopy of the common proper motion system fhleo (components hd 96273 and bd+07 2411b), which has been classified as anovalike variable due to an outburst observed by hipparcos, and we present andreview the available photometry. we show from our spectra that neither star canpossibly be a cataclysmic variable, instead they are perfectly normal late-fand early-g stars. we measured their radial velocities and derived theatmospheric fundamental parameters, abundances of several elements includingfe, ni, cr, co, v, sc, ti, ca and mg, and we derive the age of the system. fromour analysis we conclude that the stars do indeed constitute a physical binary.however, the observed outburst cannot be readily explained. we examine severalexplanations, including pollution with scattered light from jupiter, binarity,microlensing, background supernovae, interaction with unseen companions andplanetary engulfment. while no explanation is fully satisfactory, the scatteredlight and star-planet interaction scenarios emerge as the least unlikely ones,and we give suggestions for further study.

astro-ph;0509326	oxygen abundances in planet-harbouring stars. comparison of different  abundance indicators	we present a detailed and uniform study of oxygen abundances in 155 solartype stars, 96 of which are planet hosts and 59 of which form part of avolume-limited comparison sample with no known planets. ew measurements werecarried out for the [o i] 6300 \aa line and the o i triplet, and spectralsynthesis was performed for several oh lines. nlte corrections were calculatedand applied to the lte abundance results derived from the o i 7771-5 \aa\triplet. abundances from [o i], the o i triplet and near-uv oh were obtained in103, 87 and 77 dwarfs, respectively. we present the first detailed and uniformcomparison of these three oxygen indicators in a large sample of solar-typestars. there is good agreement between the [o/h] ratios from forbidden and ohlines, while the nlte triplet shows a systematically lower abundance. we foundthat discrepancies between oh, [o i] and the o i triplet do not exceed 0.2 dexin most cases. we have studied abundance trends in planet host and comparisonsample stars, and no obvious anomalies related to the presence of planets havebeen detected. all three indicators show that, on average, [o/fe] decreaseswith [fe/h] in the metallicity range -0.8&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0.5. the planet host starspresent an average oxygen overabundance of 0.1-0.2dex with respect to thecomparison sample.

astro-ph;0512219	abundances of refractory elements in the atmospheres of stars with  extrasolar planets	this work presents a uniform and homogeneous study of chemical abundances ofrefractory elements in 101 stars with and 94 without known planetarycompanions. we carry out an in-depth investigation of the abundances of si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, co, ni, na, mg and al. the new comparison sample, spanningthe metallicity range -0.70&lt; [fe/h]&lt; 0.50, fills the gap that previouslyexisted, mainly at high metallicities, in the number of stars without knownplanets. we used an enlarged set of data including new observations, especiallyfor the field ``single'' comparison stars. the line list previously studied byother authors was improved: on average we analysed 90 spectral lines in everyspectrum and carefully measured more than 16600 equivalent widths (ew) tocalculate the abundances. we investigate possible differences between thechemical abundances of the two groups of stars, both with and without planets.the results are globally comparable to those obtained by other authors, and inmost cases the abundance trends of planet-host stars are very similar to thoseof the comparison sample. this work represents a step towards the comprehensionof recently discovered planetary systems. these results could also be usefulfor verifying galactic models at high metallicities and consequently improveour knowledge of stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0606758	chemical abundances for the transiting planet host stars ogle-tr-10, 56,  111, 113, 132 and tres-1. abundances in different galactic populations	we used the uves spectrograph (vlt-ut2 telescope) to obtain high-resolutionspectra of 6 stars hosting transiting planets, namely for ogle-tr-10, 56, 111,113, 132 and tres-1. the spectra are now used to derive and discuss thechemical abundances for c, o, na, mg, al, si, s, ca, sc, ti, v, cr, mn, co, ni,cu and zn. abundances were derived in lte, using 1-d plane-parallel kuruczmodel atmospheres. for s, zn and cu we used a spectral synthesis procedure,while for the remaining cases the abundances were derived from measurements ofline-equivalent widths. the resulting abundances are compared with those foundfor stars in the solar neighborhood. distances and galactic coordinates areestimated for the stars. we conclude that besides being particularlymetal-rich, with small possible exceptions ogle-tr-10, 56, 111, 113, 132 andtres-1 are chemically undistinguishable from the field (thin disk) starsregarding their [x/fe] abundances. this is particularly relevant for the mostdistant of the targets, located at up to ~2 kpc from the sun. we also did notfind any correlation between the abundances and the condensation temperature ofthe elements, an evidence that strong accretion of planetary-like material,tentatively connected to planetary migration, did not occur.

astro-ph;0608669	kinematics of planet-host stars and their relation with dynamical  streams in the solar neighbourhood	we present a detailed study on the kinematics of metal-rich stars with andwithout planets, and their relation with the hyades, sirius and herculesdynamical streams in the solar neighbourhood. accurate kinematics have beenderived for all the stars belonging to the coralie planet search survey. weused precise radial velocity measurements and ccf parameters from the coraliedatabase, and parallaxes, photometry and proper motions from the hipparcos andtycho-2 catalogues. the location of stars with planets in the thin or thickdiscs has been analysed using both kinematic and chemical constraints. wecompare the kinematic behaviour of known planet-host stars to the remainingtargets belonging to the volume-limited sample, in particular to its metal-richpopulation. the high average metallicity of the hyades stream is confirmed. theplanet-host targets show a kinematic behaviour similar to that of themetal-rich comparison subsample, rather than to that of the comparison sampleas a whole, thus supporting a primordial origin for the metal excess observedin stars with known planetary companions. according to the scenarios proposedas an explanation for the dynamical streams, systems with giant planets couldhave formed more easily in metal-rich inner galactic regions and then beenbrought into the solar neighbourhood by dynamical streams.

astro-ph;0609259	on the age of stars harboring transiting planets	results of photometric surveys have brought to light the existence of apopulation of giant planets orbiting their host stars even closer than the hotjupiters (hj), with orbital periods below 3 days. the reason why radialvelocity surveys were not able to detect these very-hot jupiters (vhj) is underdiscussion. a possible explanation is that these close-in planets areshort-lived, being evaporated on short time-scales due to uv flux of their hoststars. in this case, stars hosting transiting vhj planets would besystematically younger than those in the radial velocity sample. we have usedthe uves spectrograph (vlt-ut2 telescope) to obtain high resolution spectra of5 faint stars hosting transiting planets, namely, ogle-tr-10, 56, 111, 113 andtres-1. previously obtained coralie spectra of hd189733, and published data onthe other transiting planet-hosts were also used. the immediate objective is toestimate ages via li abundances, using the ca ii activity-age relation, andfrom the analysis of the stellar rotational velocity. for the stars for whichwe have spectra, li abundances were computed as in israelian et al. (2004)using the stellar parameters derived in santos et al. (2006). the chromosphericactivity index $s_{us}$ was built as the ratio of the flux within the core ofthe ca ii h &amp; k lines and the flux in two nearby continuum regions. the index$s_{us}$ was calibrated to mount wilson index $s_{mw}$ allowing the computationof the ca ii h &amp; k corrected for the photospheric contribution. these valueswere then used to derive the ages by means of the henry et al. (1996)activity-age relation. bearing in mind the limitations of the ages derived byli abundances, chromospheric activity, and stellar rotational velocities, noneof the stars studied in this paper seem to be younger than 0.5 gyr.

astro-ph;9806235	oxygen abundances in unevolved metal-poor stars from near-uv oh lines	we have performed a detailed oxygen abundance analysis of 23 metal-poor(-3.0&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.3) unevolved halo stars and one giant through the oh bands inthe near uv, using high-resolution echelle spectra. oxygen is found to beoverabundant with respect to iron in these stars, with the [o/fe] ratioincreasing from 0.6 to 1 between [fe/h]=-1.5 and -3.0. the behavior of theoxygen overabundance with respect to [fe/h] is similar to that seen in previousworks based on oi ir triplet data (abia and rebolo 1989; tomkin et al. 1992;cavallo, pilachowski, and rebolo 1997). contrary to the previously acceptedpicture, our oxygen abundances, derived from low-excitation oh lines, agreewell with those derived from high-excitation lines of the triplet. for ninestars in common with tomkin et al. we obtain a mean difference of 0.00+/-0.11dex with respect to the abundances determined from the triplet using the samestellar parameters and model photospheres. for four stars in our sample we havefound measurements of the [oi] 6300 a line in the literature, from which wederive oxygen abundances consistent (average difference 0.09 dex) with thosebased on oh lines, showing that the long standing controversy between oxygenabundances from forbidden and permitted lines in metal-poor unevolved stars canbe resolved. our new oxygen abundances show a smooth extension of theedvardsson et al.'s (1993) [o/fe] versus metallicity curve to much lowerabundances, with a slope -0.31+/- 0.11 (taking into account the error bars inboth oxygen abundances and metallicities) in the range -3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-1.
