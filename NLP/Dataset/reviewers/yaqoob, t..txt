0905.1041	a suzaku observation of the ulirg iras19254-7245: disclosing the agn  component	we discuss here a long suzaku observation of iras 19254-7245 (also known asthe superantennae), one of the brightest and well studied ultra luminousinfrared galaxies in the local universe. this long observation provided thefirst detection of iras 19254-7245 above 10 kev, and measured a 15-30 kev fluxof ~5x10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1. the detection above 10 kev has allowed us tounveil, for the first time, the intrinsic luminosity of the agn hosted in iras19254-7245, which is strongly absorbed (nh ~ 3x10^(24) cm^-2) and has anintrinsic luminosity in the qso regime (l(2-10 kev) ~ 3 x 10^(44) erg s^-1).the 2-10 kev spectrum of iras 19254-7245 is remarkably hard (gamma~1.2), andpresents a strong iron line (ew ~0.7 kev), clearly suggesting that below 10 kevwe are seeing only reprocessed radiation. since the energy of the fe k emissionis found to be at ~6.7 kev, consistent with he-like fe, and its ew is too highto be explained in a starburst dominated scenario, we suggest that the 2--10kev emission of iras 19254-7245 is dominated by reflection/scattering fromhighly ionized matter. indeed, within this latter scenario we found that thephoton index of the illuminating source is gamma=1.87 (+0.11,-0.28), inexcellent agreement with the mean value found for radio quiet unobscured agn.

0905.3188	an x-ray spectral model for compton-thick toroidal reprocessors	the central engines of both type 1 and type 2 agns are thought to harbor atoroidal structure that absorbs and reprocesses high-energy photons from thecentral x-ray source. if the reprocessor is compton-thick, the calculation ofemission-line and continuum spectra that are suitable for direct fitting tox-ray data is challenging because the reprocessed emission depends on thespectral shape of the incident continuum, which may not be directly observable.we present new monte-carlo calculations of green's functions for a toroidalreprocessor that provide significant improvements over currently availablemodels. the green's function approach enables the construction of x-rayspectral fitting models that allow arbitrary incident spectra as part of thefitting process. the calculations are fully relativistic and have beenperformed for column densities that cover the compton-thin to compton-thickregime, for incident photon energies up to 500 kev. the reprocessed continuumand fluorescent line emission due to fe ka, fe kb, and ni ka are treatedself-consistently, eliminating the need for ad hoc modeling that is currentlycommon practice. we find that the spectral shape of the compton-thickreflection spectrum in both the soft and hard x-ray bands in our toroidalgeometry is different compared to that obtained from disk models. a key resultof our study is that a compton-thick toroidal structure that subtends the samesolid angle at the x-ray source as a disk can produce a reflection spectrumthat is ~6 times weaker than that from a disk. this highlights the widespreadand erroneous interpretation of the so-called "reflection-fraction" as a solidangle, obtained from fitting disk-reflection models to compton-thick sourceswithout regard for proper consideration of geometry.

0906.2438	x-ray evidence for a mildly relativistic and variable outflow in the  luminous seyfert 1 galaxy mrk509	there is growing evidence for the presence of blueshifted fe k absorptionlines in a number of radio-quiet agns and qsos. these may be fundamental toprobe flow dynamics near supermassive black holes. here we aim at verifying andbetter characterising the existence of such fe k absorption at ~8-10 kev in theluminous seyfert 1 galaxy mrk509, one of the most promising target for thesestudies. we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of the six xmm-newtonobservations of the source (for a total of ~200 ks), focusing on the detailedand systematic search for absorption features in the high-energy data. wedetect several absorption features at rest-frame energies ~8-8.5 kev and ~9.7kev. the lines are consistent with being produced by h-like iron ka and kbshell absorptions associated with an outflow with mildly relativistic velocityof ~0.14-0.2 c. the lines are found to be variable in energy and, marginally inintensity, implying that variations in either the column density, geometryand/or ionization structure of the outflow are common in this source.

0909.0899	on the efficiency of production of the fe kalpha emission line in  neutral matter	the absolute luminosity of the fe kalpha emission line from matterilluminated by x-rays in astrophysical sources is nontrivial to calculateexcept when the line-emitting medium is optically-thin to absorption andscattering. we characterize the fe kalpha line flux using a dimensionlessefficiency, defined as the fraction of continuum photons above the fe k shellabsorption edge threshold energy that appear in the line. the optically-thinapproximation begins to break down even for column densities as small as 2 x10^22 cm^-2. we show how to obtain reliable estimates of the fe kalpha lineefficiency in the case of cold, neutral matter, even for the compton-thickregime. we find that, regardless of geometry and covering factor, the largestfe kalpha line efficiency is attained well before the medium becomescompton-thick. for cosmic elemental abundances it is difficult to achieve anefficiency higher than a few percent under the most favorable conditions andlines of sight. for a given geometry, compton-thick lines-of-sight may have fekalpha line efficiencies that are orders of magnitude less than the maximumpossible for that geometry. configurations that allow unobscured views of acompton-thick reflecting surface are capable of yielding the highestefficiencies. our results can be used to estimate the predicted flux of thenarrow fe kalpha line at ~6.4 kev from absorption models in agn. in particularwe show that contrary to a recent claim in the literature, absorption dominatedmodels for the relativistic fe kalpha emission line in mcg -6-30-15 do notover-predict the narrow fe kalpha line for any column density or coveringfactor.

0707.2950	relativistic iron k emission and absorption in the seyfert 1.9 galaxy  mcg-5-23-16	we present the results of the simultaneous deep xmm and chandra observationsof the bright seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg-5-23-16, which is thought to have one ofthe best known examples of a relativistically broadened iron k-alpha line. thetime averaged spectral analysis shows that the iron k-shell complex is bestmodeled with an unresolved narrow emission component (fwhm &lt; 5000 km/s, ew ~ 60ev) plus a broad component. this latter component has fwhm ~ 44000 km/s and ew~ 50 ev. its profile is well described by an emission line originating from anaccretion disk viewed with an inclination angle ~ 40^\circ and with theemission arising from within a few tens of gravitational radii of the centralblack hole. the time-resolved spectral analysis of the xmm epic-pn spectrumshows that both the narrow and broad components of the fe k emission lineappear to be constant in time within the errors. we detected a narrow sporadicabsorption line at 7.7 kev which appears to be variable on a time-scale of 20ksec. if associated with fe xxvi ly-alpha this absorption is indicative of apossibly variable, high ionization, high velocity outflow. the variability ofthis absorption feature appears to rule out a local (z=0) origin. the analysisof the xmm rgs spectrum reveals that the soft x-ray emission of mcg-5-23-16 islikely dominated by several emission lines superimposed on an unabsorbedscattered power-law continuum. the lack of strong fe l shell emission togetherwith the detection of a strong forbidden line in the o vii triplet isconsistent with a scenario where the soft x-ray emission lines are produced ina plasma photoionized by the nuclear emission.

1003.1789	ngc 2992 in an x-ray high state observed by xmm: response of the  relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line to the continuum	we present the analysis of an xmm observation of the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992.the source was found in its highest level of x-ray activity yet detected, afactor $\sim 23.5$ higher in 2--10 kev flux than the historical minimum. ngc2992 is known to exhibit x-ray flaring activity on timescales of days to weeks,and the xmm data provide at least factor of $\sim 3$ better spectral resolutionin the fe k band than any previously measured flaring x-ray state. we find thatthere is a broad feature in the \sim 5-7 kev band which could be interpreted asa relativistic fe k$\alpha$ emission line. its flux appears to have increasedin tandem with the 2--10 kev continuum when compared to a previous suzakuobservation when the continuum was a factor of $\sim 8$ lower than that duringthe xmm observation. the xmm data are consistent with the general picture thatincreased x-ray activity and corresponding changes in the fe k$\alpha$ lineemission occur in the innermost regions of the putative accretion disk. thisbehavior contrasts with the behavior of other agn in which the fe k$\alpha$line does not respond to variability in the x-ray.

1006.2858	evidence for ultra-fast outflows in radio-quiet agns: i - detection and  statistical incidence of fe k-shell absorption lines	we performed a blind search for narrow absorption features at energiesgreater than 6.4 kev in a sample of 42 radio-quiet agns observed withxmm-newton. we detect 36 narrow absorption lines on a total of 101 xmm-newtonepic pn observations. the number of absorption lines at rest-frame energies e&gt;7kev is 22. their global probability to be generated by random fluctuations isvery low, less than 3x10^-8, and their detection have been independentlyconfirmed by a spectral analysis of the mos data, with associated randomprobability &lt;10^-7. we identify the lines as fe xxv and fe xxvi k-shellresonant absorption. they are systematically blue-shifted, with a velocitydistribution ranging from zero up to 0.3c, with a peak and mean value at 0.1c.we detect variability of the lines on both ews and blue-shifted velocitiesamong different observations even on time-scales as short as a few days,possibly suggesting somewhat compact absorbers. moreover, we find nosignificant correlation between the cosmological red-shifts of the sources andthe lines blue-shifted velocities, ruling out any systematic contamination bylocal absorption. if we define ultra-fast outflows (ufos) those highly ionizedabsorbers with outflow velocities higher than 10^4 km/s, then the majority ofthe lines are consistent with being associated to ufos and the fraction ofobjects with detected ufos in the whole sample is at least 35%. this fractionis similar for type 1 and type 2 sources. the global covering fraction of theabsorbers is consequently estimated to be in the range c=0.4-0.6, therebyimplying large opening angles. these lines indicate that ufos are a rathercommon phenomenon observable in the central regions of these sources and theyare probably the direct signature of agn accretion disk winds/ejecta. thedetailed photo-ionization modeling of these absorbers is presented in acompanion paper.

0704.2756	the nature of a broad line radio galaxy: simultaneous rxte and chandra  hetg observations of 3c 382	we present the results from simultaneous chandra and rxte observations of thex-ray bright broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 382. the long (120 ks) exposurewith chandra hetg allows a detailed study of the soft x-ray continuum and ofthe narrow component of the fe kalpha line. the rxte pca data are used to putan upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard x-raycontinuum. a strong soft excess below 1 kev is observed in the time-averagedhetg spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermalmodel. the flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of thesoft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission,detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). a narrow (sigma&lt;90ev) fe kalpha line (with ew&lt; 100 ev) is observed by the chandra heg. similarvalues for the line parameters are measured by the rxte pca, suggesting thatthe contribution from a broad line component is negligible. the fact that theexposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us toinvestigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on differenttimescales. significant flux variability associated with spectral changes isobserved on timescales of hours and days. the spectral variability is similarto that observed in radio-quiet agn ruling out a jet-dominated origin of thex-rays.

0710.0382	the suzaku observation of ngc 3516: complex absorption and the broad and  narrow fe k lines	we present results from a 150 ksec suzaku observation of the seyfert 1.5 ngc3516 in october 2005. the source was in a relatively highly absorbed state. ourbest-fit model is consistent with the presence of a low-ionization absorberwhich has a column density near 5 * 10^{22} cm^{-2} and covers most of thex-ray continuum source (covering fraction 96-100%). a high-ionization absorbingcomponent, which yields a narrow absorption feature consistent with fe k xxvi,is confirmed. a relativistically broadened fe k alpha line is required in allfits, even after the complex absorption is taken into account; an additionalpartial-covering component is an inadequate substitute for the continuumcurvature associated with the broad fe line. a narrow fe k alpha emission linehas a velocity width consistent with the broad line region. the low-ionizationabsorber may be responsible for producing the narrow fe k alpha line, though acontribution from additional material out of the line of sight is possible. weinclude in our model soft band emission lines from he- and h-like ions of n, o,ne and mg, consistent with photo-ionization, though a small contribution fromcollisionally-ionized emission is possible.

1108.1787	on rapid migration and accretion within disks around supermassive black  holes	galactic nuclei should contain a cluster of stars and compact objects in thevicinity of the central supermassive black hole due to stellar evolution, minormergers and gravitational dynamical friction. by analogy with protoplanetarymigration, nuclear cluster objects (ncos) can migrate in the accretion disksthat power active galactic nuclei by exchanging angular momentum with disk gas.here we show that an individual nco undergoing runaway outward migrationcomparable to type iii protoplanetary migration can generate an accretion ratecorresponding to seyfert agn or quasar luminosities. multiple migrating ncos inan agn disk can dominate traditional viscous disk accretion and at large diskradii, ensemble nco migration and accretion could provide sufficient heating toprevent the gravitational instability from consuming disk gas in starformation. the magnitude and energy of the x-ray soft excess observed at~0.1-1kev in seyfert agn could be explained by a small population of~10^{2}-10^{3} accreting stellar mass black holes or a few ulxs. nco migrationand accretion in agn disks are therefore extremely important mechanisms to addto realistic models of agn disks.

0704.3743	the suzaku observation of the nucleus of the radio-loud active galaxy  centaurus a: constraints on abundances of the accreting material	a suzaku observation of the nucleus of the radio-loud agn centaurus a in 2005has yielded a broadband spectrum spanning 0.3 to 250 kev. the net exposuretimes after screening were: 70 ks per x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) camera,60.8 ks for the hard x-ray detector (hxd) pin, and 17.1 ks for the hxd-gso. thehard x-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of1.5 and 7 * 10^{23} cm^{-2} respectively. the spectrum is consistent withprevious suggestions that the power-law components are x-ray emission from thesub-pc vlbi jet and from bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistentwith a partial covering interpretation. the soft band is dominated by thermalemission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature vapecmodel, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclearemission, jet emission, and emission from x-ray binaries and other pointsources. narrow fluorescent emission lines from fe, si, s, ar, ca and ni aredetected. the fe k alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on thedistance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas. fe, ca, and s k-shellabsorption edges are detected. elemental abundances are constrained viaabsorption edge depths and strengths of the fluorescent and diffuse plasmaemission lines. the high metallicity ([fe/h]=+0.1) of the circumnuclearmaterial suggests that it could not have originated in the relativelymetal-poor outer halo unless enrichment by local star formation has occurred.relative abundances are consistent with enrichment from type ii and iasupernovae.

1508.07685	a compton-thin solution for the suzaku x-ray spectrum of the seyfert 2  galaxy mkn 3	mkn 3 is a seyfert 2 galaxy that is widely regarded as an exemplarycompton-thick agn. we study the suzaku x-ray spectrum using models of the x-rayreprocessor that self-consistently account for the fe k$\alpha$ fluorescentemission line and the associated compton-scattered, or reflection, continuum.we find a solution in which the average global column density,$0.234^{+0.012}_{-0.010} \times 10^{24} \ \rm cm^{-2}$, is very different tothe line-of-sight column density, $0.902^{+0.012}_{-0.013} \times 10^{24} \ \rmcm^{-2}$. the global column density is $\sim 5$ times smaller than thatrequired for the matter distribution to be compton-thick. our model accountsfor the profiles of the fe k$\alpha$ and fe k$\beta$ lines, and the fe k edgeremarkably well, with a solar abundance of fe. the matter distribution couldconsist of a clumpy medium with a line-of-sight column density higher than theglobal average. a uniform, spherically-symmetric distribution alone cannotsimultaneously produce the correct fluorescent line spectrum and reflectioncontinuum. previous works on mkn 3, and other agn, that assumed a reflectioncontinuum from matter with an infinite column density could therefore lead toerroneous or "puzzling" conclusions if the matter out of the line-of-sight isreally compton-thin. whereas studies of samples of agn have generally onlyprobed the line-of-sight column density, with simplistic, one-dimensionalmodels, it is important now to establish the global column densities in agn. itis the global properties that affect the energy budget in terms of reprocessingof x-rays into infrared emission, and that constrain population synthesismodels of the cosmic x-ray background.

astro-ph;0008522	variable iron k-alpha lines in seyfert 1 galaxies	we find that variability of the iron k-alpha line is common in seyfert 1galaxies. using data from the asca archive for objects that have been observedmore than once during the mission, we study the time-averaged spectra fromindividual observations, thereby probing variability on timescales that rangefrom days to years. since the statistics of the data do not warrant searchesfor line variability in terms of a complex physical model, we use a a simplegaussian to model the gross shape of the line, and then use the centroidenergy, intensity and equivalent width as robust indicators of changes in theline profile. we find that ~70% of seyfert 1s (ten out of fifteen) showvariability in at least one of these parameters: the centroid energy,intensity, and equivalent width vary in six, four, and eight sourcesrespectively. due to the low s/n, limited sampling and time averaging, weconsider these results to represent lower limits to the rate of incidence ofvariability. in most cases changes in the line do not appear to track changesin the continuum. in particular, we find no evidence for variability of theline intensity in ngc 4151, suggesting an origin in a region larger than theputative accretion disk, where most of the iron line has been thought tooriginate. mkn 279 is investigated on short timescales. the time-averagedeffective line energy is 6.5 kev in the galaxy rest frame. as the continuumflux increases by 20% in a few hours, the fe k line responds with the effectiveline energy increasing by 0.22 kev (~10,500 km s^-1). problems with the ascaand rosat calibration that affect simultaneous spectral fits are discussed inan appendix.

astro-ph;0111419	subtleties in measuring iron k lines in agn	chandra and xmm observations are showing that the fe-k emission lines in type1 agn are composite, in general consisting of a narrow and a broad component.we review the latest chandra hetg results and compare the line profiles withthose measured by asca. the narrow fe-k line components necessitate re-modelingof the line profiles measured previously and revision of the parameters of therelativistic broad components, as well re-interpretation of variabilitystudies. we also explicitly demonstrate the effect of changes in the ascacalibration on the measurements of the fe-k lines in agn. we find that thedifferences in measured parameters are insignificant. both the intrinsic widthand ew change by less than 8%. fe-k line studies which claim much largerdifferences do not adequately model the line emission. we point out that it isincorrect to compare different calibrations, and indeed make astrophysicalinferences, using models which do not describe the data. we then present somenew results for the highest s/n broad fe-k line profile in the entire ascaarchive, from ngc 4151.

astro-ph;0112318	the effect of changes in the asca calibration on the fe-kalpha lines in  active galaxies	the asca calibration has evolved considerably since launch and indeed, isstill evolving. there have been concerns in the literature that changes in theasca calibration have resulted in the fe-kalpha lines in active galaxies (agn)now being systematically narrower than was originally thought. if this weretrue, a large body of asca results would be impacted. in particular, it hasbeen claimed that the broad red wing (when present) of the fe-kalpha line hasbeen considerably weakened by changes in the asca calibration. we demonstrateexplicitly that changes in the asca calibration over a period of about eightyears have a negligible effect on the width, strength, or shape of thefe-kalpha lines. the reduction in both width and equivalent width is only ~8%or less. we confirm this with simulations and individual sources, as well assample average profiles. the average profile for type 1 agn is still verybroad, with the red wing extending down to ~4 kev. the reason for the claimed,apparently large, discrepancies is that in some sources the \fekalfa line iscomplex, and a single-gaussian model, being an inadequate description of theline profile, picks up different portions of the profile with differentcalibration. single-gaussian fits do not therefore model all of the lineemission in some sources, in which case they do not compare old and currentcalibration since the models do not then describe the data.

astro-ph;0211349	chandra grating observations of agn	the highest spectral resolution data for the fe-k lines in type i agn, asobserved with the chandra high energy grating (heg), reveal a variety of lineshapes. however, the energies of the most prominent peak are all clusteredtightly around 6.4 kev (weighted mean $6.403 \pm 0.062$ kev). if all the peakswere part of single, relativistically broadened disk line, this would requireunrealistically fine tuning. thus, some of the cores must originate in distantmatter (e.g. blr, nlr, torus). on the other hand, in at least two agn, theemission at 6.4 kev has been seen to vanish on short timescales, indicating anorigin close to the central engine. for one of these (mrk 509) this is puzzlingbecause the heg and simultaneous rxte time-averaged spectra indicate only anarrow line was present at that time. simultaneous heg/rxte observations forngc 4593 indicate a broad and narrow fe-k complex, all originating in neutralfe, and for f9 show a narrow, neutral fe-k component plus a broad, he-likecomponent. the latter signature has been observed in three other agn by xmm andmay be quite common.

astro-ph;0403541	an extended scheme for fitting x-ray data with accretion disk spectra in  the strong gravity regime	accreting black holes are believed to emit x-rays which then mediateinformation about strong gravity in the vicinity of the emission region. wereport on a set of new routines for the xspec package for analysing x-rayspectra of black-hole accretion disks. the new computational tool significantlyextends the capabilities of the currently available fitting procedures thatinclude the effects of strong gravity, and allows one to systematically explorethe constraints on more model parameters than previously possible (for exampleblack-hole angular momentum). moreover, axial symmetry of the disk intrinsicemissivity is not assumed, although it can be imposed to speed up thecomputations. the new routines can be used also as a stand-alone and flexiblecode with the capability of handling time-resolved spectra in the regime ofstrong gravity. we have used the new code to analyse the mean x-ray spectrumfrom the long xmm--newton 2001 campaign of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15.consistent with previous findings, we obtained a good fit to the broad fe kline profile for a radial line intrinsic emissivity law in the disk which isnot a simple power law, and for near maximal value of black hole angularmomentum. however, equally good fits can be obtained also for small values ofthe black hole angular momentum. the code has been developed with the aim ofallowing precise modelling of relativistic effects. although we find thatcurrent data cannot constrain the parameters of black-hole/accretion disksystem well, the approach allows, for a given source or situation, detailedinvestigations of what features of the data future studies should be focused onin order to achieve the goal of uniquely isolating the parameters of suchsystems.

astro-ph;0610436	suzaku observations of iron lines and reflection in agn	initial results on the iron k-shell line and reflection component in severalagn observed as part of the suzaku guaranteed time program are reviewed. thispaper discusses a small sample of compton-thin seyferts observed to date withsuzaku; namely mcg -5-23-16, mcg -6-30-15, ngc 4051, ngc 3516, ngc 2110, 3c 120and ngc 2992. the broad iron k$\alpha$ emission line appears to be present inall but one of these seyfert galaxies, while the narrow core of the line fromdistant matter is ubiquitous in all the observations. the iron line in mcg-6-30-15 shows the most extreme relativistic blurring of all the objects, thered-wing of the line requires the inner accretion disk to extend inwards towithin 2.2rg of the black hole, in agreement with the xmm-newton observations.strong excess emission in the hard x-ray detector (hxd) above 10 kev isobserved in many of these seyfert galaxies, consistent with the presence of areflection component from reprocessing in compton-thick matter (e.g. theaccretion disk). only one seyfert galaxy (ngc 2110) shows neither a broad ironline nor a reflection component. the spectral variability of mcg -6-30-15, mcg-5-23-16 and ngc 4051 is also discussed. in all 3 cases, the spectra appearharder when the source is fainter, while there is little variability of theiron line or reflection component with source flux. this agrees with a simpletwo component spectral model, whereby the variable emission is the primarypower-law, while the iron line and reflection component remain relativelyconstant.

astro-ph;9603091	the x-ray spectral variability of mrk 766	analysis results from asca and rosat observations of the narrow-line seyfert1 galaxy mrk 766 are reported. in the asca observation we observed rapidvariability with a doubling time scale of 1000 seconds. a spectral variabilityevent was observed in which the spectrum softened and hardened above and below~1 kev, respectively, as the flux increased. the spectra could be modeled with5 components: a power law, warm absorber, iron k(alpha) line and soft excesscomponent flux. the spectral variability resulted from a highly significantchange in the intrinsic photon law index from gamma ~1.6 to ~2.0, an increasein the warm absorber ionization, and a marginally significant decrease in thesoft component normalization. a ~100 ev equivalent width narrow iron k(alpha)line was detected in the high state spectrum. spectral hardening during fluxincreases was observed in three rosat observations.  the change in intrinsic photon index and disappearance of the soft excesscomponent in the asca spectra can be explained as a transition from a firstorder pair reprocessed spectrum to a pair cascade brought about by a suddenincrease in the injected electron lorentz factor. the change in the ionizationof the warm absorber, though model dependent, could correspond to the increasein flux at the oxygen edges resulting from the spectral index change. the rosatspectral variability can be interpreted by variable intensity hard power lawand a relatively nonvarying soft component, possibly primary disk emission.these results are compared with those reported from other narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies.

astro-ph;9606169	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: ii. relativistic iron k-alpha  emission	we present evidence for widespread relativistic effects in the centralregions of active galactic nuclei. in a sample of 18 seyfert 1 galaxiesobserved by \asca, 14 show an iron k$\alpha$ line which is is resolved, withmean width $\sigma_{\rm k\alpha}=0.43\pm 0.12$~kev for a gaussian profile (fullwidth at half maximum, fwhm$\sim 50,000$~km s$^{-1}$). however, many of theline profiles are asymmetric. a strong red wing is indicative of gravitationalredshifts close to a central black hole and accretion disk models provide anexcellent description of the data. the peak energy of the line is 6.4~kev,indicating that it arises by fluorescence in near-neutral material. our fitsimply a low inclination for the disk in these seyfert 1 galaxies, with a meanof 30\deg, consistent with orientation-dependent unification schemes.differences in the line profiles from source-to-source imply slight variationsin geometry, which cannot be accounted for solely by inclination. in mostcases, we require that the line emission arises from a range of radii. althougha small contribution to the emission from a region other than the disk is notruled out, it is not generally required and has little effect on ourconclusions regarding the disk line. our data are fit equally well withrotating (kerr) and non-rotating (schwarzschild) black hole models. we find amean spectral index in the 3-10 kev range of $&lt;\gamma_{3-10}&gt;=1.91\pm 0.07$after accounting for the effects of reflection. such observations probe theinnermost regions of agn, and arguably provide the best evidence yet obtainedfor the existence of super-massive black holes in the centers of activegalaxies.

astro-ph;9608170	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: i. data analysis, imaging and  timing	we present the first in a series of papers describing the x-ray properties ofa sample of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies, using data obtained by \asca. the imagingdata reveal a number of serendipitous hard x-ray sources in some source fields,but none contribute significantly to the hard x-ray flux of the agn. all butone of the seyferts show evidence for variability on timescales ofminutes-hours, with the amplitude anti-correlated with the source luminosity,confirming previous results. in at least 8 sources, there is evidence that thevariability amplitude below 2 kev is greater than that in the hard x-ray band,perhaps indicating variable components other than the power-law in the softband. ultra-rapid variability, implying significant power at frequencies $&gt;10^{-3}$~hz is detected in at least 5 sources, but is difficult to detect inmost cases, due to the sampling and signal-to-noise ratio. in mrk 766 andmcg-6-30-15 there is also an indication that the high--frequency power--spectraare variable in shape and/or intensity. there is similar evidence in ngc 4151,but on longer time scales.

astro-ph;9701127	x-ray observations of liner and starburst galaxies	we present the results of asca observations of a heterogenous sample of 15spiral galaxies. 8 are liners or low-luminosity agn (llagn), 5 are starburstgalaxies and 2 are normal spiral galaxies. we find that in all cases the ascaspectra can be described by a canonical model consisting of a power-law with aphoton index ~ 1.7-2.0, plus a soft optically thin emission component with kt ~0.6-0.8 kev. the implied element abundances are often sub-solar. the softcomponent is usually extended and the nuclear, point-like emission is sometimesabsorbed by column densities in the range log nh ~ 21-23 cm-2. the relativeluminosities of the soft and hard components vary from galaxy to galaxy. forthe liners, the 2-10 kev luminosity of the hard component is typically log l ~40-41 ergs/s whereas the 0.5-2.0 kev luminosity of the soft component istypically log l ~ 39-40 ergs/s. for starbursts, the 2-10 kev luminosity of islog l ~ 39-40 ergs/s, somewhat lower than the corresponding luminosity of mostof the liners in our sample. the hard component is similar to the observedx-ray spectra of quasars and also to the intrinsic x-ray spectra of classicalseyfert galaxies. most of the galaxies in our sample exhibit no significant(di/i &gt; 20%) short-term variability (with timescales of a day or less) whereaslong-term variability is common. we present a case study of the liner m81 indetail where there is evidence of large-amplitude (di/i ~ 70%) variability overseveral weeks. there is also clear evidence for a broad, complex fe-k emissionline which is compatible with an origin in an accretion disk viewed at ~ 40deg. these results suggest a strong connection between classical agn, liners,and starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;9702011	the complex x-ray spectra of m82 and ngc 253	we present the results of the first imaging x-ray observations in the0.4-10.0 kev bandpass of the nearby starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253. theasca spectra of both m82 and ngc 253 are complex with strong line emission fromo, ne, fe, mg, s, and si, allowing elemental abundances to be estimated in thex-ray band for the first time in these sources. two components are required tofit the spectra of both galaxies, with a "soft" component well described by athermal model with a temperature of ~ 10^6-7 k and a "hard" component welldescribed by either a thermal model (t ~ 10^8 k) or a power-law model (energyindex ~ 0.8-1.0). we find that different models (with different continua) yieldabsolute abundances that differ by more than an order of magnitude, whilerelative abundances are more robust and suggest an underabundance of fe(inferred from the fe-l complex) relative to alpha-burning elements, possiblyas a result of dust depletion. most of the soft flux (which originates mostlywithin the central kpc of m82 and ngc 253) is consistent with starburst modelsof supernovae-heated ism and, to a lesser extent, starburst-driven superwindemission and the direct emission from supernova (sn). the hard component inboth galaxies may have some contribution from ~ 10^8 k superwind emission orindividual sn, although most of the emission probably originates in pointsources (most likely blackhole candidates or mini-agn with m_edd &gt; 3-20 solarmasses) and, possibly, inverse-compton scattering of ir photons. the similarityof the spectral x-ray characteristics of ngc 253 and m82 to some liners andlow-luminosity agn suggests a link between agn and starbursts (e.g., both maycontain an accretion-driven emission component).

astro-ph;9708046	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: iii. the evidence for  absorption &amp; emission due to photoionized gas	(abridged) we present the results from a detailed analysis of the 0.6 - 10kev spectra of 23 asca observations of 18 objects. we find that in most casesthe underlying continuum can be well-represented by a powerlaw with a photonindex gamma approx 2. however we find strong evidence for photoionized gas inthe line-of-sight to 13/18 objects. we present detailed modelling of this gasbased upon the ion photoionization code. we find the x-ray ionization parameterfor the ionized material is strongly peaked at ux approx 0.1. the columndensities of ionized material are typically in the range n_{h,z} approx10^{21}--10^{23} cm^{-2}, although highly ionized column densities up to10^{24} cm^{-2} cannot be excluded in some cases. we also investigate theimportance of the emission-spectrum from the ionized gas, finding that itsignificantly improves the fit to many sources with an intensity consistentwith material subtending a large solid angle at the central source. a deficitof counts is observed at approx 1 kev in the sources exhibiting the strongestabsorption features. we suggest this is likely to be the signature of a secondzone of (more highly) ionized gas, which might have been seen previously in thedeep fe k-shell edges observed in some ginga observations. we find evidencethat the ionized material in ngc 3227 and mcg-6-30-15 contains embedded dust,whilst there is no such evidence in the other sources

astro-ph;9709198	a simple new method for analysing gapped time-series: search for a high  frequency cut-off in the x-ray power spectrum of mcg -6-30-15	we present a new, simple method for analysing gapped time-series which isparticularly suited to probe the x-ray power spectra of active galactic nuclei(agn).the method is applied to a four-day observation of the seyfert 1 galaxymcg -6-30-15 with asca. mcg -6-30-15 is well-known for rapid, large amplitudex-ray variability. in this source, our method probes the power spectrum in therange 0.001 hz to 0.05 hz, thus extending the high-frequency coverage by afactor of over 50 compared to previous studies. the asca data out a cessationof variability up to 0.016 hz at greater than 90% confidence. the power-lawindex of the power spectrum is consistent with -1.4.at 0.021 hz we can place anupper limit of 7% on the intrinsic fluctuations of the source luminosity atgreater than 99% confidence. above this frequency poisson noise becomesdominant but we can place an upper limit of 10% on intrinsic fluctuations up to0.05 hz at 98.9% confidence. the data argue against orbital modulation as theorigin of the variability since it would imply upper limits on the mass of theputative black hole of less than half a million solar solar masses andtherefore super-eddington luminosities.

astro-ph;9803057	parameter estimation in x-ray astronomy revisited	the method of obtaining confidence intervals on a subset of the total numberof parameters (p) of a model used for fitting x-ray spectra is to perturb thebest-fitting model until, for each parameter, a range is found for which thechange in the fit statistic is equal to some critical value. this criticalvalue corresponds to the desired confidence level and is obtained from thechi-square distribution for q degrees of freedom, where q is the number ofinteresting parameters. with the advent of better energy-resolution detectors,such as those onboard asca it has become more common to fit complex models withnarrow features, comparable to the instrumental energy resolution. toinvestigate whether this leads to significant non-gaussian deviations betweendata and model, we use simulations based on asca data and we show that themethod is still valid in such cases. we also investigate the weak-source limitas well as the case of obtaining upper limits on equivalents widths of weakemission lines and find that for all practical purposes the method gives thecorrect confidence ranges. however, upper limits on emission-line equivalentwidths may be over-estimated in the extreme poisson limit.

astro-ph;9804265	occultation mapping of the central engine in the active galaxy mcg  -6-30-15	the colossal power output of active galactic nuclei (agn) is believed to befueled by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. this centralaccreting region of agn has hitherto been spatially unresolved and itsstructure therefore unknown. here we propose that a previously reported `deepminimum' in the x-ray intensity of the agn mcg-6-30-15, was due to a uniquex-ray occultation event and that it probes structure of the central engine onscales &lt; 1e14 cm, or 1.4e-7 arcseconds. the data are consistent with a brightcentral source surrounded by a less intense ring, which we identify with theinner edge of an accretion disk. these may be the first direct measurements ofthe spatial structure and geometry of the accreting black-hole system in anactive galaxy.if the ring of x-ray emission is identified with the inner edgeof an accretion disk, upper limits on the bh mass can be derived. ouroccultation interpretation is controversial in the sense that x-ray variabilityin agns is normally attributed to intrinsic physical changes in the x-rayemission region, such as disk or coronal instabilities.

astro-ph;9804327	x-ray variability as a probe of advection-dominated accretion in  low-luminosity agn	as a class, liners and low-luminosity agn tend to show little or nosignificant short-term variability (i.e., with time-scales less than a day).this is a marked break for the trend of increased variability in seyfert 1galaxies with decreased luminosity. we propose that this difference is due tothe lower accretion rate in liners and llagn which is probably causing theaccretion flow to be advection-dominated. this results in a largercharacteristic size for the x-ray producing region than is the case in``normal'' agn. short-term variability may be caused by a localized instabilityor occultation events, but we note that such events would likely be accompaniedby broad-band spectral changes. since the adaf is more compact in a kerrmetric, it is possible that the x-ray emission from adafs around rotatingblackholes would be more variable than x-ray emission from adafs in aschwarzchild metric. similar variability arguments also apply to otherwavelengths, and accordingly multiwavelength monitoring of llagn could serve to``map'' the adaf regions.
