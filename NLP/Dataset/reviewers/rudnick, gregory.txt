0901.0551	the newfirm medium-band survey: filter definitions and first results	deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distantgalaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding ofthe early universe. as the vast majority of k- or irac-selected galaxies is toofaint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almostexclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to thebroad-band photometry. the best-achieved accuracy of these redshiftsdelta(z)/(1+z) ~ 0.06 at z&gt;1.5, which is sufficient for determining the broadcharacteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accuraterest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density.we have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the newfirm camera on thekitt peak 4m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshiftsin the range 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5. the survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, whichprovide crude "spectra" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 micron for all objectsin the 27.6 x 27.6 arcmin newfirm field. in this first paper, we illustrate thetechnique by showing medium band newfirm photometry of several galaxies at1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7 from the near-infrared spectroscopic sample of kriek et al. (2008).the filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted balmer breakin these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. the fullsurvey will provide similar data for ~8000 faint k-selected galaxies at z&gt;1.5in the cosmos and aegis fields. the filter set also enables efficient selectionof exotic objects such as high redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emissionlines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late t and candidate "y" dwarfscould be identified using only two of the filters.

0706.2164	spitzer mid-to-far-infrared flux densities of distant galaxies	we study the infrared (ir) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deepspitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. our primary interest is to improve theconstraints on the total ir luminosities, l(ir), of these galaxies. we combinethe spitzer data in the southern extended chandra deep field with ak-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile. we used a stacking analysis to measurethe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 galaxies as afunction of 24 micron flux density, x-ray activity, and rest-frame near-ircolor. galaxies with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 and s(24)=53-250 micro-jy have l(ir) derivedfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of thosederived from the 24 micron flux densities only. however, l(ir) derived from theaverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy and1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron fluxdensity by factors of 2-10. galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy have s(70)/s(24)flux ratios comparable to sources with x-ray detections or red rest-frame ircolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by agn may contribute to thehigh 24 micron emission. based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 have l(ir) &lt; 6 x 10^12solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to &lt; 1000solar masses per year. this suggests that high redshift galaxies may havesimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.objects with l(ir) &gt; 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with asurface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6mpc^-3 over 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

0902.4080	frequency and properties of bars in cluster and field galaxies at  intermediate redshifts	we present a study of large-scale bars in field and cluster environments outto redshifts of ~0.8 using a final sample of 945 moderately inclined diskgalaxies drawn from the ediscs project. we characterize bars and their hostgalaxies and look for relations between the presence of a bar and theproperties of the underlying disk. we investigate whether the fraction andproperties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in thefield. the total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (medianz=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). for thecluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,respectively. we find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in thefield and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the barfraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%). thesefindings however rely on a relatively small subsample and might be affected bysmall number statistics. in agreement with local studies, we find thatdisk-dominated galaxies have a higher optical bar fraction (~45%) thanbulge-dominated galaxies (~15%). this result is based on hubble types andeffective radii and does not change with redshift. the latter finding impliesthat bar formation or dissolution is strongly connected to the emergence of themorphological structure of a disk and is typically accompanied by a transitionin the hubble type.

0905.1122	turning back the clock: inferring the history of the eight o'clock arc	we present the results from an optical and near-infrared spectroscopic studyof the ultraviolet-luminous z = 2.73 galaxy, the 8 o'clock arc. due togravitational lensing, this galaxy is magnified by a factor of &gt; 10, allowingin-depth measurements which are usually unfeasible at such redshifts. in theoptical spectra, we measured the systemic redshift of the galaxy, z = 2.7322+/- 0.0012, using stellar photospheric lines. this differs from the redshift ofabsorption lines in the interstellar medium, z = 2.7302 +/- 0.0006, implyinggas outflows on the order of 160 km/s. with h and k-band near-infrared spectra,we have measured nebular emission lines of halpha, hbeta, hgamma, [n ii] and [oiii], which have a redshift z = 2.7333 +/- 0.0001, consistent with the derivedsystemic redshift. from the balmer decrement, we measured the dust extinctionto be a_5500 = 1.17 +/- 0.36 mag. correcting halpha for dust extinction and theassumed lensing factor, we measure a star-formation rate of ~ 270 msol/yr,which is higher than ~ 85% of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. usingcombinations of all detected emission lines, we find that the 8 o'clock arc hasa gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.8 zsol, showing that enrichment at high-redshiftis not rare, even in blue, star-forming galaxies. studying spectra from two ofthe arc components separately, we find that one component dominates the dustextinction and star-formation rate, although the metallicities between the twocomponents are similar. we derive the mass via stellar population modeling, andfind that the arc has a total stellar mass of ~ 4 x 10^11 msol, which falls onthe mass-metallicity relation at z ~ 2. finally, we estimate the total gasmass, and find it to be only ~ 12% of the stellar mass, implying that the 8o'clock arc is likely nearing the end of a starburst.

0905.4503	the rest-frame optical luminosity function of cluster galaxies at z&lt;0.8  and the assembly of the cluster red sequence	we present the rest-frame optical luminosity function (lf) of red sequencegalaxies in 16 clusters at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 drawn from the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs). we compare our clusters to an analogous sample from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) and match the ediscs clusters to their most likelydescendants. we measure all lfs down to m m* + (2.5 - 3.5). at z&lt;0.8, thebright end of the lf is consistent with passive evolution but there is asignificant build-up of the faint end of the red sequence towards lowerredshift. there is a weak dependence of the lf on cluster velocity dispersionfor ediscs but no such dependence for the sdss clusters. we find tentativeevidence that red sequence galaxies brighter than a threshold magnitude arealready in place, and that this threshold evolves to fainter magnitudes towardlower redshifts. we compare the ediscs lfs with the lf of co-eval red sequencegalaxies in the field and find that the bright end of the lfs agree. however,relative to the number of bright red galaxies, the field has more faint redgalaxies than clusters at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8 but fewer at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6, implyingdifferential evolution. we compare the total light in the ediscs cluster redsequences to the total red sequence light in our sdss cluster sample. clustersat 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 must increase their luminosity on the red sequence (and thereforestellar mass in red galaxies) by a factor of 1-3 by z=0. the necessaryprocesses that add mass to the red sequence in clusters predict local clustersthat are over-luminous as compared to those observed in the sdss. the predictedcluster luminosities can be reconciled with observed local cluster luminositiesby combining multiple previously known effects.

0910.1836	optical spectroscopy of distant red galaxies	we present optical spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of distant redgalaxies (drgs) with k &lt; 22.5 (vega), selected by j-k &gt; 2.3, in the hubble deepfield south, the ms 1054-03 field, and the chandra deep field south.spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 15 drgs. only 2 out of 15 drgs arelocated at z &lt; 2, suggesting a high efficiency to select high-redshift sources.  from other spectroscopic surveys in the cdfs targeting intermediate to highredshift populations selected with different criteria, we find spectroscopicredshifts for a further 30 drgs. we use the sample of spectroscopicallyconfirmed drgs to establish the high quality (scatter in \delta z/(1+z) of ~0.05) of their photometric redshifts in the considered deep fields, as derivedwith eazy (brammer et al. 2008). combining the spectroscopic and photometricredshifts, we find that 74% of drgs with k &lt; 22.5 lie at z &gt; 2. the combinedspectroscopic and photometric sample is used to analyze the distinct intrinsicand observed properties of drgs at z &lt; 2 and z &gt; 2. in our photometric sampleto k &lt; 22.5, low-redshift drgs are brighter in k than high-redshift drgs by 0.7mag, and more extincted by 1.2 mag in av. our analysis shows that the drgcriterion selects galaxies with different properties at different redshifts.such biases can be largely avoided by selecting galaxies based on theirrest-frame properties, which requires very good multi-band photometry and highquality photometric redshifts.

0910.2986	paschen-alpha emission in the gravitationally lensed galaxy smm  j163554.2+661225	we report the detection of the paschen-alpha emission line in the z=2.515galaxy smm j163554.2+661225 using spitzer spectroscopy. smm j163554.2+661225 isa sub-millimeter-selected infrared (ir)-luminous galaxy maintaining a highstar-formation rate (sfr), with no evidence of an agn from optical or infraredspectroscopy, nor x-ray emission. this galaxy is lensed gravitationally by thecluster abell 2218, making it accessible to spitzer spectroscopy. correctingfor nebular extinction derived from the h-alpha and pa-alpha lines, thedust-corrected luminosity is l(pa-alpha) = (2.57+/-0.43) x 10^43 erg s^-1,which corresponds to an ionization rate, q = (1.6+/-0.3) x 10^55 photons s^-1.the instantaneous sfr is 171+/-28 solar masses per year, assuming asalpeter-like initial mass function. the total ir luminosity derived using 70,450, and 850 micron data is l(ir) = (5-10) x 10^11 solar luminosities,corrected for gravitational lensing. this corresponds to a sfr=90-180 solarmasses per year, where the upper range is consistent with that derived from thepaschen-alpha luminosity. while the l(8 micron) / l(pa-alpha) ratio isconsistent with the extrapolated relation observed in local galaxies andstar-forming regions, the rest-frame 24 micron luminosity is significantlylower with respect to local galaxies of comparable paschen-alpha luminosity.thus, smm j163554.2+661225 arguably lacks a warmer dust component (t ~ 70 k),which is associated with deeply embedded star formation, and which contrastswith local galaxies with comparable sfrs. rather, the starburst is consistentwith star-forming local galaxies with intrinsic luminosities, l(ir) ~ 10^10solar luminosities, but "scaled-up" by a factor of 10-100.

0912.0514	the growth of massive galaxies since z=2	we study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using datafrom the newfirm medium band survey. the sample is selected at a constantnumber density of n=2x10^-4 mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can becompared in a meaningful way. we show that the stellar mass of galaxies at thisnumber density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following therelation log(m)=11.45-0.15z. in order to determine at what physical radii thismass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame r-band images atredshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. these image stacks of typically 70-80galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surfacebrightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. we find that massive galaxiesgradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 gyr. the mass within aradius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpchas increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. parameterizing the surfacebrightness profiles we find that the effective radius and sersic n parameterevolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. the data demonstratethat massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extendedstellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radialdensity distributions. comparing the observed mass evolution to the averagestar formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likelydominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% ofthe mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. the main uncertainties in this study arepossible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses andthe conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.

0912.1180	comparing the relation between star formation and galaxy mass in  different environments	analyzing 24 mu m mips/spitzer data and the [o ii]3727 line of a sample ofgalaxies at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs), weinvestigate the ongoing star formation rate (sfr) and the specific starformation rate (ssfr) as a function of stellar mass in galaxy clusters andgroups, and compare with field studies. as for the field, we find a decline insfr with time, indicating that star formation (sf) was more active in the past,and a decline in ssfr as galaxy stellar mass increases, showing that thecurrent sf contributes more to the fractional growth of low-mass galaxies thanhigh-mass galaxies. however, we find a lower median sfr (by a factor of ~1.5)in cluster star-forming galaxies than in the field. the difference is highlysignificant when all spitzer and emission-line galaxies are considered,regardless of color. it remains significant at z&gt;0.6 after removing redemission-line (rel) galaxies, to avoid possible agn contamination. while thereis overlap between the cluster and field sfr-mass relations, we find apopulation of cluster galaxies (10-25%) with reduced sfr for their mass. theseare likely to be in transition from star-forming to passive. comparingseparately clusters and groups at z&gt;0.6, only cluster trends are significantlydifferent from the field, and the average cluster sfr at a given mass is ~2times lower than the field. we conclude that the average sfr in star-forminggalaxies varies with galaxy environment at a fixed galaxy mass.

1001.2008	the environmental dependence of the evolving s0 fraction	we reinvestigate the dramatic rise in the s0 fraction, f_s0, within clusterssince z ~ 0.5. in particular, we focus on the role of the global galaxyenvironment on f_s0 by compiling, either from our own observations or theliterature, robust line-of-sight velocity dispersions, sigma's, for a sample ofgalaxy groups and clusters at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 that have uniformly determined,published morphological fractions. we find that the trend of f_s0 with redshiftis twice as strong for sigma &lt; 750 km/s groups/poor clusters than forhigher-sigma, rich clusters. from this result, we infer that over this redshiftrange galaxy-galaxy interactions, which are more effective in lower-sigmaenvironments, are more responsible for transforming spiral galaxies into s0'sthan galaxy-environment processes, which are more effective in higher-sigmaenvironments. the rapid, recent growth of the s0 population in groups and poorclusters implies that large numbers of progenitors exist in low-sigma systemsat modest redshifts (~ 0.5), where morphologies and internal kinematics arewithin the measurement range of current technology.

1007.1425	the colour-magnitude relation of elliptical and lenticular galaxies in  the eso distant cluster survey	we study the colour-magnitude relation (cmr) for a sample of 172morphologically-classified e/s0 cluster galaxies from the eso distant clustersurvey (ediscs) at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8. the intrinsic colour scatter about the cmr isvery small (0.076) in rest-frame u-v. only 7% of the galaxies are significantlybluer than the cmr. the scarcity of blue s0s indicates that, if they are thedescendants of spirals, these were already red when they became s0s. we observeno dependence of the cmr scatter with redshift or cluster velocity dispersion.this implies that by the time cluster e/s0s achieve their morphology, the vastmajority have already joined the red sequence. we estimate the galaxy formationredshift z_f for each cluster and find that it does not depend on the clustervelocity dispersion. however, z_f increases weakly with cluster redshift. thistrend becomes clearer when including higher-z clusters from the literature,suggesting that, at any given z, in order to have a population of fully-formede and s0s they needed to have formed most of their stars 2-4 gyr prior toobservation. in other words, the galaxies that already have early-type (et)morphologies also have reasonably-old stellar populations. this is partly amanifestation of the "progenitor bias", but also a consequence of the fact thatthe vast majority of the ets in clusters (in particular the massive ones) werealready red by the time they achieved their morphology. e and s0 galaxiesexhibit very similar colour scatter, implying similar stellar population ages.we also find that fainter ets finished forming their stars later, consistentwith the cluster red sequence being built over time and the brightest galaxiesreaching the red sequence earlier than fainter ones. finally, we find that theet cluster galaxies must have had their star formation truncated over anextended period of at least 1 gyr.

1008.4357	the spectral energy distribution of post-starburst galaxies in the  newfirm medium-band survey: a low contribution from tp-agb stars	stellar population synthesis (sps) models are a key ingredient of many galaxyevolution studies. unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated forcertain stellar evolution stages. of particular concern is the treatment of thethermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase, as differentimplementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as tp-agb stars arethought to be most prominently visible during this phase. here, we usepost-starburst galaxies in the newfirm medium-band survey to assess differentsps models. the available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous andwell-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0, from which weconstruct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (sed) over therange 1200-40 000 angstrom. the sed is well-fit by the bruzual &amp; charlot spsmodels, while the maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical andnear-infrared parts of the sed simultaneously. when the fitting is restrictedto lambda &lt; 6000 angstrom, the maraston models overpredict the near-infraredluminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to tp-agb stars.using the flexible sps models by conroy et al, and assuming solar metallicity,we find that the contribution of tp-agb stars to the integrated sed is a factorof ~3 lower than predicted by the latest padova tp-agb models. whether this isdue to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dustobscuration of tp-agb stars remains to be addressed. altogether, our datademand a low contribution from tp-agb stars to the sed of post-starburstgalaxies.

1009.0269	the most massive galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 in the newfirm medium-band  survey: properties and improved constraints on the stellar mass function	[abridged] we use the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) to characterize theproperties of a mass-complete sample of 14 galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 withm_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun, and to derive more accurate measurements of thehigh-mass end of the stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies at z=3.5, withsignificantly reduced contributions from photometric redshift errors and cosmicvariance to the total error budget of the smf. the typical very massive galaxyat z=3.5 is red and faint in the observer's optical, with median r=26.1, andrest-frame u-v=1.6. about 60% of the sample have optical colors satisfyingeither the u- or the b-dropout color criteria, although ~50% of these galaxieshave r&gt;25.5. about 30% of the sample has sfrs from sed modeling consistent withzero. however, &gt;80% of the sample is detected at 24 micron, with total infraredluminosities in the range (0.5-4.0)x10^13 lsun. this implies the presence ofeither dust-enshrouded starburst activity (with sfrs of 600-4300 msun/yr)and/or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). the contribution ofgalaxies with m_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun to the total stellar mass budget at z=3.5is ~8%. we find an evolution by a factor of 2-7 and 3-22 from z~5 and z~6,respectively, to z=3.5. the previously found disagreement at the high-mass endbetween observed and model-predicted smfs is now significant at the 3sigmalevel. however, systematic uncertainties dominate the total error budget, witherrors up to a factor of ~8 in the densities, bringing the observed smf inmarginal agreement with the predicted smf. additional systematic uncertaintieson the high-mass end could be introduced by either 1) the intensestar-formation and/or the very common agn activities as inferred from the mips24 micron detections, and/or 2) contamination by a significant population ofmassive, old, and dusty galaxies at z~2.6.

1010.4442	galaxy stellar mass functions of different morphological types in  clusters, and their evolution between z=0.8 and z=0	we present the galaxy stellar mass function (mf) and its evolution inclusters from z~0.8 to the current epoch, based on the wide-field nearbygalaxy-cluster survey (wings) (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07), and the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs) (0.4&lt;z &lt;0.8). we investigate the total mf and find it evolvesnoticeably with redshift. the shape at m*&gt;10^11 m' does not evolve, but belowm*~10^10.8 m' the mf at high redshift is flat, while in the local universe itflattens out at lower masses. the population of m* = 10^10.2 - 10^10.8 m'galaxies must have grown significantly between z=0.8 and z=0. we analyze the mfof different morphological types (ellipticals, s0s and late-types), and findthat also each of them evolves with redshift. all types have proportionallymore massive galaxies at high- than at low-z, and the strongest evolutionoccurs among s0 galaxies. examining the morphology-mass relation (the way theproportion of galaxies of different morphological types changes with galaxymass), we find it strongly depends on redshift. at both redshifts, ~40% of thestellar mass is in elliptical galaxies. another ~43% of the mass is in s0galaxies in local clusters, while it is in spirals in distant clusters. toexplain the observed trends, we discuss the importance of those mechanisms thatcould shape the mf. we conclude that mass growth due to star formation plays acrucial role in driving the evolution. it has to be accompanied by infall ofgalaxies onto clusters, and the mass distribution of infalling galaxies mightbe different from that of cluster galaxies. however, comparing with high-zfield samples, we do not find conclusive evidence for such an environmentalmass segregation. our results suggest that star formation and infall changedirectly the mf of late-type galaxies in clusters and, indirectly, that ofearly-type galaxies through subsequent morphological transformations.

1105.4609	the newfirm medium-band survey: photometric catalogs, redshifts and the  bimodal color distribution of galaxies out to z~3	we present deep near-infrared (nir) medium-bandwidth photometry over thewavelength range 1-1.8 microns in the all-wavelength extended groth stripinternational survey (aegis) and cosmic evolution survey (cosmos) fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs),an noao survey program on the mayall 4m telescope on kitt peak using the noaoextremely wide-field infrared imager (newfirm). in this paper, we describe thefull details of the observations, data reduction and photometry for the survey.we also present a public k-selected photometric catalog, along with accuratephotometric redshifts. the redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in thecosmos (aegis) fields, combining the nir medium-bandwidth data with existingultraviolet (uv; galaxy evolution explorer), visible and nir(canada-france-hawaii telescope and subaru) and mid-ir (spitzer/irac) imaging.we find excellent agreement with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts,with sigma_z/(1+z)~1-2% for ~4000 galaxies at z=0-3. the nmbs catalogs contain~13,000 galaxies at z&gt;1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-framecolors. due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five nirmedium-band filters, the median 68% confidence intervals of the photometricredshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of ~2 timessmaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band nir photometry to nirbroadband photometry. we show evidence for a clear bimodal color distributionbetween quiescent and star-forming galaxies that persists to z~3, a higherredshift than has been probed so far.

1107.0963	the effect of the environment on the gas kinematics and the structure of  distant galaxies	with the aim of distinguishing between possible physical mechanisms acting ongalaxies when they fall into clusters, we study the properties of the gas andthe stars in a sample of 422 emission-line galaxies from ediscs in differentenvironments up to z~1. we identify galaxies with kinematical disturbances(from emission-lines in their 2d spectra) and find that they are more frequentin clusters than in the field. the fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxiesincreases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from thecluster centre, but remains constant with projected galaxy density. we alsostudied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from hst/f814w images,finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar inall environments. moreover, there is little correlation between the presence ofkinematically-disturbed gas and morphological distortions. we also study thedependence of the tully-fisher relation, star formation, and extent of theemission on environment, and conclude that the gas disks in cluster galaxieshave been truncated, and therefore their star formation is more concentratedthan in low-density environments. if spirals transform into s0s, our findingsimply that the physical mechanism transforming cluster galaxies efficientlydisturbs the star-forming gas and reduces their specific star formation rate.moreover, this star-forming gas is either removed more efficiently from theoutskirts of the galaxies or is driven towards the centre (or both), helping tobuild the bulges of s0s. these results, in addition to the finding that thetransformation mechanism does not seem to induce strong morphologicaldisturbances on the galaxies, suggest that the physical processes involved arerelated to the intracluster medium, with galaxy-galaxy interactions playingonly a limited role in clusters.

0710.0589	the lopsidedness of present-day galaxies: results from the sloan digital  sky survey	large-scale asymmetries in the stellar mass distribution in galaxies arebelieved to trace non-equilibrium situations in the luminous and/or dark mattercomponent. these may arise in the aftermath of events like mergers, accretion,and tidal interactions. these events are key in the evolution of galaxies. inthis paper we quantify the large-scale lopsidedness of light distributions in25155 galaxies at z &lt; 0.06 from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4using the m = 1 azimuthal fourier mode. we show that the lopsided distributionof light is primarily due to a corresponding lopsidedness in the stellar massdistribution. observational effects, such as seeing, poisson noise, andinclination, introduce only small errors in lopsidedness for the majority ofthis sample. we find that lopsidedness correlates strongly with other basicgalaxy structural parameters: galaxies with low concentration, stellar mass,and stellar surface mass density tend to be lopsided, while galaxies with highconcentration, mass, and density are not. we find that the strongest and mostfundamental relationship between lopsidedness and the other structuralparameters is with the surface mass density. we also find, in agreement withprevious studies, that lopsidedness tends to increase with radius. both theseresults may be understood as a consequence of several factors. the outerregions of galaxies and low-density galaxies are more susceptible to tidalperturbations, and they also have longer dynamical times (so lopsidedness willlast longer). they are also more likely to be affected by any underlyingasymmetries in the dark matter halo.

1110.3323	probing the star formation history and initial mass function of the  z~2.5 lensed galaxy smm j163554.2+661225 with herschel	we present the analysis of herschel spire far-infrared (fir) observations ofthe z = 2.515 lensed galaxy smm j163554.2+661225. combining new 250, 350, and500 micron observations with existing data, we make an improved fit to the firspectral energy distribution (sed) of this galaxy. we find a total infrared(ir) luminosity of l(8--1000 micron) = 6.9 +/- 0.6x10^11 lsol; a factor of 3more precise over previous l_ir estimates for this galaxy, and one of the mostaccurate measurements for any galaxy at these redshifts. this fir luminosityimplies an unlensed star formation rate (sfr) for this galaxy of 119 +/- 10msol per yr, which is a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.35 lower than the sfr derived fromthe nebular pa-alpha emission line (a 2.5-sigma discrepancy). both sfrindicators assume identical salpeter initial mass functions (imf) with slopegamma=2.35 over a mass range of 0.1 - 100 msol, thus this discrepancy suggeststhat more ionizing photons may be necessary to account for the higherpa-alpha-derived sfr. we examine a number of scenarios and find that theobservations can be explained with a varying star formation history (sfh) dueto an increasing star formation rate (sfr), paired with a slight flattening ofthe imf. if the sfr is constant in time, then larger changes need to be made tothe imf by either increasing the upper-mass cutoff to ~ 200 msol, or aflattening of the imf slope to 1.9 +/- 0.15, or a combination of the two. thesescenarios result in up to double the number of stars with masses above 20 msol,which produce the requisite increase in ionizing photons over a salpeter imfwith a constant sfh.

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1403.3104	ionized gas disks in elliptical and s0 galaxies at $z&lt;1$	we analyse the extended, ionized-gas emission of 24 early-type galaxies(etgs) at $0&lt;z&lt;1$ from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs). we discussdifferent possible sources of ionization and favour star-formation as the maincause of the observed emission. 10 galaxies have disturbed gas kinematics,while 14 have rotating gas disks. in addition, 15 galaxies are in the field,while 9 are in the infall regions of clusters. this implies that, if the gashas an internal origin, this is likely stripped as the galaxies get closer tothe cluster centre. if the gas instead comes from an external source, then ourresults suggest that this is more likely acquired outside the clusterenvironment, where galaxy-galaxy interactions more commonly take place. weanalyse the tully-fisher relation of the etgs with gas disks, and compare themto ediscs spirals. taking a matched range of redshifts, $m_{b}&lt;-20$, andexcluding galaxies with large velocity uncertainties, we find that, at fixedrotational velocity, etgs are 1.7 mag fainter in $m_{b}$ than spirals. at fixedstellar mass, we also find that etgs have systematically lower specificstar-formation rates than spirals. this study constitutes an important stepforward towards the understanding of the evolution of the complex ism in etgsby significantly extending the look-back-time baseline explored so far.

0805.1145	the relation between star formation, morphology and local density in  high redshift clusters and groups	we investigate how the [oii] properties and the morphologies of galaxies inclusters and groups at z=0.4-0.8 depend on projected local galaxy density, andcompare with the field at similar redshifts and clusters at low-z. in bothnearby and distant clusters, higher-density regions contain proportionallyfewer star-forming galaxies, and the average [oii] equivalent width ofstar-forming galaxies is independent of local density. however, in distantclusters the average current star formation rate (sfr) in star-forming galaxiesseems to peak at densities ~15-40 galaxies mpc^{-2}. at odds with low-zresults, at high-z the relation between star-forming fraction and local densityvaries from high- to low-mass clusters. overall, our results suggest that athigh-z the current star formation (sf) activity in star-forming galaxies doesnot depend strongly on global or local environment, though the possible sfrpeak seems at odds with this conclusion. we find that the cluster sfrnormalized by cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with thestar-forming fraction. these trends can be understood given a) that the averagestar-forming galaxy forms about 1 msun/yr in all clusters; b) that the totalnumber of galaxies scales with cluster mass and c) the dependence ofstar-forming fraction on cluster mass. we present the morphology-density (md)relation for our z=0.4-0.8 clusters, and uncover that the decline of the spiralfraction with density is entirely driven by galaxies of types sc or later. forgalaxies of a given hubble type, we see no evidence that sf properties dependon local environment. in contrast with recent findings at low-z, in our distantclusters the sf-density relation and the md-relation are equivalent, suggestingthat neither of the two is more fundamental than the other.(abr.)

astro-ph;0003109	lopsided galaxies, weak interactions and boosting the star formation  rate	to investigate the link between weak tidal interactions in disk galaxies andthe boosting of their recent star formation, we obtain images and spatiallyintegrated spectra (3615a &lt; lambda &lt; 5315a) for 40 late-type spiral galaxies(sab-sbc) with varying degrees of lopsidedness (a dynamical indicator of weakinteractions). we quantify lopsidedness as the amplitude &lt;a_1&gt; of the m=1fourier component of the azimuthal surface brightness distribution, averagedover a range of radii. we compare the young stellar content, quantified byew(h\delta_abs) and the strength of the 4000 angstrom break (d_4000), withlopsidedness and find a 3-4 sigma correlation between the two. we also find a3.2 sigma correlation between ew(h\beta_emission) and lopsidedness. using theevolutionary population synthesis code of bruzual &amp; charlot we model thespectra as an ``underlying population'' and a superimposed ``boost population''with the aim of constraining the fractional boost in the sfr averaged over thepast 0.5 gyr (the characteristic lifetime of lopsidedness). from the differencein both ew(h\delta_abs) and d_4000 between the most and least symmetric thirdsof our sample, we infer that ~ 1x10^9 m_solar of stars are formed over theduration of a lopsided event in addition to the ``underlying'' sfh (assuming afinal galactic stellar mass of 10^10 m_solar). this corresponds to a factor of8 increase in the sfr over the past 5x10^8 years. for the nuclear spectra, allof the above correlations except d_4000 vs. &lt;a_1&gt; are weaker than for the disk,indicating that in lopsided galaxies, the sf boost is not dominated by thenucleus.

astro-ph;0303163	a significant population of red, near-ir selected high redshift galaxies	we use very deep near-infrared photometry of the hubble deep field southtaken with isaac/vlt to identify a population of high redshift galaxies withrest- frame optical colors similar to those of nearby galaxies. the galaxiesare chosen by their infrared colors js-ks &gt; 2.3, aimed at selecting galaxieswith redshifts above 2. when applied to our dataset, we find 14 galaxies withks &lt; 22.5, corresponding to a surface density of 3+-0.8 /arcmin**2. thephotometric redshifts all lie above 1.9, with a median of 2.6 and a rms of 0.7.the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies show a wide range: one isvery blue in the rest-frame uv, and satisfies the normal lyman-break criteriafor high redshift, star-forming galaxies. others are quite red throughout theobserved spectral range, and are extremely faint in the optical, with a medianv = 26.6. hence these galaxies would not be included in photometric samplesbased on optical ground-based data, and spectroscopic follow-up is difficult.the spectral energy distributions often show a prominent break, identified asthe balmer break or 4000 ang. break. the median age is 1 gyr when fit with aconstant star formation model with dust, or 0.7 gyr when fit with a singleburst model. although significantly younger ages cannot be excluded when alarger range of models is allowed, the results indicate that these galaxies areamong the oldest at these redshifts. the volume density to ks=22.5 is half thatof lyman-break galaxies at z = 3. since the mass-to-light ratios of the redgalaxies are likely to be higher, the stellar mass density is inferred to becomparable to that of lyman-break galaxies. these red galaxies may be thedescendants of galaxies which started to form stars at very high redshifts, andthey may evolve into the most massive galaxies at low redshift.

astro-ph;0504225	the size evolution of galaxies since z~3: combining sdss, gems and fires	we present the evolution of the luminosity-size and stellar mass-sizerelations of luminous (l_v&gt;3.4x10^10h_70^-2l_sun) and of massive(m_*&gt;3x10^10h_70^-2m_sun) galaxies in the last ~11 gyr. we use very deepnear-infrared images of the hubble deep field-south and the ms1054-03 field inthe j_s, h and k_s bands from fires to retrieve the sizes in the opticalrest-frame for galaxies with z&gt;1. we combine our results with those from gemsat 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 and sdss at z~0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the opticalrest-frame size evolution from z=0 to z=3. galaxies are differentiatedaccording to their light concentration using the sersic index n. for lessconcentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3+-0.5(+-2 sigma) times smaller at z~2.5 than those we see today. the stellarmass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was\~2+-0.5 times smaller at z~2.5, evolving proportional to (1+z)^{-0.40+-0.06}.simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in ahierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the errorbars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. the observedluminosity-size evolution out to z~2.5 matches well recent infall modelpredictions for milky-way type objects. for low-n galaxies, the evolution ofthe stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individualgalaxies grow inside-out. for highly concentrated objects, the situation is asfollows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7+-1.1 times smaller atz~2.5 (or put differently, were typically ~2.2+-0.7 mag brighter at a givensize than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolvedproportional to (1+z)^{-0.45+-0.10}.

astro-ph;0504578	halpha-derived star-formation rates for three z ~ 0.75 ediscs galaxy  clusters	we present halpha-derived star-formation rates (sfrs) for three z ~ 0.75galaxy clusters. our 1 sigma flux limit corresponds to a star-formation rate of0.10-0.24 solar mass per year, and our minimum reliable halpha + [n ii]rest-frame equivalent width is 10\aa. we show that halpha narrowband imaging isan efficient method for measuring star formation in distant clusters. in twoout of three clusters, we find that the fraction of star-forming galaxiesincreases with projected distance from the cluster center. we also find thatthe fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxysurface density in the same two clusters. we compare the median rate of starformation among star-forming cluster galaxies to a small sample of star-formingfield galaxies from the literature and find that the median cluster sfrs are\~50% less than the median field sfr. we characterize cluster evolution interms of the mass-normalized integrated cluster sfr and find that the z ~ 0.75clusters have more sfr per cluster mass on average than the z &lt;= 0.4 clustersfrom the literature. the interpretation of this result is complicated by thedependence of the mass-normalized sfr on cluster mass and the lack ofsufficient overlap in the mass ranges covered by the low and high redshiftsamples. we find that the fraction and luminosities of the brightest starburstgalaxies at z ~ 0.75 are consistent with their being progenitors of thepost-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.45 if the post-starburst phase lasts several(~5) times longer than the starburst phase.

astro-ph;0603063	direct measurements of the stellar continua and balmer/4000 angstrom  breaks of red z&gt;2 galaxies: redshifts and improved constraints on stellar  populations	we use near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy obtained with gnirs on gemini,nirspec on keck, and isaac on the vlt to study the rest-frame optical continuaof three `distant red galaxies' (having js - ks &gt; 2.3) at z&gt;2. all three galaxyspectra show the balmer/4000 angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. thespectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum withan estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. these redshifts agree well withthe emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with halpha emission. thistechnique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in therest-frame uv, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selectedin optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. furthermore, weuse the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of halpha together withevolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,dust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. inclusionof the nir spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range ofpossible solutions for stellar population properties. we find that the stellarpopulations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dustystarburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxywith a strong break and no detected line emission. the dusty starburst galaxyhas an age of 0.3 gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11 msun. the spectra of thetwo most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3-1.4 gyr and stellar masses of4*10^11 msun. the large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthensour previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry. largersamples are required to determine the relative frequency of dusty starburstsand (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0606330	clustering of k-selected galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5: evidence for a  color-density relation	we study the clustering properties of k-selected galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 usingdeep multiwavelength imaging in three fields from the musyc survey. these arethe first measurements to probe the spatial correlation function of k-selectedgalaxies in this redshift range on large scales, allowing for robustconclusions about the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. k-selectedgalaxies with k&lt;21 have a correlation length r_0 ~ 6 h^-1 mpc, larger thantypical values found for optically-selected galaxies. the correlation lengthdoes not depend on k-band magnitude, but it does increase strongly with color;the j-k&gt;2.3 distant red galaxies (drgs) have r_0 ~ 11 h^-1 mpc. contrary tofindings for optically-selected galaxies, k-selected galaxies that are faint inthe r-band cluster more strongly than brighter galaxies. these results suggestthat a color-density relation was in place at z&gt;2. our results indicate thatk-bright blue galaxies and k-bright red galaxies are fundamentally different,as they have different clustering properties. using a simple model of onegalaxy per halo, we infer halo masses ~ 5 x 10^12 m_sun for k&lt;21 galaxies and ~2 x 10^13 m_sun for drgs. a comparison of the observed space density of drgs tothe density of their host halos suggests large halo occupation numbers;however, this result is at odds with the lack of a strong small-scale excess inthe angular correlation function. we find that the z=0 descendants of thegalaxies considered here reside primarily in groups and clusters.

astro-ph;0606536	measuring the average evolution of luminous galaxies at z&lt;3: the  rest-frame optical luminosity density, spectral energy distribution, and  stellar mass density	(abridged) we present the evolution of the volume averaged properties of therest-frame optically luminous galaxy population to z~3, determined from fourdisjoint deep fields with optical to near-infrared wavelength coverage. weselect galaxies above a rest-frame v-band luminosity of 3x10^10 lsol andcharacterize their rest-frame uv through optical properties via the meanspectral energy distribution (sed). to measure evolution we apply the sameselection criteria to a sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky surveyand combo-17. the mean rest-frame 2200ang through v-band sed becomes steadilybluer with increasing redshift but at z&lt;3 the mean sed falls within the rangedefined by ``normal'' galaxies in the nearby universe. we measure stellarmass-to-light ratios (mstar/l) by fitting models to the rest-frame uv-opticalseds and derive the stellar mass density. the stellar mass density in luminousgalaxies has increased by a factor of 3.5-7.9 from z=3 to z=0.1, includingfield-to-field variance uncertainties. after correcting to total, the measuredmass densities at z&lt;2 lie below the integral of the star formation rate (sfr)density as a function of redshift as derived from uv selected samples. this mayindicate a systematic error in the mass densities or sfr(z) estimates. we findlarge discrepancies between recent model predictions for the evolution of themass density and our results, even when our observational selection is appliedto the models. finally we determine that distant red galaxies (selected to havej_s - k_s&gt;2.3) in our lv selected samples contribute 30% and 64% of the stellarmass budget at z~2 and z~ 2.8 respectively. these galaxies are largely absentfrom uv surveys and this result highlights the need for mass selection of highredshift galaxies.

astro-ph;0608446	spectroscopic identification of massive galaxies at z~2.3 with strongly  suppressed star formation	we present first results of a spectroscopic survey targeting k-selectedgalaxies at z=2.0-2.7 using the gnirs instrument on gemini-south. we obtainednear-infrared spectra with a wavelength coverage of 1.0-2.5 micron for 26k-bright galaxies (k&lt;19.7) selected from the musyc survey using photometricredshifts. we successfully derived spectroscopic redshifts for all 26 galaxiesusing rest-frame optical emission lines or the redshifted balmer/4000 angstrombreak. twenty galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7, forwhich bright emission lines like halpha and [oiii] fall in atmospheric windows.surprisingly, we detected no emission lines for nine of these 20 galaxies. themedian 2 sigma upper limit on the rest-frame equivalent width of halpha forthese nine galaxies is ~10 angstrom. the stellar continuum emission of thesesame nine galaxies is best fitted by evolved stellar population models. thebest-fit star formation rate (sfr) is zero for five out of nine galaxies, andconsistent with zero within 1 sigma for the remaining four. thus, both thehalpha measurements and the independent stellar continuum modeling imply that45% of our k-selected galaxies are not forming stars intensely. this highfraction of galaxies without detected line emission and low sfrs may imply thatthe suppression of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at higher redshiftthan is predicted by current cdm galaxy formation models. however, obscuredstar formation may have been missed, and deep mid-infrared imaging is needed toclarify this situation.

astro-ph;0609548	what do we learn from irac observations of galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5?	we analyze very deep hst, vlt and spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5in the hubble deep field south. the sample is selected from the deepest publick-band imaging currently available. we show that the rest-frame u-v vs v-jcolor-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations ofdistant galaxies. galaxies with red rest-frame u-v colors are generally red inrest-frame v-j as well. however, at a given u-v color a range in v-j colorsexists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxiesfrom old, passively evolving galaxies. we quantify the effects of iracphotometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z&gt;2 galaxies.the estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantlywhen adding irac data to the ubvijhk photometry. however, for individualgalaxies the addition of irac can improve the constraints on the stellarpopulations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar massdecrease by a factor of 2.7 for red (u-v &gt; 1) galaxies, but only by a factor of1.3 for blue (u-v &lt; 1) galaxies. we find a similar color-dependence of theimprovement for estimates of age and dust extinction. in addition, theimprovement from adding irac depends on the availability of full near-infraredjhk coverage; if only k-band were available, the mass uncertainties of bluegalaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor 1.9. finally, we find thata trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z&gt;2. the mostmassive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame u-v colors compared tolower mass galaxies even when allowing for complex star formation histories.

astro-ph;0610373	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters since  z~0.8	using galaxy clusters from the eso distant cluster survey, we study how thedistribution of galaxies along the colour-magnitude relation has evolved sincez~0.8. while red-sequence galaxies in all these clusters are well described byan old, passively evolving population, we confirm our previous finding of asignificant evolution in their luminosity distribution as a function ofredshift. when compared to galaxy clusters in the local universe, the highredshift ediscs clusters exhibit a significant "deficit" of faint red galaxies.combining clusters in three different redshift bins, and defining as `faint'all galaxies in the range 0.4 &gt; l/l* &gt; 0.1, we find a clear decrease in theluminous-to-faint ratio of red galaxies from z~0.8 to z~0.4. the amount of sucha decrease appears to be in qualitative agreement with predictions of a modelwhere the blue bright galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram ofhigh redshift clusters, have their star formation suppressed by the hostilecluster environment. although model results need to be interpreted withcaution, our findings clearly indicate that the red-sequence population ofhigh-redshift clusters does not contain all progenitors of nearby red-sequencecluster galaxies. a significant fraction of these must have moved onto thered-sequence below z~0.8.

astro-ph;0610484	the rest-frame optical luminosity functions of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5	we present the rest-frame optical (b, v, and r band) luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5, measured from a k-selected sample constructedfrom the deep nir musyc, the ultradeep fires, and the goods-cdfs. this sampleis unique for its combination of area and range of luminosities. the faint-endslopes of the lfs at z&gt;2 are consistent with those at z~0. the characteristicmagnitudes are significantly brighter than the local values (e.g., ~1.2 mag inthe r band), while the measured values for phi_star are typically ~5 timessmaller. the b-band luminosity density at z~2.3 is similar to the local value,and in the r band it is ~2 times smaller than the local value. we present thelf of distant red galaxies (drgs), which we compare to that of non-drgs. whiledrgs and non-drgs are characterized by similar lfs at the bright end, thefaint-end slope of the non-drg lf is much steeper than that of drgs. thecontribution of drgs to the global densities down to the faintest probedluminosities is 14%-25% in number and 22%-33% in luminosity. from the derivedrest-frame u-v colors and stellar population synthesis models, we estimate themass-to-light ratios (m/l) of the different subsamples. the m/l ratios of drgsare ~5 times higher (in the r and v bands) than those of non-drgs. the globalstellar mass density at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 appears to be dominated by drgs, whosecontribution is of order ~60%-80% of the global value. qualitatively similarresults are obtained when the population is split by rest-frame u-v colorinstead of observed j-k color.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.

astro-ph;0612612	the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc): deep near-infrared  imaging and the selection of distant galaxies	we present deep near-infrared jhk imaging of four 10'x10' fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the multiwavelength survey byyale-chile (musyc) with ispi on the ctio 4m telescope. the typical point sourcelimiting depths are j~22.5, h~21.5, and k~21 (5sigma; vega). the effectiveseeing in the final images is ~1.0". we combine these data with musyc ubvrizimaging to create k-selected catalogs that are unique for their uniform size,depth, filter coverage, and image quality. we investigate the rest-frameoptical colors and photometric redshifts of galaxies that are selected usingcommon color selection techniques, including distant red galaxies (drgs),star-forming and passive bzks, and the rest-frame uv-selected bm, bx, and lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs). these techniques are effective at isolating largesamples of high redshift galaxies, but none provide complete or uniform samplesacross the targeted redshift ranges. the drg and bm/bx/lbg criteria identifypopulations of red and blue galaxies, respectively, as they were designed todo. the star-forming bzks have a very wide redshift distribution, a wide rangeof colors, and may include galaxies with very low specific star formationrates. in comparison, the passive bzks are fewer in number, have a differentdistribution of k magnitudes, and have a somewhat different redshiftdistribution. by combining these color selection criteria, it appears possibleto define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit overspecific redshift ranges. however, the redshift dependence of both thecompleteness and sampled range of rest-frame colors poses an ultimate limit tothe usefulness of these techniques.

astro-ph;9805316	lopsidedness in early type disk galaxies	we quantify the mean asymmetry of 54 face-on, early type disk galaxies (s0 tosab) using the amplitude of the m=1 azimuthal fourier component of the r-bandsurface brightness. we find that the median lopsidedness, (a_1/a_0)_{mean}, ofour sample is 0.11 and that the most lopsided 20% of our galaxies have(a_1/a_0)_{mean} &gt;= 0.19. asymmetries in early type disks appear to be ofsimilar frequency and strength as in late type disk galaxies (zaritsky and rix1997.) we have observed our early type disks in a bandpass (r-band) in whichthe light is dominated by stars with ages greater than 10^9 yrs, and thereforeare seeing azimuthal asymmetries in the stellar mass distribution. the similardegree of lopsidedness seen in disks of very different star formation ratesindicates that the lopsidedness in all galactic disks is primarily due toazimuthal mass asymmetries. hence, 20% of all disk galaxies (regardless ofhubble type) have azimuthal asymmetries, (a_1/a_0)_{mean} &gt;= 0.19, in theirstellar disk mass distribution, confirming lopsidedness as a dynamicalphenomenon.

0809.3310	the lopsidedness of present-day galaxies: connections to the formation  of stars, the chemical evolution of galaxies, and the growth of black holes	we have used the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to undertake aninvestigation of lopsidedness in a sample of ~25,000 nearby galaxies (z &lt;0.06). we use the m=1 azimuthal fourier mode between the 50% and 90% lightradii as our measure of lopsidedness. the sdss spectra are used to measure theproperties of the stars, gas, and black hole in the central-most few-kpc-scaleregion. we show that there is a strong link between lopsidedness in the outerparts of the galactic disk and the youth of the stellar population in thecentral region. this link is independent of the other structural properties ofthe galaxy. these results provide a robust statistical characterization of theconnections between accretion/interactions/mergers and the resulting starformation. we also show that residuals in the galaxy mass-metallicity relationcorrelate with lopsidedness (at fixed mass, the more metal-poor galaxies aremore lopsided). this suggests that the events causing lopsidedness and enhancedstar formation deliver lower metallicity gas into the galaxy's central region.finally, we find that there is a trend for the more powerful active galacticnuclei to be hosted by more lopsided galaxies (at fixed galaxy mass, density,or concentration). however if we compare samples matched to have both the samestructures and central stellar populations, we then find no difference inlopsidedness between active and non-active galaxies. this leads to thefollowing picture. the presence of cold gas in the central region of a galaxy(irrespective of its origin) is essential for both star-formation and blackhole growth. the delivery of cold gas is aided by the processes that producelopsidedness. other processes on scales smaller than we can probe with our dataare required to transport the gas to the black hole.

0810.3459	the rise of massive red galaxies: the color-magnitude and color-stellar  mass diagrams for z &lt; ~2 from the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile  (musyc)	we present the color-magnitude and color-stellar mass diagrams for galaxieswith z_phot &lt; ~2, based on a k &lt; 22 (ab) catalog of the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs) from the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc). ourmain sample of 7840 galaxies contains 1297 m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies in therange 0.2 &lt; z_phot &lt; 1.8. we show empirically that this catalog isapproximately complete for m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies for z_phot &lt; 1.8. forthis mass-limited sample, we show that the locus of the red sequencecolor-stellar mass relation evolves as del(u-r) ~ (-0.44+/-0.02) z_phot forz_phot &lt; ~1.2. for z_phot &gt; ~1.3, however, we are no longer able to reliablydistinguish red and blue subpopulations from the observed color distribution;we show that this would require much deeper near infrared data. at 1.5 &lt; z_phot&lt;1.8, the comoving number density of m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies is ~50% of thelocal value, with a red fraction of ~33%. making a parametric fit to theobserved evolution, we find n_tot(z) ~ (1+z_phot)^(-0.52+/-0.12(+/-0.20)). wefind stronger evolution in the red fraction: f_red(z) ~(1+z_phot)^(-1.17+/-0.18(+/-0.21)). through a series of sensitivity analyses,we show that the most important sources of systematic error are: 1. systematicdifferences in the analysis of the z~0 and z&gt;&gt;0 samples; 2. systematic effectsassociated with details of the photometric redshift calculation; and 3.uncertainties in the photometric calibration. with this in mind, we show thatour results based on photometric redshifts are consistent with a completelyindependent analysis which does not require redshift information for individualgalaxies. our results suggest that, at most, 1/5 of local red sequence galaxieswith m_* &gt;10^11 m_sol were already in place at z ~ 2.

0704.0953	ir observations of ms 1054-03: star formation and its evolution in rich  galaxy clusters	we study the infrared (ir) properties of galaxies in the cluster ms 1054-03at z=0.83 by combining mips 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400galaxies and a very deep k-band selected catalog. 19 ir cluster members areselected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by theirphotometric redshifts. we derive the ir luminosity function of the cluster andfind strong evolution compared to the similar-mass coma cluster. the bestfitting schechter function gives l*_{ir}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 l_sun with a fixedfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in coma. therate of evolution of the ir luminosity from coma to ms 1054-03 is consistentwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internalmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for thegeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) in differentenvironments. the mass-normalized integrated sfr within 0.5r_200 in ms 1054-03also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, butthe trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. anonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively andthe overdensity of ir galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. it isunlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from thesurrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their starformation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

0811.0252	the environments of starburst and post-starburst galaxies at z=0.4-0.8	post-starburst (e+a or k+a) spectra, characterized by their exceptionallystrong balmer lines in absorption and the lack of emission lines, belong togalaxies in which the star formation activity ended abruptly sometime duringthe past gyr. we perform a spectral analysis of galaxies in clusters, groups,poor groups and the field at z=0.4-0.8 based on the eso distant cluster survey.the incidence of k+a's at these redshifts depends strongly on environment.k+a's reside preferentially in clusters and, unexpectedly, in a subset of thesigma = 200-400 km/s groups, those that have a low fraction of [oii] emitters.in these environments, 20-30% of the recently star-forming galaxies have hadtheir star formation activity recently truncated. in contrast, there areproportionally fewer k+a's in the field, the poor groups and groups with a high[oii] fraction. the incidence of k+a galaxies correlates with the clustervelocity dispersion: more massive clusters have higher proportions of k+a's.spectra of dusty starburst candidates, with strong balmer absorption andemission lines, present a very different environmental dependence from k+a's.they are numerous in all environments at z=0.4-0.8, but they are especiallynumerous in all types of groups, favoring the hypothesis of triggering by amerger. our observations are consistent with previous suggestions that clusterk+a galaxies are observed in a transition phase as massive s0 and sa galaxies,evolving from star-forming later types to passively evolving early-typegalaxies. the correlation between k+a fraction and cluster sigma supports thehypothesis that k+a galaxies in clusters originate from processes related tothe intracluster medium, while several possibilities are discussed for theorigin of the k+a frequency in low-[oii] groups.(abr.)
