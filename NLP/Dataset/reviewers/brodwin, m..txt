0902.2812	mid-infrared galaxy luminosity functions from the agn and galaxy  evolution survey	we present galaxy luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micronmeasured by combining photometry from the irac shallow survey with redshiftsfrom the agn and galaxy evolution survey of the noao deep wide-field surveybootes field. the well-defined irac samples contain 3800-5800 galaxies for the3.6-8.0 micron bands with spectroscopic redshifts and z &lt; 0.6. we obtainedrelatively complete luminosity functions in the local redshift bin of z &lt; 0.2for all four irac channels that are well fit by schechter functions. we foundsignificant evolution in the luminosity functions for all four irac channelsthat can be fit as an evolution in m* with redshift, \delta m* = qz. while wemeasured q=1.2\pm0.4 and 1.1\pm0.4 in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands consistentwith the predictions from a passively evolving population, we obtainedq=1.8\pm1.1 in the 8.0 micron band consistent with other evolving starformation rate estimates. we compared our lfs with the predictions ofsemi-analytical galaxy formation and found the best agreement at 3.6 and 4.5micron, rough agreement at 8.0 micron, and a large mismatch at 5.8 micron.these models also predicted a comparable q value to our luminosity functions at8.0 micron, but predicted smaller values at 3.6 and 4.5 micron. we alsomeasured the luminosity functions separately for early and late-type galaxies.while the luminosity functions of late-type galaxies resemble those for thetotal population, the luminosity functions of early-type galaxies in the 3.6and 4.5 micron bands indicate deviations from the passive evolution model,especially from the measured flat luminosity density evolution. combining ourestimates with other measurements in the literature, we found (53\pm18)% of thepresent stellar mass of early-type galaxies has been assembled at z=0.7.

0905.0001	the host galaxies of swift dark gamma-ray bursts: observational  constraints on highly obscured and very high-redshift grbs	in this work we present the first results of our imaging campaign at keckobservatory to identify the host galaxies of "dark" gamma-ray bursts (grbs),events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical fluxsignificantly fainter than expected from the observed x-ray afterglow. we findthat out of a uniform sample of 29 swift bursts rapidly observed by the palomar60-inch telescope through march 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), allevents have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxydetection, or both. our results constrain the fraction of swift grbs comingfrom very high redshift (z &gt; 7), such as the recent grb 090423, to between0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. in contrast, a significant fraction of thesample requires large extinction columns (host-frame a_v &gt; 1 mag, with severalevents showing a_v &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominantcause of the dark grb phenomenon. we infer that a significant fraction of grbs(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscuredregions. however, the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal opticalcolors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinityof the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

0909.3849	low resolution spectral templates for agns and galaxies from 0.03 -- 30  microns	we present a set of low resolution empirical sed templates for agns andgalaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 to 30 microns based on themulti-wavelength photometric observations of the noao deep-wide field surveybootes field and the spectroscopic observations of the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey. our training sample is comprised of 14448 galaxies in the redshiftrange 0&lt;~z&lt;~1 and 5347 likely agns in the range 0&lt;~z&lt;~5.58. we use ourtemplates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and agns. while theyare relatively accurate for galaxies, their accuracies for agns are a strongfunction of the luminosity ratio between the agn and galaxy components.somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the agn and its host arewell determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error.we also use our templates to study the mid-ir agn selection criteria developedby stern et al.(2005) and lacy et al.(2004). we find that the stern etal.(2005) criteria suffers from significant incompleteness when there is astrong host galaxy component and at z =~ 4.5, when the broad halpha emissionline is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated bylow and intermediate redshift galaxies. the lacy et al.(2004) criterion is notaffected by incompleteness at z =~ 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by stronggalaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low redshift starforming galaxies. finally, we use our templates to predict the color-colordistribution of sources in the upcoming wise mission and define a colorcriterion to select agns analogous to those developed for irac photometry. weestimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 agns will be identified by thesecriteria, but will have serious completeness problems for z &gt;~ 3.4.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

1001.4529	the mid-ir and x-ray selected qso luminosity function	we present the j-band luminosity function of 1838 mid-infrared and x-rayselected agns in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;5.85. these luminosity functions areconstructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broad-band observations fromthe uv to the mid-ir of the ndwfs bootes field with the x-ray observations ofthe xbootes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field byages. our sample is primarily composed of irac-selected agns, targeted usingmodifications of the stern et al.(2005) criteria, complemented by mips 24microns and x-ray selected agns to alleviate the biases of irac mid-irselection against z~4.5 quasars and agns faint with respect to their hosts.this sample provides an accurate link between low and high redshift agnluminosity functions and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness ofoptical samples at z~3. we find that the space density of the brightest quasarsstrongly decreases from z=3 to z=0, while the space density of faint quasars isat least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. at z&gt;3 weobserve a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. wemodel the luminosity function by a double power-law and find that its evolutioncannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, butmust be a combination of both. our best-fit model has bright and faintpower-law indices consistent with the low redshift measurements based on the2qz and 2slaq surveys and it generally agrees with the number of bright quasarspredicted by other lfs at all redshifts. if we construct the qso luminosityfunction using only the irac-selected agns, we find that the biases inherent tothis selection method significantly modify the behavior of phi*(z) only for z&lt;1and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude m*_j(z).

1002.3158	a spitzer-selected galaxy cluster at z=1.62	we report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at z=1.62 located in the spitzerwide-area infrared extragalactic survey xmm-lss field. this structure wasselected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red spitzer/irac colors,satisfying [3.6]-[4.5] &gt; -0.1 ab mag. photometric redshifts derived from subaruxmm deep survey (bviz-bands), ukirt infrared deep survey-ultra-deep survey(ukidss-uds, jk-bands), and from the spitzer public uds survey (3.6-8.0 micron)show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z ~ 1.6that is more than 20 sigma above the mean at this redshift. we obtained opticalspectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using imacs on themagellan telescope. we measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the rangez=1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin (&lt;1.4 mpc) of the astrometric center of thecluster. a posteriori analysis of the xmm data in this field reveal a weak (4sigma) detection in the [0.5-2 kev] band compatible with the expected thermalemission from such a cluster. the color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies inthis cluster shows a prominent red-sequence, dominated by a population of redgalaxies with (z-j) &gt; 1.7 mag. the photometric redshift probabilitydistributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z=1.62, coincidentwith the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. the rest-frame (u-b) color andscatter of galaxies on the red-sequence are consistent with a meanluminosity-weighted age of 1.2 +/- 0.1 gyr, yielding a formation redshift z_f =2.35 +/- 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star-formation periodin these galaxies.

1002.3365	mid-infrared variability from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	we use the multi-epoch, mid-infrared spitzer deep, wide-field survey toinvestigate the variability of 474,179 objects in 8.1 deg^2 of the ndwfs bootesfield. we perform a difference image analysis of the four available epochsbetween 2004 and 2008, focusing on the deeper 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. we findthat 1.1% of the studied sample meet our standard selection criteria for beingclassed as a variable source. we require that the 3.6 and 4.5 micronlight-curves are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.8) and that their joint varianceexceeds that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2 sigma. we thenexamine the mid-ir colors of the variable sources and match them with x-raysources from the xbootes survey, radio catalogs, 24 micron-selected agncandidates, and spectroscopically identified agns from the agn and galaxyevolution survey (ages). based on their mid-ir colors, most of the variablesources are agns (76%), with smaller contributions from stars (11%), galaxies(6%), and unclassified objects. most of the stellar, galaxy and unclassifiedsources are false positives. for our standard selection criteria, 11-12% of themid-ir counterparts to x-ray sources, 24 micron-selected agn candidates andspectroscopically identified agns show variability. mid-ir agn variability canbe well described by a single power-law structure function with a power-lawindex of 0.5 at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and an amplitude of 0.1 mag onrest-frame time scales of 2 years. the variability amplitude is higher forshorter rest-frame wavelengths and lower luminosities.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1103.4612	a multiband study of the galaxy populations of the first four  sunyaev--zeldovich effect selected galaxy clusters	we present first results of an examination of the optical properties of thegalaxy populations in sze selected galaxy clusters. using clusters selected bythe south pole telescope survey and deep multiband optical data from the blancocosmology survey, we measure the radial profile, the luminosity function, theblue fraction and the halo occupation number of the galaxy populations of thesefour clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 1. our goal is to understandwhether there are differences among the galaxy populations of these szeselected clusters and previously studied clusters selected in the optical andthe x-ray. the radial distributions of galaxies in the four systems areconsistent with nfw profiles with a galaxy concentration of 3 to 6. we showthat the characteristic luminosities in $griz$ bands are consistent withpassively evolving populations emerging from a single burst at redshift $z=3$.the faint end power law slope of the luminosity function is found to be onaverage $\alpha \approx -1.2$ in griz. halo occupation numbers (to $m^*+2$) forthese systems appear to be consistent with those based on x-ray selectedclusters. the blue fraction estimated to $0.36l^*$, for the three lowerredshift systems, suggests an increase with redshift, although with the currentsample the uncertainties are still large. overall, this pilot study of thefirst four clusters provides no evidence that the galaxy populations in thesesystems differ significantly from those in previously studied clusterpopulations selected in the x-ray or the optical.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1105.3186	scaling relations and overabundance of massive clusters at z&gt;~1 from  weak-lensing studies with hst	we present weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 high-redshift (z &gt;~1)clusters based on hubble space telescope images. most clusters in our sampleprovide significant lensing signals and are well detected in theirreconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. combining the current results and ourprevious weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we comparegravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. werevisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in oursample is in tension with the current lambdacdm structure formation paradigm.we find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gastemperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperaturerelation at z &gt;~ 1. for the power law slope of the m-tx relation (m proptot^{\alpha}), we obtain \alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. this is consistent with thetheoretical self-similar prediction \alpha=3/2 and with the results previouslyreported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. however, ournormalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that thenormalization in the m-tx relation might evolve. after correcting for eddingtonbias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we findthat the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides atension with the current lambda cdm model. the combined probability of findingthe four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization overcurrent cosmological parameters is less than 1%.

1108.4681	the serendipitous observation of a gravitationally lensed galaxy at z =  0.9057 from the blanco cosmology survey: the elliot arc	we report on the serendipitous discovery in the blanco cosmology survey (bcs)imaging data of a z = 0.9057 galaxy that is being strongly lensed by a massivegalaxy cluster at a redshift of z=0.3838. the lens (bcs j2352-5452) wasdiscovered while examining i- and z-band images being acquired in october 2006during a bcs observing run. follow-up spectroscopic observations with the gmosinstrument on the gemini south 8m telescope confirmed the lensing nature ofthis system. using weak plus strong lensing, velocity dispersion, clusterrichness n_200, and fitting to an nfw cluster mass density profile, we havemade three independent estimates of the mass m_200 which are all veryconsistent with each other. the combination of the results from the threemethods gives m_200 = (5.1 +- 1.3) x 10^14 m_sun, which is fully consistentwith the individual measurements. the final nfw concentration c_200 from thecombined fit is c_200 = 5.4(+1.4 -1.1). we have compared our measurements ofm_200 and c_200 with predictions for (a) clusters from lambda_cdm simulations,(b) lensing selected clusters from simulations, and (c) a real sample ofcluster lenses. we find that we are most compatible with the predictions forlambda_cdm simulations for lensing clusters, and we see no evidence based onthis one system for an increased concentration compared to lambda_cdm. finally,using the flux measured from the [oii]3727 line we have determined the starformation rate (sfr) of the source galaxy and find it to be rather modest giventhe assumed lens magnification.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1201.3989	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: iii. correlated  properties of type ia supernovae and their hosts at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.46	using the sample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the hubblespace telescope (hst) cluster supernova survey and augmented with hst-observedsne ia in the goods fields, we search for correlations between the propertiesof sne and their host galaxies at high redshift. we use galaxy color andquantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters anddevelop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies fromstar-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. with this approach, weidentify six sn ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven sn iahosts that are early-type field galaxies. we confirm for the first time atz&gt;0.9 that sne ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quicklythan sne ia hosted by late-type galaxies. we also show that the two samples ofhosts produce sne ia with similar color distributions. the relatively simplespectral energy distributions (seds) expected for passive galaxies enable us tomeasure stellar masses of early-type sn hosts. in combination with stellar massestimates of late-type goods sn hosts from thomson &amp; chary (2011), weinvestigate the correlation of host mass with hubble residual observed at lowerredshifts. although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hintof this relation is found at z&gt;0.9. by simultaneously fitting the averagecluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,we show that the reddening of early-type cluster sn hosts is likely e(b-v) &lt;~0.06. the similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggeststhat field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also beminimally affected by dust. hence, the early-type hosted sne ia studied hereoccupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshiftstandard candles than other sne ia.

0704.3609	the local galaxy 8 micron luminosity function	a sst survey in the noao deep-wide field in bo\"otes provides a complete,8-micron-selected sample of galaxies to a limiting (vega) magnitude of 13.5. inthe 6.88 deg$^2$ field sampled, 79% of the 4867 galaxies have spectroscopicredshifts, allowing an accurate determination of the local (z&lt;0.3) galaxyluminosity function. stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis ofobserved galaxy colors. dust emission (mostly pah) accounts for 80% of the 8micron luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19%, and agn emissionaccounts for roughly 1 %. a sub-sample of the 8 micron-selected galaxies haveblue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant pah emission.the luminosity functions for the total 8 micron luminosity and for the dustemission alone are both well fit by schechter functions. for the 8 micronluminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is \nu l_{\nu}^*(8.0\micron) = 1.8 \times 10^{10}$ \lsun while for the dust emission alone it is1.6 x 10^{10}$ \lsun\null. the average 8 \micron luminosity density at z&lt;0.3 is3.1 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}, and the average luminosity density from dust aloneis 2.5 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}. this luminos ity arises predominantly fromgalaxies with 8 \micron luminosities ($\nu l_{\nu}$) between $2\times 10^9$ and$2 x 10^{10}$ \lsun, i.e., normal galaxies, not lirgs or ulirgs.

1303.2726	alma redshifts of millimeter-selected galaxies from the spt survey: the  redshift distribution of dusty star-forming galaxies	using the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma), we haveconducted a blind redshift survey in the 3 mm atmospheric transmission windowfor 26 strongly lensd dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected with thesouth pole telescope (spt). the sources were selected to have s_1.4mm&gt;20 mjyand a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio(s_843mhz&lt;6mjy) or far-infrared counterparts (s_100um&lt;1 jy, s_60um&lt;200mjy). werobustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshiftedemission lines of 12co, 13co, [ci], h2o, and h2o+. we find one or more spectralfeatures in 23 sources yielding a ~90% detection rate for this survey; in 12 ofthese sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only asingle line. for the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshiftdegeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or inferthe most likely line identification based on photometric data. this yieldssecure redshifts for ~70% of the sample. the three sources with no linesdetected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.0. theresulting mean redshift of our sample is &lt;z&gt;=3.5. this finding is in contrastto the redshift distribution of radio-identified dsfgs, which have asignificantly lower mean redshift of &lt;z&gt;=2.3 and for which only 10-15% of thepopulation is expected to be at z&gt;3. we discuss the effect of gravitationallensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshiftdistribution to that of models in the literature.

1304.0770	galaxy clusters around radio-loud agn at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 as seen by  spitzer	we report the first results from the clusters around radio-loud agn (carla)program, a cycle 7 and 8 spitzer space telescope snapshot program toinvestigate the environments of a large sample of obscured and unobscuredluminous radio-loud agn at 1.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. these data, obtained for 387 fields,reach 3.6 and 4.5 um depths of [3.6] (ab) = 22.6 and [4.5] (ab) = 22.9 at the95% completeness level, which is two to three times fainter than l* in thisredshift range. by using the color cut [3.6]-[4.5] &gt; -0.1 (ab), whichefficiently selects high-redshift (z &gt; 1.3) galaxies of all types, we identifygalaxy cluster member candidates in the fields of the radio-loud agn. the localdensity of these irac-selected sources is compared to the density of similarlyselected sources in blank fields. we find that 92% of the radio-loud agn residein environments richer than average. the majority (55%) of the radio-loud agnfields are found to be overdense at a &gt; 2 {\sigma} level; 10% are overdense ata &gt; 5 {\sigma} level. a clear rise in surface density of irac-selected sourcestowards the position of the radio-loud agn strongly supports an association ofthe majority of the irac-selected sources with the radio-loud agn. our resultsprovide solid statistical evidence that radio-loud agn are likely beacons forfinding high-redshift galaxy (proto-)clusters. we investigate how environmentdepends on agn type (unobscured radio-loud quasars vs. obscured radiogalaxies), radio luminosity and redshift, finding no correlation with eitheragn type or radio luminosity. we find a decrease in density with redshift,consistent with galaxy evolution for this uniform, flux-limited survey. theseresults are consistent with expectations from the orientation-driven agnunification model, at least for the high radio luminosity regimes considered inthis sample.

1309.5384	spectroscopic needs for imaging dark energy experiments: photometric  redshift training and calibration	large sets of objects with spectroscopic redshift measurements will be neededfor imaging dark energy experiments to achieve their full potential, servingtwo goals:_training_, i.e., the use of objects with known redshift to developand optimize photometric redshift algorithms; and_calibration_, i.e., thecharacterization of moments of redshift (or photo-z error) distributions.better training makes cosmological constraints from a given experimentstronger, while highly-accurate calibration is needed for photo-z systematicsnot to dominate errors. in this white paper, we investigate the required scopeof spectroscopic datasets which can serve both these purposes for ongoing andnext-generation dark energy experiments, as well as the time required to obtainsuch data with instruments available in the next decade. large time allocationson kilo-object spectrographs will be necessary, ideally augmented by infraredspectroscopy from space. alternatively, precision calibrations could beobtained by measuring cross-correlation statistics using samples of brightobjects from a large baryon acoustic oscillation experiment such as desi. wealso summarize the additional work on photometric redshift methods needed toprepare for ongoing and future dark energy experiments.

1310.6039	the era of star formation in galaxy clusters	we analyze the star formation properties of 16 infrared-selected,spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters at $1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$ from thespitzer/irac shallow cluster survey (iscs). we present new spectroscopicconfirmation for six of these high-redshift clusters, five of which are at$z&gt;1.35$. using infrared luminosities measured with deep spitzer/mipsobservations at 24 $\mu$m, along with robust optical+irac photometric redshiftsand sed-fitted stellar masses, we present the dust-obscured star-formingfractions, star formation rates and specific star formation rates in theseclusters as functions of redshift and projected clustercentric radius. we findthat $z\sim 1.4$ represents a transition redshift for the iscs sample, withclear evidence of an unquenched era of cluster star formation at earlier times.beyond this redshift the fraction of star-forming cluster members increasesmonotonically toward the cluster centers. indeed, the specific star formationrate in the cores of these distant clusters is consistent with field values atsimilar redshifts, indicating that at $z&gt;1.4$ environment-dependent quenchinghad not yet been established in iscs clusters. combining these observationswith complementary studies showing a rapid increase in the agn fraction, astochastic star formation history, and a major merging episode at the sameepoch in this cluster sample, we suggest that the starburst activity is likelymerger-driven and that the subsequent quenching is due to feedback frommerger-fueled agn. the totality of the evidence suggests we are witnessing thefinal quenching period that brings an end to the era of star formation ingalaxy clusters and initiates the era of passive evolution.

1311.4953	optical spectroscopy and velocity dispersions of galaxy clusters from  the spt-sz survey	we present optical spectroscopy of galaxies in clusters detected through thesunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we reportour own measurements of $61$ spectroscopic cluster redshifts, and $48$ velocitydispersions each calculated with more than $15$ member galaxies. this catalogalso includes $19$ dispersions of spt-observed clusters previously reported inthe literature. the majority of the clusters in this paper are spt-discovered;of these, most have been previously reported in other spt cluster catalogs, andfive are reported here as spt discoveries for the first time. by performing aresampling analysis of galaxy velocities, we find that unbiased velocitydispersions can be obtained from a relatively small number of member galaxies($\lesssim 30$), but with increased systematic scatter. we use this analysis todetermine statistical confidence intervals that include the effect ofmembership selection. we fit scaling relations between the observed clustervelocity dispersions and mass estimates from sz and x-ray observables. in bothcases, the results are consistent with the scaling relation between velocitydispersion and mass expected from dark-matter simulations. we measure a$\sim$30% log-normal scatter in dispersion at fixed mass, and a $\sim$10%offset in the normalization of the dispersion-mass relation when compared tothe expectation from simulations, which is within the expected level ofsystematic uncertainty.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1410.0025	x-ray cavities in a sample of 83 spt-selected clusters of galaxies:  tracing the evolution of agn feedback in clusters of galaxies out to z=1.2	x-ray cavities are key tracers of mechanical (or radio mode) heating arisingfrom the active galactic nuclei (agn) in brightest cluster galaxies. we reporton a survey for x-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2)clusters of galaxies selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature in thesouth pole telescope data. based on chandra x-ray images, we find a total of 6clusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistentwith the picture of radio jets inflating x-ray cavities in the intraclustermedium. the majority of these detections are of relatively low significance andrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. further, due to thelimitations of chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (&lt;10 kpc),unresolved x-ray cavities at high (z&gt;0.5) redshift. despite these limitations,our results suggest that the power generated by agn feedback in brightestcluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of theuniverse (&gt;7 gyrs at z=0.8). on average, the detected x-ray cavities havepowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.integrating over 7 gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in thebrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9m_sun ofmaterial to power these outflows. this level of accretion indicates thatsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,in the quasar era, but at late times as well. we also find that x-ray cavitiesat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 kev per particle into thehot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.this value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, breakself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1412.7823	baryon content of massive galaxy clusters (0.57 &lt; z &lt; 1.33)	we study the stellar, brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) and intracluster medium(icm) masses of 14 south pole telescope (spt) selected galaxy clusters withmedian redshift $z=0.9$ and median mass $m_{500}=6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. weestimate stellar masses for each cluster and bcg using six photometric bandsspanning the range from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared observed with thevlt, hst and spitzer. the icm masses are derived from chandra and xmm-newtonx-ray observations, and the virial masses are derived from the sptsunyaev-zel'dovich effect signature.  at $z=0.9$ the bcg mass $m_{\star}^{\textrm{bcg}}$ constitutes $0.12\pm0.01$%of the halo mass for a $6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$ cluster, and this fractionfalls as $m_{500}^{-0.58\pm0.07}$. the cluster stellar mass function has acharacteristic mass $m_{0}=10^{11.0\pm0.1}m_{\odot}$, and the number ofgalaxies per unit mass in clusters is larger than in the field by a factor$1.65\pm0.2$. both results are consistent with measurements on group scales andat lower redshift. we combine our spt sample with previously published samplesat low redshift that we correct to a common initial mass function and forsystematic differences in virial masses. we then explore mass and redshifttrends in the stellar fraction (fstar), the icm fraction (ficm), the coldbaryon fraction (fc) and the baryon fraction (fb). at a pivot mass of$6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$ and redshift $z=0.9$, the characteristic values arefstar=$1.1\pm0.1$%, ficm=$9.6\pm0.5$%, fc=$10.4\pm1.2$% and fb=$10.7\pm0.6$%.these fractions all vary with cluster mass at high significance, indicatingthat higher mass clusters have lower fstar and fc and higher ficm and fb. whenaccounting for a 15% systematic virial mass uncertainty, there is nostatistically significant redshift trend at fixed mass in these baryonfractions.

1506.07814	constraints on the richness-mass relation and the optical-sze positional  offset distribution for sze-selected clusters	we cross-match galaxy cluster candidates selected via theirsunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) signatures in 129.1 deg$^2$ of the south poletelescope 2500d spt-sz survey with optically identified clusters selected fromthe dark energy survey (des) science verification data. we identify 25 clustersbetween $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim 0.8$ in the union of the spt-sz and redmapper(rm) samples. rm is an optical cluster finding algorithm that also returns arichness estimate for each cluster. we model the richness $\lambda$-massrelation with the following function $\langle\ln\lambda|m_{500}\rangle\proptob_\lambda\ln m_{500}+c_\lambda\ln e(z)$ and use spt-sz cluster masses and rmrichnesses $\lambda$ to constrain the parameters. we find $b_\lambda=1.14^{+0.21}_{-0.18}$ and $c_\lambda=0.73^{+0.77}_{-0.75}$. the associatedscatter in mass at fixed richness is $\sigma_{\ln m|\lambda} =0.18^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ at a characteristic richness $\lambda=70$. we demonstratethat our model provides an adequate description of the matched sample, showingthat the fraction of spt-sz selected clusters with rm counterparts isconsistent with expectations and that the fraction of rm selected clusters withspt-sz counterparts is in mild tension with expectation. we model theoptical-sze cluster positional offset distribution with the sum of twogaussians, showing that it is consistent with a dominant, centrally peakedpopulation and a sub-dominant population characterized by larger offsets. wealso cross-match the rm catalog with spt-sz candidates below the officialcatalog threshold significance $\xi=4.5$, using the rm catalog to provideoptical confirmation and redshifts for additional low-$\xi$ spt-szcandidates.in this way, we identify 15 additional clusters with $\xi\in[4,4.5]$ over the redshift regime explored by rm in the overlapping regionbetween des science verification data and the spt-sz survey.

1507.00350	the formation history of massive cluster galaxies as revealed by carla	we use a sample of 37 of the densest clusters and protoclusters across $1.3\le z \le 3.2$ from the clusters around radio-loud agn (carla) survey to studythe formation of massive cluster galaxies. we use optical $i'$-band andinfrared 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m images to statistically select sources withinthese protoclusters and measure their median observed colours; $\langlei'-[3.6] \rangle$. we find the abundance of massive galaxies within theprotoclusters increases with decreasing redshift, suggesting these objects mayform an evolutionary sequence, with the lower redshift clusters in the samplehaving similar properties to the descendants of the high redshiftprotoclusters. we find that the protocluster galaxies have an approximatelyunevolving observed-frame $i'-[3.6]$ colour across the examined redshift range.we compare the evolution of the $\langle i'-[3.6] \rangle$ colour of massivecluster galaxies with simplistic galaxy formation models. taking the fullcluster population into account, we show that the formation of stars within themajority of massive cluster galaxies occurs over at least 2gyr, and peaks at $z\sim 2$-3. from the median $i'-[3.6]$ colours we cannot determine the starformation histories of individual galaxies, but their star formation must havebeen rapidly terminated to produce the observed red colours. finally, we showthat massive galaxies at $z&gt;2$ must have assembled within 0.5gyr of themforming a significant fraction of their stars. this means that few massivegalaxies in $z&gt;2$ protoclusters could have formed via dry mergers.

1508.06283	star-forming brightest cluster galaxies at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25: a  transitioning fuel supply	we present a multi-wavelength study of 90 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs)in a sample of galaxy clusters selected via the sunyaev zel'dovich effect bythe south pole telescope, utilizing data from various ground- and space-basedfacilities. we infer the star formation rate (sfr) for the bcg in each cluster,based on the uv and ir continuum luminosity, as well as the [o ii] emissionline luminosity in cases where spectroscopy is available, finding 7 systemswith sfr &gt; 100 msun/yr. we find that the bcg sfr exceeds 10 msun/yr in 31 of 90(34%) cases at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25, compared to ~1-5% at z ~ 0 from the literature.at z &gt; 1, this fraction increases to 92(+6)(-31)%, implying a steady decreasein the bcg sfr over the past ~9 gyr. at low-z, we find that the specific starformation rate in bcgs is declining more slowly with time than for field orcluster galaxies, most likely due to the replenishing fuel from the cooling icmin relaxed, cool core clusters. at z &gt; 0.6, the correlation between clustercentral entropy and bcg star formation - which is well established at z ~ 0 -is not present. instead, we find that the most star-forming bcgs at high-z arefound in the cores of dynamically unrelaxed clusters. we investigate therest-frame near-uv morphology of a subsample of the most star-forming bcgsusing data from the hubble space telescope, finding complex, highly asymmetricuv morphologies on scales as large as ~50-60 kpc. the high fraction ofstar-forming bcgs hosted in unrelaxed, non-cool core clusters at early timessuggests that the dominant mode of fueling star formation in bcgs may haverecently transitioned from galaxy-galaxy interactions to icm cooling.

1509.02835	stellar masses and star formation rates of lensed dusty star-forming  galaxies from the spt survey	to understand cosmic mass assembly in the universe at early epochs, weprimarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate ofdistant galaxies. in this paper, we present stellar masses and star formationrates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. thesesources were first discovered by the south pole telescope (spt) at millimeterwavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derivedfrom alma observations. we have conducted follow-up observations, obtainingmulti-wavelength imaging data, using {\it hst}, {\it spitzer}, {\it herschel}and the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex). we use the high-resolution {\ithst}/wfc3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lensin {\it spitzer}/irac data. the detections and upper limits provide importantconstraints on the spectral energy distributions (seds) for these dsfgs,yielding stellar masses, ir luminosities, and star formation rates (sfrs). thesed fits of six spt sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a rangemore than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times10^{10}m_{\sun}$. the intrinsic ir luminosities range from 4$\times10^{12}l_{\sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}l_{\sun}$. they all have prodigiousintrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $m_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.compared to the star-forming main sequence (ms), these six dsfgs have specificsfrs that all lie above the ms, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10higher than the ms. our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoingstrong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

1510.01359	probing star formation in the dense environments of z~1 lensing halos  aligned with dusty star-forming galaxies detected with the south pole  telescope	we probe star formation in the environments of massive$\sim10^{13}\,m_{\odot}$ dark matter halos at redshifts of $z$$\sim$$1$. thisstar formation is linked to a sub-millimetre clustering signal which we detectin maps of the planck high frequency instrument that are stacked at thepositions of a sample of high-redshift ($z$$&gt;$$2$) strongly-lensed dustystar-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected from the south pole telescope (spt) 2500deg$^2$ survey. the clustering signal has sub-millimetre colours which areconsistent with the mean redshift of the foreground lensing halos($z$$\sim$$1$). we report a mean excess of star formation rate (sfr) comparedto the field, of $(2700\pm700)\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$ from all galaxiescontributing to this clustering signal within a radius of 3.5' from the sptdsfgs. the magnitude of the planck excess is in broad agreement withpredictions of a current model of the cosmic infrared background. the modelpredicts that 80$\%$ of the excess emission measured by planck originates fromgalaxies lying in the neighbouring halos of the lensing halo. using herschelmaps of the same fields, we find a clear excess, relative to the field, ofindividual sources which contribute to the planck excess. the mean excess sfrcompared to the field is measured to be ($370\pm40)$$\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$per resolved, clustered source. our findings suggest that the environmentsaround these massive $z$$\sim$$1$ lensing halos host intense star formation outto about $2\,$mpc. the flux enhancement due to clustering should also beconsidered when measuring flux densities of galaxies in planck data.

astro-ph;0609579	a scuba/spitzer investigation of the far infra-red extragalactic  background	we have measured the contribution of submillimeter and mid-infrared sourcesto the extragalactic background radiation at 70 and 160um. specifically, wehave stacked flux in 70 and 160um spitzer space telescope (spitzer)observations of the canada-uk deep sub-millimeter survey 14h field at thepositions of 850um sources detected by scuba and also 8 and 24um sourcesdetected by spitzer. we find that per source, the scuba galaxies are thestrongest and the 8um sources the weakest contributors to the background fluxat both 70 and 160um. our estimate of the contribution of the scuba sources ishigher than previous estimates. however, expressed as a total contribution, thefull 8um source catalogue accounts for twice the total 24um source contributionand ~10 times the total scuba source contribution. the 8um sources account forthe majority of the background radiation at 160um with a flux of 0.87+/-0.16mjy/sr and at least a third at 70um with a flux of 0.103+/-0.019 mjy/sr. thesemeasurements are consistent with current lower limits on the background at 70and 160um. finally, we have investigated the 70 and 160um emission from the 8and 24um sources as a function of redshift. we find that the average 70um fluxper 24um source and the average 160um flux per 8 and 24um source is constantover all redshifts, up to z~4. in contrast, the low-redshift half (z&lt;1) of theof 8um sample contributes approximately four times the total 70um flux of thehigh-redshift half. these trends can be explained by a single non-evolving sed.

astro-ph;0611654	a rich bounty of agn in the 9 square degree bootes survey: high-z  obscured agn and large-scale structure	we use observations from the 9 square degree multiwavelength survey in bootesto identify hundreds of obscured active galactic nuclei (agn) with highredshifts (z &gt; 0.7), luminosities (l_bol &gt; 10^45 ergs/s), and moderateobscuring columns (n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2), and to measure the clustering propertiesof x-ray agn at z &gt; 1. in the bootes region, shallow (5 ks) chandra x-rayobservations have detected ~4,000 x-ray sources, and the same region has beenmapped with deep optical imaging and by spitzer irac, which detects ~300,000point sources, of which ~30,000 have detections in all four irac bands, forwhich we can select agn on the basis of their mid-ir colors. with themmt/hectospec we have obtained modest resolution optical spectra for about halfthe x-ray sources (out to z &gt; 3) and ~20,000 galaxies (out to z = 0.7). withthis multiwavelength data we select &gt;400 agn per square degree (compared to 12per square degree from sdss). among a sample of irac-selected agn we identify641 candidate obscured objects based on their r band and irac luminosities. weuse x-ray stacking techniques to verify that they are obscured agn and measuretheir absorbing column densities. we also measure the three-dimensionaltwo-point correlation function for x-ray selected agn.
