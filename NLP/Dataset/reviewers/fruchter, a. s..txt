0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0906.4318	constraining dust and color variations of high-z sne using nicmos on  hubble space telescope	we present data from the supernova cosmology project for five high redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) that were obtained using the nicmos infrared cameraon the hubble space telescope. we add two sne from this sample to a rest-framei-band hubble diagram, doubling the number of high redshift supernovae on thisdiagram. this i-band hubble diagram is consistent with a flat universe(omega_matter, omega_lambda= 0.29, 0.71). a homogeneous distribution of largegrain dust in the intergalactic medium (replenishing dust) is incompatible withthe data and is excluded at the 5 sigma confidence level, if the sn host galaxyreddening is corrected assuming r_v=1.75. we use both optical and infraredobservations to compare photometric properties of distant sne ia with those ofnearby objects. we find generally good agreement with the expected colorevolution for all sne except the highest redshift sn in our sample (sn 1997ekat z=0.863) which shows a peculiar color behavior. we also present spectraobtained from ground based telescopes for type identification and determinationof redshift.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

0911.0138	hst discovery of a z = 3.9 multiply imaged galaxy behind the complex  cluster lens warps j1415.1+36 at z = 1.026	we report the discovery of a multiply lensed ly alpha (lya) emitter at z =3.90 behind the massive galaxy cluster warps j1415.1+3612 at z = 1.026. imagestaken by the hubble space telescope(hst) using acs reveal a complex lensingsystem that produces a prominent, highly magnified arc and a triplet of smallerarcs grouped tightly around a spectroscopically confirmed cluster member.spectroscopic observations using focas on subaru confirm strong lya emission inthe source galaxy and provide redshifts for more than 21 cluster members, fromwhich we obtain a velocity dispersion of 807+/-185 km/s. assuming a singularisothermal sphere profile, the mass within the einstein ring (7.13+/-0.38")corresponds to a central velocity dispersion of 686+15-19 km/s for the cluster,consistent with the value estimated from cluster member redshifts. our massprofile estimate from combining strong lensing and dynamical analyses is ingood agreement with both x-ray and weak lensing results.

1001.5042	the host galaxies of core-collapse supernovae and gamma ray bursts	we present a comparative study of the galactic and small scale environmentsof gamma-ray bursts (grb) and core collapse supernovae (ccsn). we use a sampleof 34 grb hosts at z&lt;1.2, and a comparison sample of 58 supernova hosts locatedwithin the great observatories origins deep survey footprint. we fit templatespectra to the available photometric data, which span the range 0.45-24 micron,and extract absolute magnitudes, stellar masses and star formation rates fromthe resulting fits. our results broadly corroborate previous findings, butoffer significant enhancements in spectral coverage and a factor 2-3 increasein sample size. specifically, we find that ccsn occur frequently in massivespirals (spiral fraction ~50%). in contrast grbs occur in small, relatively lowmass galaxies with high specific and surface star formation rates, and have aspiral fraction of only ~10%. a comparison of the rest frame absolutemagnitudes of the grb and ccsn sample is less conclusive than found in previouswork, suggesting that while grb hosts are typically both smaller and bluer thanthose of ccsn their total blue light luminosities are only slightly lower. wesuggest this is likely due to rapid periods of intensified star formationactivity, as indicated by the high specific star formation rates, which bothcreate the grb progenitors and briefly significantly enhance the host galaxyblue luminosity. finally, our analysis of local environments of grbs and ccsnshows that grbs are highly concentrated on their host light, and further occurin regions of higher absolute surface luminosity than ccsn.

1004.1131	grb 021004: tomography of a gamma-ray burst progenitor and its host  galaxy	we analyse the distribution of matter around the progenitor star of gamma-rayburst grb 021004 as well as the properties of its host galaxy withhigh-resolution echelle as well as near-infrared spectroscopy. observationswere taken by the 8.2m very large telescope with the ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (uves) and the infrared spectrometer and array camera(isaac) between 10 and 14 hours after the onset of the event. we report thefirst detection of emission lines from a grb host galaxy in the near-infrared,detecting h-alpha and the [o iii] doublet. these allow an independentmeasurement of the systemic redshift (z = 2.3304 +/- 0.0005) which is notcontaminated by absorption as the ly-alpha line is, and the deduction ofproperties of the host galaxy. from the visual echelle spectroscopy, we findseveral absorption line groups spanning a range of about 3,000 km/s in velocityrelative to the redshift of the host galaxy. the absorption profiles are verycomplex with both velocity-broadened components extending over several 100 km/sand narrow lines with velocity widths of only 20 km/s. by analogy with qsoabsorption line studies, the relative velocities,widths, and degrees ofionization of the lines ("line-locking", "ionization--velocity correlation")show that the progenitor had both an extremely strong radiation field andseveral distinct mass loss phases (winds). these results are consistent withgrb progenitors being massive stars, such as luminous blue variables (lbvs) orwolf--rayet stars, providing a detailed picture of the spatial and velocitystructure of the grb progenitor star at the time of explosion. the host galaxyis a prolific star-forming galaxy with a sfr of about 40 solar masses per year.

1004.1711	spectra and light curves of six type ia supernovae at 0.511 &lt; z &lt; 1.12  and the union2 compilation	we report on work to increase the number of well-measured type ia supernovae(sne ia) at high redshifts. light curves, including high signal-to-noise hstdata, and spectra of six sne ia that were discovered during 2001 are presented.additionally, for the two sne with z&gt;1, we present ground-based j-bandphotometry from gemini and the vlt. these are among the most distant sne ia forwhich ground based near-ir observations have been obtained. we add these sixsne ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in theliterature to the union compilation (kowalski et al. 2008). we have made anumber of refinements to the union analysis chain, the most important onesbeing the refitting of all light curves with the salt2 fitter and an improvedhandling of systematic errors. we call this new compilation, consisting of 557supernovae, the union2 compilation. the flat concordance lambdacdm modelremains an excellent fit to the union2 data with the best fit constant equationof state parameter w=-0.997^{+0.050}_{-0.054} (stat) ^{+0.077}_{-0.082}(stat+sys\ together) for a flat universe, or w=-1.035^{+0.055}_{-0.059}(stat)^{+0.093}_{-0.097} (stat+sys together) with curvature. we also presentimproved constraints on w(z). while no significant change in w with redshift isdetected, there is still considerable room for evolution in w. the strength ofthe constraints depend strongly on redshift. in particular, at z &gt; 1, theexistence and nature of dark energy are only weakly constrained by the data.

1004.2919	discovery of the nearby long, soft grb 100316d with an associated  supernova	we report the swift discovery of nearby long, soft gamma-ray burst grb100316d, and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy andassociated supernova. we derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb-sn. we study the extremelyunusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to x-ray spectroscopy, andfind that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition toa synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. the x-ray light curvehas a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. the host is a bright,blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south, vlt andhst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. wecompare and contrast the x-ray emission and host galaxy of grb 100316d to asubsample of grb-sne. grb 100316d is unlike the majority of grb-sne in itsx-ray evolution, but resembles rather grb 060218, and we find that these twoevents have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.comparison of the host galaxies of grb-sne demonstrates, however, that there isa great diversity in the environments in which grb-sne can be found. grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample ofspectroscopically confirmed grb-sne, from which a better understanding of longgrb progenitors and the grb--sn connection can be gleaned.

1007.2185	the unusual x-ray emission of the short swift grb 090515: evidence for  the formation of a magnetar?	the majority of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to originate fromthe merger of compact binary systems collapsing directly to form a black hole.however, it has been proposed that both sgrbs and long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)may, on rare occasions, form an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) prior tofinal collapse. grb 090515, detected by the swift satellite was extremelyshort, with a t_90 of 0.036 +/- 0.016 s, and had a very low fluence of 2 x10^-8 erg cm^-2 and faint optical afterglow. despite this, the 0.3 - 10 kevflux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a sgrb by the swift x-raytelescope (xrt). the x-ray light curve showed an unusual plateau and steepdecay, becoming undetectable after ~500 s. this behaviour is similar to thatobserved in some long bursts proposed to have magnetars contributing to theiremission. in this paper, we present the swift observations of grb 090515 andcompare it to other gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the swift sample. additionally,we present optical observations from gemini, which detected an afterglow ofmagnitude 26.4 +/- 0.1 at t+ 1.7 hours after the burst. we discuss potentialcauses of the unusual 0.3 - 10 kev emission and suggest it might be energyinjection from an unstable millisecond pulsar. using the duration and flux ofthe plateau of grb 090515, we place constraints on the millisecond pulsar spinperiod and magnetic field.

1010.5786	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: ii. the type ia  supernova rate in high-redshift galaxy clusters	we report a measurement of the type ia supernova (sn ia) rate in galaxyclusters at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.45 from the hubble space telescope (hst) clustersupernova survey. this is the first cluster sn ia rate measurement withdetected z &gt; 0.9 sne. finding 8 +/- 1 cluster sne ia, we determine a sn ia rateof 0.50 +0.23-0.19 (stat) +0.10-0.09 (sys) snub (snub = 10^-12 sne l_{sun,b}^-1yr^-1). in units of stellar mass, this translates to 0.36 +0.16-0.13 (stat)+0.07-0.06 (sys) snum (snum = 10^-12 sne m_sun^-1 yr^-1). this represents afactor of approximately 5 +/- 2 increase over measurements of the cluster rateat z &lt; 0.2. we parameterize the late-time sn ia delay time distribution with apower law (proportional to t^s). under the assumption of a cluster formationredshift of z_f = 3, our rate measurement in combination with lower-redshiftcluster sn ia rates constrains s = -1.41 +0.47/-0.40, consistent withmeasurements of the delay time distribution in the field. this measurement isgenerally consistent with expectations for the "double degenerate" scenario andinconsistent with some models for the "single degenerate" scenario predicting asteeper delay time distribution at large delay times. we check forenvironmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations bycalculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and inmorphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the fullcluster rate. finally, the upper limit of one host-less cluster sn ia detectedin the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium isless than 0.47 (95% confidence), consistent with measurements at lowerredshifts.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

1104.5141	xrf 100316d / sn 2010bh and the nature of gamma ray burst supernovae	we present ground-based and hst optical and infrared observations of xrf100316d / sn 2010bh. it is seen that the optical light curves of sn 2010bhevolve at a faster rate than the archetype grb-sn 1998bw, but at a similar rateto sn 2006aj, a supernova that was spectroscopically linked with xrf 060218,and at a similar rate to non-grb associated type ic sn 1994i. we estimate therest-frame extinction of this event from our optical data to be e(b-v)=0.18 +/-0.08 mag. we find the v-band absolute magnitude of sn 2010bh to be m_{v}=-18.62+/- 0.08, which is the faintest peak v-band magnitude observed to-date for aspectroscopically-confirmed grb-sne. when we investigate the origin of the fluxat t-t_{o}=0.598 days, it is shown that the light is not synchrotron in origin,but is likely coming from the supernova shock break-out. we then use ouroptical and infrared data to create a quasi-bolometric light curve of sn 2010bhwhich we model with a simple analytical formula. the results of our modelingimply that sn 2010bh synthesized a nickel mass of m_{ni} \approx 0.10 m_{sun},ejected m_{ej} \approx 2.2 m_{sun} and has an explosion energy of e_{k} \approx1.4 x 10^{52} erg. finally, for a sample 22 grb-sne we check for a correlationbetween the stretch factors and luminosity factors in the r band and concludethat no statistically-significant correlation exists.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

0710.3120	a new determination of the high redshift type ia supernova rates with  the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys	we present a new measurement of the volumetric rate of type ia supernova upto a redshift of 1.7, using the hubble space telescope (hst) goods datacombined with an additional hst dataset covering the north goods fieldcollected in 2004. we employ a novel technique that does not requirespectroscopic data for identifying type ia supernovae (although spectroscopicmeasurements of redshifts are used for over half the sample); instead we employa bayesian approach using only photometric data to calculate the probabilitythat an object is a type ia supernova. this bayesian technique can easily bemodified to incorporate improved priors on supernova properties, and it iswell-suited for future high-statistics supernovae searches in whichspectroscopic follow up of all candidates will be impractical. here, the methodis validated on both ground- and space-based supernova data having somespectroscopic follow up. we combine our volumetric rate measurements with lowredshift supernova data, and fit to a number of possible models for theevolution of the type ia supernova rate as a function of redshift. the data donot distinguish between a flat rate at redshift &gt; 0.5 and a previously proposedmodel, in which the type ia rate peaks at redshift &gt;1 due to a significantdelay from star-formation to the supernova explosion. except for the highestredshifts, where the signal to noise ratio is generally too low to apply thistechnique, this approach yields smaller or comparable uncertainties thanprevious work.

1201.3989	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: iii. correlated  properties of type ia supernovae and their hosts at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.46	using the sample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the hubblespace telescope (hst) cluster supernova survey and augmented with hst-observedsne ia in the goods fields, we search for correlations between the propertiesof sne and their host galaxies at high redshift. we use galaxy color andquantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters anddevelop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies fromstar-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. with this approach, weidentify six sn ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven sn iahosts that are early-type field galaxies. we confirm for the first time atz&gt;0.9 that sne ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quicklythan sne ia hosted by late-type galaxies. we also show that the two samples ofhosts produce sne ia with similar color distributions. the relatively simplespectral energy distributions (seds) expected for passive galaxies enable us tomeasure stellar masses of early-type sn hosts. in combination with stellar massestimates of late-type goods sn hosts from thomson &amp; chary (2011), weinvestigate the correlation of host mass with hubble residual observed at lowerredshifts. although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hintof this relation is found at z&gt;0.9. by simultaneously fitting the averagecluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,we show that the reddening of early-type cluster sn hosts is likely e(b-v) &lt;~0.06. the similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggeststhat field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also beminimally affected by dust. hence, the early-type hosted sne ia studied hereoccupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshiftstandard candles than other sne ia.

1201.6074	star formation in the early universe: beyond the tip of the iceberg	we present late-time hubble space telescope imaging of the fields of sixswift grbs lying at 5.0&lt;z&lt;9.5. our data includes very deep observations of thefield of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, grb 090423, atz=8.2. using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can placestringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. in one case, thatof grb 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the grbposition which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude j(ab)=28.5. none ofthe others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie belowl\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates sfr&lt;4mo/yr inall cases. indeed, stacking the five fields with wfc3-ir data we conclude amean sfr&lt;0.17mo/yr per galaxy. these results support the proposition that thebulk of star formation, and hence integrated uv luminosity, at high redshiftsarises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.making the reasonable assumption that grb rate is proportional to uv luminosityat early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based ongalaxy luminosity functions derived from the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) andother deep fields. we infer that a luminosity function which is evolvingrapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristicluminosity (l\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with ourobservations, whereas a non-evolving lf shape is ruled out at &gt;90% confidence.although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required forgrb production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the natureof star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supplyof ionizing photons in the early universe.

1211.7068	the metal aversion of lgrbs	recently, it has been suggested that the metallicity aversion oflong-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) is not intrinsic to their formation, butrather a consequence of the anti-correlation between star-formation andmetallicity seen in the general galaxy population. to investigate thisproposal, we compare the metallicity of the hosts of lgrbs, broad-lined type ic(ic-bl) supernovae (sne), and type ii sne to each other and to the metallicitydistribution of star-forming galaxies using the sdss to represent galaxies inthe local universe and the tkrs for galaxies at intermediate redshifts.  the differing metallicity distributions of the lgrb hosts and the starformation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicitypreference of lgrbs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation betweenstar-formation and metallicity, but rather must be overwhelmingly due to theastrophysics of the lgrbs themselves. three quarters of our lgrb sample arefound at metallicities below 12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.6, while less than a tenth oflocal star-formation is at similarly low metallicities. however, our sn samplesare statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the generalgalaxy population. using the tkrs population of galaxies, we are able toexclude the possibility that the lgrb host metallicity aversion is caused bythe decrease in galaxy metallicity with redshift. the presence of the strongmetallicity difference between lgrbs and ic-bl sne largely eliminates thepossibility that the observed lgrb metallicity bias is a byproduct of adifference in the initial mass functions of the galaxy populations. rather,metallicity below half-solar must be a fundamental component of theevolutionary process that separates lgrbs from the vast majority of ic-bl sneand from the bulk of local star-formation.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1306.4971	a "kilonova" associated with short-duration gamma-ray burst 130603b	short-duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are intense flashes of cosmicgamma-rays, lasting less than ~2 s, whose origin is one of the great unsolvedquestions of astrophysics today. while the favoured hypothesis for theirproduction, a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellarobjects (specifically, two neutron stars, ns-ns, or a neutron star and a blackhole, ns-bh), is supported by indirect evidence such as their host galaxyproperties, unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. mergers ofthis kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-richradioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient in the daysfollowing the burst, a so-called "kilonova". indeed, it is speculated that thismechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in theuniverse. recent calculations suggest much of the kilonova energy should appearin the near-infrared (nir) due to the high optical opacity created by theseheavy r-process elements. here we report strong evidence for such an eventaccompanying sgrb 130603b. if this simplest interpretation of the data iscorrect, it provides (i) support for the compact object merger hypothesis ofsgrbs, (ii) confirmation that such mergers are likely sites of significantr-process production and (iii) quite possibly an alternative, un-beamedelectromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection ofgravitational waves.

1307.5338	hubble space telescope observations of the afterglow, supernova and host  galaxy associated with the extremely bright grb 130427a	we present hubble space telescope (hst) observations of the exceptionallybright and luminous swift gamma-ray burst, grb 130427a. at z=0.34 this burstaffords an excellent opportunity to study the supernova and host galaxyassociated with an intrinsically extremely luminous burst ($e_{iso} &gt;10^{54}$erg): more luminous than any previous grb with a spectroscopically associatedsupernova. we use the combination of the image quality, uv capability and andinvariant psf of hst to provide the best possible separation of the afterglow,host and supernova contributions to the observed light ~17 rest-frame daysafter the burst utilising a host subtraction spectrum obtained 1 year later.advanced camera for surveys (acs) grism observations show that the associatedsupernova, sn~2013cq, has an overall spectral shape and luminosity similar tosn 1998bw (with a photospheric velocity, v$_{ph}$ ~15,000 km/s). the positionsof the bluer features are better matched by the higher velocity sn~2010bh(v$_{ph}$ ~ 30,000 km/s), but sn 2010bh is significantly fainter, and fails toreproduce the overall spectral shape, perhaps indicative of velocity structurein the ejecta. we find that the burst originated ~4 kpc from the nucleus of amoderately star forming (1 msol/yr), possibly interacting disc galaxy. theabsolute magnitude, physical size and morphology of this galaxy, as well as thelocation of the grb within it are also strikingly similar to those ofgrb980425/sn 1998bw. the similarity of supernovae and environment from both themost luminous and least luminous grbs suggests broadly similar progenitor starscan create grbs across six orders of magnitude in isotropic energy.

1312.2576	lensed type ia supernovae as probes of cluster mass models	using three magnified type ia supernovae (sne ia) detected behind clashclusters, we perform a first pilot study to see whether standardizable candlescan be used to calibrate cluster mass maps created from strong lensingobservations. such calibrations will be crucial when next generation hstcluster surveys (e.g. frontier) provide magnification maps that will, in turn,form the basis for the exploration of the high redshift universe. we classifysne using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations, finding two ofthe three to be clearly of type sn ia and the third probable. the sne exhibitsignificant amplification, up to a factor of 1.7 at $\sim5\sigma$ significance(sn-l2). we conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine tuning of parameters,finding a mean amplification difference between sne and the cluster lensingmodels of $0.09 \pm 0.09^{stat} \pm 0.05^{sys}$ mag. this impressive agreementsuggests no tension between cluster mass models and high redshift standardizedsne ia. however, the measured statistical dispersion of $\sigma_{\mu}=0.21$ magappeared large compared to the dispersion expected based on statisticaluncertainties ($0.14$). further work with the supernova and cluster lensingmodels, post unblinding, reduced the measured dispersion to$\sigma_{\mu}=0.12$. an explicit choice should thus be made as to whether sneare used unblinded to improve the model, or blinded to test the model. as thelensed sn samples grow larger, this technique will allow improved constraintson assumptions regarding e.g. the structure of the dark matter halo.

1404.0881	the host of the sn-less grb 060505 in high resolution	the spiral host galaxy of grb 060505 at z=0.089 was the site of a puzzlinglong duration burst without an accompanying supernova. studies of the burstenvironment by th\"one et al. (2008) suggested that this grb came from thecollapse of a massive star and that the grb site was a region with propertiesdifferent from the rest of the galaxy. we reobserved the galaxy in high spatialresolution using the vimos integral-field unit (ifu) at the vlt with a spaxelsize of 0.67 arcsec. furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data fromhires/keck at two different slit positions covering the grb site, the center ofthe galaxy and an hii region next to the grb region. we compare the propertiesof different hii regions in the galaxy with the grb site and study the globaland local kinematic properties of this galaxy. the resolved data show that thegrb site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 z_solar, butits specific sfr (ssfr) of 7.4 m_solar/yr/l/l* and age (determined by thehalpha ew) are similar to other hii regions in the host. the galaxy shows agradient in metallicity and ssfr from the bulge to the outskirts as it iscommon for spiral galaxies. this gives further support to the theory that grbsprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in s-typegalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.kinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for largeperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. this studyconfirms the collapsar origin of grb060505 but reveals that the properties ofthe hii region surrounding the grb were not unique to that galaxy. spatiallyresolved observations are key to know the implications and interpretations ofunresolved grb hosts observations at higher redshifts.

1502.01026	a calibration of nicmos camera 2 for low count-rates	nicmos 2 observations are crucial for constraining distances to most of theexisting sample of z &gt; 1 sne ia. unlike the conventional calibration programs,these observations involve long exposure times and low count rates. reciprocityfailure is known to exist in hgcdte devices and a correction for this effecthas already been implemented for high and medium count-rates. howeverobservations at faint count-rates rely on extrapolations. here instead, weprovide a new zeropoint calibration directly applicable to faint sources. thisis obtained via inter-calibration of nic2 f110w/f160w with wfc3 in the lowcount-rate regime using z ~ 1 elliptical galaxies as tertiary calibrators.these objects have relatively simple near-ir seds, uniform colors, and theirextended nature gives superior signal-to-noise at the same count rate thanwould stars. the use of extended objects also allows greater tolerances on psfprofiles. we find st magnitude zeropoints (after the installation of the nicmoscooling system, ncs) of 25.296 +- 0.022 for f110w and 25.803 +- 0.023 forf160w, both in agreement with the calibration extrapolated from count-rates1,000 times larger (25.262 and 25.799). before the installation of the ncs, wefind 24.843 +- 0.025 for f110w and 25.498 +- 0.021 for f160w, also in agreementwith the high-count-rate calibration (24.815 and 25.470). we also check thestandard bandpasses of wfc3 and nicmos 2 using a range of stars and galaxies atdifferent colors and find mild tension for wfc3, limiting the accuracy of thezeropoints. to avoid human bias, our cross-calibration was "blinded" in thatthe fitted zeropoint differences were hidden until the analysis was finalized.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1509.08945	late time multi wavelength observations of swift j1644+5734: a luminous  optical/ir bump and quiescent x-ray emission	we present late-time multi-wavelength observations of swift j1644+57,suggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (tdf). our observationsextend to &gt;4 years from discovery, and show that 1.4 years after outburst therelativistic jet switched-off on a timescale less than tens of days,corresponding to a power-law decay faster than $t^{-70}$. beyond this pointweak x-rays continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity of$l_x \sim 5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and are marginally inconsistent witha continuing decay of $t^{-5/3}$, similar to that seen prior to the switch-off.host photometry enables us to infer a black hole mass of $m_{bh}=3 \times 10^6$m$_{\odot}$, consistent with the late time x-ray luminosity arising fromsub-eddington accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an unusuallyoptically faint agn or a slowly varying phase of the transient. optical/irobservations show a clear bump in the light curve at timescales of 30-50 days,with a peak magnitude (corrected for host galaxy extinction) of $m_r \sim-22-23$. the luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in other,non-relativistic tdfs and does not match any re-brightening seen at x-ray orradio wavelengths. its luminosity, light curve shape and spectrum are broadlysimilar to those seen in superluminous sne, although subject to largeuncertainties in the correction of the significant host extinction. we discussthese observations in the context of both tdf and massive star origins forswift j1644+5734 and other candidate relativistic tidal flares.

0806.1182	photometry and spectroscopy of grb 060526: a detailed study of the  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst	aims: with this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglowlight curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (grb) 060526 at $z=3.221$.methods: we present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for agrb afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultravioletto the near infrared. the data set contains 412 data points in total to whichwe add additional data from the literature. furthermore, we presentlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. the afterglowlight curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power lawfits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.the absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive columndensities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis fromwhich we derive the metallicity of the host of grb 060526. results: thetemporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law withbreaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. it shows deviationsfrom the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energyinjections from the central engine, although some significant microvariabilityremains. the broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows nosignificant extinction along the line of sight. the metallicity derived from\ion{s}{ii} and \ion{fe}{ii} of [s/h] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [fe/h] =--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparableto the metallicity of other grb hosts at similar redshifts. at the position ofthe afterglow, no host is detected to f775w(ab) = 28.5 mag with the hst,implying an absolute magnitude of the host m(1500 \aa{})$&gt;$--18.3 mag which isfainter than most long-duration hosts, although the grb may be associated witha faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

1511.00667	high metallicity lgrb hosts	we present our imaging and spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies oftwo dark long bursts with anomalously high metallicities, lgrb 051022 and lgrb020819b, which in conjunction with another lgrb event with an optical afterglowcomprise the three lgrbs with high metallicity host galaxies in the graham &amp;fruchter (2013) sample. in graham &amp; fruchter (2013), we showed that lgrbsexhibit a strong and apparently intrinsic preference for low metallicityenvironments (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.4 in the kk04 scale) in spite of these threecases with abundances of about solar and above. these exceptions however areconsistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparablebrightness &amp; redshift. this is surprising: even among a preselected sample ofhigh metallicity lgrbs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for theseobjects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typicalmetallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift. therefore wededuce that it is possible to form an lgrb in a high metallicity environmentalthough with greater rarity.  from this we conclude that there are three possible explanations for thepresence of the lgrbs observed in high metallicity hosts as seen to date: (1)lgrbs do not occur in high metallicity environments and those seen in highmetallicity hosts are in fact occurring in low metallicity environments thathave become associated with otherwise high metallicity hosts but remainunenriched. (2) the lgrb formation mechanism while preferring low metallicityenvironments does not strictly require it resulting in a gradual decline inburst formation with increasing metallicity. (3) the typical low metallicitylgrbs and the few high metallicity cases are the result of physically differentburst formation pathways with only the former affected by the metallicity andthe later occurring much more infrequently.

1511.01079	the relative rate of lgrb formation as a function of metallicity	there is now strong evidence that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) arepreferentially formed in low-metallicity environments. however, the magnitudeof this effect, and its functional dependence on metallicity have not been wellcharacterized. in our previous paper, graham &amp; fruchter (2013), we compared themetallicity distribution of lgrb host galaxies to the that of star forminggalaxies in the local universe. here we build upon this work by in effectdividing one distribution by the other, and thus directly determine therelative rate of lgrb formation as a function of metallicity in thelow-redshift universe. we find a dramatic cutoff in lgrb formation above ametallicity of log(o/h)}+12 ~ 8.3 in the kk04 scale, with lgrbs forming &gt;25times more frequently per unit star-formation below this cutoff than above.furthermore, our data suggests that the rate of lgrb formation per unit starformation continues to fall above this break. we estimate the lgrb formationrate per unit star formation may drop by as much as a factor of one hundredbetween one-third solar and solar metallicity.

0806.3607	a comparison of the afterglows of short- and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts	we present a comparative study of the observed properties of the optical andx-ray afterglows of short- and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs). using alarge sample of 37 short and 421 long grbs, we find a strong correlationbetween the afterglow brightness measured after 11 hours and the observedfluence of the prompt emission. both the optical (r band) and x-ray fluxdensities (f_r and f_x) scale with the gamma-ray fluence, f_gamma. for burstswith a known redshift, a tight correlation exists between the afterglow fluxdensities at 11 hours (rest-frame) and the total isotropic gamma-ray energy,egi: f_{r,x} ~ egi^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 1. the constant of proportionality isnearly identical for long and short bursts, when egi is obtained from the swiftdata. additionally, we find that for short busts with f_gamma &gt;10^{-7} ergcm^{-2}, optical afterglows are nearly always detected by reasonably deep earlyobservations. finally, we show that the ratio f_r/f_x has very similar valuesfor short and long bursts. these results are difficult to explain in theframework of the standard scenario, since they require that either (1) thenumber density of the surrounding medium of short bursts is typicallycomparable to, or even larger than the number density of long bursts; (2) shortbursts explode into a density profile, n(r)\alpha r^{-2} or (3) the promptgamma-ray fluence depends on the density of the external medium. we thereforefind it likely that either basic assumptions on the properties of thecircumburst environment of short grbs or else the standard models of grbemission must be re-examined. we believe that the most likely solution is thatthe ambient density surrounding typical short bursts is higher than hasgenerally been expected: a typical value of ~1 per cm^{-3} is indicated.

astro-ph;0008160	a photometric study of the ages and metallicities of early-type galaxies  in a2218	we present deep optical and near-infrared imaging of the rich cluster a2218at z=0.17. our optical imaging comes from new multicolour hubble spacetelescope wfpc2 observations in the f450w (b), f606w (v) and f814w (i)passbands. these observations are complemented by deep near-infrared, ks-band,imaging from the new ingrid imager on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope.this combination provides unique high-precision multicolour optical-infraredphotometry and morphological information for a large sample of galaxies in thecore of this rich cluster at a lookback time of ~3gyrs. we analyse the (b-i),(v-i) and (i-ks) colours of galaxies spanning a range of a factor of 100 ink-band luminosity in this region and compare these with grids of stellarpopulation models. we find that the locus of the colours of the stellarpopulations in the luminous (&gt;0.5l*) early-type galaxies, both ellipticals ands0s, traces a sequence of varying metallicity at a single age. at fainterluminosities (&lt;0.1l*), this sequence is extended to lower metallicities by themorphologically-classified ellipticals. however, the faintest s0s exhibit verydifferent behaviour, showing a wide range in colours, including a largefraction (30%) with relatively blue colours which appear to have youngerluminosity-weighted ages for their stellar populations, 2-5gyrs. we show thatthe proportion of these young s0s in the cluster population is consistent withthe observed decrease in the s0 population seen in distant clusters wheninterpreted within the framework of a two-step spectroscopic and morphologicaltransformation of accreted spiral field galaxies into cluster s0s.

astro-ph;0010374	proper motion measurements with the vla: i. wide-field imaging and pulse  gating techniques	the pulsar velocity distribution provides information about the binaryhistory of pulsar progenitors as well as asymmetries of the supernova events inwhich pulsars are born. studies of local pulsars present a biased view of thisdistribution, since they preferentially select low velocity pulsars that haveremained near their birthplaces in the galactic plane. using the vla, we havestudied the proper motions of a large sample of distant pulsars. these pulsarsare generally faint, and the expected proper motions are small. in this paper,we describe the data analysis techniques that we have developed to allowprecise astrometric measurements of faint sources with the vla. thesetechniques include ``gating'' the vla correlator to increase thesignal-to-noise ratio of the pulsar by gathering data only during the pulse.wide-field imaging techniques, including multiband imaging to account forbandwidth smearing, were used to allow identification of multiple in-beambackground sources for astrometric calibration. we present the analysis ofthree pulsars, and demonstrate that astrometric accuracy of about tenmilliarcseconds can be obtained for individual sources with our technique,allowing measurement of proper motions with errors of only a fewmilliarcseconds per year over our seven year baseline.

astro-ph;0305227	variable polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 021004	we present polarimetric observations of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 021004, obtained with the nordic optical telescope (not) and the verylarge telescope (vlt) between 8 and 17 hours after the burst. comparison amongthe observations shows a 45 degree change in the position angle from 9 hoursafter the burst to 16 hours after the burst, and comparison with published datafrom later epochs even shows a 90 degree change between 9 and 89 hours afterthe burst. the degree of linear polarization shows a marginal change, but isalso consistent with being constant in time. in the context of currentlyavailable models for changes in the polarization of grbs, a homogeneous jetwith an early break time of t_b ~ 1 day provides a good explanation of ourdata. the break time is a factor 2 to 6 earlier than has been found from theanalysis of the optical light curve. the change in the position angle of thepolarization rules out a structured jet model for the grb.

astro-ph;0306403	on the ly-alpha emission from gamma-ray burst host galaxies: evidence  for low metallicities	we report on the results of a search for ly-alpha emission from the hostgalaxy of the z=2.140 grb 011211 and other galaxies in its surrounding field.we detect ly-alpha emission from the host as well as from six other galaxies inthe field. the restframe equivalent width of the ly-alpha line from the grb011211 host is about 21 aa. this is the fifth detection of ly-alpha emissionout of five possible detections from grb host galaxies, strongly indicatingthat grb hosts, at least at high redshifts, are ly-alpha emitters. this isintriguing as only about 25% of the lyman-break selected galaxies at similarredshifts have ly-alpha emission lines with restframe equivalent width largerthan 20 aa. possible explanations are i) a preference for grb progenitors to bemetal-poor as expected in the collapsar model, ii) an optical afterglowselection bias against dusty hosts, and iii) a higher fraction of ly-alphaemitters at the faint end of the luminosity function for high-z galaxies. ofthese, the current evidence seems to favour i).

astro-ph;0309215	proper-motion measurements with the vla. ii. observations of  twenty-eight pulsars	using the very large array, we have measured the proper motions oftwenty-eight radio pulsars. on average, the pulsars studied are fainter andmore distant than those studied in earlier work, reducing the selection biasesinherent in surveys restricted to the solar neighborhood. the typicalmeasurement precision achieved is a few milliarcseconds per year, correspondingto a few tens of kilometers per second for a pulsar a kiloparsec away. whileour results compare well with higher-precision measurements done usingvery-long baseline interferometry, we find that several earlier proper motionsurveys appear to have reported overly optimistic measurement uncertainties,most likely because of a failure to fully account for ionospheric effects. wediscuss difficulties inherent in estimating pulsar velocities from propermotions given poorly constrained pulsar distances. our observations favor adistribution with 20% of pulsars in a low velocity component (sigma_1d = 99km/s) and 80% in a high velocity component (sigma_1d = 294 km/s). furthermore,our sample is consistent with a scale height of pulsar birthplaces comparableto the scale height of the massive stars that are their presumed progenitors.no evidence is found in our data for a significant population of young pulsarsborn far from the plane. we find that estimates of pulsar ages based onkinematics agree well with the canonical spin-down age estimate, but agreementis improved if braking indexes are drawn from a gaussian distribution centeredat n=3 with width 0.8.

astro-ph;0309368	new constraints on $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from an  independent set of eleven high-redshift supernovae observed with hst	we report measurements of $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from elevensupernovae at z=0.36-0.86 with high-quality lightcurves measured using wfpc-2on the hst. this is an independent set of high-redshift supernovae thatconfirms previous supernova evidence for an accelerating universe. combinedwith earlier supernova cosmology project data, the new supernovae yield aflat-universe measurement of the mass density $\omega_m=0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$(statistical) $\pm0.04$ (identified systematics), or equivalently, acosmological constant of $\omega_\lambda=0.75^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ (statistical)$\pm0.04$ (identified systematics). when the supernova results are combinedwith independent flat-universe measurements of $\omega_m$ from cmb and galaxyredshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of$w=-1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ (statistical) $\pm0.09$ (identified systematic), if wis assumed to be constant in time. the new data offer greatly improved colormeasurements of the high-redshift supernovae, and hence improved host-galaxyextinction estimates. these extinction measurements show no anomalous negativee(b-v) at high redshift. the precision of the measurements is such that it ispossible to perform a host-galaxy extinction correction directly for individualsupernovae without any assumptions or priors on the parent e(b-v) distribution.our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that darkenergy is required with $p(\omega_\lambda&gt;0)&gt;0.99$, a result consistent withprevious and current supernova analyses which rely upon the identification of alow-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinctiondistribution.

astro-ph;0406233	the submm properties of grb host galaxies	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) accompany the deaths of some massivestars and hence, since massive stars are short lived, are a tracer of starformation activity. given that grbs are bright enough to be seen to very highredshifts, and detected even in dusty environments, they should thereforeprovide a powerful probe of the global star formation history of the universe.the potential of this approach can be investigated via submm photometry of grbhost galaxies. submm luminosity also correlates with star formation rate, sothe distribution of host galaxy submm fluxes should allow us to test the twomethods for consistency. here, we report new jcmt/scuba 850 micron measurementsfor 15 grb hosts. combining these data with results from previous studies weconstruct a sample of 21 hosts with &lt;1.4 mjy errors. we show that thedistribution of apparent 850 micron flux densities of this sample is reasonablyconsistent with model predictions, but there is tentative evidence of a dearthof submm bright (&gt;4 mjy) galaxies. furthermore, the optical/infrared propertiesof the submm brightest grb hosts are not typical of the galaxy populationselected in submm surveys, although the sample size is still small. possibleselection effects and physical mechanisms which may explain these discrepanciesare discussed.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

astro-ph;0611554	the early and late-time spectral and temporal evolution of grb 050716	we report on a comprehensive set of observations of gamma ray burst 050716,detected by the swift satellite and subsequently followed-up rapidly in x-ray,optical and near infra-red wavebands. the prompt emission is typical oflong-duration bursts, with two peaks in a time interval of t90 = 68 seconds (15- 350 kev). the prompt emission continues at lower flux levels in the x-rayband, where several smaller flares can be seen, on top of a decaying lightcurve that exhibits an apparent break around 220 seconds post trigger. thistemporal break is roughly coincident with a spectral break. the latter can berelated to the extrapolated evolution of the break energy in the promptgamma-ray emission, and is possibly the manifestation of the peak flux breakfrequency of the internal shock passing through the observing band. a possible3 sigma change in the x-ray absorption column is also seen during this time.the late-time afterglow behaviour is relatively standard, with an electrondistribution power-law index of p = 2 there is no noticable temporal break outto at least 10 days. the broad-band optical/nir to x-ray spectrum indicates aredshift of z ~&gt; 2 for this burst, with a host-galaxy extinction value ofe(b-v) ~ 0.7 that prefers an smc-like extinction curve.

astro-ph;0611690	rapid-response mode vlt/uves spectroscopy of grb060418: conclusive  evidence for uv pumping from the time evolution of feii and niii excited- and  metastable-level populations	we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of grb060418, obtainedwith vlt/uves. these observations were triggered using the vlt rapid responsemode (rrm), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena,without any human intervention. this resulted in the first uves exposure ofgrb060418 to be started only 10 minutes after the initial swift satellitetrigger. a sequence of spectra covering 330-670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25,41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7km/s, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10-15. this time-series clearly showsevidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving feiifine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both feii and niii, at thehost-galaxy redshift z=1.490. this is the first report of absorption linesarising from metastable levels of feii and niii along any grb sightline. wemodel the observed evolution of the level populations with three differentexcitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, andfluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. our data allow us toreject the collisional and ir excitation scenarios with high confidence. the uvpumping model, in which the grb afterglow uv photons excite a cloud of atomswith a column density n, distance d, and doppler broadening parameter b,provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log n(feii)=14.75+0.06-0.04,log n(niii)=13.84+/-0.02, d=1.7+/-0.2 kpc (but see appendix a), and b=25+/-3km/s. the success of our uv pumping modeling implies that no significant amountof feii or niii is present at distances smaller than ~1.7 kpc (but see erratumin appendix a), most likely because it is ionized by the grb x-ray/uv flash.because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than feii and niii, thisminimum distance also applies to any hi present.

astro-ph;9807295	the fading optical counterpart of grb~970228, six months and one year  later	we report on observations of the fading optical counterpart of the gamma-rayburst grb 970228, made with the hubble space telescope stis ccd approximatelysix months after outburst and with the hst/nicmos and keck/nirc approximatelyone year after outburst. the unresolved counterpart is detected by stis atv=28.0 +/- 0.25, consistent with a continued power-law decline with exponent-1.14 +/- 0.05. the counterpart is located within, but near the edge of, afaint extended source with diameter ~0."8 and integrated magnitude v=25.8 +/-0.25. a reanalysis of hst and ntt observations performed shortly after theburst shows no evidence of proper motion of the point source or fading of theextended emission. only the extended source is visible in the nicmos imageswith a magnitude of h=23.3 +/- 0.1. the keck observations find k = 22.8 +/-0.3. several distinct and independent means of deriving the foregroundextinction in the direction of grb 970228 all agree with a_v = 0.75 +/- 0.2.after adjusting for galactic extinction, we find that the size of the observedextended emission is consistent with that of galaxies of comparable magnitudefound in the hubble deep field (hdf) and other deep hst images. only 2% of thesky is covered by galaxies of similar or greater surface brightness; thereforethe extended source is almost certainly the host galaxy. additionally, we findthat the extinction-corrected v - h and v - k colors of the host are as blue asany galaxy of comparable or brighter magnitude in the hdf. taken in concertwith recent observations of grb 970508, grb 971214, and grb 980703 our worksuggests that all four grbs with spectroscopic identification or deepmulticolor broad-band imaging of the host lie in rapidly star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;9808282	an extremely red r^{1/4} galaxy in the test image of the hubble deep  field south	we report the serendipitous discovery of an extremely red object in thehubble deep field south (hdfs) test nicmos (near infrared camera and multiobject spectrograph) field of view. the object is resolved in the nicmos imageand has a light profile very well described by an r^{1/4} law with effectiveradius r_e=0."20+-0."05 and h_{ab}=21.7+-0.1 magnitudes. in contrast, thegalaxy is undetected in the r and i band ground based images taken at the ctio4 m blanco telescope, giving a lower limit to the color of (r-h)_{ab}&gt;3.9 and(i-h)_{ab}&gt;3.5 at the 95% confidence level. the colors of a range of syntheticgalactic spectra are computed, showing that the object is likely to be an``old'' elliptical galaxy at redshift z&gt;~1.7. alternatively the colors can bereproduced by an ``old'' elliptical galaxy at somewhat lower redshift (z&gt;~1)with significant amount of dust, or by a younger galaxy at higher redshift.this object represents a very interesting target for future vlt observations.

astro-ph;9812102	vlt and hst observations of a candidate high redshift elliptical galaxy  in the hubble deep field south	the combined use of the eso very large telescope (vlt) ut1 scienceverification (sv) images and of the hubble space telescope (hst) hubble deepfield south observations allows us to strengthen the identification as acandidate elliptical galaxy of the extremely red object hdfs 223251-603910previously identified by us on the basis of nicmos and cerro tololointeramerican observatory imaging. the photometry presented here includes vltdata in u, b, v, r, i, a stis unfiltered image, nicmos j, h, and k band data,thus combining the 16.5 hours of vlt sv exposures with 101 hours of hstobserving. the object is detected in all images except the vlt u band and isone of the reddest known with b-k=9.7+-0.5. we consider a wide range of modelswith different ages, metallicities, star formation histories and dust content,and conclude that the observed spectral energy distribution agrees best withthat of an old elliptical galaxy at redshift just below 2. alternativepossibilities are discussed in light of their likelihood and of the perspectiveof spectroscopic confirmation.

astro-ph;9812133	measurements of omega and lambda from 42 high-redshift supernovae	we report measurements of the mass density, omega_m, andcosmological-constant energy density, omega_lambda, of the universe based onthe analysis of 42 type ia supernovae discovered by the supernova cosmologyproject. the magnitude-redshift data for these sne, at redshifts between 0.18and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of sne from the calan/tololo supernovasurvey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmologicalparameters. all sn peak magnitudes are standardized using a sn ia lightcurvewidth-luminosity relation. the measurement yields a joint probabilitydistribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by therelation 0.8 omega_m - 0.6 omega_lambda ~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region ofinterest (omega_m &lt;~ 1.5). for a flat (omega_m + omega_lambda = 1) cosmology wefind omega_m = 0.28{+0.09,-0.08} (1 sigma statistical) {+0.05,-0.04}(identified systematics). the data are strongly inconsistent with a lambda = 0flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. an open, lambda = 0cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that thecosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of p(lambda &gt;0) = 99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. the best-fit ageof the universe relative to the hubble time is t_0 = 14.9{+1.4,-1.1} (0.63/h)gyr for a flat cosmology. the size of our sample allows us to perform a varietyof statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. wefind no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution ormalmquist bias between the low-redshift calan/tololo sample and ourhigh-redshift sample. the conclusions are robust whether or not awidth-luminosity relation is used to standardize the sn peak magnitudes.

astro-ph;9903236	hst observations of the host galaxy of grb970508	we report on observations of the field of grb~970508 made in early august1998, 454 days after outburst, with the stis ccd camera onboard the hubblespace telescope. the images, taken in open filter (50ccd) mode, clearly revealthe presence of a galaxy which was obscured in earlier (june 1997) hst imagesby emission from the optical transient (ot). the galaxy is regular in shape:after correcting for the hst/stis psf, it is well-fitted by an exponential diskwith a scale length of 0."046 +/- 0."006 and an ellipticity of 0.70 +/- 0.07.all observations are marginally consistent with a continuous decline in otemission as t^{-1.3} beginning two days after outburst; however, we find nodirect evidence in the image for emission from the ot, and the surfacebrightness profile of the galaxy is most regular if we assume that the otemission is negligible, suggesting that the ot may have faded more rapidly atlate times than is predicted by the power-law decay. due to the wide bandwidthof the stis clear mode, the estimated magnitude of the galaxy is dependent onthe galaxy spectrum that is assumed. using colors obtained from late-timeground-based observations to constrain the spectrum, we find v = 25.4 +/- 0.15,a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than earlier ground-based estimates thatwere obtained by observing the total light of the galaxy and the ot and thensubtracting the estimated ot brightness assuming it fades as a singlepower-law. this again suggests that the ot may have faded faster at late timethan the power-law predicts. the position of the ot agrees with that of theisophotal center of the galaxy to 0."01. this remarkable agreement raises thepossibility that the grb may have been associated with either an activegalactic nucleus or a nuclear starburst.

astro-ph;9903380	deviations from the fundamental plane and the peculiar velocities of  clusters	we have fit the fundamental plane of ellipticals (fp) to over 400 early-typegalaxies in 20 nearby clusters (4000 &lt; cz &lt; 11000 km/s), using our ownphotometry and spectroscopy as well as measurements culled from the literature.we find that the quality-of-fit, r.m.s.[log(sigma)], to the average fundamentalplane &lt;fp&gt; varies substantially among these clusters. a statisticallysignificant gap in r.m.s.[log(sigma)] roughly separates the clusters which fit&lt;fp&gt; well from those that do not. in addition, these two groups of clustersshow distinctly different behavior in their peculiar velocity (pv)distributions. assuming galaxies are drawn from a single underlying population,cluster pv should not be correlated with r.m.s.[log(sigma)]. instead, theclusters with below average scatter display no motion with respect to thecosmic microwave background (cmb) within our measurement errors (~250 km/s),while clusters in the poor-fit group typically show large pvs. furthermore, wefind that all x-ray bright clusters in our sample fit the &lt;fp&gt; well, suggestingthat early-type galaxies in the most massive, virialized clusters form a moreuniform population than do cluster ellipticals as a whole, and that theseclusters participate in a quiet hubble flow.

astro-ph;9907264	evidence for a supernova in reanalyzed optical and near-infrared images  of grb970228	we present b-, v-, r_c-, i_c-, j-, h-, k- and k'-band observations of theoptical transient (ot) associated with grb970228, based on a reanalysis ofpreviously used images and unpublished data. in order to minimize calibrationdifferences we have collected and analyzed most of the photometry andconsistently determined the magnitude of the ot relative to a set of secondaryfield stars. we confirm our earlier finding that the early decay of the lightcurves (before march 6, 1997) was faster than that at intermediate times(between march 6 and april 7, 1997). at late times the light curves resume afast decay (after april 7, 1997). the early-time observations of grb970228 areconsistent with relativistic blast-wave models but the intermediate- andlate-time observations are hard to understand in this framework. theobservations are well explained by an initial power law decay with index -1.73+0.09 -0.12 modified at later times by a type-i_c supernova light curve.together with the evidence for grb980326 and grb980425 this gives furthersupport for the idea that at least some grbs are associated with a possiblyrare type of supernova.

astro-ph;9910436	deep radio imaging of globular clusters and the cluster pulsar  population	we have obtained deep multifrequency radio observations of seven globularclusters using the very large array and the australia telescope compact array.five of these, ngc 6440, ngc 6539, ngc 6544, ngc 6624 and terzan 5 hadpreviously been detected in a shallower survey for steep spectrum radio sourcesin globular clusters (fruchter and goss 1990). the sixth, the rich globularcluster, liller 1, had heretofore been undetected in the radio, and theseventh, 47 tucanae, was not included in our original survey. high resolution 6and 20 cm images of three of the clusters, ngc 6440, ngc 6539, ngc 6624 revealonly point sources coincident with pulsars which have been discoveredsubsequent to our first imaging survey. 21 and 18 cm images reveal severalpoint sources within a few core-radii of the center of 47 tuc. two of these areidentified pulsars, and a third, which is both variable and has a steepspectrum, is also most likely a pulsar previously identified by a pulsedsurvey. however, the 6, 20 and 90 cm images of ngc 6544, liller 1 and terzan 5display strong steep-spectrum emission which cannot be associated with knownpulsars. the image of the rich cluster terzan 5 displays numerous point sourceswithin $30''$, or 4 core radii of the cluster center. the density of theseobjects rises rapidly toward the core, where an elongated region of emission isfound. the brightest individual sources, as well as the extended emission,possess the steep spectra expected of pulsars. furthermore, the fluxdistribution of the sources agrees well with the standard pulsar luminosityfunction. the total luminosity and number of objects observed suggest thatterzan 5 contains more pulsars than any other galactic globular cluster.
