0902.1985	disentangling the system geometry of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  igr j11215-5952 with swift	igr j11215-5952 is a hard x-ray transient discovered in 2005 april byintegral and a member of the new class of hmxb, the supergiant fast x-raytransients (sfxts). while integral and rxte observations have shown that theoutbursts occur with a periodicity of ~330 days, swift data have recentlydemonstrated that the true outburst period is ~165 days. igr j11215-5952 is thefirst discovered sfxt displaying periodic outbursts, which are possibly relatedto the orbital period. we performed a guest investigator observation with swiftthat lasted 20ks and several follow-up target of opportunity (too)observations, for a total of ~32ks, during the expected "apastron" passage(defined assuming an orbital period of ~330 days), between 2008 june 16 andjuly 4. the characteristics of this "apastron'' outburst are quite similar tothose previously observed during the "periastron'' outburst of 2007 february 9.the mean spectrum of the bright peaks can be fit with an absorbed power lawmodel with a photon index of 1 and an absorbing column of 1e22 cm^-2. thisoutburst reached luminosities of ~1e36 erg/s (1-10kev), comparable with theones measured in 2007. the light curve can be modelled with the parametersobtained by sidoli et al. (2007) for the 2007 february 9 outburst, althoughsome differences can be observed in its shape. the properties of the rise tothis new outburst and the comparison with the previous outbursts allow us tosuggest that the true orbital period of igr j11215-5952 is very likely 164.6days, and that the orbit is eccentric, with the different outbursts produced atthe periastron passage, when the neutron star crosses the inclined equatorialwind from the supergiant companion. based on a too observation performed on2008 march 25-27, we can exclude that the period is 165/2 days.

0902.1988	swift and supergiant fast x-ray transients: a novel monitoring approach	we describe our monitoring strategy which best exploits the sensitivity andflexibility of swift to study the long-term behaviour of supergiant fast x-raytransients (sfxts). we present observations of the recent outbursts from twoobjects of this class. igr j16479-4514, underwent an outburst on 2008 march 19,reaching a peak luminosity of about 6e37 erg/s (0.5-100kev; at a distance of4.9 kpc). we obtained a simultaneous broad-band spectrum (0.3-100 kev), thefirst for the sfxt class, which is fit with a heavily absorbed (column density5e22 cm^-2) hard power-law with a high energy cut-off at about 7kev. thisspectrum shows properties similar to the ones of accreting pulsars, although nox-ray pulsations were found. igr j11215-5952, one of the only two periodic sfxtknown to date, was observed with swift several times, first with an intense23-day long monitoring campaign around the 2007 february 9 outburst; then witha 26-day long monitoring around the unexpected july 24 outburst; finally with adeep exposure during the 2008 june 16 outburst. we present the whole dataset,which also includes observations which allowed us to firmly establish theoutburst period at p~165 days. thanks to our combined observations commoncharacteristics to this class of objects are emerging, i.e., outburst lengthswell in excess of hours, often with a multiple peaked structure, dynamic range~3 orders of magnitude, and periodicities are starting to be found.

0905.2815	supergiant fast x-ray transients in outburst: new swift observations of  xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619, and igrj08408-4503	we report on new x-ray outbursts observed with swift from three supergiantfast x-ray transients (sfxts): xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 and igrj08408-4503.the former two outbursts were caught during the monitoring campaign we havebeen performing with the swift satellite since october 2007: xtej1739-302underwent a new outburst on 2008, august 13, igrj17544-2619 on 2008, september4, while igrj08408-4503 on 2008, september 21. while xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 bright emission triggered the swift/burst alert telescope,igrj17544-2619 did not, thus we could perform a spectral investigation only ofthe spectrum below 10 kev. the broad band spectra from xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 were compatible with the x-ray spectral shape displayed duringthe previous flares. a variable absorbing column density during the flare wasobserved in xtej1739-302 for the first time. the broad band spectrum ofigrj08408-4503 requires the presence of two distinct photon populations, a coldone (0.3 kev) most likely from a thermal halo around the neutron star and ahotter one (1.4-1.8 kev) from the accreting column. the outburst fromxtej1739-302 could be monitored with a very good sampling, thus revealing ashape which can be explained with a second wind component in this sfxt, inanalogy to what we have suggested in the periodic sfxt igrj11215-5952. theoutburst recurrence timescale in igrj17544-2619 during our monitoring campaignwith swift suggests a long orbital period of ~150 days (in an highly eccentricorbit), compatible with what previously observed with integral.

0906.3185	the structure of blue supergiant winds and the accretion in supergiant  high mass x-ray binaries	we have developed a stellar wind model for ob supergiants to investigate theeffects of accretion from a clumpy wind on the luminosity and variabilityproperties of high mass x-ray binaries. assuming that the clumps are confinedby ram pressure of the ambient gas and exploring different distributions fortheir mass and radii, we computed the expected x-ray light curves in theframework of the bondi-hoyle accretion theory, modified to take into accountthe presence of clumps. the resulting variability properties are found todepend not only on the assumed orbital parameters but also on the windcharacteristics. we have then applied this model to reproduce the x-ray lightcurves of three representative high mass x-ray binaries: two persistentsupergiant systems (velax-1 and 4u1700-377) and the supergiant fast x-raytransient igrj11215-5952. the model can reproduce well the observed lightcurves, but requiring in all cases an overall mass loss from the supergiantabout a factor 3-10 smaller than the values inferred from uv lines studies thatassume a homogeneous wind.

0907.1289	monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift. results from the  first year	swift has allowed the possibility to give supergiant fast x-ray transients(sfxts), the new class of high mass x-ray binaries discovered by integral, nonserendipitous attention throughout all phases of their life. we present ourresults based on the first year of intense swift monitoring of four sfxts, igrj16479-4514, xte j1739-302, igr j17544-2619 and ax j1841.0-0536. we obtain thefirst assessment of how long each source spends in each state using asystematic monitoring with a sensitive instrument. the duty-cycle of inactivityis 17, 28, 39, 55% (5% uncertainty), for igr j16479-4514, ax j1841.0-0536, xtej1739-302, and igr j17544-2619, respectively, so that true quiescence is a rarestate. this demonstrates that these transients accrete matter throughout theirlife at different rates. ax j1841.0-0536 is the only source which has notundergone a bright outburst during our campaign. although individual sourcesbehave somewhat differently, common x-ray characteristics of this class areemerging such as outburst lengths well in excess of hours, with a multiplepeaked structure. a high dynamic range (including bright outbursts) of 4 ordersof magnitude has been observed. we performed out-of-outburst intensity-basedspectroscopy. spectral fits with an absorbed blackbody always result inblackbody radii of a few hundred meters, consistent with being emitted from asmall portion of the neutron star surface, very likely the neutron star polarcaps. we also present the uvot data of these sources.

0907.4041	the first broad-band x-ray study of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  saxj1818.6-1703 in outburst	the supergiant fast x-ray transient (sfxt) saxj1818.6-1703 underwent anoutburst on 2009 may 6 and was observed with swift. we report on theseobservations which, for the first time, allow us to study the broad-bandspectrum from soft to hard x-rays of this source. no x-ray spectral informationwas available on this source before the swift monitoring. the spectrum can bedeconvolved well with models usually adopted to describe the emission from highmass x-ray binary x-ray pulsars, and is characterized by a very highabsorption, a flat power law (photon index ~0.1-0.5) and a cutoff at about 7-12kev. alternatively, the saxj1818.6-1703 emission can be described with acomptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona, with an electrontemperature kte=5-7 kev, a hot seed photon temperature, kt0, of 1.3-1.4 kev,and an optical depth for the comptonizing plasma of about 10. the 1-100 kevluminosity at the peak of the flare is 3e36 erg/s (assuming the opticalcounterpart distance of 2.5 kpc). these properties of saxj1818.6-1703 resemblethose of the prototype of the sfxt class, xtej1739-302. the monitoring withswift/xrt reveals an outburst duration of about 5 days, similarly to othermembers of the class of sfxts, confirming saxj1818.6-1703 as a member of thisclass.

0907.4239	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j1037.5-5647 in a low luminosity state	the spectra of several x-ray binary pulsars display a clear soft excess,which in most cases can be described with a blackbody model, above the mainpower-law component. while in the high-luminosity sources it is usuallycharacterized by low temperature (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and large emission radius (r &gt;100 km), in the two persistent and low-luminosity pulsars 4u 0352+309 and rxj0146.9+6121 this component has a high temperature (kt &gt; 1 kev) and a smallerradius (r &lt; 0.5 km), consistent with the estimated size of the neutron-starpolar cap. here we report on the timing and spectral analysis of rxj1037.5-5647, another low-luminosity persistent be binary pulsar, based on thefirst xmm-newton observation of this source. we have found a best-fit period p= 853.4(+/-0.2) s, that implies an average pulsar spin-up dp/dt ~ -2e-8 s/s inthe latest decade. the estimated source luminosity is lx ~ 10^34 erg/s, a valuecomparable to that of the other persistent be binary pulsars and about oneorder of magnitude lower than in most of the previous measurements. the sourcespectrum can be described with a power law plus blackbody model, with ktbb =1.26(+0.16/-0.09) kev and rbb = 128(+13/-21) m, suggesting a polar-cap originof this component. these results strengthen the hypothesis that, in addition tolow luminosities and long periods, this class of sources is characterized alsoby common spectral properties

0909.5109	swift/xrt monitoring of the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j18483-0311 for an entire orbital period	igr j18483-0311 is an x-ray pulsar with transient x-ray activity, belongingto the new class of high mass x-ray binaries called supergiant fast x-raytransients. this system is one of the two members of this class, together withigr j11215-5952, where both the orbital (18.52d) and spin period (21s) areknown. we report on the first complete monitoring of the x-ray activity alongan entire orbital period of a supergiant fast x-ray transient. these swiftobservations, lasting 28d, cover more than one entire orbital phaseconsecutively. they are a unique data-set, which allows us to constrain thedifferent mechanisms proposed to explain the nature of this new class of x-raytransients. we applied the new clumpy wind model for blue supergiants developedby ducci et al. (2009), to the observed x-ray light curve. assuming aneccentricity of e=0.4, the x-ray emission from this source can be explained interms of the accretion from a spherically symmetric clumpy wind, composed ofclumps with different masses, ranging from 10^{18}g to 5x 10^{21}g.

0912.1730	xmm-newton and integral study of the sfxt igr j18483-0311 in quiescence:  hint of a cyclotron emission feature?	we report the results from archival xmm-newton and integral observations ofthe supergiant fast x-ray transient (sfxt) igr j18483-0311 in quiescence. the18-60 kev hard x-ray behaviour of the source is presented here for the firsttime, it is characterized by a spectral shape ($\gamma$ about 2.5) similar tothat during outburst activity and the lowest measured luminosity level is about10^34 erg s^-1. the 0.5-10 kev luminosity state, measured by xmm-newton duringthe apastron passage, is about one order of magnitude lower and it isreasonably fitted by an absorbed black body model yielding parametersconsistent with previous measurements. in addition, we find evidence (about 3.5sigma significance) of an emission-like feature at about 3.3 kev in thequiescent 0.5-10 kev source spectrum. the absence of any known or foundsystematic effects, which could artificially introduce the observed feature,give us confidence about its non-instrumental nature. we show that its physicalexplanation in terms of atomic emission line appears unlikely and conversely weattempt to ascribe it to an electron cyclotron emission line which would implya neutron star magnetic field of the order of about 3x10^11 g. importantly,such direct estimation is in very good agreement with that independentlyinferred by us in the framework of accretion from a spherically symmetricstellar wind. if firmly confirmed by future longer x-ray observations, thiswould be the first detection ever of a cyclotron feature in the x-ray spectrumof a sfxt, with important implications on theoretical models.

1001.3234	exist perspective for supergiant fast x-ray transients	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are one of the most intriguing (andunexpected) results of the integral mission. they are a new class of high massx-ray binaries involving about 20 sources to date, with 8 firmly identifiedsfxts and many candidates. they are composed by a massive ob supergiant star ascompanion donor and a compact object. at least four sfxts host a neutron star,because x-ray pulsations have been discovered, while for the others a blackhole cannot be excluded. sfxts display short x-ray outbursts (compared withbe/x-ray transients) characterized by fast flares on brief timescales of hoursand large flux variability typically in the range 1,000-100,000. theintegral/ibis sensitivity allowed to catch only the bright flares (peaking at1e36-1e37erg/s), without persistent or quiescent emission. the investigation oftheir properties, in particular the rapid variability time scales of theirflaring activity, will greatly benefit from observations with the energeticx-ray imaging survey telescope (exist), with the possibility to perform a longterm and continuous as possible monitoring of the hard x-ray sky.

1004.1896	the role of structured ob supergiant winds in producing the x-ray  flaring emission from high mass x-ray binaries	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a new class of high mass x-raybinaries, discovered by the integral satellite, which display flares lastingfrom minutes to hours, with peak luminosity of 1e36-1e37 erg/s. outside thebright outbursts, they show a frequent long-term flaring activity reaching anx-ray luminosity level of 1e33-1e34 erg/s, as recently observed with the swiftsatellite. since a few persistent high mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) withsupergiant donors show flares with properties similar to those observed insfxts, it has been suggested that the flaring activity in both classes could beproduced by the same mechanism, probably the accretion of clumps composing thesupergiant wind. we have developed a new clumpy wind model for ob supergiantswith both a spherical and a non spherical symmetry for the outflow. we haveinvestigated the effects of the accretion of a clumpy wind onto a neutron starin both classes of persistent and transient hmxbs.

(1977), which is based on the accretion via rayleigh-taylor instability,and was originally proposed to explain type ii bursts.

1112.5341	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j0440.9+4431	many x-ray accreting pulsars have a soft excess below 10 kev. this featurehas been detected also in faint sources and at low luminosity levels,suggesting that it is an ubiquitous phenomenon. in the case of the highluminosity pulsars (lx &gt; 10^36 erg/s), the fit of this component with thermalemission models usually provides low temperatures (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and largeemission regions (r &gt; a few hundred km); for this reason, it is referred to asa `soft' excess. on the other hand, we recently found that in persistent,low-luminosity (lx ~ 10^34 erg/s) and long-period (p &gt; 100 s) be accretingpulsars the observed excess can be modeled with a rather hot (kt &gt; 1 kev)blackbody component of small area (r &lt; 0.5 km), which can be interpreted asemission from the ns polar caps. in this paper we present the results of arecent xmm-newton observation of the galactic be pulsar rx j0440.9+4431, whichis a poorly studied member of this class of sources. we have found a best-fitperiod p = 204.96(+/-0.02) s, which implies an average pulsar spin-down duringthe last 13 years, with dp/dt ~ 6x10^(-9) s/s. the estimated source luminosityis lx ~ 8x10^(34) erg/s: this value is higher by a factor &lt; 10 compared tothose obtained in the first source observations, but almost two orders ofmagnitude lower than those measured during a few outbursts detected in thelatest years. the source spectrum can be described with a power law plusblackbody model, with ktbb = 1.34(+/-0.04) kev and rbb = 273(+/-16) m,suggesting a polar-cap origin of this component. our results support theclassification of rx j0440.9+4431 as a persistent be/ns pulsar, and confirmthat the hot blackbody spectral component is a common property of this class ofsources.

1204.5904	xmm-newton observations of gx 13+1: correlation between photoionised  absorption and broad line emission	we analysed data from five xmm-newton observations of gx 13+1 to investigatethe variability of the photo-ionised absorber present in this source. we fittedepic and rgs spectra obtained from the "least-variable" intervals with a modelconsisting of disc-blackbody and blackbody components together with a gaussianemission feature at ~6.55-6.7 kev modified by absorption due to cold andphoto-ionised material. we found a significant correlation between the hard,~6-10 kev, flux, the ionisation and column density of the absorber and theequivalent width of the broad iron line. we interpret the correlation in ascenario in which a disc wind is thermally driven at large, ~10^{10} cm, radiiand the broad line results from reprocessed emission in the wind and/or hotatmosphere. the breadth of the emission line is naturally explained by acombination of scattering, recombination and fluorescence processes. weattribute the variations in the absorption and emission along the orbitalperiod to the view of different parts of the wind, possibly located at slightlydifferent inclination angles. we constrain the inclination of gx 13+1 to bebetween 60 and 80 degrees from the presence of strong absorption in the line ofsight, that obscures up to 80% of the total emission in one observation, andthe absence of eclipses. we conclude that the presence of a disc wind and/or ahot atmosphere can explain the current observations of narrow absorption andbroad iron emission features in neutron star low mass x-ray binaries as aclass.

1212.0723	a suzaku x-ray observation of one orbit of the supergiant fast x-ray  transient igr j16479-4514	we report on a 250 ks long x-ray observation of the supergiant fast x-raytransient (sfxt) igr j16479-4514 performed with suzaku in 2012 february. about80% of the short orbital period (porb=3.32 days) was covered as continuously aspossible for the first time. the source light curve displays variability ofmore than two orders of magnitude, starting with a very low emission statelasting the first 46 ks (1e-13 erg/cm2/s, 1-10 kev), consistent with being dueto the x-ray eclipse by the supergiant companion. the transition to theuneclipsed x-ray emission is energy dependent. outside the eclipse, the sourcespends most of the time at a level of (6-7)x10^-12 erg/cm2/s punctuated by twostructured faint flares with a duration of about 10 and 15 ks. remarkably, thefirst faint flare occurs at a similar orbital phase of the bright flarespreviously observed in the system. this indicates the presence of aphase-locked large scale structure in the supergiant wind, driving a higheraccretion rate onto the compact object. the scattered component visible duringthe x-ray eclipse allowed us to directly probe the wind density at the orbitalseparation, resulting in rho=7e-14 g/cm3. assuming a spherical geometry for thesupergiant wind, the derived wind density translates into a ratiomdot_w/v_terminal = 7e-17 solar masses/km which, assuming terminal velocitiesin a large range 500-3000 km/s, implies an accretion luminosity two orders ofmagnitude higher than that observed. as a consequence, a mechanism is at workreducing the mass accretion rate. different possibilities are discussed.

1306.1106	cxou j005047.9-731817: a 292-s x-ray binary pulsar in the small  magellanic cloud	we report on the discovery of a transient x-ray pulsars, located in the smallmagellanic cloud, with a pulse period of 292 s. a series of chandra pointingsfortuitously recorded in 2010 april-may the occurrence of a two-weeks-longoutburst, during which the source luminosity increased by a factor of about100, reaching a peak of ~1e36 erg/s (for a distance of 61 kpc). complex-shapeand energy-dependent pulsations were detected close to the outburst peak andduring the very first part of its decay phase. during the outburst, thephase-averaged spectrum of the pulsar was well described by an absorbed powerlaw with photon index ~0.6, but large variations as a function of phase werepresent. the source was also detected by chandra several times (during 2002,2003, 2006, and 2010) at a quiescent level of ~1e34 erg/s. in 2012 we performedan infrared photometric follow-up of the r ~ 15 mag optical counterpart withthe eso/vlt and a spectroscopic observation by means of the ctio telescope. theoptical spectra suggest a late-oe or early-be v-iii luminosity-class star,though a more evolved companion cannot be ruled out by our data (we can excludea luminosity class i and a spectral type later than b2). finally, we show thatthe outburst main parameters (duration and peak luminosity) can be accountedfor by interpreting the source transient activity as a type i outburst in a bex-ray binary.

1401.6861	cumulative luminosity distributions of supergiant fast x-ray transients  in hard x-rays	we have analyzed in a systematic way about nine years of integral data(17-100 kev) focusing on supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) and threeclassical high mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs). our approach has been twofold:image based analysis, sampled over a ~ks time frame to investigate thelong-term properties of the sources, and lightcurve based analysis, sampledover a 100s time frame to seize the fast variability of each source during its~ks activity. we find that while the prototypical sfxts (igr j17544-2619, xtej1739-302 and sax j1818.6-1703) are among the sources with the lowest ~ks basedduty cycle ($&lt;$1% activity over nine years of data), when studied at the 100slevel, they are the ones with the highest detection percentage, meaning that,when active, they tend to have many bright short-term flares with respect tothe other sfxts. to investigate in a coherent and self consistent way all theavailable results within a physical scenario, we have extracted cumulativeluminosity distributions for all the sources of the sample. thecharacterization of such distributions in hard x-rays, presented for the firsttime in this work for the sfxts, shows that a power-law model is a plausiblerepresentation for sfxts, while it can only reproduce the very high luminositytail of the classical hmxbs, and even then, with a significantly steeperpower-law slope with respect to sfxts. the physical implications of theseresults within the frame of accretion in wind-fed systems are discussed.

1405.5707	bright flares in supergiant fast x-ray transients	at steady low-luminosity states, supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) canbe at the stage of quasi-spherical settling accretion onto slowly rotatingmagnetized ns from the ob-companion winds. at this stage, a hot quasi-staticshell is formed above the magnetosphere, the plasma entry rate intomagnetosphere is controlled by (inefficient) radiative plasma cooling, and theaccretion rate onto the ns is suppressed by a factor of \sim 30 relative to thebondi-hoyle-littleton value. changes in the local wind velocity and density canonly slightly increase the mass accretion rate (a factor of \sim 10) bringingthe system into the compton cooling dominated regime and led to the productionof moderately bright flares (l_x\lesssim 10^{36} erg/s). to interpret thebrightest flares (l_x&gt;10^{36}~erg/s) displayed by the sfxts, we propose that alarger increase in the mass accretion rate can be produced by sporadic captureof magnetized stellar wind plasma. at sufficiently low accretion rates,magnetic reconnection can enhance the magnetospheric plasma entry rate,resulting in copious production of x-ray photons, strong compton cooling andultimately in unstable accretion of the entire shell. a bright flare developson the free-fall time scale in the shell, and the typical energy released in ansfxt bright flare corresponds to the mass of the shell. this view is consistentwith the energy released in sfxt bright flares (\sim 10^{38}-10^{40}~ergs),their typical dynamic range (\sim 100), and with the observed dependence ofthese characteristics on the average unflaring x-ray luminosity of sfxts. thusthe flaring behavior of sfxts, as opposed to steady hmxbs, may be primarilyrelated to their low x-ray luminosity allowing sporadic magnetic reconnectionto occur during magnetized plasma entry into the magnetosphere.

1407.3163	wind accretion: theory and observations	a review of wind accretion in hmxb is presented. we focus on differentregimes of quasi-spherical accretion onto a ns: supersonic (bondi) accretion,which takes place when the captured matter cools down rapidly and fallssupersonically towards the ns magnetosphere, and subsonic (settling) accretionwhich occurs when the plasma remains hot until it meets the magnetosphericboundary. the two regimes are separated by a limit in x-ray luminosity at about4 10^{36} erg/s. in subsonic accretion, which works a hot quasi-spherical shellmust form around the magnetosphere, and the actual accretion rate onto the nsis determined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due tothe rayleigh-taylor instability. two regimes of subsonic accretion arepossible, depending on the plasma cooling mechanism (compton or radiative) nearthe magnetopshere. the transition from the high-luminosity regime with comptoncooling to the low-luminosity (l_x &lt; 3\times 10^35 erg/s) regime with radiativecooling can be responsible for the onset of the 'off' states repeatedlyobserved in several x-ray pulsars, such as vela x-1, gx 301-2 and 4u 1907+09.the triggering of the transition may be due to a switch in the x-ray beampattern in response to a change in the optical depth in the accretion columnwith changing luminosity. we also show that in the settling accretion theory,bright x-ray flares (10^{38}-10^{40} ergs) observed in sfxt may be produced bysporadic capture of magnetized stellar-wind plasma. at sufficiently lowaccretion rates, magnetic reconnection can enhance the magnetospheric plasmaentry rate, resulting in copious production of x-ray photons, strong comptoncooling and ultimately in unstable accretion of the entire shell. a brightflare develops on the free-fall time scale in the shell, and the typical energyreleased in an sfxt bright flare corresponds to the mass of the shell.

1411.7869	probing large-scale wind structures in vela x-1 using off-states with  integral	vela x-1 is the prototype of the class of wind-fed accreting pulsars in highmass x-ray binaries hosting a supergiant donor. we have analyzed in asystematic way ten years of integral data of vela x-1 (22-50 kev) and we foundthat when outside the x-ray eclipse, the source undergoes several luminositydrops where the hard x-rays luminosity goes below 3x10^35 erg/s, becomingundetected by integral. these drops in the x-ray flux are usually referred toas "off-states" in the literature. we have investigated the distribution ofthese off-states along the vela x-1 ~8.9 d orbit, finding that their orbitaloccurrence displays an asymmetric distribution, with a higher probability toobserve an off-state near the pre-eclipse than during the post-eclipse. thisasymmetry can be explained by scattering of hard x-rays in a region of ionizedwind, able to reduce the source hard x-ray brightness preferentially neareclipse ingress. we associate this ionized large-scale wind structure with thephotoionization wake produced by the interaction of the supergiant wind withthe x-ray emission from the neutron star. we emphasize that this observationalresult could be obtained thanks to the accumulation of a decade of integraldata, with observations covering the whole orbit several times, allowing us todetect an asymmetric pattern in the orbital distribution of off-states in velax-1.

1503.08830	swift j201424.9+152930: discovery of a new deeply eclipsing binary with  491 s and 3.4 h modulations	we report on the discovery of a new x-ray pulsator, swift j201424.9+152930(sw j2014). owing to its x-ray modulation at 491 s, it was discovered in asystematic search for coherent signals in the archival data of the swift x-raytelescope. to investigate the nature of sw j2014, we performed multi-wavelengthfollow-up observations with space-borne (swift and xmm-newton) and ground-based(the 1.5-m loiano telescope and the 3.6-m telescopio nazionale galileo)instruments. the x-ray spectrum of sw j2014 can be described by a hard andhighly absorbed power law. the optical observations made it possible to singleout the optical counterpart to this source, which displays several variableemission lines and total eclipses lasting ~20 min. total eclipses of similarlength were observed also in x-rays. the study of the eclipses, allowed us toinfer a second periodicity of 3.44 h, which we interpret as the orbital periodof a close binary system. we also found that the period has not significantlychanged over a ~7 yr timespan. based on the timing signatures of sw j2014, andits optical and x-ray spectral properties, we suggest that it is a close binaryhosting an accreting magnetic white dwarf. the system is therefore acataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar type and one of the very fewshowing deep eclipses.

0805.1808	monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift. i. behavior  outside outbursts	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a new class of hmxbs discoveredthanks to the monitoring of the galactic plane performed with the integralsatellite in the last 5 years. these sources display short outbursts(significantly shorter than typical be/x-ray binaries) with a peak luminosityof a few 1e36 erg/s. the quiescent level, measured only in a few sources, isaround 1e32 erg/s. we are performing a monitoring campaign with swift of foursfxts (igrj16479-4514, xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 andaxj1841.0-0536/igrj18410-0535). we report on the first four months of swiftobservations, started on 2007 october 26. we detect a low level x-ray activityin all four sfxts which demonstrates that these transient sources accretematter even outside their outbursts. this fainter x-ray activity is composed ofmany flares with a large flux variability, on timescales of thousands ofseconds. the lightcurve variability is also evident on larger timescales ofdays, weeks and months, with a dynamic range of more than one order ofmagnitude in all four sfxts. the x-ray spectra are typically hard, with anaverage 2-10 kev luminosity during this monitoring of about 1e33-1e34 erg/s. wedetected pulsations from the pulsar axj1841.0-0536, with a period of4.7008+/-0.0004 s. this monitoring demonstrates that these transients spendmost of the time accreting matter, although at a much lower level (~100-1000times lower than during the bright outbusts), and that the true quiescence,characterized by a soft spectrum and a luminosity of a few 1e32 erg/s, observedin the past only in a couple of members of this class, is probably a very rarestate.

1506.05808	periodic signals from the circinus region: two new cataclysmic variables  and the ultraluminous x-ray source candidate gc x-1	the examination of two 2010 chandra acis exposures of the circinus galaxyresulted in the discovery of two pulsators: cxo j141430.1-651621 and cxouj141332.9-651756. we also detected 26-ks pulsations in cg x-1, consistentlywith previous measures. for ~40 other sources, we obtained limits on periodicmodulations. in cxo j141430.1-651621, which is ~2 arcmin outside the circinusgalaxy, we detected signals at 6120(1) s and 64.2(5) ks. in the longestobservation, the source showed a flux of ~1.1e-13 erg/cm^2/s (absorbed, 0.5-10kev) and the spectrum could be described by a power-law with photon index ~1.4.from archival observations, we found that the luminosity is variable by ~50 percent on time-scales of weeks-years. the two periodicities pin down cxoj141430.1-651621 as a cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar subtype.the period of cxou j141332.9-651756 is 6378(3) s. it is located inside thecircinus galaxy, but the low absorption indicates a galactic foreground object.the flux was ~5e-14 erg/cm^2/s in the chandra observations and showed ~50 percent variations on weekly/yearly scales; the spectrum is well fit by a powerlaw ~0.9. these characteristics and the large modulation suggest that cxouj141332.9-651756 is a magnetic cataclysmic variable, probably a polar. for cgx-1, we show that if the source is in the circinus galaxy, its properties areconsistent with a wolf-rayet plus black hole binary. we consider theimplications of this for ultraluminous x-ray sources and the prospects ofadvanced ligo and virgo. in particular, from the current sample of wr-bhsystems we estimate an upper limit to the detection rate of stellar bh-bhmergers of ~16 events per yr.

astro-ph;0007377	the bepposax view of the galactic center region	the galactic center region has been surveyed in 1997-1998 with the narrowfield instruments on-board the bepposax satellite (2-10kev energy range). thex-ray emission from sgra*, the putative supermassive black hole at the centerof our galaxy, has been measured and its spectrum studied, together with thex-ray emission from several bright x-ray sources, lmxbs containing neutronstars and black holes located within the region ($|l|&lt;2\deg)\times(|b|&lt;1\deg$).new point-like x-ray sources have also been discovered. the results on thediffuse emission coming from the sgra complex are summarized here: it displaysa two-temperature thermal spectrum (kt1~0.6kev and kt2~8kev) and anenergy-dependent morphology, with the hard emission (5-10 kev) elongated alongthe galactic plane and the soft one (2-5 kev) spatially correlated with theradio halo of sgraeast. the results of the study of the diffuse x-ray emissionfrom other three fields in the galactic center region containing the giantmolecular clouds sgrb2, sgrc and sgrd are reported for the first time. thediffuse emission from the direction of these three molecular clouds shows adouble temperature nature as well, with a prominent iron line at \~6.7kev, theintensity and equivalent width of which depends on the galactic longitude.moreover, the sgrb2 spectrum shows an intense 6.4kev line of fluorescentorigin. while the hard component of the galactic center diffuse emissiondisplays a similar temperature with respect to the galactic ridge, the lowtemperature plasma is significantly softer. this may be due to a netcontribution produced from the accretion of material onto old isolated neutronstars located inside the giant molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0012383	bepposax study of the broad-band properties of luminous globular cluster  x-ray sources	we have performed a detailed study of the broadband spectra of the luminousglobular cluster x-ray sources using bepposax. with the exception of x2127+119,located in ngc7078, all the other spectra are well represented by a twocomponent model consisting of a disk-blackbody and comptonized emission. themeasured low-energy absorptions are in good agreement with those predicted fromoptical measurements of the host globular clusters. this implies that there islittle intrinsic x-ray absorption within the binaries themselves, and that theabove spectral model provides a good representation of the low-energy continua.the sources can be divided into two groups. in the first group, composed of 3ultra-compact (orbital period &lt;1hr) sources, the disk-blackbody temperaturesand inner-radii appear physically realistic and the comptonization seed photonstemperatures and radii of the emission areas are consistent with the disktemperatures and inner radii. for all the other sources, the disk-blackbodyparameters appear not to be physically realistic and the comptonizationparameters are unrelated to those of the disk-blackbody emission. if this is aspectral signature of ultra-compact binaries, this implies that no otherultra-compact binaries are present among those studied here. it is unclear whythis difference between the two types of binaries should exist.

astro-ph;0101057	bepposax spectroscopy of the luminous x-ray sources in m33	the nearby galaxy m33 was observed by the imaging x-ray instruments on-boardbepposax. two observations at different phases of the 105.9 day intensity cycleof the luminous central source x-8 failed to reveal the expected modulation,suggesting that it is probably transitory. similar behavior has been observedfrom several x-ray binary sources. this strengthens somewhat the idea that m33x-8 is a black hole accreting from a binary companion. the 0.2-10 kev spectrumof m33 x-8 can best be modeled by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of1.89 +0.40 -0.79 and a disk-blackbody with a temperature, kt, of 1.10 +/0 0.05kev and a projected inner-disk radius of 55.4 +6.0 -7.7 km. this spectral shapeis in good agreement with earlier asca results. the 2-10 kev spectra of m33x-4, x-5, x-7, x-9 and x-10 are all consistent with power-law or bremsstrahlungmodels, whilst that of x-6 appears to be significantly more complex and may bereasonably well modeled with a disk-blackbody with kt = 1.7 +/- 0.2 kev and aprojected inner-disk radius of 7 +/- 2 km. the spectrum of m33 x-9 is ratherhard with a photon index of 1.3. compared to earlier einstein and rosatobservations, m33 x-7 and x-9 varied in intensity, m33 x-4, x-6, and x-10 mayhave varied and m33 x-5 remained constant.

astro-ph;9904393	the zoo of x-ray sources in the galactic center region: observations  with bepposax	we report the results of a survey of the galactic center region (|l| &lt; 2deg,|b| &lt; 0.5deg) performed with the bepposax satellite. the flux from the centerof our galaxy corresponds to a luminosity of ~3 10^{35} erg/s in the 2-10 kevrange. due to the limited angular resolution ($\gsim 1'$) only part of it issupposed to come from sagittarius a*, the non-thermal radio source which isbelieved to mark the dynamical center of the galaxy. in addition to the diffuseemission, several bright (l$_x\gsim10^{36} ergs/s) point sources have beenobserved, both persistent (a 1742-294, slx 1744-299, slx 1744-300, 1e1743.1-2843, 1e 1740.7-2942) and transient (xte j1748-288, sax j1747.0-2853 andks 1741-293). the low mass x-ray binary ax j1745.6-2901, discovered with ascaat only $1.3'$ from sgra* was detected in a low luminosity state in august1997. two fainter sources are very likely associated with young neutron stars:the (possibly diffuse) x-ray source at the center of the composite supernovaremnant g0.9+0.1, and the "head" of the axially symmetric radio sourceg359.23-0.92. the latter has been detected above 6 kev, supporting anon-thermal emission mechanism.

0810.1180	multiple flaring activity in the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j08408-4503 observed with swift	igr j08408-4503 is a supergiant fast x-ray transient discovered in 2006 witha confirmed association with a o8.5ib(f) supergiant star, hd 74194. we reporton the analysis of two outbursts caught by swift/bat on 2006 october 4 and 2008july 5, and followed up at softer energies with swift/xrt. the 2008 xrt lightcurve shows a multiple-peaked structure with an initial bright flare thatreached a flux of ~1e-9 erg/cm2/s (2-10 kev), followed by two equally brightflares within 75 ks. the spectral characteristics of the flares differdramatically, with most of the difference, as derived via time-resolvedspectroscopy, being due to absorbing column variations. we observe a gradualdecrease of the nh, derived with a fit using absorbed power law model, as timepasses. we interpret these nh variations as due to an ionization effectproduced by the first flare, resulting in a significant decrease in themeasured column density towards the source. the durations of the flares, aswell as the times of the outbursts suggest that the orbital period is ~35 days,if the flaring activity is interpreted within the framework of the sidoli et al2007 model with the outbursts triggered by the neutron star passage inside anequatorial wind inclined with respect to the orbital plane.

0810.5446	swift monitoring of supergiant fast x-ray transients: the  out-of-outburst behaviour and the flares from igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a sub-class of high mass x-raybinaries (hmxbs) associated with ob supergiant companions and displayingtransient x-ray activity. this behaviour is quite surprising since hmxbshosting supergiants were known to be persistent sources, until the integraldiscoveries obtained by means of the monitoring of the galactic plane. we havebeen performing a monitoring campaign with swift of four sfxts with the mainaim of characterizing both the long-term behaviour of these transients and theproperties during bright outbursts. here we discuss the properties of the x-rayemission observed outside the outbursts as well as the flares observed from twosfxts: igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302. contrarily to what previously thought,swift allowed us to discover that sfxts spend most of the time in accretion ata low level, even outside the bright outbursts, with an accretion luminosity of1e33-1e34 erg/s, and that the quiescent level at ~1e32 erg/s is a much rarerstate.
