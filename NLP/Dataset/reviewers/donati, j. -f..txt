0812.4605	search for the magnetic field of the o7.5 iii star xi persei	cyclical wind variability is an ubiquitous but as yet unexplained featureamong ob stars. the o7.5 iii(n)((f)) star xi persei is the brightestrepresentative of this class on the northern hemisphere. as its prominentcyclical wind properties vary on a rotational time scale (2 or 4 days) the starhas been already for a long time a serious magnetic candidate. as the cause ofthis enigmatic behavior non-radial pulsations and/or a surface magnetic fieldare suggested. we present a preliminary report on our attempts to detect amagnetic field in this star with high-resolution measurements obtained with thespectropolarimeter narval at tbl, france during 2 observing runs of 5 nights in2006 and 5 nights in 2007. only upper limits could be obtained, even with thelongest possible exposure times. if the star hosts a magnetic field, itssurface strength should be less than about 300 g. this would still be enough todisturb the stellar wind significantly. from our new data it seems that theamplitude of the known non-radial pulsations has changed within less than ayear, which needs further investigation.

0905.0914	surface magnetic fields on two accreting t tauri stars: cv cha and cr  cha	we have produced brightness and magnetic field maps of the surfaces of cv chaand cr cha: two actively accreting g and k-type t tauri stars in the chamaeleoni star-forming cloud with ages of 3-5 myr. our magnetic field maps showevidence for strong, complex multi-polar fields similar to those obtained foryoung rapidly rotating main sequence stars. brightness maps indicate thepresence of dark polar caps and low latitude spots -- these brightness maps arevery similar to those obtained for other pre-main sequence and rapidly rotatingmain sequence stars.  only two other classical t tauri stars have been studied using similartechniques so far: v2129 oph and bp tau. cv cha and cr cha show magnetic fieldpatterns that are significantly more complex than those recovered for bp tau, afully convective t tauri star.  we discuss possible reasons for this difference and suggest that thecomplexity of the stellar magnetic field is related to the convection zone;with more complex fields being found in t tauri stars with radiative cores(v2129 oph, cv cha and cr cha). however, it is clearly necessary to conductmagnetic field studies of t tauri star systems, exploring a wide range ofstellar parameters in order to establish how they affect magnetic fieldgeneration, and thus how these magnetic fields are likely to affect theevolution of t tauri star systems as they approach the main sequence.

0907.0286	the chromospheric emission of solar-type stars in the young open  clusters ic 2391 and ic 2602	in this paper we present chromospheric emission levels of the solar-typestars in the young open clusters ic 2391 and ic 2602. high resolutionspectroscopic data were obtained for over 50 f, g, and k stars from theseclusters over several observing campaigns using the university college londonechelle spectrograph on the 3.9-m anglo-australian telescope. unlike olderclusters, the majority (28/52) of the solar-type stars in the two clusters arerapid-rotators (vsini &gt; 20 km/s) with five of the stars being classified asultra-rapid rotators (vsini &gt; 100 km/s). the emission levels in the calciuminfrared triplet lines were then used as a measure of the chromosphericactivity of the stars. when plotted against rossby number (nr) the star'schromospheric emission levels show a plateau in the emission for log(nr) &lt; -1.1indicating chromospheric saturation similar to the coronal saturation seen inpreviously observed x-ray emission from the same stars. however, unlike thecoronal emission, the chromospheric emission of the stars show little evidenceof a reduction in emission (i.e. supersaturation) for the ultra-rapid rotatorsin the clusters. thus we believe that coronal supersaturation is not the resultof an overall decrease in magnetic dynamo efficiency for ultra-rapid rotators.

0907.1423	discovery of a weak magnetic field in the photosphere of the single  giant pollux	aims: we observe the nearby, weakly-active single giant, pollux, in order todirectly study and infer the nature of its magnetic field. methods: we used thenew generation spectropolarimeters espadons and narval to observe and detectcircular polarization within the photospheric absorption lines of pollux. ourobservations span 18 months from 2007-2009. we treated the spectropolarimetricdata using the least-squares deconvolution method to create highsignal-to-noise ratio mean stokes v profiles. we also measured the classicalactivity indicator s-index for the ca h&amp;k lines, and the stellar radialvelocity (rv). results: we have unambiguously detected a weak stokes v signalin the spectral lines of pollux, and measured the related surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field bl. the longitudinal field averaged over the spanof the observations is below one gauss. our data suggest variations of thelongitudinal magnetic field, but no significant variation of the s-index. weobserve variations of rv which are qualitatively consistent with the publishedephemeris for a proposed exoplanet orbiting pollux. the observed variations ofbl appear to mimic those of rv, but additional data for this relationship to beestablished. using evolutionary models including the effects of rotation, wederive the mass of pollux and we discuss its evolutionary status and the originof its magnetic field. conclusions: this work presents the first directdetection of the magnetic field of pollux, and demonstrates that espadons andnarval are capable of obtaining sub-g measurements of the surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field of giant stars, and of directly studying therelationships between magnetic activity, stellar evolution and planet hostingof these stars.

0907.5113	magnetism and binarity of the herbig ae star v380 ori	in this paper we report the results of high-resolution circularspectropolarimetric monitoring of the herbig ae star v380 ori, in which wediscovered a magnetic field in 2005. a careful study of the intensity spectrumreveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. by modelling the binaryspectrum we infer the effective temperature of both stars: $10500\pm 500$ k forthe primary, and $5500\pm500$ k for the secondary, and we argue that the highmetallicity ($[m/h] = 0.5$), required to fit the lines may imply that theprimary is a chemically peculiar star. we observe that the radial velocity ofthe secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the the primary does not.by fitting these variations we derive the orbital parameters of the system. wefind an orbital period of $104\pm5$ d, and a mass ratio ($m_{\rm p}/m_{\rm s}$)larger than 2.9. the intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong,broad and variable emission. a simple analysis of these lines reveals that adisk might surround the binary, and that a wind occurs in the environment ofthe system. finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the least-squaresdeconvolved (lsd) profiles of the stokes $v$ spectra of both stars, andadopting the oblique rotator model. from rotational modulation of the primary'sstokes $v$ signatures, we infer its rotation period $p=4.31276\pm0.00042$ d,and find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength$2.12\pm0.15$ kg, with a magnetic obliquity $\beta = 66\pm5^{\circ}$, and arotation axis inclination $i=32\pm5^{\circ}$. however, no magnetic field isdetected in the secondary, and if it hosts a dipolar magnetic field, itsstrength must be below about 500 g, to be consistent with our observations.

0909.2355	magnetic field topology in low-mass stars: spectropolarimetric  observations of m dwarfs	(abridged) we report here our mapping of the magnetic field topology of them4 dwarf g 164-31 (or gl 490b), which is expected to be fully convective, basedon time series data collected from 20 hours of observations spread over 3successive nights with the espadons spectropolarimeter. our tomographic imagingtechnique applied to time series of rotationally modulated circularly polarizedprofiles reveals an axisymmetric large-scale poloidal magnetic field on the m4dwarf. we then apply a synthetic spectrum fitting technique for measuring theaverage magnetic flux on the star. the flux measured in g 164-31 is bf =3.2+-0.4 kg, which is significantly greater than the average value of 0.68 kgdetermined from the imaging technique. the difference indicates that asignificant fraction of the stellar magnetic energy is stored in small-scalestructures at the surface of g 164-31. our h_alpha emission light curve showsevidence for rotational modulation suggesting the presence of localizedstructure in the chromosphere of this m dwarf. the radius of the m4 dwarfderived from the rotational period and the projected equatorial velocity is atleast 30% larger than that predicted from theoretical models. we argue thatthis discrepancy is likely primarily due to the young nature of g 164-31 ratherthan primarily due to magnetic field effects, indicating that age is animportant factor which should be considered in the interpretation of thisobservational result. we also report here our polarimetric observations of fiveother m dwarfs with spectral types from m0 to m4.5, three of them showingstrong zeeman signatures.

1005.1854	detection of a magnetic field on hd108: clues to extreme magnetic  braking and the of?p phenomenon	we report the detection of a magnetic field on the of?p star hd108.spectropolarimetric observations conducted in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectivelywith narval@tbl and espadons@cfht reveal a clear zeeman signature in theaverage stokes v profile, stable on timescales of days to months and slowlyincreasing in amplitude on timescales of years. we speculate that thistimescale is the same as that on which ha emission is varying and is equal tothe rotation period of the star. the corresponding longitudinal magnetic field,measured during each of the three seasons, increases slowly from 100 to 150g,implying that the polar strength of the putatively-dipolar large-scale magneticfield of hd108 is at least 0.5kg and most likely of the order of 1-2 kg. thestellar and wind properties are derived through a quantitative spectroscopicanalysis with the code cmfgen. the effective temperature is difficult toconstrain because of the unusually strong hei4471 and hei5876 lines. values inthe range 33000-37000 k are preferred. a mass loss rate of about 1e-7 msun/yr(with a clumping factor f=0.01) and a wind terminal velocity of 2000 km/s arederived. the wind confinement parameter eta_star is larger than 100, implyingthat the wind of hd108 is magnetically confined. stochastic short-termvariability is observed in the wind-sensitive lines but not in the photosphericlines, excluding the presence of pulsations. material infall in the confinedwind is the most likely origin for lines formed in the inner wind.wind-clumping also probably causes part of the ha variability. the projectedrotational velocity of hd108 is lower than 50 km/s, consistent with thespectroscopic and photometric variation timescales of a few decades. overall,hd108 is very similar to the magnetic o star hd191612 except for an even slowerrotation.

1008.1883	the magnetic fields of forming solar-like stars	magnetic fields play a crucial role at all stages of the formation of lowmass stars and planetary systems. in the final stages, in particular, theycontrol the kinematics of in-falling gas from circumstellar discs, and thelaunching and collimation of spectacular outflows. the magnetic coupling withthe disc is thought to influence the rotational evolution of the star, whilemagnetised stellar winds control the braking of more evolved stars and mayinfluence the migration of planets. magnetic reconnection events triggerenergetic flares which irradiate circumstellar discs with high energy particlesthat influence the disc chemistry and set the initial conditions for planetformation. however, it is only in the past few years that the currentgeneration of optical spectropolarimeters have allowed the magnetic fields offorming solar-like stars to be probed in unprecedented detail. in order to dojustice to the recent extensive observational programs new theoretical modelsare being developed that incorporate magnetic fields with an observed degree ofcomplexity. in this review we draw together disparate results from theclassical electromagnetism, molecular physics/chemistry, and the geophysicsliterature, and demonstrate how they can be adapted to construct models of thelarge scale magnetospheres of stars and planets. we conclude by examining howthe incorporation of multipolar magnetic fields into new theoretical modelswill drive future progress in the field through the elucidation of severalobservational conundrums.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1101.1233	understanding the angular momentum loss of low-mass stars: the case of  v374 peg	recently, surface magnetic field maps had been acquired for a small sample ofactive m dwarfs, showing that fully convective stars (spectral types ~m4 andlater) host intense (~kg), mainly axi-symmetrical poloidal fields. inparticular, the rapidly rotating m dwarf v374peg (m4), believed to lie near thetheoretical full convection threshold, presents a stable magnetic topology on atime-scale of 1 yr. the rapid rotation of v374peg (p=0.44 days) along with itsintense magnetic field point toward a magneto-centrifugally acceleration of acoronal wind. in this work, we aim at investigating the structure of thecoronal magnetic field in the m dwarf v374peg by means of three-dimensionalmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) numerical simulations of the coronal wind. for thefirst time, an observationally derived surface magnetic field map isimplemented in mhd models of stellar winds for a low-mass star. weself-consistently take into consideration the interaction of the outflowingwind with the magnetic field and vice versa. hence, from the interplay betweenmagnetic forces and wind forces, we are able to determine the configuration ofthe magnetic field and the structure of the coronal winds. our results enableus to evaluate the angular momentum loss of the rapidly rotating m dwarfv374peg.

0710.1780	magnetism and rotation in herbig ae/be stars	among the main sequence intermediate mass a and b stars, around 5% hostlarge-scale organized magnetic fields. most of these stars are very slowrotators compared to their non-magnetic counterparts, and show photosphericabundance anomalies. they are referred to as the ap/bp stars. one of thegreatest challenges, today is to understand the origin of their magnetic fieldand their slow rotation. the favoured hypothesis is a fossil origin of themagnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of ap/bp stars are relics of thosewhich existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. thisimplies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of thestellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. this isconsistent with the general belief that magnetic braking occurs during the pmsphase, which sheds angular momentum and slows the rotation of these stars. inthis context, we proceeded with a survey of a sample of around 50 pms herbigae/be stars, using the new spectropolarimeter espadons at the cfht, in order tostudy the magnetic field and the rotation velocity of these stars. this talkreviews the results of our survey, as well as their consequences for the originof the magnetic fields and the evolution of the rotation of intermediate massstars during the pms phase.

1203.6331	accretion dynamics in the classical t tauri star v2129 oph	we analyze the photometric and spectroscopic variability of the classical ttauri star v2129 oph over several rotational cycles to test the dynamicalpredictions of magnetospheric accretion models. the photometric variability andthe radial velocity variations in the photospheric lines can be explained byrotational modulation due to cold spots, while the radial velocity variationsof the he i (5876 \aa) line and the veiling variability are due to hot spotrotational modulation. the hot and cold spots are located at high latitudes andabout the same phase, but the hot spot is expected to sit at the chromosphericlevel, while the cold spot is at the photospheric level. using thedipole+octupole magnetic-field configuration previously proposed in theliterature for the system, we compute 3d mhd magnetospheric simulations of thestar-disk system. we use the simulation's density, velocity and scaledtemperature structures as input to a radiative transfer code, from which wecalculate theoretical line profiles at all rotational phases. the theoreticalprofiles tend to be narrower than the observed ones, but the qualitativebehavior and the observed rotational modulation of the h\alpha and h\betaemission lines are well reproduced by the theoretical profiles. thespectroscopic and photometric variability observed in v2129 oph support thegeneral predictions of complex magnetospheric accretion models withnon-axisymmetric, multipolar fields.

1206.5238	can we predict the global magnetic topology of a pre-main sequence star  from its position in the hertzsprung-russell diagram?	zdi studies have shown that the magnetic fields of t tauri stars can besignificantly more complex than a simple dipole and can vary markedly betweensources. we collect and summarize the magnetic field topology informationobtained to date and present hertzsprung-russell (hr) diagrams for the stars inthe sample. intriguingly, the large scale field topology of a given pre-mainsequence (pms) star is strongly dependent upon the stellar internal structure,with the strength of the dipole component of its multipolar magnetic fielddecaying rapidly with the development of a radiative core. using theobservational data as a basis, we argue that the general characteristics of theglobal magnetic field of a pms star can be determined from its position in thehr diagram. moving from hotter and more luminous to cooler and less luminousstars across the pms of the hr diagram, we present evidence for four distinctmagnetic topology regimes. stars with large radiative cores, empiricallyestimated to be those with a core mass in excess of ~40 per cent of the stellarmass, host highly complex and dominantly non-axisymmetric magnetic fields,while those with smaller radiative cores host axisymmetric fields with fieldmodes of higher order than the dipole dominant (typically, but not always, theoctupole). fully convective stars stars above ~0.5 msun appear to hostdominantly axisymmetric fields with strong (kilo-gauss) dipole components.based on similarities between the magnetic properties of pms stars and mainsequence m-dwarfs with similar internal structures, we speculate that abistable dynamo process operates for lower mass stars (&lt;~0.5 msun at an age ofa few myr) and that they will be found to host a variety of magnetic fieldtopologies. if the magnetic topology trends across the hr diagram are confirmedthey may provide a new method of constraining pms stellar evolution models.

0712.0199	magnetism in pre-ms intermediate-mass stars and the fossil field  hypothesis	today, one of the greatest challenges concerning the ap/bp stars is tounderstand the origin of their slow rotation and their magnetic fields. thefavoured hypothesis for the latter is the fossil field, which implies that themagnetic fields subsist throughout the different evolutionary phases, and inparticular during the pre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fieldsat the pre-main sequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation ofap/bp stars. however, until recently, essentially no information was availableabout the magnetic properties of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, theso-called herbig ae/be stars. the new high-resolution spectropolarimeterespadons, installed in 2005 at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, provided thecapability necessary to perform surveys of the herbig ae/be stars in order toinvestigate their magnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted inthe detection and/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars,ranging in mass from 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this contribution i willpresent the results of our survey, as well as their implications for the originand evolution of the magnetic fields and rotation.

1304.0349	influence of surface stressing on stellar coronae and winds	the large-scale field of the sun is well represented by its lowest energy (orpotential) state. recent observations, by comparison, reveal that manysolar-type stars show large-scale surface magnetic fields that are highlynon-potential - that is, they have been stressed above their lowest-energystate. this non-potential component of the surface field is neglected bycurrent stellar wind models. the aim of this paper is to determine its effecton the coronal structure and wind. we use zeeman-doppler surface magnetogramsof two stars - one with an almost potential, one with a non-potential surfacefield - to extrapolate a static model of the coronal structure for each star.we find that the stresses are carried almost exclusively in a band ofuni-directional azimuthal field that is confined to mid-latitudes. using thisstatic solution as an initial state for an mhd wind model, we then find thatthe final state is determined primarily by the potential component of thesurface magnetic field. the band of azimuthal field must be confined close tothe stellar surface as it is not compatible with a steady-state wind. byartificially increasing the stellar rotation rate we demonstrate that theobserved azimuthal fields can not be produced by the action of the wind butmust be due to processes at or below the stellar surface. we conclude that thebackground winds of solar-like stars are largely unaffected by thesehighly-stressed surface fields. nonetheless, the increased flare activity andassociated coronal mass ejections that may be expected to accompany suchhighly-stressed fields may have a significant impact on any surroundingplanets.

1306.4789	effects of m dwarf magnetic fields on potentially habitable planets	we investigate the effect of the magnetic fields of m dwarf (dm) stars onpotentially habitable earth-like planets. these fields can reduce the size ofplanetary magnetospheres to such an extent that a significant fraction of theplanet's atmosphere may be exposed to erosion by the stellar wind. we used asample of 15 active dm stars, for which surface magnetic-field maps werereconstructed, to determine the magnetic pressure at the planet orbit and hencethe largest size of its magnetosphere, which would only be decreased byconsidering the stellar wind. our method provides a fast means to assess whichplanets are most affected by the stellar magnetic field. we show thathypothetical earth-like planets with similar terrestrial magnetisation (1g)orbiting at the inner (outer) edge of the habitable zone of these stars wouldpresent magnetospheres that extend at most up to 6 (11.7) planetary radii. tobe able to sustain an earth-sized magnetosphere, with the exception of only afew cases, the terrestrial planet would either (1) need to orbit significantlyfarther out than the traditional limits of the habitable zone; or else, (2) ifit were orbiting within the habitable zone, it would require at least amagnetic field ranging from a few g to up to a few thousand g. by assuming amagnetospheric size that is more appropriate for the young-earth (3.4gyr ago),the required planetary magnetic fields are one order of magnitude weaker.however, in this case, the polar-cap area of the planet, which is unprotectedfrom transport of particles to/from interplanetary space, is twice as large. asthe star becomes older and, therefore, its rotation rate and magnetic fieldreduce, the interplanetary magnetic pressure decreases and the magnetosphere ofplanets probably expands. using an empirically derivedrotation-activity/magnetism relation,...

1310.0599	planetary protection in the extreme environments of low-mass stars	recent results showed that the magnetic field of m-dwarf (dm) stars,currently the main targets in searches for terrestrial planets, is verydifferent from the solar one, both in topology as well as in intensity. inparticular, the magnetised environment surrounding a planet orbiting in thehabitable zone (hz) of dm stars can differ substantially to the one encounteredaround the earth. these extreme magnetic fields can compress planetarymagnetospheres to such an extent that a significant fraction of the planet'satmosphere may be exposed to erosion by the stellar wind. using observedsurface magnetic maps for a sample of 15 dm stars, we investigate the minimumdegree of planetary magnetospheric compression caused by the intense stellarmagnetic fields. we show that hypothetical earth-like planets with similarterrestrial magnetisation (~1g) orbiting at the inner (outer) edge of the hz ofthese stars would present magnetospheres that extend at most up to 6.1 (11.7)planetary radii. to be able to sustain an earth-sized magnetosphere, theterrestrial planet would either need to orbit significantly farther out thanthe traditional limits of the hz; or else, if it were orbiting within thelife-bearing region, it would require a minimum magnetic field ranging from afew g to up to a few thousand g.

1310.8194	classical t tauri stars: magnetic fields, coronae, and star-disc  interactions	the magnetic fields of young stars set their coronal properties and controltheir spin evolution via the star-disc interaction and outflows. using 14magnetic maps of 10 classical t tauri stars (cttss) we investigate their closedx-ray emitting coronae, their open wind-bearing magnetic fields, and thegeometry of magnetospheric accretion flows. the magnetic fields of all thecttss are multipolar. stars with simpler (more dipolar) large-scale magneticfields have stronger fields, are slower rotators, and have larger x-rayemitting coronae compared to stars with more complex large-scale magneticfields. the field complexity controls the distribution of open and closed fieldregions across the stellar surface, and strongly influences the location andshapes of accretion hot spots. however, the higher order field components areof secondary importance in determining the total unsigned open magnetic flux,which depends mainly on the strength of the dipole component and the stellarsurface area. likewise, the dipole component alone provides an adequateapproximation of the disc truncation radius. for some stars, the pressure ofthe hot coronal plasma dominates the stellar magnetic pressure and forces openthe closed field inside the disc truncation radius. this is significant asaccretion models generally assume that the magnetic field has a closed geometryout to the inner disc edge.

0802.2213	coronal structure of the ctts v2129 oph	the nature of the magnetic coupling between t tauri stars and their disksdetermines not only the mass accretion process but possibly the spin evolutionof the central star. we have taken a recently-published surface magnetogram ofone moderately-accreting t tauri star (v2129 oph) and used it to extrapolatethe geometry of its large-scale field. we determine the structure of the open(wind-bearing) field lines, the closed (x-ray bright) field lines and thosepotentially accreting field lines that pass through the equatorial plane insidethe keplerian co-rotation radius. we consider a series of models in which thestellar magnetic field is opened up by the outward pressure of the hot coronalgas at a range of radii. as this radius is increased, accretion takes placealong simpler field structures and impacts on fewer sites at the stellarsurface. this is consistent with the observed variation in the ca ii irt andhei lines which suggests that accretion in the visible hemisphere is confinedto a single high-latitude spot. by determining the density and velocity of theaccretion flows, we find that in order to have most of the total mass accretionrate impacting on a single high-latitude region we need disk material toaccrete from approximately 7r*, close to the keplerian co-rotation radius at6.8r*. we also calculate the coronal density and x-ray emission measure. wefind that both the magnitude and rotational modulation of the emission measureincrease as the source surface is increased. for the field structure of v2129oph which is dominantly octupolar, the emission forms a bright, high-latitudering that is always in view as the star rotates. since the accretion funnelsare not dense enough to cause significant scattering of coronal x-ray photons,they provide only a low rotational modulation of around 10% at most.

1404.2733	stellar magnetism: empirical trends with age and rotation	we investigate how the observed large-scale surface magnetic fields oflow-mass stars (~0.1 -- 2 msun), reconstructed through zeeman-doppler imaging(zdi), vary with age t, rotation and x-ray emission. our sample consists of 104magnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequenceobjects (1 myr &lt; t &lt; 10 gyr). for non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find thatthe unsigned average large-scale surface field &lt;|bv|&gt; is related to age as$t^{-0.655 \pm 0.045}$. this relation has a similar dependence to thatidentified by skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology. likewise,our relation could be used as an age-dating method ("magnetochronology"). thetrends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism areconsistent with the trends found from zeeman broadening measurements (sensitiveto large- and small-scale fields). these similarities indicate that the fieldsrecovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting thatsmall- and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generationprocesses. for the accreting objects, fewer statistically significant relationsare found, with one being a correlation between the unsigned magnetic flux androtation period. we attribute this to a signature of star-disc interaction,rather than being driven by the dynamo.

0803.0532	magnetism in herbig ae/be stars and the link to the ap/bp stars	among the a/b stars, about 5% host large-scale organised magnetic fields.these magnetic stars show also abundance anomalies in their spectra, and aretherefore called the magnetic ap/bp stars. most of these stars are also slowrotators compared to the normal a and b stars. today, one of the greatestchallenges concerning the ap/bp stars is to understand the origin of their slowrotation and their magnetic fields. the favoured hypothesis for the latter isthat the fields are fosils, which implies that the magnetic fields subsistthroughout the different evolutionary phases, and in particular during thepre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fields at the pre-mainsequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation of ap/bp stars.during the last 3 years we performed a spectropolarimetric survey of the herbigae/be stars in the field and in young clusters, in order to investigate theirmagnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted in the detectionand/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars, ranging in massfrom 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this paper i will present the results ofour survey, as well as their implications for the origin and evolution of themagnetic fields and rotation of the a and b stars.

0804.1290	toroidal versus poloidal magnetic fields in sun-like stars: a rotation  threshold	from a set of stellar spectropolarimetric observations, we report thedetection of surface magnetic fields in a sample of four solar-type stars,namely hd 73350, hd 76151, hd 146233 (18 sco) and hd 190771. assuming that theobserved variability of polarimetric signal is controlled by stellar rotation,we establish the rotation periods of our targets, with values ranging from 8.8d (for hd 190771) to 22.7 d (for hd 146233). apart from rotation, fundamentalparameters of the selected objects are very close to the sun's, making thissample a practical basis to investigate the specific impact of rotation onmagnetic properties of sun-like stars.  we reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of the targets as alow-order (l&lt;10) spherical harmonics expansion of the surface magnetic field.  from the set of magnetic maps, we draw two main conclusions. (a) the magneticenergy of the large-scale field increases with rotation rate. the increase ofchromospheric emission with the mean magnetic field is flatter than observed inthe sun. since the chromospheric flux is also sensitive to magnetic elementssmaller than those contributing to the polarimetric signal, this observationsuggests that a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy is stored inlarge scales as rotation increases. (b) whereas the magnetic field is mostlypoloidal for low rotation rates, more rapid rotators host a large-scaletoroidal component in their surface field. from our observations, we infer thata rotation period lower than ~12 days is necessary for the toroidal magneticenergy to dominate over the poloidal component.

1503.00180	a maximum entropy approach to detect close-in giant planets around  active stars	(shortened for arxiv) we aim to progress towards more efficient exoplanetdetection around active stars by optimizing the use of doppler imaging inradial velocity measurements. we propose a simple method to simultaneouslyextract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographicinversion technique derived from classical doppler mapping. based on themaximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set oforbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resultingdoppler map. we carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform apreliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual dopplermap of the very active star hr 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data setfor various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit.using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peakactivity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radialvelocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planetdown to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocityscatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). onenoticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation,in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radialvelocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustlyrecovered. the present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbitalparameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when moreclassical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. it is easilyadaptable to most existing doppler imaging codes, paving the way towards asystematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.

1507.04117	activity and magnetic field structure of the sun-like planet hosting  star hd 1237	we analyse the magnetic activity characteristics of the planet hostingsun-like star, hd 1237, using harps spectro-polarimetric time-series data. wefind evidence of rotational modulation of the magnetic longitudinal fieldmeasurements consistent with our zdi analysis, with a period of 7 days. weinvestigate the effect of customising the lsd mask to the line depths of theobserved spectrum and find that it has a minimal effect on shape of theextracted stokes v profile but does result in a small increase in the s/n($\sim$ 7%). we find that using a milne-eddington solution to describe thelocal line profile provides a better fit to the lsd profiles in this slowlyrotating star, which also impacts the recovered zdi field distribution. we alsointroduce a fit-stopping criterion based on the information content (entropy)of the zdi maps solution set. the recovered magnetic field maps show a strong(+90 g) ring-like azimuthal field distribution and a complex radial fielddominating at mid latitudes ($\sim$45 degrees). similar magnetic field maps arerecovered from data acquired five months apart. future work will investigatehow this surface magnetic field distribution impacts the coronal magnetic fieldand extended environment around this planet-hosting star.

1509.08751	could a change in magnetic field geometry cause the break in the  wind-activity relation?	wood et al suggested that mass-loss rate is a function of x-ray flux($\dot{m} \propto f_x^{1.34}$) for dwarf stars with $f_x \lesssim f_{x,6}\equiv 10^6$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. however, more active stars do not obeythis relation. these authors suggested that the break at $f_{x,6}$ could becaused by significant changes in magnetic field topology that would inhibitstellar wind generation. here, we investigate this hypothesis by analysing thestars in wood et al's sample that had their surface magnetic fieldsreconstructed through zeeman-doppler imaging (zdi). although the solar-likeoutliers in the $\dot{m}$ -- $f_x$ relation have higher fractional toroidalmagnetic energy, we do not find evidence of a sharp transition in magnetictopology at $f_{x,6}$. to confirm this, further wind measurements and zdiobservations at both sides of the break are required. as active stars can jumpbetween states with highly toroidal to highly poloidal fields, we expectsignificant scatter in magnetic field topology to exist for stars with $f_x\gtrsim f_{x,6}$. this strengthens the importance of multi-epoch zdiobservations. finally, we show that there is a correlation between $f_x$ andmagnetic energy, which implies that $\dot{m}$ -- magnetic energy relation hasthe same qualitative behaviour as the original $\dot{m}$ -- $f_x$ relation. nobreak is seen in any of the $f_x$ -- magnetic energy

0807.0758	the non-dipolar magnetic fields of accreting t tauri stars	models of magnetospheric accretion on to classical t tauri stars often assumethat stellar magnetic fields are simple dipoles. recently published surfacemagnetograms of bp tau and v2129 oph have shown, however, that their fields aremore complex. the magnetic field of v2129 oph was found to be predominantlyoctupolar. for bp tau the magnetic energy was shared mainly between the dipoleand octupole field components, with the dipole component being almost fourtimes as strong as that of v2129 oph. from the published surface maps of thephotospheric magnetic fields we extrapolate the coronal fields of both stars,and compare the resulting field structures with that of a dipole. we considerdifferent models where the disc is truncated at, or well-within, the kepleriancorotation radius. we find that although the structure of the surface magneticfield is particularly complex for both stars, the geometry of the larger scalefield, along which accretion is occurring, is somewhat simpler. however, thelarger scale field is distorted close to the star by the stronger fieldregions, with the net effect being that the fractional open flux through thestellar surface is less than would be expected with a dipole magnetic fieldmodel. finally, we estimate the disc truncation radius, assuming that thisoccurs where the magnetic torque from the stellar magnetosphere is comparableto the viscous torque in the disc.

astro-ph;0110602	modelling surface magnetic field evolution on ab doradus due to  diffusion and surface differential rotation	from zeeman doppler images of the young, rapidly-rotating k0 dwarf abdoradus, we have created a potential approximation to the observed radialmagnetic field and have evolved it over 30 days due to the observed surfacedifferential rotation, meridional flow and various diffusion rates. assumingthat the dark polar cap seen in doppler images of this star is caused by thepresence of a unipolar field, we have shown that the observed differentialrotation will shear this field to produce the observed high-latitude band ofunidirectional azimuthal field. by cross-correlating the evolved fields eachday with the initial field we have followed the decay with time of thecross-correlation function. over 30 days it decays by only 10 percent. thiscontrasts with the results of barnes et al (1998), who show that on thistimescale the spot distribution of he699 is uncorrelated. we propose that thisis due to the effects of flux emergence changing the spot distributions.

astro-ph;0111050	stellar differential rotation from direct starspot tracking	on the sun, the rotation periods of individual sunspots not only trace thelatitude dependence of the surface rotation rate, but also provide clues as tothe amount of subsurface fluid shear. in this paper we present the firstmeasurements of stellar differential rotation made by tracking the rotation ofindividual starspots with sizes comparable to the largest sunspots. to achievethis we re-analyse four sequences of densely-sampled, high signal-to-noiseechelle spectra of ab doradus spanning several stellar rotations in 1996december. using spectral subtraction, least-squares deconvolution andmatched-filter analysis, we demonstrate that it is possible to measure directlythe velocity amplitudes and rotation periods of large numbers of individualstarspots at low to intermediate latitude. we derive values for the equatorialrotation rate and the magnitude of the surface differential rotation, both ofwhich are in excellent agreement with those obtained by donati &amp; colliercameron (1997) from cross-correlation of doppler images derived a year earlierin 1995 december, and with a re-analysis of the 1996 data by the method ofdonati et al (2000). the differences between the rotation rates of individualspots and the fitted differential rotation law are substantially greater thanthe observational errors. the smaller spots show a greater scatter about themean relation than the larger ones, which suggests that buffeting by turbulentsupergranular flows could be responsible.

astro-ph;0207522	inferring x-ray coronal structures from zeeman-doppler images	we have modelled the x-ray emission from the young rapid rotator ab doradus(p = 0.514 days) using as a basis zeeman-doppler maps of the surface magneticfield. this allows us to reconcile the apparently conflicting observations of ahigh x-ray emission measure and coronal density with a low rotationalmodulation in x-rays. the technique is to extrapolate the coronal field fromthe surface maps by assuming the field to be potential. we then determine thecoronal density for an isothermal corona by solving hydrostatic equilibriumalong each field line and scaling the plasma pressure at the loop footpointswith the magnetic pressure. we set the density to zero along those field linesthat are open and those where at any point along their length the plasmapressure exceeds the magnetic pressure. we then calculate the optically thinx-ray emission measure and rotational modulation for models with a range ofcoronal densities. although the corona can be very extended, much of theemission comes from high-latitude regions close to the stellar surface. sincethese are always in view as the star rotates, there is little rotationalmodulation. we find that emission measures in the observed range of 10^52.8 -10^53.3 per cubic centimetre can be reproduced with densities in the range 10^9- 10^10.7 per cubic centimetre for coronae at temperatures of 10^6-10^7 k.

astro-ph;0307210	polar fields for ab dor	polar spots are often observed on rapidly-rotating cool stars, but the natureof the magnetic field in these spots is as yet unknown. while zeeman-dopplerimaging can provide surface magnetic field maps over much of the observedstellar surface, the zeeman signature is suppressed in the dark polar regions.we have determined the effect on the global coronal structure of three currentmodels for this polar field: that it is composed (a) of unipolar field, (b) ofbipolar regions or (c) of nested rings of opposite polarity. we take as anexample the young, rapid rotator ab dor (rotation period = 0.514 days). byadding these model polar fields into the surface field maps determined fromzeeman-doppler imaging, we have compared the resulting coronal structure withthe observable properties of the corona - the magnitude and rotationalmodulation of the x-ray emission measure and the presence of slingshotprominences trapped in the corona around the keplerian co-rotation radius. wefind that only the presence of a unipolar spot has any significant effect onthe overall coronal structure, forcing much of the polar field to be open.

astro-ph;0307448	temporal fluctuations in the differential rotation of cool active stars	this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation ontwo rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs, by using stellar surfacefeatures (both cool spots and magnetic regions) as tracers of the large scalelatitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars.we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is differentwhen estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions, and that it undergoestemporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a fewyears. we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processesoperating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone ratherthan being confined at its base as in the sun. by comparing our observationswith two very simple models of the differential rotation within the convectivezone, we obtain evidence that the internal rotation velocity field of the starswe investigated is not like that of the sun, and may resemble that we expectfor rapid rotators. we speculate that the changes in differential rotationresult from the dynamo processes (and from the underlying magnetic cycle) thatperiodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa. weemphasise that the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the firstpractical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity fieldwithin convective zones of cool active stars, and offers several advantagesover asteroseismology for this particular purpose and this specific stellarclass.

(2003) at the anglo-australian telescope. weconclude that the small-scale brightness and magnetic patterns undergo majorchanges within a timescale of 4 to 6 weeks, while the largest structures remainstable over several years. we report the detection of a weak surfacedifferential rotation (both from brightness and magnetic tracers) indicatingthat the equator rotates faster than the pole with a difference in rotationrate between the pole and the equator about 4 times smaller than that of thesun. this result suggests that tidal forces also impact the global dynamicequilibrium of convective zones in cool active stars.

astro-ph;0610758	the magnetic field of the planet-hosting star $\tau$ bootis	we have obtained high resolution spectropolarimetric data for theplanet-hosting star $\tau$ bootis, using the espadons spectropolarimeter atcfht. a weak but clear stokes $v$ signature is detected on three of the fournights of june 2006 during which we have recorded data. this polarimetricsignature indicates with no ambiguity the presence of a magnetic field at thestar's surface, with intensity of just a few gauss.  the analysis of the photospheric lines of $\tau$ boo at ultra-highsignal-to-noise reveals the presence of an 18% relative differential rotation.tentative zeeman-doppler imaging, using our spectropolarimetric observationscovering only a fraction of the star's rotational phase, indicates a magneticfield with a dominant potential field component. the data are best fitted whena 3.1d period of modulation and an intermediate inclination are assumed.considering the level of differential rotation of $\tau$ boo, this implies arotation period of 3.0d at the equator and of 3.7d at the pole, and a topologyof the magnetic field where its main non-axisymmetric part is located at lowlatitudes.  the planet is probably synchronised with the star's rotation at intermediatelatitudes, while the non-axisymmetric part of the magnetic field seems locatedat lower latitudes. our limited data do not provide sufficient constraints onthe magnetic field to study a possible interaction of the planet with thestar's magnetosphere. investigating this issue will require data with muchbetter phase coverage. similar studies should also be performed for other starshosting close-in giant planets.

0809.2039	magnetic fields and chemical peculiarities of the very young  intermediate-mass binary system hd 72106	the recently discovered magnetic herbig ae and be stars may providequalitatively new information about the formation and evolution of magnetic apand bp stars. we have performed a detailed investigation of one particularlyinteresting binary system with a herbig ae secondary and a late b-type primarypossessing a strong, globally ordered magnetic field. twenty high-resolutionstokes v spectra of the system were obtained with the espadons instrumentmounted on the cfht. in these observations we see clear evidence for a magneticfield in the primary, but no evidence for a magnetic field in the secondary. adetailed abundance analysis was performed for both stars, revealing strongchemical peculiarities in the primary and normal chemical abundances in thesecondary. the primary is strongly overabundant in si, cr, and other iron-peakelements, as well as nd, and underabundant in he. the primary therefore appearsto be a very young bp star. in this context, line profile variations of theprimary suggest non-uniform lateral distributions of surface abundances.interpreting the 0.63995 +/- 0.00009 day variation period of the stokes i and vprofiles as the rotational period of the star, we have modeled the magneticfield geometry and the surface abundance distributions of si, ti, cr and feusing magnetic doppler imaging. we derive a dipolar geometry of the surfacemagnetic field, with a polar strength of 1230 g and an obliquity of 57 degrees.the distributions ti, cr and fe are all qualitatively similar, with anelongated patch of enhanced abundance situated near the positive magnetic pole.the si distribution is somewhat different, and its relationship to the magneticfield geometry less clear.

astro-ph;0703619	the coronal structure of ab dor determined from contemporaneous doppler  imaging and x-ray spectroscopy	we obtain contemporaneous observations of the surface and corona of ab dorusing ground-based circularly polarised spectra from the anglo-australiantelescope and x-ray data from the chandra satellite. the ground-based data areused to construct surface magnetic field maps, which are extrapolated toproduce detailed models of the quiescent corona. the x-ray data serve as a newtest for the validity of these coronal models.  the high coronal density and complex multi-polar magnetic field indicate acompact x-ray corona, which is concentrated close to the surface, with aheight, h~0.3-0.4r*. there is also significant correlation between the surfaceand coronal active region locations. at this epoch ab dor appears to possessone very large active longitude region; displaying enhanced activity in theform of large dark spots, strong magnetic fields and chromospheric emission.  finally, the level of rotational modulation and shape of the x-ray lightcurvedepend on the distribution of magnetic field in the obscured hemisphere. themodels that best reproduce the rotational modulation observed in thecontemporaneous chandra x-ray lightcurve and spectra require the magnetic fieldin the obscured hemisphere to be of the same polarity as that in the observedhemisphere. the sun shows different behaviour, with the leading polarityreversed in the opposite hemisphere. the x-ray observations provide a uniqueconstraint on the magnetic structure in the obscured hemisphere.

astro-ph;9805069	linear spectropolarimetry of ap stars: a new degree of constraint on  magnetic structure	we present preliminary results from a programme aimed at acquiring linearspectropolarimetry of magnetic a and b stars. linear polarization in thespectral lines of these objects is due to the zeeman effect, and should providedetailed new information regarding the structure of their strong magneticfields. to illustrate the impact of these new data, we compare observedcircular and linear polarization line profiles of 53 cam with the profilespredicted by the magnetic model by landstreet (1988).  linear polarization in the spectral lines of all stars studied is extremelyweak; in most cases, below the threshold of detectability even for very highsnrs. in order to overcome this problem, we employ the least-squaresdeconvolution (lsd) multi-line analysis technique in order to extract low-noisemean line profiles and polarization signatures from our echelle spectra. testsshow that these mean signatures can be modelled as real spectral lines, andhave the potential to lead to high-resolution maps of the magnetic and chemicalabundance surface distributions.
