0903.1247	first evidence of a magnetic field on vega. towards a new class of  magnetic a-type stars	we report the detection of a magnetic field on vega throughspectropolarimetric observations. we acquired 257 stokes v, highsignal-to-noise and high-resolution echelle spectra during four consecutivenights with the narval spectropolarimeter at the 2-m telescope bernard lyot ofobservatoire du pic du midi (france). a circularly polarized signal in lineprofiles is unambiguously detected after combining the contribution of about1200 spectral lines for each spectrum and summing the signal over the 257spectra. due to the low amplitude of the polarized signal, various tests havebeen performed to discard the possibility of a spurious polarized signal. theyall point towards a stellar origin of the polarized signal. interpreting thispolarization as a zeeman signature leads to a value of $-0.6 \pm 0.3$ g for thedisk-averaged line-of-sight component of the surface magnetic field. this isthe first strong evidence of a magnetic field in an a-type star which is not anap chemically peculiar star. moreover, this longitudinal magnetic field issmaller by about two orders of magnitude than the longitudinal magnetic field(taken at its maximum phase) of the most weakly magnetic ap stars. magneticfields similar to the vega magnetic field could be present but still undetectedin many other a-type stars.

0907.1423	discovery of a weak magnetic field in the photosphere of the single  giant pollux	aims: we observe the nearby, weakly-active single giant, pollux, in order todirectly study and infer the nature of its magnetic field. methods: we used thenew generation spectropolarimeters espadons and narval to observe and detectcircular polarization within the photospheric absorption lines of pollux. ourobservations span 18 months from 2007-2009. we treated the spectropolarimetricdata using the least-squares deconvolution method to create highsignal-to-noise ratio mean stokes v profiles. we also measured the classicalactivity indicator s-index for the ca h&amp;k lines, and the stellar radialvelocity (rv). results: we have unambiguously detected a weak stokes v signalin the spectral lines of pollux, and measured the related surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field bl. the longitudinal field averaged over the spanof the observations is below one gauss. our data suggest variations of thelongitudinal magnetic field, but no significant variation of the s-index. weobserve variations of rv which are qualitatively consistent with the publishedephemeris for a proposed exoplanet orbiting pollux. the observed variations ofbl appear to mimic those of rv, but additional data for this relationship to beestablished. using evolutionary models including the effects of rotation, wederive the mass of pollux and we discuss its evolutionary status and the originof its magnetic field. conclusions: this work presents the first directdetection of the magnetic field of pollux, and demonstrates that espadons andnarval are capable of obtaining sub-g measurements of the surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field of giant stars, and of directly studying therelationships between magnetic activity, stellar evolution and planet hostingof these stars.

1001.1003	spectropolarimetric multi line analysis of stellar magnetic fields	in this paper we study the feasibility of inferring the magnetic field frompolarized multi-line spectra using two methods: the pseudo line approach andthe pca-zdi approach. we use multi-line techniques, meaning that all the linesof a stellar spectrum contribute to obtain a polarization signature. the use ofmultiple lines dramatically increases the signal to noise ratio of thesepolarizations signatures. using one technique, the pseudo-line approach, weconstruct the pseudo-line as the mean profile of all the individual lines. theother technique, the pca-zdi approach proposed recently by semel et al. (2006)for the detection of polarized signals, combines principle components analysis(pca) and the zeeman do ppler imaging technique (zdi). this new method has amain advantage: the polarized signature is extracted using cross correlationsbetween the stellar spectra nd functions containing the polarization propertiesof each line. these functions are the principal components of a database ofsynthetic spectra. the synthesis of the spectra of the database are obtainedusing the radiative transfer equations in lte. the profiles built with thepca-zdi technique are denominated multi-zeeman-signatures. the construction ofthe pseudo line as well as the multi-zeeman-signatures is a powerful tool inthe study of stellar and solar magnetic fields. the information of the physicalparameters that governs the line formation is contained in the final polarizedprofiles. in particular, using inversion codes, we have shown that the magneticfield vector can be properly inferred with both approaches despite the magneticfield regime.

1005.5552	large-scale magnetic topologies of late m dwarfs	we present here the final results of the first spectropolarimetric survey ofa small sample of active m dwarfs, aimed at providing observational constraintson dynamo action on both sides of the full-convection threshold (spectral typem4). our two previous studies (donati et al. 2008b; morin et al. 2008b) werefocused on early and mid m dwarfs. the present paper examines 11 fullyconvective late m dwarfs (spectral types m5-m8). tomographic imaging techniqueswere applied to time-series of circularly polarised profiles of 6 stars, inorder to infer their large-scale magnetic topologies. for 3 other stars wecould not produce such magnetic maps, because of low variability of the stokesv signatures, but were able to derive some properties of the magnetic fields.we find 2 distinct categories of magnetic topologies: on the one hand strongaxisymmetric dipolar fields (similar to mid m dwarfs), and on the other handweak fields generally featuring a significant non-axisymmetric component, andsometimes a significant toroidal one. comparison with unsigned magnetic fluxesdemonstrates that the second category of magnetic fields shows lessorganization (less energy in the large scales), similarly to partly convectiveearly m dwarfs. stars in both categories have similar stellar parameters, ourdata do not evidence a separation between these 2 categories in themass-rotation plane. we also report marginal detection of a large-scalemagnetic field on the m8 star vb 10 featuring a significant toroidalaxisymmetric component, whereas no field is detectable on vb 8 (m7).

1006.5868	the rapid rotation and complex magnetic field geometry of vega	the recent discovery of a weak surface magnetic field on the normalintermediate-mass star vega raises the question of the origin of this magnetismin a class of stars that was not known to host magnetic fields. we aim toconfirm the field detection and provide additional observational constraintsabout the field characteristics, by modelling the magnetic geometry of the starand by investigating the seasonal variability of the reconstructed field. weanalyse a total of 799 circularly-polarized spectra collected with the narvaland espadons spectropolarimeters during 2008 and 2009. we employ across-correlation procedure to compute, from each spectrum, a mean polarizedline profile with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20,000. the technique ofzeeman-doppler imaging is then used to determine the rotation period of thestar and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of vega at two differentepochs. we confirm the detection of circularly polarized signatures in the meanline profiles. the amplitude of the signatures is larger when spectral lines ofhigher magnetic sensitivity are selected for the analysis, as expected for asignal of magnetic origin. the short-term evolution of polarized signatures isconsistent with a rotational period of 0.732 \pm 0.008 d. the reconstructedmagnetic topology unveils a magnetic region of radial field orientation,closely concentrated around the rotation pole. this polar feature isaccompanied by a small number of magnetic patches at lower latitudes. nosignificant variability in the field structure is observed over a time span ofone year. the repeated observation of a weak photospheric magnetic field onvega suggests that a previously unknown type of magnetic stars exists in theintermediate-mass domain. vega may well be the first confirmed member of a muchlarger, as yet unexplored, class of weakly-magnetic stars.

1009.2589	exploring the magnetic topologies of cool stars	magnetic fields of cool stars can be directly investigated through the studyof the zeeman effect on photospheric spectral lines using several approaches.with spectroscopic measurement in unpolarised light, the total magnetic fluxaveraged over the stellar disc can be derived but very little information onthe field geometry is available. spectropolarimetry provides a complementaryinformation on the large-scale component of the magnetic topology. withzeeman-doppler imaging (zdi), this information can be retrieved to produce amap of the vector magnetic field at the surface of the star, and in particularto assess the relative importance of the poloidal and toroidal components aswell as the degree of axisymmetry of the field distribution. the development ofhigh-performance spectropolarimeters associated with multi-lines techniques andzdi allows us to explore magnetic topologies throughout the hertzsprung-russeldiagram, on stars spanning a wide range of mass, age and rotation period. theseobservations bring novel constraints on magnetic field generation by dynamoeffect in cool stars. in particular, the study of solar twins brings newinsight on the impact of rotation on the solar dynamo, whereas the detection ofstrong and stable dipolar magnetic fields on fully convective stars questionsthe precise role of the tachocline in this process.

1106.5363	detection of a weak surface magnetic field on sirius a: are all tepid  stars magnetic ?	we aim at a highly sensitive search for weak magnetic fields in main sequencestars of intermediate mass, by scanning classes of stars with no previouslyreported magnetic members. after detecting a weak magnetic field on the normal,rapidly rotating a-type star vega, we concentrate here on the bright starsirius a, taken as a prototypical, chemically peculiar, moderately rotating amstar. we employed the narval and espadons high-resolution spectropolarimetersto collect 442 circularly polarized spectra, complemented by 60 linearlypolarized spectra. using a list of about 1,100 photospheric spectral lines, wecomputed a cross correlation line profile from every spectrum, leading to asignal-to-noise ratio of up to 30,000 in the polarized profile. we report therepeated detection of circularly polarized, highly asymmetric signatures in theline profiles, interpreted as zeeman signatures of a large-scale photosphericmagnetic field, with a line-of-sight component equal to $0.2 \pm 0.1$ g. thisis the first polarimetric detection of a surface magnetic field on an am star.using rough estimates of the physical properties of the upper layers of siriusa, we suggest that a dynamo operating in the shallow convective envelope cannotaccount for the field strength reported here. together with the magnetic fieldof vega, this result confirms that a new class of magnetic objects exists amongnon ap/bp intermediate-mass stars, and it may indicate that a significantfraction of tepid stars are magnetic.

0710.1780	magnetism and rotation in herbig ae/be stars	among the main sequence intermediate mass a and b stars, around 5% hostlarge-scale organized magnetic fields. most of these stars are very slowrotators compared to their non-magnetic counterparts, and show photosphericabundance anomalies. they are referred to as the ap/bp stars. one of thegreatest challenges, today is to understand the origin of their magnetic fieldand their slow rotation. the favoured hypothesis is a fossil origin of themagnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of ap/bp stars are relics of thosewhich existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. thisimplies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of thestellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. this isconsistent with the general belief that magnetic braking occurs during the pmsphase, which sheds angular momentum and slows the rotation of these stars. inthis context, we proceeded with a survey of a sample of around 50 pms herbigae/be stars, using the new spectropolarimeter espadons at the cfht, in order tostudy the magnetic field and the rotation velocity of these stars. this talkreviews the results of our survey, as well as their consequences for the originof the magnetic fields and the evolution of the rotation of intermediate massstars during the pms phase.

0712.0199	magnetism in pre-ms intermediate-mass stars and the fossil field  hypothesis	today, one of the greatest challenges concerning the ap/bp stars is tounderstand the origin of their slow rotation and their magnetic fields. thefavoured hypothesis for the latter is the fossil field, which implies that themagnetic fields subsist throughout the different evolutionary phases, and inparticular during the pre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fieldsat the pre-main sequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation ofap/bp stars. however, until recently, essentially no information was availableabout the magnetic properties of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, theso-called herbig ae/be stars. the new high-resolution spectropolarimeterespadons, installed in 2005 at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, provided thecapability necessary to perform surveys of the herbig ae/be stars in order toinvestigate their magnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted inthe detection and/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars,ranging in mass from 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this contribution i willpresent the results of our survey, as well as their implications for the originand evolution of the magnetic fields and rotation.

1310.4379	search for surface magnetic fields in mira stars. first detection in chi  cyg	in order to complete the knowledge of the magnetic field and of its influenceduring the transition from asymptotic giant branch to planetary nebulae stages,we have undertaken a search for magnetic fields at the surface of mira stars.we used spectropolarimetric observations, collected with the narval instrumentat tbl, in order to detect - with least squares deconvolution method - a zeemansignature in the visible part of the spectrum. we present the firstspectropolarimetric observations of the s-type mira star chi cyg, performedaround its maximum light. we have detected a polarimetric signal in the stokesv spectra and we have established its zeeman origin. we claim that it is likelyto be related to a weak magnetic field present at the photospheric level and inthe lower part of the stellar atmosphere. we have estimated the strength of itslongitudinal component to about 2-3 gauss. this result favors a 1/r law for thevariation of the magnetic field strength across the circumstellar envelope ofchi cyg. this is the first detection of a weak magnetic field at the stellarsurface of a mira star and we discuss its origin in the framework of shockwaves periodically propagating throughout the atmosphere of these radiallypulsating stars. at the date of our observations of chi cyg, the shock wavereaches its maximum intensity, and it is likely that the shock amplifies a weakstellar magnetic field during its passage through the atmosphere. without suchan amplification by the shock, the magnetic field strength would have been toolow to be detected. for the first time, we also report strong stokes q and usignatures (linear polarization) centered onto the zero velocity (i.e., at theshock front position). they seem to indicate that the radial direction would befavored by the shock during its propagation throughout the atmosphere.

(1998). the stars appear tobe in the mass range 1-4 m_sun, situated at different evolutionary stages afterthe main sequence (ms), up to the asymptotic giant branch (agb). the samplecontains 45 stars. up to now, 29 stars are observed (that is about 64 % of thesample), each observed at least twice. for 2 stars in the hertzsprung gap, oneis definitely zeeman detected. only 5 g and k giants, situated mainly at thebase of the red giant branch (rgb) and in the he-burning phase are detected.surprisingly, a lot of stars ascending towards the rgb tip and in early agbphase are detected (8 of 13 observed stars). for all zeeman detected stars vsin i is redetermined and appears in the interval 2-3 km/s, but few giants withmf possess larger v sin i.

1311.3374	a bcool magnetic snapshot survey of solar-type stars	stellar magnetic field measurements obtained from spectropolarimetry offerkey data for activity and dynamo studies, and we present the results of a majorhigh-resolution spectropolarimetric bcool project magnetic snapshot survey of170 solar-type stars from observations with the telescope bernard lyot and thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. for each target star a high signal-to-noisecircularly polarised stokes v profile has been obtained using least-squaresdeconvolution, and used to detect surface magnetic fields and measure thecorresponding mean surface longitudinal magnetic field ($b_{l}$). chromosphericactivity indicators were also measured.  surface magnetic fields were detected for 67 stars, with 21 of these starsclassified as mature solar-type stars, a result that increases by a factor offour the number of mature solar-type stars on which magnetic fields have beenobserved. in addition, a magnetic field was detected for 3 out of 18 of thesubgiant stars surveyed. for the population of k-dwarfs the mean value of$b_{l}$ ($|b_{l}|_{mean}$) was also found to be higher (5.7 g) than$|b_{l}|_{mean}$ measured for the g-dwarfs (3.2 g) and the f-dwarfs (3.3 g).for the sample as a whole $|b_{l}|_{mean}$ increases with rotation rate anddecreases with age, and the upper envelope for $|b_{l}|$ correlates well withthe observed chromospheric emission. stars with a chromospheric s-index greaterthan about 0.2 show a high magnetic field detection rate and so offer optimaltargets for future studies.  this survey constitutes the most extensive spectropolarimetric survey of coolstars undertaken to date, and suggests that it is feasible to pursue magneticmapping of a wide range of moderately active solar-type stars to improveunderstanding of their surface fields and dynamos.

0802.2052	magnetospheric accretion on the t tauri star bp tauri	from observations collected with the espadons and narval spectropolarimeters,we report the detection of zeeman signatures on the classical t tauri star bptau. circular polarisation signatures in photospheric lines and in narrowemission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion are monitored throughout mostof the rotation cycle of bp tau at two different epochs in 2006. we observethat rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of bothunpolarised and circularly polarised spectral proxies tracing the photosphereand the footpoints of accretion funnels.  from the complete data sets at each epoch, we reconstruct the large-scalemagnetic topology and the location of accretion spots at the surface of bp tauusing tomographic imaging. we find that the field of bp tau involves a 1.2 kgdipole and 1.6 kg octupole, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotationaxis. accretion spots coincide with the two main magnetic poles at highlatitudes and overlap with dark photospheric spots; they cover about 2% of thestellar surface. the strong mainly-axisymmetric poloidal field of bp tau isvery reminiscent of magnetic topologies of fully-convective dwarfs. it suggeststhat magnetic fields of fully-convective cttss such as bp tau are likely notfossil remants, but rather result from vigorous dynamo action operating withinthe bulk of their convective zones.  preliminary modelling suggests that the magnetosphere of bp tau extends todistances of at least 4 r* to ensure that accretion spots are located at highlatitudes, and is not blown open close to the surface by a putative stellarwind. it apparently succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out asthe corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of bp tau.

1402.5362	the dichotomy between strong and ultra-weak magnetic fields among  intermediate-mass stars	until recently, the detection of magnetic fields at the surface ofintermediate-mass main-sequence stars has been limited to ap/bp stars, a classof chemically peculiar stars. this class represents no more than 5-10% of thestars in this mass range. this small fraction is not explained by the fossilfield paradigm that describes the ap/bp type magnetism as a remnant of an earlyphase of the star-life. also, the limitation of the field measurements to asmall and special group of stars is obviously a problem to study the effect ofthe magnetic fields on the stellar evolution of a typical intermediate-massstar.  thanks to the improved sensitivity of a new generation ofspectropolarimeters, a lower bound to the magnetic fields of ap/bp stars, a twoorders of magnitude desert in the longitudinal magnetic field and a new type ofsub-gauss magnetism first discovered on vega have been identified. theseadvances provide new clues to understand the origin of intermediate-massmagnetism as well as its influence on stellar evolution. in particular, ascenario has been proposed whereby the magnetic dichotomy between ap/bp andvega-like magnetism originate from the bifurcation between stable and unstablelarge scale magnetic configurations in differentially rotating stars. in thispaper, we review these recent observational findings and discuss this scenario.

1404.2733	stellar magnetism: empirical trends with age and rotation	we investigate how the observed large-scale surface magnetic fields oflow-mass stars (~0.1 -- 2 msun), reconstructed through zeeman-doppler imaging(zdi), vary with age t, rotation and x-ray emission. our sample consists of 104magnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequenceobjects (1 myr &lt; t &lt; 10 gyr). for non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find thatthe unsigned average large-scale surface field &lt;|bv|&gt; is related to age as$t^{-0.655 \pm 0.045}$. this relation has a similar dependence to thatidentified by skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology. likewise,our relation could be used as an age-dating method ("magnetochronology"). thetrends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism areconsistent with the trends found from zeeman broadening measurements (sensitiveto large- and small-scale fields). these similarities indicate that the fieldsrecovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting thatsmall- and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generationprocesses. for the accreting objects, fewer statistically significant relationsare found, with one being a correlation between the unsigned magnetic flux androtation period. we attribute this to a signature of star-disc interaction,rather than being driven by the dynamo.

0803.0532	magnetism in herbig ae/be stars and the link to the ap/bp stars	among the a/b stars, about 5% host large-scale organised magnetic fields.these magnetic stars show also abundance anomalies in their spectra, and aretherefore called the magnetic ap/bp stars. most of these stars are also slowrotators compared to the normal a and b stars. today, one of the greatestchallenges concerning the ap/bp stars is to understand the origin of their slowrotation and their magnetic fields. the favoured hypothesis for the latter isthat the fields are fosils, which implies that the magnetic fields subsistthroughout the different evolutionary phases, and in particular during thepre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fields at the pre-mainsequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation of ap/bp stars.during the last 3 years we performed a spectropolarimetric survey of the herbigae/be stars in the field and in young clusters, in order to investigate theirmagnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted in the detectionand/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars, ranging in massfrom 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this paper i will present the results ofour survey, as well as their implications for the origin and evolution of themagnetic fields and rotation of the a and b stars.

1407.3991	a search for weak or complex magnetic fields in the the b3v star iota  herculis	we obtained 128 high signal-to-noise ratio stokes $v$ spectra of the b3v star$\iota$~her on 5 consecutive nights in 2012 with the espadonsspectropolarimeter at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, with the aim ofsearching for the presence of weak and/or complex magnetic fields.least-squares deconvolution mean profiles were computed from individualspectra, averaged over individual nights and over the entire run. no zeemansignatures are detected in any of the profiles. the longitudinal magnetic fieldin the grand average profile was measured to be $-0.24 \pm 0.32 $ g, ascompared to $-0.22 \pm 0.32$ g in the null profile. our observations thereforeprovide no evidence for the presence of zeeman signatures analogous to thoseobserved in the a0v star vega by lignieres et al. (2009). we interpret theseobservations in three ways. first, we compare the lsd profiles with syntheticstokes $v$ profiles corresponding to organised (dipolar) magnetic fields, forwhich we find an upper limit of about 8~g on the polar strength of any surfacedipole present. secondly, we compare the grand average profile withcalculations corresponding to the random magnetic spot topologies of kochukhov&amp; sudnik (2013), inferring that spots, if present, of 2 degrees radius withstrengths of 2-4 g and a filling factor of 50% should have been detected in ourdata. finally, we compare the observations with synthetic $v$ profilescorresponding to the surface magnetic maps of vega (petit et al. 2010) computedfor the spectral characteristics of $\iota$ her. we conclude that while it isunlikely we would have detected a magnetic field identical to vega's, we wouldhave likely detected one with a peak strength of about 30 g, i.e. approximatelyfour times as strong as that of vega.

0804.1290	toroidal versus poloidal magnetic fields in sun-like stars: a rotation  threshold	from a set of stellar spectropolarimetric observations, we report thedetection of surface magnetic fields in a sample of four solar-type stars,namely hd 73350, hd 76151, hd 146233 (18 sco) and hd 190771. assuming that theobserved variability of polarimetric signal is controlled by stellar rotation,we establish the rotation periods of our targets, with values ranging from 8.8d (for hd 190771) to 22.7 d (for hd 146233). apart from rotation, fundamentalparameters of the selected objects are very close to the sun's, making thissample a practical basis to investigate the specific impact of rotation onmagnetic properties of sun-like stars.  we reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of the targets as alow-order (l&lt;10) spherical harmonics expansion of the surface magnetic field.  from the set of magnetic maps, we draw two main conclusions. (a) the magneticenergy of the large-scale field increases with rotation rate. the increase ofchromospheric emission with the mean magnetic field is flatter than observed inthe sun. since the chromospheric flux is also sensitive to magnetic elementssmaller than those contributing to the polarimetric signal, this observationsuggests that a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy is stored inlarge scales as rotation increases. (b) whereas the magnetic field is mostlypoloidal for low rotation rates, more rapid rotators host a large-scaletoroidal component in their surface field. from our observations, we infer thata rotation period lower than ~12 days is necessary for the toroidal magneticenergy to dominate over the poloidal component.

1503.00180	a maximum entropy approach to detect close-in giant planets around  active stars	(shortened for arxiv) we aim to progress towards more efficient exoplanetdetection around active stars by optimizing the use of doppler imaging inradial velocity measurements. we propose a simple method to simultaneouslyextract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographicinversion technique derived from classical doppler mapping. based on themaximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set oforbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resultingdoppler map. we carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform apreliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual dopplermap of the very active star hr 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data setfor various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit.using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peakactivity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radialvelocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planetdown to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocityscatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). onenoticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation,in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radialvelocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustlyrecovered. the present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbitalparameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when moreclassical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. it is easilyadaptable to most existing doppler imaging codes, paving the way towards asystematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.

1509.08751	could a change in magnetic field geometry cause the break in the  wind-activity relation?	wood et al suggested that mass-loss rate is a function of x-ray flux($\dot{m} \propto f_x^{1.34}$) for dwarf stars with $f_x \lesssim f_{x,6}\equiv 10^6$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. however, more active stars do not obeythis relation. these authors suggested that the break at $f_{x,6}$ could becaused by significant changes in magnetic field topology that would inhibitstellar wind generation. here, we investigate this hypothesis by analysing thestars in wood et al's sample that had their surface magnetic fieldsreconstructed through zeeman-doppler imaging (zdi). although the solar-likeoutliers in the $\dot{m}$ -- $f_x$ relation have higher fractional toroidalmagnetic energy, we do not find evidence of a sharp transition in magnetictopology at $f_{x,6}$. to confirm this, further wind measurements and zdiobservations at both sides of the break are required. as active stars can jumpbetween states with highly toroidal to highly poloidal fields, we expectsignificant scatter in magnetic field topology to exist for stars with $f_x\gtrsim f_{x,6}$. this strengthens the importance of multi-epoch zdiobservations. finally, we show that there is a correlation between $f_x$ andmagnetic energy, which implies that $\dot{m}$ -- magnetic energy relation hasthe same qualitative behaviour as the original $\dot{m}$ -- $f_x$ relation. nobreak is seen in any of the $f_x$ -- magnetic energy

astro-ph;0307448	temporal fluctuations in the differential rotation of cool active stars	this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation ontwo rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs, by using stellar surfacefeatures (both cool spots and magnetic regions) as tracers of the large scalelatitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars.we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is differentwhen estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions, and that it undergoestemporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a fewyears. we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processesoperating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone ratherthan being confined at its base as in the sun. by comparing our observationswith two very simple models of the differential rotation within the convectivezone, we obtain evidence that the internal rotation velocity field of the starswe investigated is not like that of the sun, and may resemble that we expectfor rapid rotators. we speculate that the changes in differential rotationresult from the dynamo processes (and from the underlying magnetic cycle) thatperiodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa. weemphasise that the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the firstpractical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity fieldwithin convective zones of cool active stars, and offers several advantagesover asteroseismology for this particular purpose and this specific stellarclass.

astro-ph;0312238	magnetic topology and surface differential rotation on the k1 subgiant  of the rs cvn system hr 1099	we present here spectropolarimetric observations of the rs cvn system hr 1099(v711 tau) secured from 1998 february to 2002 january with thespectropolarimeter musicos at the telescope bernard lyot (observatoire du picdu midi, france). we apply zeeman-doppler imaging and reconstruct brightnessand magnetic surface topologies of the k1 primary subgiant of the system, atfive different epochs. we confirm the presence of large, axisymmetric regionswhere the magnetic field is mainly azimuthal, providing further support to thehypothesis that dynamo processes may be distributed throughout the wholeconvective zone in this star. we study the short-term evolution of surfacestructures from a comparison of our images with observations secured atclose-by epochs by donati et al. (2003) at the anglo-australian telescope. weconclude that the small-scale brightness and magnetic patterns undergo majorchanges within a timescale of 4 to 6 weeks, while the largest structures remainstable over several years. we report the detection of a weak surfacedifferential rotation (both from brightness and magnetic tracers) indicatingthat the equator rotates faster than the pole with a difference in rotationrate between the pole and the equator about 4 times smaller than that of thesun. this result suggests that tidal forces also impact the global dynamicequilibrium of convective zones in cool active stars.

astro-ph;0410575	the dependence of differential rotation on temperature and rotation	we use doppler imaging techniques to determine the dependence of starspotrotation rates on latitude in an homogeneous sample of young, rapidly-rotatingsolar analogues. a solar-like differential rotation law is used, where therotation depends on sin$^2$($\theta$), where $\theta$ is the stellar latitude.by including this term in the image reconstruction process, using starspots astracers, we are able to determine the magnitude of the shear over more than onerotation cycle. we also consider results from matched filter starspot trackingtechniques, where individual starspot rotation rates are determined. inaddition we have re-analysed published results and present a new measurementfor the k3 dwarf, speedy mic.  a total of 10 stars of spectral type g2 - m2 are considered. we find a trendtowards decreasing surface differential rotation with decreasing effectivetemperature. the implied approach to solid body rotation with increasingrelative convection zone depth implies that the dynamo mechanism operating inlow-mass stars may be substantially different from that in the sun.

astro-ph;0505438	large-scale magnetic field of the g8 dwarf xi bootis a	we investigate the magnetic geometry of the active g8 dwarf xi bootis a, fromspectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2003 with the musicos echellespectropolarimeter at the telescope bernard lyot (observatoire du pic du midi,france). we repeatedly detect a photospheric magnetic field, with periodicvariations consistent with rotational modulation. circularly polarized (stokesv) line profiles present a systematic asymmetry, showing up as an excess inamplitude and area of the blue lobe of the profiles. a direct modeling ofstokes v profiles suggests that the global magnetic field is composed of twomain components, with an inclined dipole and a large-scale toroidal field. wederive a dipole intensity of about 40 g, with an inclination of 35 degrees ofthe dipole with respect to the rotation axis. the toroidal field strength is oforder of 120 g. a noticeable evolution of the field geometry is observed overthe 40 nights of our observing window and results in an increase of the fieldstrength and of the dipole inclination.  this study is the first step of a long-term monitoring of xi bootis a andother active solar-type stars, with the aim to investigate secular fluctuationsof stellar magnetic geometries induced by activity cycles.

astro-ph;0601616	a search for magnetic fields in the variable hgmn star $\alpha$  andromedae	with this work, we have conducted an extensive search for magnetic fields inthe photosphere of $\alpha$~and. we have acquired new circular polarisationspectra with the musicos and espadons sp ectropolarimeters. we have alsoobtained fors1 circular polarisation spectra fro m the eso archive, andconsidered all previously published magnetic data. this e xtensive dataset hasbeen used to systematically test for the presence of magnet ic fields in thephotosphere of $\alpha$~and. we have also examined the high-res olution spectrafor line profile variability. the polarimetric and magnetic data provide noconvincing evidence for photospheric magnetic fields. the highest-s/n phase-and velocity-resolved stokes $v$ profiles, obtained with espadons, allow us toplace a $3\sigma$ upper limit of abou t 100~g on the possible presence of anyundetected pure dipolar, quadrupolar or octupolar surface magnet ic fields (andjust 50~g for fields with significant obliquity). we also conside r and dismissthe possible existence of more complex fossil and dynamo-generated fields, anddiscuss the implications of these results for explaining the non-un iformsurface distribution of hg. the very high-quality espadons spectra have allowed us to confidently detect variability of hg~{\sc ii} $\lambda 6149$,$\lamb da 5425$ and $\lambda 5677$. the profile variability of the hg~{\sc ii}lines is strong, and similar to that of the hg~{\sc ii} $\lambda 3984$ line. onthe ot her hand, variability of other lines (e.g. mn, fe) is much weaker, andappears to be attributable to orbital modulation, continuum normalisationdifferences and weak, variable fringing.

astro-ph;0601623	the magnetic field and confined wind of the o star $\theta^1$~orionis~c	in this paper we confirm the presence of a globally-ordered, kg-strengthmagnetic field in the photosphere of the young o star $\theta^1$~orionis~c, andexamine the properties of its optical line profile variations. a new series ofhigh-resolution musicos stokes $v$ and $i$ spectra has been acquired whichsamples approximately uniformly the rotational cycle of $\theta^1$~orionis~c.using the least-squares deconvolution (lsd) multiline technique, we havesucceeded in detecting variable stokes $v$ zeeman signatures associated withthe lsd mean line profile. these signatures have been modeled to determine themagnetic field geometry. we have furthermore examined the profi le variationsof lines formed in both the wind and photosphere using dynamic spectra. basedon spectrum synthesis fitting of the lsd profiles, we determine that the polarstrength of the magnetic dipole component is $1150 \la b_{\rm d}\la 1800$~g andthat the magnetic obliquity is $27\degr \la \beta \la 68\degr$, assuming$i=45\pm 20\degr$. the best-fit values for $i=45\degr$ are $b_{\rm d} = 1300\pm 150 (1\sigma)$~g and $\beta = 50\degr \pm 6\degr (1\sigma)$. our dataconfirm the previous detection of a magnetic field in this star, andfurthermore demonstrate the sinusoidal variability of the longitudinal fieldand accurately determine the phases and intensities of the magnetic extrema.the analysis of ``photospheric'' and ``wind'' line profile variations supportsprevious reports of the optical spectroscopic characteristics, and providesevidence for infall of material within the magnetic equatorial plane.

astro-ph;0703559	first direct detection of magnetic fields in starspots and stellar  chromospheres	here we report on the first detection of circular polarization in molecularlines formed in cool magnetic regions (starspots) and in chromospheric emissionlines formed in hot plages on the surfaces of active stars. our survey of g-k-mstars included young main-sequence dwarfs and rs cvn-type giants and subgiants.all stars were found to possess surface magnetic fields producing stokes v lsdsignals in atomic lines of 0.05 to 0.5%. several stars clearly showed circularpolarization in molecular lines of 0.1 to 1%. the molecular stokes v signal isreminiscent of that observed in sunspots. chromospheric magnetic fields weredetected on most active targets in stokes v profiles of emission lines withpeak polarization up to 2%. the observed molecular circular polarization on mdwarfs indicates single-polarity magnetic fields covering at least 10% of thestellar disk. smaller signals on k stars imply that their magnetic fields areapparently weaker, more entangled than on m dwarfs, or more diluted by thebright photosphere.

0810.2228	ek eridani: the tip of the iceberg of giants which have evolved from  magnetic ap stars	we observe the slowly-rotating, active, single giant, ek eri, to study andinfer the nature of its magnetic field directly. we used the spectropolarimeternarval at the telescope bernard lyot, pic du midi observatory, and the leastsquare deconvolution method to create high signal-to-noise ratio stokes vprofiles. we fitted the stokes v profiles with a model of the large-scalemagnetic field. we studied the classical activity indicators, the caii h and klines, the caii infrared triplet, and h\alpha line. we detected the stokes vsignal of ek eri securely and measured the longitudinal magnetic field bl forseven individual dates spanning 60% of the rotational period. the measuredlongitudinal magnetic field of ek eri reached about 100 g and was as strong asfields observed in rscvn or fk com type stars: this was found to beextraordinary when compared with the weak fields observed at the surfaces ofslowly-rotating ms stars or any single red giant previously observed withnarval. from our modeling, we infer that the mean surface magnetic field isabout 270 g, and that the large scale magnetic field is dominated by a poloidalcomponent. this is compatible with expectations for the descendant of astrongly magnetic ap star.
