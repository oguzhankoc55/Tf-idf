1004.2089	multi-wavelength observations of h 2356-309	aims: the properties of the broad-band emission from the high-frequencypeaked bl lac h 2356-309 (z=0.165) are investigated. methods: very high energy(vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) observations of h 2356-309 were performed with the highenergy stereoscopic system (hess) from 2004 through 2007. simultaneousoptical/uv and x-ray observations were made with the xmm-newton satellite onjune 12/13 and june 14/15, 2005. nrt radio observations were alsocontemporaneously performed in 2005. atom optical monitoring observations werealso made in 2007. results: a strong vhe signal, ~13 sigma total, was detectedby hess after the four years hess observations (116.8 hrs live time). theintegral flux above 240 gev is i(&gt;240 gev) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observedfrom the crab nebula. a time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 gevto 2 tev and is characterized by a power law (photon index of gamma = 3.06 +-0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). significant small-amplitude variations in the vheflux from h 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not onshorter time scales. no evidence for any variations in the vhe spectral slopeare found within these data. the xmm-newton x-ray measurements show ahistorically low x-ray state, characterized by a hard, broken-power-lawspectrum on both nights. conclusions: the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) of the blazar can be adequately fit using a simple one-zonesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) model. in the ssc scenario, higher vhe fluxescould be expected in the future since the observed x-ray flux is at ahistorically low level.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1205.5485	spectral analysis and interpretation of the \gamma-ray emission from the  starburst galaxy ngc 253	very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt;100 gev) and high-energy (he; 100 mev &lt; e &lt; 100gev) data from \gamma-ray observations performed with the h.e.s.s. telescopearray and the fermi-lat instrument, respectively, are analysed in order toinvestigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy ngc 253. the vhe\gamma-ray data can be described by a power law in energy with differentialphoton index \gamma=2.14 \pm 0.18_stat \pm 0.30_sys and differential fluxnormalisation at 1 tev of f_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}tev^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. a power-law fit to the differential he \gamma-rayspectrum reveals a photon index of \gamma=2.24 \pm 0.14_stat \pm 0.03_sys andan integral flux between 200 mev and 200 gev of f(0.2-200 gev) = (4.9 \pm1.0_stat \pm 0.3_sys) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no evidence for a spectralbreak or turnover is found over the dynamic range of both the lat instrumentand the h.e.s.s. experiment: a combined fit of a power law to the he and vhe\gamma-ray data results in a differential photon index \gamma=2.34 \pm 0.03with a p-value of 30%. the \gamma-ray observations indicate that at least about20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactionsis channeled into pion production. the smooth alignment between the spectra inthe he and vhe \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processesdominate in the entire energy range. advection is most likely responsible forcharged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tevenergies. in a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the singleoverall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the meanenergy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburstregion.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1208.1636	discovery of gamma-ray emission from the extragalactic pulsar wind  nebula n157b with the high energy stereoscopic system	we present the significant detection of the first extragalactic pulsar windnebula (pwn) detected in gamma rays, n157b, located in the large magellaniccloud (lmc). pulsars with high spin-down luminosity are found to powerenergised nebulae that emit gamma rays up to energies of several tens of tev.n157b is associated with psrj0537-6910, which is the pulsar with the highestknown spin-down luminosity. the high energy stereoscopic system telescope arrayobserved this nebula on a yearly basis from 2004 to 2009 with a dead-timecorrected exposure of 46 h. the gamma-ray spectrum between 600 gev and 12 tevis well-described by a pure power-law with a photon index of 2.8 \pm 0.2(stat)\pm 0.3(syst) and a normalisation at 1 tev of (8.2 \pm 0.8(stat) \pm 2.5(syst))\times 10^-13 cm^-2s^-1tev^-1. a leptonic multi-wavelength model shows that anenergy of about 4 \times 10^49erg is stored in electrons and positrons. theapparent efficiency, which is the ratio of the tev gamma-ray luminosity to thepulsar's spindown luminosity, 0.08% \pm 0.01%, is comparable to those of pwnefound in the milky way. the detection of a pwn at such a large distance ispossible due to the pulsar's favourable spin-down luminosity and a brightinfrared photon-field serving as an inverse-compton-scattering target foraccelerated leptons. by applying a calorimetric technique to theseobservations, the pulsar's birth period is estimated to be shorter than 10 ms.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1301.1173	search for photon line-like signatures from dark matter annihilations  with h.e.s.s	gamma-ray line signatures can be expected in the very-high-energy (vhe;e_\gamma &gt; 100 gev) domain due to self-annihilation or decay of dark matter(dm) particles in space. such a signal would be readily distinguishable fromastrophysical \gamma-ray sources that in most cases produce continuous spectrawhich span over several orders of magnitude in energy. using data collectedwith the h.e.s.s. \gamma-ray instrument, upper limits on line-like emission areobtained in the energy range between ~500 gev and ~25 tev for the central partof the milky way halo and for extragalactic observations, complementing recentlimits obtained with the fermi-lat instrument at lower energies. nostatistically significant signal could be found. for monochromatic \gamma-rayline emission, flux limits of (2x10^-7 - 2x10^-5) m^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 and (1x10^-8- 2x10^-6) m^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 are obtained for the central part of the milky wayhalo and extragalactic observations, respectively. for a dm particle mass of 1tev, limits on the velocity-averaged dm annihilation cross section &lt; \sigma v&gt;(\chi\chi -&gt; \gamma\gamma) reach ~10^-27 cm^3 s^-1, based on the einastoparametrization of the galactic dm halo density profile.

1301.1678	search for very-high-energy \gamma-ray emission from galactic globular  clusters with h.e.s.s	globular clusters (gcs) are established emitters of high-energy (he, 100mev&lt;e&lt;100 gev) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulativeemission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (mspsrs) in the clusters' cores orfrom inverse compton (ic) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in thegc environment. these stellar clusters could also constitute a new class ofsources in the very-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) \gamma-ray regime, judgingfrom the recent detection of a signal from the direction of terzan 5 with theh.e.s.s. telescope array.  we searched for point-like and extended vhe \gamma-ray emission from 15 gcsserendipitously covered by h.e.s.s observations and also performed a stackinganalysis combining the data from all gcs to investigate the hypothesis of apopulation of faint emitters. assuming ic emission as the origin of the vhe\gamma-ray signal from the direction of terzan 5, we calculated the expected\gamma-ray flux from each of the 15 gcs, based on their number of millisecondpulsars, their optical brightness and the energy density of background photonfields.  we did not detect significant vhe \gamma-ray emission from any of the 15 gcsin either of the two analyses. given the uncertainties related to the parameterdeterminations, the obtained flux upper limits allow to rule out the simpleic/mspsr scaling model for ngc 6388 and ngc 7078. the upper limits derived fromthe stacking analyses are factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted bythe simple leptonic scaling model, depending on the assumed source extent andthe dominant target photon fields. therefore, terzan 5 still remainsexceptional among all gcs, as the vhe \gamma-ray emission either arises fromextra-ordinarily efficient leptonic processes, or from a recent catastrophicevent, or is even unrelated to the gc itself.

1310.6956	hess j1818-154, a new composite supernova remnant discovered in tev  gamma rays and x-rays	composite supernova remnants (snrs) constitute a small subclass of theremnants of massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observedfrom both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula(pwn) located inside of the snr. these systems represent a unique evolutionaryphase of snrs where observations in the radio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray regimesallow the study of the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. in thisarticle, we report results from observations of the shell-type snr g15.4+0.1performed with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) and xmm-newton. acompact tev $\gamma$-ray source, hessj1818-154, located in the center andcontained within the shell of g15.4+0.1 is detected by h.e.s.s. and featurs aspectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of $-2.3\pm 0.3_{stat} \pm 0.2_{sys}$ and an integral flux off$(&gt;$0.42$\,\mathrm{tev}$)=($0.9 \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm0.2_{\mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. furthermore, a recentobservation with xmm-newton reveals extended x-ray emission strongly peaked inthe center of g15.4+0.1. the x-ray source shows indications of anenergy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 kevand more extended emission that fills the entire region within the snr at lowerenergies. together, the x-ray and vhe $\gamma$-ray emission provide strongevidence of a pwn located inside the shell of g15.4+0.1, and this snr cantherefore be classified as a \emph{composite} based on these observations. theradio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn is compatible with aone-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside theemission region. an unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which isthought to power the pwn, has been detected neither in radio nor in x-rayobservations of g15.4+0.1.
