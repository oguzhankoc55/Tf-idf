0903.1946	effects of dust abundance on the far-infrared colours of blue compact  dwarf galaxies	we investigate the fir properties of a sample of bcds observed by akari. byutilizing the data at wavelengths of $\lambda =65 \mu$m, 90 $\mu$m, and 140$\mu$m, we find that the fir colours of the bcds are located at the naturalhigh-temperature extension of those of the milky way and the magellanic clouds.this implies that the optical properties of dust in bcds are similar to thosein the milky way. indeed, we explain the fir colours by assuming the same grainoptical properties, which may be appropriate for amorphous dust grains, and thesame size distribution as those adopted for the milky way dust. since bothinterstellar radiation field and dust optical depth affect the dusttemperature, it is difficult to distinguish which of these two physicalproperties is responsible for the change of fir colours. then, in order toexamine if the dust optical depth plays an important role in determining thedust temperature, we investigate the correlation between fir colour (dusttemperature) and dust-to-gas ratio. we find that the dust temperature tends tobe high as the dust-to-gas ratio decreases but that this trend cannot beexplained by the effect of dust optical depth. rather, it indicates acorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and interstellar radiation field.although the metallicity may also play a role in this correlation, we suggestthat the dust optical depth could regulate the star formation activities, whichgovern the interstellar radiation field. we also mention the importance ofsubmillimetre data in tracing the emission from highly shielded low-temperaturedust.

0908.1571	detecting lyman alpha emitters in the sub-millimeter	using the results from a previously developed lyman alpha/continuumproduction/transmission and dust enrichment model for lyman alpha emitters(laes), based on cosmological sph simulations, we assess the detectability oftheir dust-reprocessed sub-millimeter (submm) radiation. as supernovae (ratherthan evolved stars) control dust formation and destruction processes, laes arerelatively dust-poor with respect to local galaxies: they have low dust-to-gasratios (0.05 times the dust-to-gas ratio of the milky way) in spite of theirrelatively high metallicity, which is approximately 10-50% of the solar value.using the derived escape fraction of ultraviolet (uv) continuum photons wecompute the uv luminosity absorbed by dust and re-emitted in the far infrared.the lae submm fluxes correlate with their lyman alpha luminosity: about (3%,1%) at z=(5.7, 6.6) of the laes in our simulated sample (those with with logl_\alpha &gt; 43.1) would have fluxes at 850 micrometer (the optimal band fordetection) in excess of 0.12 mjy and will be therefore detectable at 5 sigmawith alma with an integration time of only 1 hour. such detections would open anew window on the physical conditions prevailing in these most distantgalaxies.

1001.2606	effects of grain shattering by turbulence on extinction curves in  starburst galaxies	dust grains can be efficiently accelerated and shattered in warm ionizedmedium (wim) because of the turbulent motion. this effect is enhanced instarburst galaxies, where gas is ionized and turbulence is sustained by massivestars. moreover, dust production by type ii supernovae (sne ii) can beefficient in starburst galaxies. in this paper, we examine the effect ofshattering in wim on the dust grains produced by sne ii. we find that althoughthe grains ejected from sne ii are expected to be biased to large sizes ($a\ga0.1 \micron$, where $a$ is the grain radius) because of the shock destructionin supernova remnants, the shattering in wim is efficient enough in $\sim 5$myr to produce small grains if the metallicity is nearly solar or more. theproduction of small grains by shattering steepens the extinction curve. thus,steepening of extinction curves by shattering should always be taken intoaccount for the system where the metallicity is solar and the starburst age istypically larger than 5 myr. these conditions may be satisfied not only innearby starbursts but also in high redshift ($z&gt;5$) quasars.

1006.2187	shattering by turbulence as a production source of very small grains	the origin of grain size distribution in the interstellar medium is one ofthe most fundamental problems in the interstellar physics. in the milky way,smaller grains are more abundant in number, but their origins are notnecessarily specified and quantified. one of the most efficient drivers ofsmall grain production is interstellar turbulence, in which dust grains canacquire relative velocities large enough to be shattered. applying theframework of shattering developed in previous papers, we show that small ($a\la0.01~\micron$) grains reach the abundance level observed in the milky way in$\sim 10^8$ yr (i.e. within the grain lifetime) by shattering in warm neutralmedium. we also show that if part of grains experience additional shattering inwarm ionized medium, carbonaceous grains with $a\sim 0.01~\micron$ areredistributed into smaller sizes. this could explain the relative enhancementof very small carbonaceous grains with $a\sim 3$--100 \aa. our theory alsoexplains the ubiquitous association between large grains and very small grainsnaturally. some tests for our theory are proposed in terms of the metallicitydependence.

1010.1419	importance of far-infrared mapping in a spiral galaxy: akari observation  of m81	the importance of the far-infrared (fir) mapping is demonstrated for aface-on spiral galaxy, m81, by analyzing its imaging data at 65, 90, and 140{\mu}m taken by akari. basic products are the dust temperature map, the dustoptical depth map, and the colour-colour diagram. the main features are asfollows. (i) the dust temperature derived from the total fluxes at 90 {\mu}mand 140 {\mu}m reflects the relatively low temperatures seen in the interarmand spiral arms excluding the warm spots, rather than the high temperatures inwarm spots and the centre. this indicates that the total fir luminosity isdominated by the dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field. (ii)the galaxy is more extended at 140 {\mu}m than at the other shorterwavelengths, which reflects the radial dust temperature gradient. (iii) thedust optical depth derived from the fir mapping is broadly consistent with thatestimated from the fir-to-ultraviolet luminosity ratio. (iv) the fircolour-colour diagramis useful to identify a 'contamination' of warm dust. theexistence of small-scale warm star-forming regions is supported in the brightspots along the spiral arms. this contamination also leads to an underestimateof dust optical depth (or dust column density).

0709.1527	origin of chromatic features in multiple quasars -variability, dust, or  microlensing -	aims:in some of the lensed quasars, color differences between multiple imagesare observed at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. there are three possibleorigins of the color differences: intrinsic variabilities of quasars,differential dust extinction, and quasar microlensing. we examine how thesethree possible scenarios can reproduce the observed chromaticity. methods:weevaluate how much color difference between multiple images can be reproduced bythe above three possible scenarios with realistic models; (i) an empiricalrelation for intrinsic variabilities of quasars, (ii) empirical relations fordust extinction and theoretically predicted inhomogeneity in galaxies, or (iii)a theoretical model for quasar accretion disks and magnification patterns inthe vicinity of caustics. results:we find that intrinsic variabilities ofquasars cannot be a dominant source responsible for observed chromatic featuresin multiple quasars. in contrast, either dust extinction or quasar microlensingcan nicely reproduce the observed color differences between multiple images inmost of the lensed quasars. taking into account the time interval betweenobservations at different wavebands in our estimations, quasar microlensing isa more realistic scenario to reproduce the observed color differences than dustextinction. all the observed color differences presented in this paper can beexplained by a combination of these two effects, but monitoring observations atmultiple wavebands are necessary to disentangle these.

1104.0728	the role of dust in the early universe i : protogalaxy evolution	we develop one-zone galaxy formation models in the early universe, takinginto account dust formation and evolution by supernova (sn) explosions.especially we focus on the time evolution of dust size distribution, because${\rm h}_{2}$ formation on the dust surface plays a critical role in the starformation process in the early universe. in the model we assume that starformation rate (sfr) is proportional to the total amount of ${\rm h}_{2}$. weconsistently treat (i) the formation and size evolution of dust, (ii) thechemical reaction networks including ${\rm h}_{2}$ formation both on thesurface of dust and in gas phase, and (iii) the sfr in the model. first, wefind that, because of dust destruction due to both reverse and forward shocksdriven by sne, h$_{2}$ formation is more suppressed than that without dustdestruction. at the galaxy age of $sim0.8 {\rm gyr}$, for galaxy models withvirial mass $m_{\rm vir}=10^{9} m_{\odot}$ and formation redshift $z_{\rmvir}=10$, the molecular fraction is 2.5 orders of magnitude less in the modelwith dust destruction by both shocks than that in the model without dustdestruction. second, we show that the h$_{2}$ formation rate strongly dependson the ism density around sn progenitors. the sfr in higher ism density islower, since dust destruction by reverse shocks is more effective in higher ismdensity. we conclude that not only the amount but also the size distribution ofdust being related with the star formation activity strongly affects theevolution of galaxies in the early universe.

1105.4930	effects of grain size distribution on the interstellar dust mass growth	grain growth by the accretion of metals in interstellar clouds (called `graingrowth') could be one of the dominant processes that determine the dust contentin galaxies. the importance of grain size distribution for the grain growth isdemonstrated in this paper. first, we derive an analytical formula that givesthe grain size distribution after the grain growth in individual clouds for anyinitial grain size distribution. the time-scale of the grain growth is verysensitive to grain size distribution, since the grain growth is mainlyregulated by the surface to volume ratio of grains. next, we implement theresults of grain growth into dust enrichment models of entire galactic systemalong with the grain formation and destruction in the interstellar medium,finding that the grain growth in clouds governs the dust content in nearbygalaxies unless the grain size is strongly biased to sizes larger than $\sim0.1 \micron$ or the power index of the grain size distribution is shallowerthan $\sim -2.5$. the grain growth in clouds contributes to the rapid increaseof dust-to-gas ratio at a certain metallicity level (called criticalmetallicity in asano et al. 2011 and and inoue 2011), which we find to besensitive to grain size distribution. thus, the grain growth efficientlyincrease the dust mass not only in nearby galaxies but also in high-redshiftquasars, whose metallicities are larger than the critical value. our recipe forthe grain growth is applicable for any grain size distribution and easilyimplemented into any framework of dust enrichment in galaxies.

1110.3259	dust properties in afterglow of grb 071025 at z~5	at high redshift, the universe was so young that core-collapse supernovae(sne) are suspected to be the dominant source of dust production. however, someobservations indicate that the dust production by sne is an inefficientprocess, casting doubts on the existence of abundant sne-dust in the earlyuniverse. recently, perley et al. (2010) reported that the afterglow of grb071025 - an unusually red grb at z ~ 5 - shows evidence for the sne-produceddust. since this is perhaps the only high redshift grb exhibiting compellingevidence for sne-dust but the result could easily be affected by smallsystematics in photometry, we re-examined the extinction properties of grb071025 using our own optical/near-infrared data at a different epoch. inaddition, we tested sne-dust models with different progenitor masses and dustdestruction efficiencies to constrain the dust formation mechanisms. bysearching for the best-fit model of the afterglow spectral energy distribution,we confirm the previous claim that the dust in grb 071025 is most likely tooriginate from sne. we also find that the sne-dust model of 13 or 25m_{\odot}without dust destruction fits the extinction property of grb 071025 best, whilepair-instability sne (pisne) models with a 170m_{\odot} progenitor poorly fitthe data. our results indicate that, at least in some systems at high redshift,sne with intermediate masses within 10 - 30m_{\odot} were the main contributorsfor the dust enrichment, and the dust destruction effect due to reverse shockwas negligible.

1202.1345	dust growth in the interstellar medium: how do accretion and coagulation  interplay?	dust grains grow in interstellar clouds by accretion and coagulation. in thispaper, we focus on these two grain growth processes and numerically investigatehow they interplay to increase the grain radii. we show that accretionefficiently depletes grains with radii $a\la 0.001 \micron$ on a time-scale of$\la 10$ myr in solar-metallicity molecular clouds. coagulation also occurs ona similar time-scale, but accretion is more efficient in producing a large bumpin the grain size distribution. coagulation further pushes the grains to largersizes after a major part of the gas phase metals are used up. similar grainsizes are achieved by coagulation regardless of whether accretion takes placeor not; in this sense, accretion and coagulation modify the grain sizedistribution independently. the increase of the total dust mass in a cloud isalso investigated. we show that coagulation slightly 'suppresses' dust massgrowth by accretion but that this effect is slight enough to be neglected inconsidering the grain mass budget in galaxies. finally we examine how accretionand coagulation affect the extinction curve: the ultraviolet slope and thecarbon bump are \textit{enhanced} by accretion, while they are flattened bycoagulation.

1203.4298	synthesized grain size distribution in the interstellar medium	we examine a synthetic way of constructing the grain size distribution in theinterstellar medium (ism). first we formulate a synthetic grain sizedistribution composed of three grain size distributions processed with thefollowing mechanisms that govern the grain size distribution in the milky way:(i) grain growth by accretion and coagulation in dense clouds, (ii) supernovashock destruction by sputtering in diffuse ism, and (iii) shattering driven byturbulence in diffuse ism. then, we examine if the observational grain sizedistribution in the milky way (called mrn) is successfully synthesized or not.we find that the three components actually synthesize the mrn grain sizedistribution in the sense that the deficiency of small grains by (i) and (ii)is compensated by the production of small grains by (iii). the fraction of each{contribution} to the total grain processing of (i), (ii), and (iii) (i.e., therelative importance of the three {contributions} to all grain processingmechanisms) is 30-50%, 20-40%, and 10-40%, respectively. we also show that themilky way extinction curve is reproduced with the synthetic grain sizedistributions.

1205.6137	impact of grain size distributions on the dust enrichment in  high-redshift quasars	in high-redshift ($z&gt;5$) quasars, a large amount of dust ($\textstyle\sim10^{8} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}$) has been observed. in order to explain the largedust content, we focus on a possibility that grain growth by the accretion ofheavy elements is the dominant dust source. we adopt a chemical evolution modelapplicable to nearby galaxies but utilize parameters adequate to high-$z$quasars. it is assumed that metals and dust are predominantly ejected by typeii supernovae (sne). we have found that grain growth strongly depends on thegrain size distribution. if we simply use the size distribution of grainsejected from sne, grain growth is inefficient because of the lack of smallgrains (i.e.\ small surface-to-volume ratio of the dust grains). however, if wetake small grain production by interstellar shattering into consideration,grain growth is efficient enough to account for the rich dust abundance inhigh-$z$ quasars. our results not only confirm that grain growth is necessaryto explain the large amount of dust in high-$z$ quasars, but also demonstratethat grain size distributions have a critical impact on grain growth.

1206.0817	dust formation history of galaxies: a critical role of metallicity for  the dust mass growth by accreting materials in the interstellar medium	this paper investigate what is the main driver of the dust mass growth in theinterstellar medium (ism) by using a chemical evolution model of galaxy withmetals (elements heavier than helium) in dust phase in addition to the totalamount of metals. we consider asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars, type iisupernovae (sne ii) and the dust mass growth in the ism as the sources of dust,and sn shocks as the destruction mechanism of dust. further, to describe thedust evolution precisely, our model takes into account the age and metallicity(the ratio of metal mass to ism mass) dependence of the sources of dust. weparticularly focused on the dust mass growth, and found that the dust massgrowth in the ism is regulated by the metallicity. to quantify this aspect, weintroduce a "critical metallicity", which is a metallicity at which thecontribution of stars (agb stars and sne ii) equals that of the dust massgrowth in the ism. if the star formation timescale is shorter, the value of thecritical metallicity is higher, but the galactic age at which the metallicityreaches the critical metallicity is shorter. from observations, it was expectedthat the dust mass growth was the dominant source of dust in the milky way anddusty qsos at high redshifts. by introducing the critical metallicity, it isclearly shown that the dust mass growth is the main source of dust in suchgalaxies with various star formation timescales and ages. the dust mass growthin the ism is regulated by metallicity, and we stress that the criticalmetallicity works as an indicator to judge whether the grain growth in the ismis dominant source of dust in a galaxy, especially because of the strong andnonlinear dependence on the metallicity.

1212.3761	properties of free-free, dust, and co emissions in the starbursts of  blue compact dwarf galaxies	the central star-forming regions in three blue compact dwarf galaxies (he2-10, ngc 5253, and ii zw 40) were observed in the 340 ghz (880 micron) band at5 arcsec resolution with the submillimetre array (sma). continuum emissionassociated with the central star-forming complex was detected in all thesegalaxies. the sma 880 micron flux is decomposed into free-free emission anddust emission by using centimetre-wavelength data in the literature. we findthat free-free emission contributes half or more of the sma 880 micron flux inthe central starbursts in those three galaxies. in spite of the dominance offree-free emission at 880 micron, the radio-to-far infrared (fir) ratios in thecentral star-forming regions are not significantly higher than those of theentire systems, showing the robustness of radio-fir relation. based on therobustness of the radio-fir relation, we argue that the free--free fraction inthe 880 micron emission is regulated by the dust temperature. we also analyzethe co (j = 3--2) emission data. we find that co is a good tracer of the totalgas mass in solar-metallicity object he 2-10. low-metallicity objects, ngc 5253and ii zw 40, have apparently high star formation efficiencies; however, thismay be an artifact of significant dissociation of co in the low-metallicityenvironments. we also point out a potential underestimate of dust mass, sincethe dust traced by emission is biased to the most luminous high-temperatureregions, particularly when a system hosts a compact star-forming region wherethe dust temperature is high.

1303.3958	evolution of dust grain size distribution by shattering in the  interstellar medium: robustness and uncertainty	shattering of dust grains in the interstellar medium is a viable mechanism ofsmall grain production in galaxies. we examine the robustness or uncertainty inthe theoretical predictions of shattering. we identify $p_1$ (the criticalpressure above which the deformation destroys the original lattice structures)as the most important quantity in determining the timescale of small grainproduction, and confirm that the same $p_1/t$ ($t$ is the duration ofshattering) gives the same grain size distribution [$n(a)$, where $a$ is thegrain radius] after shattering within a factor of 3. the uncertainty in thefraction of shocked material that is eventually ejected as fragments causesuncertainties in $n(a)$ by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6 for silicate andcarbonaceous dust, respectively. the size distribution of shattered fragmentshave minor effects as long as the power index of the fragment size distributionis less than ~ 3.5, since the slope of grain size distribution $n(a)$continuously change by shattering and becomes consistent with $n(a)\proptoa^{-3.5}$. the grain velocities as a function of grain radius can have animprint in the grain size distribution especially for carbonaceous dust. wealso show that the formulation of shattering can be simplified without losingsufficient precision.

1303.5528	what determines the grain size distribution in galaxies?	we construct a dust evolution model taking into account the grain sizedistribution, and investigate what kind of dust processes determine the grainsize distribution at each stage of galaxy evolution. in addition to the dustproduction by type ii supernovae (sneii) and asymptotic giant branch (agb)stars, we consider three processes in the ism: (i) dust destruction by snshocks, (ii) metal accretion onto the surface of preexisting grains in the coldneutral medium (cnm) (called grain growth), and (iii) grain-grain collisions(shattering and coagulation) in the warm neutral medium (wnm) and cnm. we foundthat the grain size distribution in galaxies is controlled by stellar sourcesin the early stage of galaxy evolution, and that afterwards the main processesthat govern the size distribution changes to those in the ism. since shatteringproduces a large abundance of small grains (consequently, the surface-to-volumeratio of grains increases), it enhances the efficiency of grain growth,contributing to the significant increase of the total dust mass. grain growthcreates a large bump in the grain size distribution around a ~ 0.01 \mu m.coagulation occurs effectively after the number of small grains is enhanced byshattering, and the grain size distribution is deformed to have a bump at a ~0.03 - 0.05 \mu m at t ~ 10 gyr. we conclude that the evolutions of the totaldust mass and the grain size distribution in galaxies are closely related toeach other, and the grain size distribution changes considerably through thegalaxy evolution because the dominant dust processes which regulate the grainsize distribution change.

1306.5575	condition for the formation of micron-sized dust grains in dense  molecular cloud cores	we investigate the condition for the formation of micron-sized grains indense cores of molecular clouds. this is motivated by the detection of themid-infrared emission from deep inside a number of dense cores, the so-called`coreshine,' which is thought to come from scattering by micron-sized grains.based on numerical calculations of coagulation starting from the typical grainsize distribution in the diffuse interstellar medium, we obtain a conservativelower limit to the time $t$ to form micron-sized grains: $t/t_\mathrm{ff}&gt;3(5/s) (n_\mathrm{h}/10^5 \mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1/4}$ (where $t_\mathrm{ff}$ isthe free-fall time at hydrogen number density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in the core, and$s$ the enhancement factor to the grain-grain collision cross-section toaccount for non-compact aggregates). at the typical core density$n_\mathrm{h}=10^5 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, it takes at least a few free-fall timesto form the micron-sized grains responsible for coreshine. the implication isthat those dense cores observed in coreshine are relatively long-lived entitiesin molecular clouds, rather than dynamically transient objects that last forone free-fall time or less.

0801.2649	extinction curves flattened by reverse shocks in supernovae	we investigate the extinction curves of young galaxies in which dust issupplied from type ii supernovae (sne ii) and/or pair instability supernovae(pisne). since at high redshift (z&gt;5), low-mass stars cannot be dominantsources for dust grains, sne ii and pisne, whose progenitors are massive starswith short lifetimes, should govern the dust production. here, we theoreticallyinvestigate the extinction curves of dust produced by sne ii and pisne, takinginto account reverse shock destruction induced by collision with ambientinterstellar medium. we find that the extinction curve is sensitive to theambient gas density around a sn, since the efficiency of reverse shockdestruction strongly depends on it. the destruction is particularly efficientfor small-sized grains, leading to a flat extinction curve in the optical andultraviolet wavelengths. such a large ambient density as n_h &gt; 1 cm^{-3}produces too flat an extinction curve to be consistent with the observedextinction curve for sdss j104845.05+463718.3 at z=6.2. although the extinctioncurve is highly sensitive to the ambient density, the hypothesis that the dustis predominantly formed by sne at z~6 is still allowed by the currentobservational constraints. for further quantification, the ambient densityshould be obtained by some other methods. finally we also discuss theimportance of our results for observations of high-z galaxies, stressing apossibility of flat extinction curves.

1310.3349	discovery of an outstanding disk in the cd galaxy of the hydra a cluster	the central cd galaxy of the hydra a cluster has one of the most powerfulactive galactic nuclei (agns) in the nearby universe (z &lt;0.2). we report on thediscovery of a dust lane in the cd galaxy using subaru telescope. the i'-bandimage shows the existence of a dark band of the size of 3.6"x 0.7" (4 kpc x 0.8kpc), which appears to be quite similar to the dust lane observed in centaurusa. the morphology indicates that the cold disk that seen as the dust lane isalmost edge-on and rotates around the agn. since the minor axis of the dustlane is nearly parallel to the radio jets emerging from the agn, the disk isprobably feeding its gas into the central black hole. from the absorption, weestimate the hydrogen column density of the lane is n_h=2.0 x 10^21 cm^-2, andthe mass of the disk is ~8 x 10^7 m_sun. the column density is consistent withconstraints obtained from chandra x-ray observations. the age of the disk is &gt;~4 x 10^7 yr. the position angle of the disk and the galaxy's photometric axisare misaligned, which may imply that the cold gas in the disk is brought viagalaxy mergers. our observations may indicate that the supply of cold gas bygalaxy mergers is required for the most intensive feedback from agns.

1310.4679	effects of grain growth mechanisms on the extinction curve and the metal  depletion in the interstellar medium	dust grains grow their sizes in the interstellar clouds (especially inmolecular clouds) by accretion and coagulation. here we model and test theseprocesses by examining the consistency with the observed variation of theextinction curves in the milky way. we find that, if we simply use theparameters used in previous studies, the model fails to explain the flatteningof far-uv extinction curve for large $r_v$ (flatness of optical extinctioncurve) and the existence of carbon bump even in flat extinction curves. thisdiscrepancy is resolved by adopting a `tuned' model, in which coagulation ofcarbonaceous dust is less efficient (by a factor of 2) and that of silicate ismore efficient with the coagulation threshold removed. the tuned model is alsoconsistent with the relation between silicon depletion (indicator of accretion)and $r_v$ if the duration of accretion and coagulation is &gt;100(n_h/10^3cm^{-3})^{-1} myr, where n_h is the number density of hydrogen nuclei in thecloud. we also examine the relations between each of the extinction curvefeatures (uv slope, far-uv curvature, and carbon bump strength) and $r_v$. thecorrelation between uv slope and $r_v$, which is the strongest among the threecorrelations, is well reproduced by the tuned model. for far-uv curvature andcarbon bump strength, the observational data are located between the tunedmodel and the original model without tuning, implying that the large scattersin the observational data can be explained by the sensitive response to thecoagulation efficiency. the overall success of the tuned model indicates thataccretion and coagulation are promising mechanisms of producing the variationof extinction curves in the milky way, although we do not exclude possibilitiesof other dust-processing mechanisms changing extinction curves.

1401.3943	formation history of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in galaxies	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are some of the major dust componentsin the interstellar medium (ism). we present our evolution models for theabundance of pahs in the ism on a galaxy-evolution timescale. we considershattering of carbonaceous dust grains in interstellar turbulence as theformation mechanism of pahs while the pah abundance can be reduced bycoagulation onto dust grains, destruction by supernova shocks, andincorporation into stars. we implement these processes in a one-zone chemicalevolution model to obtain the evolution of the pah abundance in a galaxy. wefind that pah formation becomes accelerated above certain metallicity whereshattering becomes efficient. for pah destruction, while supernova shock is theprimary mechanism in the metal-poor environment, coagulation is dominant in themetal-rich environment. we compare the evolution of the pah abundances in ourmodels with observed abundances in galaxies with a wide metallicity range. ourmodels reproduce both the paucity of pah detection in low metallicity galaxiesand the metallicity-dependence of the pah abundance in high-metallicitygalaxies. the strong metallicity dependence of pah abundance appears as aresult of the strong metallicity dependence of the dust mass increase by theaccretion of metals onto dust grains, which are eventually shattered into pahs.we conclude that the observational trend of the pah abundance can be a naturalconsequence of shattering of carbonaceous grains being the source of pahs. toestablish our scenario of pah formation, observational evidence of pahformation by shattering would be crucial.

1401.7121	evolution of the extinction curves in galaxies	we investigate the evolution of extinction curves in galaxies based on ourevolution model of grain size distribution. in this model, we consideredvarious processes: dust formation by sne ii and agb stars, dust destruction bysn shocks in the ism, metal accretion onto the surface of grains (referred toas grain growth), shattering and coagulation. we find that the extinction curveis flat in the earliest stage of galaxy evolution. as the galaxy is enrichedwith dust, shattering becomes effective to produce a large abundance of smallgrains ($a \la 0.01\;\mu$m). then, grain growth becomes effective at smallgrain radii, forming a bump at $a \sim 10^{-3}${--}$10^{-2}\;\mu$m on the grainsize distribution. consequently, the extinction curve at ultraviolet (uv)wavelengths becomes steep, and a bump at $1/\lambda \sim 4.5\;\mu{\rmm}^{-1}\;(\lambda: \mbox{wavelength})$ on the extinction curve becomesprominent. once coagulation becomes effective, the extinction curves becomeflatter, but the uv extinction remains overproduced when compared with themilky way extinction curve. this discrepancy can be resolved by introducing astronger contribution of coagulation. consequently, an interplay betweenshattering and coagulation could be important to reproduce the milky wayextinction curve.

1404.5462	planet traps and first planets: the critical metallicity for gas giant  formation	the ubiquity of planets poses an interesting question: when first planets areformed in galaxies. we investigate this problem by adopting a theoretical modeldeveloped for understanding the statistical properties of exoplanets. our modelis constructed as the combination of planet traps with the standard coreaccretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directlyrelates to the dust density in disks or the metallicity ([fe/h]). westatistically compute planet formation frequencies (pffs) as well as theorbital radius ($&lt;r_{rapid}&gt;$) within which gas accretion becomes efficientenough to form jovian planets. the three characteristic exoplanetarypopulations are considered: hot jupiters, exo-jupiters densely populated around1 au, and low-mass planets such as super-earths. we explore the behavior of thepffs as well as $&lt;r_{rapid}&gt;$ for the three different populations as a functionof metallicity ($-2 \leq$[fe/h]$\leq -0.6$). we show that the total pffsincrease steadily with metallicity, which is the direct outcome of the coreaccretion picture. for the entire range of the metallicity considered here, thepopulation of the low-mass planets dominates over the jovian planets. thejovian planets contribute to the pffs above [fe/h]-1. we find that the hotjupiters form at lower metallcities than the exo-jupiters. this arises from theradially inward transport of planetary cores by their host traps, which is moreeffective for lower metallicity disks due to the slower growth of the cores.the pffs for the exo-jupiters exceed those for the hot jupiters around[fe/h]-0.7. finally, we show that the critical metallicity for forming jovianplanets is [fe/h]-1.2, which is evaluated by comparing the values of$&lt;r_{rapid}&gt;$ between the hot jupiters and the low-mass planets. the comparisonintrinsically links to the different gas accretion efficiency between them.

1404.5724	evolution of dust content in galaxies probed by gamma-ray burst  afterglows	because of their brightness, gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows are viabletargets for investigating the dust content in their host galaxies. simpleintrinsic spectral shapes of grb afterglows allow us to derive the dustextinction. recently, the extinction data of grb afterglows are compiled up toredshift $z=6.3$, in combination with hydrogen column densities andmetallicities. this data set enables us to investigate the relation betweendust-to-gas ratio and metallicity out to high redshift for a wide metallicityrange. by applying our evolution models of dust content in galaxies, we findthat the dust-to-gas ratio derived from grb afterglow extinction data areexcessively high such that they can be explained with a fraction of gas-phasemetals condensed into dust ($f_\mathrm{in}$) $\sim 1$, while theoreticalcalculations on dust formation in the wind of asymptotic giant branch stars andin the ejecta of type ii supernovae suggest a much more moderate condensationefficiency ($f_\mathrm{in}\sim 0.1$). efficient dust growth in dense clouds hasdifficulty in explaining the excessive dust-to-gas ratio at metallicities$z/\mathrm{z}_\odot &lt;\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the star formationefficiency of the dense clouds. however, if $\epsilon$ is as small as 0.01, thedust-to-gas ratio at $z\sim 10^{-2}$ z$_\odot$ can be explained with$n_\mathrm{h}\gtrsim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. therefore, a dense environment hostingdust growth is required to explain the large fraction of metals condensed intodust, but such clouds should have low star formation efficiencies to avoidrapid metal enrichment by stars.

1406.6762	constraining dust formation in high-redshift young galaxies	core-collapse supernovae (sne) are believed to be the first significantsource of dust in the universe. such sne are expected to be the main dustproducers in young high-redshift lyman $\alpha$ emitters (laes) given theiryoung ages, providing an excellent testbed of sn dust formation models duringthe early stages of galaxy evolution. we focus on the dust enrichment of aspecific, luminous lae (himiko, $z\simeq 6.6$) for which a stringent upperlimit of $52.1~\mu$jy ($3\sigma$) has recently been obtained from almacontinuum observations at 1.2 mm. we predict its submillimetre dust emissionusing detailed models that follow sn dust enrichment and destruction and theequilibrium dust temperature, and obtain a plausible upper limit to the dustmass produced by a single sn: $m_\mathrm{d,sn} &lt; 0.15$--0.45 m$_\odot$,depending on the adopted dust optical properties. these upper limits aresmaller than the dust mass deduced for sn 1987a and that predicted by dustcondensation theories, implying that dust produced in sne are likely to besubject to reverse shock destruction before being injected into theinterstellar medium. finally, we provide a recipe for deriving$m_\mathrm{d,sn}$ from submillimetre observations of young, metal poor objectswherein condensation in sn ejecta is the dominant dust formation channel.

1407.7658	molecular hydrogen emission in the interstellar medium of the large  magellanic cloud	we present the detection and analysis of molecular hydrogen emission towardten interstellar regions in the large magellanic cloud. we examinedlow-resolution infrared spectral maps of twelve regions obtained with thespitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the pure rotational 0--0 transitions ofh$_2$ at 28.2 and 17.1${\,\rm \mu m}$ are detected in the irs spectra for tenregions. the higher level transitions are mostly upper limit measurementsexcept for three regions, where a 3$\sigma$ detection threshold is achieved forlines at 12.2 and 8.6${\,\rm \mu m}$. the excitation diagrams of the detectedh$_2$ transitions are used to determine the warm h$_2$ gas column density andtemperature. the single-temperature fits through the lower transition linesgive temperatures in the range $86-137\,{\rm k}$. the bulk of the excited h$_2$gas is found at these temperatures and contributes $\sim$5-17% to the total gasmass. we find a tight correlation of the h$_2$ surface brightness withpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and total infrared emission, which is a clearindication of photo-electric heating in photodissociation regions. we find theexcitation of h$_2$ by this process is equally efficient in both atomic andmolecular dominated regions. we also present the correlation of the warm h$_2$physical conditions with dust properties. the warm h$_2$ mass fraction andexcitation temperature show positive correlations with the average starlightintensity, again supporting h$_2$ excitation in photodissociation regions.

1408.4682	effects of grain growth on the interstellar polarization curve	we apply the time evolution of grain size distributions by accretion andcoagulation found in our previous work to the modelling of the wavelengthdependence of interstellar linear polarization. we especially focus on theparameters of the serkowski curve $k$ and $\lambda_{\max}$ characterizing thewidth and the maximum wavelength of this curve, respectively. we use alignedsilicate and non-aligned carbonaceous spheroidal particles with differentaspect ratios $a/b$. the imperfect alignment of grains with sizes larger than acut-off size $r_{v,\rm cut}$ is considered. we find that the evolutionaryeffects on the polarization curve are negligible in the original model withcommonly used material parameters (hydrogen number density $n_\mathrm{h}=10^3$cm$^{-3}$, gas temperature $t_\mathrm{gas}=10$~k, and the sticking probabilityfor accretion $s_\mathrm{acc}=0.3$). therefore, we apply the tuned model wherethe coagulation threshold of silicate is removed. in this model,$\lambda_{\max}$ displaces to the longer wavelengths and the polarization curvebecomes wider ($k$ reduces) on time-scales $\sim (30 - 50) (n_\mathrm{h}/10^3\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1}$ myr. the tuned models at $t &lt; 30 (n_\mathrm{h}/10^3\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1} $ myr and different values of the parameters $r_{v,\rmcut}$ can also explain the observed trend between $k$ and $\lambda_{\max}$. itis significant that the evolutionary effect appears in the perpendiculardirection to the effect of $r_{v,\rm cut}$ on the $k$ - $\lambda_{\max}$diagram. very narrow polarization curves can be reproduced if we change thetype of particles (prolate/oblate) and/or vary $a/b$.

1410.7861	evolution of grain size distribution in high-redshift dusty quasars:  integrating large amounts of dust and unusual extinction curves	the discoveries of huge amounts of dust and unusual extinction curves inhigh-redshift quasars (z &gt; 4) cast challenging issues on the origin andproperties of dust in the early universe. in this letter, we investigate theevolutions of dust content and extinction curve in a high-z quasar, based onthe dust evolution model taking account of grain size distribution. first, weshow that the milky-way extinction curve is reproduced by introducing amoderate fraction (~0.2) of dense molecular-cloud phases in the interstellarmedium for a graphite-silicate dust model. then we show that the peculierextinction curves in high-z quasars can be explained by taking a much highermolecular-cloud fraction (&gt;0.5), which leads to more efficient grain growth andcoagulation, and by assuming amorphous carbon instead of graphite. the largedust content in high-z quasar hosts is also found to be a natural consequenceof the enhanced dust growth. these results indicate that grain growth andcoagulation in molecular clouds are key processes that can increase the dustmass and change the size distribution of dust in galaxies, and that, along witha different dust composition, can contribute to shape the extinction curve.

1412.3866	two-size approximation: a simple way of treating the evolution of grain  size distribution in galaxies	full calculations of the evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies arein general computationally heavy. in this paper, we propose a simple model ofdust enrichment in a galaxy with a simplified treatment of grain sizedistribution by imposing a `two-size approximation'; that is, all the grainpopulation is represented by small (grain radius a &lt; 0.03 micron) and large (a&gt; 0.03 micron) grains. we include in the model dust supply from stellar ejecta,destruction in supernova shocks, dust growth by accretion, grain growth bycoagulation and grain disruption by shattering, considering how these processeswork on the small and large grains. we show that this simple frameworkreproduces the main features found in full calculations of grain sizedistributions as follows. the dust enrichment starts with the supply of largegrains from stars. at a metallicity level referred to as the criticalmetallicity of accretion, the abundance of the small grains formed byshattering becomes large enough to rapidly increase the grain abundance byaccretion. associated with this epoch, the mass ratio of the small grains tothe large grains reaches the maximum. after that, this ratio converges to thevalue determined by the balance between shattering and coagulation, and thedust-to-metal ratio is determined by the balance between accretion and shockdestruction. with a monte carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the simplicityof our model has an advantage in predicting statistical properties. we alsoshow some applications for predicting observational dust properties such asextinction curves.

1506.07926	dust cooling in supernova remnants in the large magellanic cloud	the infrared-to-x-ray (irx) flux ratio traces the relative importance of dustcooling to gas cooling in astrophysical plasma such as supernova remnants(snrs). we derive irx ratios of snrs in the lmc using spitzer and chandra snrsurvey data and compare them with those of galactic snrs. irx ratios of all thesnrs in the sample are found to be moderately greater than unity, indicatingthat dust grains are a more efficient coolant than gas although gas cooling maynot be negligible. the irx ratios of the lmc snrs are systematically lower thanthose of the galactic snrs. as both dust cooling and gas cooling pertain to theproperties of the interstellar medium, the lower irx ratios of the lmc snrs mayreflect the characteristics of the lmc, and the lower dust-to- gas ratio (aquarter of the galactic value) is likely to be the most significant factor. theobserved irx ratios are compared with theoretical predictions that yield irxratios an order of magnitude larger. this discrepancy may originate from thedearth of dust in the remnants due to either the local variation of the dustabundance in the preshock medium with respect to the canonical abundance or thedust destruction in the postshock medium. the non-equilibrium ionizationcooling of hot gas, in particular for young snrs, may also cause thediscrepancy. finally, we discuss implications for the dominant coolingmechanism of snrs in low-metallicity galaxies.

1507.03327	the origin of dust extinction curves with or without the 2175 a bump in  galaxies: the case of the magellanic clouds	the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively) areobserved to have characteristic dust extinction curves that are quite differentfrom those of the galaxy (e.g., strength of the 2175 a bump). although the dustcomposition and size distribution of the magellanic clouds (mcs) that canself-consistently explain their observed extinction curves have been alreadyproposed, it remain unclear whether and how the required dust properties can beachieved in the formation histories of the mcs. we therefore investigate thetime evolution of the dust properties of the mcs and thereby derive theirextinction curves using one-zone chemical evolution models with formation andevolution of small and large silicate and carbonaceous dust grains and dustywinds associated with starburst events. we find that the observed smcextinction curve without a conspicuous 2175 a bump can be reproduced well byour smc model, if the small carbon grains can be selectively lost through thedust wind during the latest starburst about 0.2 gyr ago. we also find that thelmc extinction curve with a weak 2175 a bump can be reproduced by our lmc modelwith less efficient removal of dust through dust wind. we discuss possiblephysical reasons for different dust wind efficiencies between silicate andgraphite and among galaxies.

1509.03978	dust processing in elliptical galaxies	we reconsider the origin and processing of dust in elliptical galaxies. wetheoretically formulate the evolution of grain size distribution, taking intoaccount dust supply from asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and dustdestruction by sputtering in the hot interstellar medium (ism), whosetemperature evolution is treated by including two cooling paths: gas emissionand dust emission (i.e. gas cooling and dust cooling). with our new fulltreatment of grain size distribution, we confirm that dust destruction bysputtering is too efficient to explain the observed dust abundance even if agbstars continue to supply dust grains, and that, except for the case where theinitial dust-to-gas ratio in the hot gas is as high as $\sim 0.01$, dustcooling is negligible compared with gas cooling. however, we show that,contrary to previous expectations, cooling does not help to protect the dust;rather, the sputtering efficiency is raised by the gas compression as a resultof cooling. we additionally consider grain growth after the gas cools down.dust growth by the accretion of gas-phase metals in the cold medium increasethe dust-to-gas ratio up to $\sim 10^{-3}$ if this process lasts &gt;10/(n_h/10^3cm^{-3}) myr, where $n_\mathrm{h}$ is the number density of hydrogen nuclei. weshow that the accretion of gas-phase metals is a viable mechanism of increasingthe dust abundance in elliptical galaxies to a level consistent withobservations, and that the steepness of observed extinction curves is betterexplained with grain growth by accretion.

astro-ph;0009460	exploring galaxy evolution from infrared number counts and cosmic  infrared background	recently reported infrared (ir) galaxy number counts and cosmic infraredbackground (cirb) all suggest that galaxies have experienced a strong evolutionsometime in their lifetime. we statistically estimate the galaxy evolutionhistory from these data. we find that an order of magnitude increase of thefar-infrared (fir) luminosity at redshift z = 0.5 - 1.0 is necessary toreproduce the very high cirb intensity at 140 um reported by hauser et al.(1998). z \sim 0.75 and decreases to, even at most, a factor of 10 toward z\sim 5, though many variants are allowed within these constraints. thisevolution history also satisfies the constraints from the galaxy number countsobtained by iras, iso and, roughly, scuba. the rapid evolution of the comovingir luminosity density required from the cirb well reproduces the very steepslope of galaxy number counts obtained by iso. we also estimate the cosmic starformation history (sfh) from the obtained fir luminosity density, consideringthe effect of the metal enrichment in galaxies. the derived sfh increasessteeply with redshift in 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.75, and becomes flat or even declines at z &gt;0.75. this is consistent with the sfh estimated from the reported ultravioletluminosity density. in addition, we present the performance of the japaneseastro-f fir galaxy survey. we show the expected number counts in the survey. wealso evaluate how large a sky area is necessary to derive a secure informationof galaxy evolution up to z \sim 1 from the survey, and find that at least 50 -300 deg^2 is required.

astro-ph;0101555	impact of future submillimeter and millimeter large facilities on the  studies of galaxy formation and evolution	we investigate what we can learn about galaxy formation and evolution fromthe data which will be obtained by the forthcoming largesubmillimeter/millimeter facilities, mainly by the atacama submillimetertelescope experiment (aste) and the atacama large millimeter array/largemillimeter and submillimeter array (alma/lmsa). we first calculate the sourcecounts from 350 um to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy number countmodel of takeuchi et al. (2001). based on the number counts, we evaluate thesource confusion and determine the confusion limit at various wavebands as afunction of the characteristic beam size. at submillimeter wavelengths, sourceconfusion with the 10-15-m class facilities becomes severe at 0.1 to 1 mjylevel, and astrometry and flux measurements will be difficult. however, we showthat very a large-area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mjycan provide a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z = 1-2. wealso find that the 5\sigma-confusion limit of the lmsa is fainter than 1 \mujy. the source counts at such faint flux levels give important information ofthe epoch of galaxy formation. we then show that multiband photometry from theinfrared (by astro-f) to the millimeter can be utilized as a redshiftestimator. in addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8-ghz source countswith our model counts to examine the contribution of star forming galaxies tothe faint radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0103231	effect of dust extinction on estimating star formation rate of galaxies:  lyman continuum extinction	we re-examine the effect of lyman continuum ($\lambda \leq 912$ \aa)extinction (lce) by dust in h {\sc ii} regions in detail and discuss how itaffects the estimation of the global star formation rate (sfr) of galaxies. toclarify the first issue, we establish two independent methods for estimating aparameter of lce ($f$), which is defined as the fraction of lyman continuumphotons contributing to hydrogen ionization in an h {\sc ii} region. one ofthose methods determines $f$ from the set of lyman continuum flux, electrondensity and metallicity. in the framework of this method, as the metallicityand/or the lyman photon flux increase, $f$ is found to decrease. the othermethod determines $f$ from the ratio of infrared flux to lyman continuum flux.importantly, we show that $f \la 0.5$ via both methods in many h {\sc ii}regions of the galaxy. thus, it establishes that dust in such h {\sc ii}regions absorbs significant amount of lyman continuum photons directly. toexamine the second issue, we approximate $f$ to a function of only thedust-to-gas mass ratio (i.e., metallicity), assuming a parameter fit for thegalactic h {\sc ii} regions. we find that a characteristic $\hat{f}$, which isdefined as $f$ averaged over a galaxy-wide scale, is 0.3 for the nearby spiralgalaxies. this relatively small $\hat{f}$ indicates that a typical incrementfactor due to lce for estimating the global sfr ($1/\hat{f}$) is large ($\sim3$) for the nearby spiral galaxies. therefore, we conclude that the effect oflce is not negligible relative to other uncertainties of estimating the sfr ofgalaxies.

astro-ph;0304473	infrared spectral energy distribution model for extremely young galaxies	the small grain sizes produced by type ii supernova (sn ii) models in young,metal-poor galaxies make the appearance of their infrared (ir) spectral energydistribution (sed) quite different from that of nearby, older galaxies. tostudy this effect, we have developed a model for the evolution of dust contentand the ir sed of low-metallicity, extremely young galaxies based on hirashitaet al. (2002). we find that, even in the intense ultraviolet (uv) radiationfield of very young galaxies, small silicate grains are subject to stochasticheating resulting in a broad temperature distribution and substantial mircontinuum emission. larger carbonaceous grains are in thermal equilibrium at t\simeq 50 - 100k, and they also contribute to the mir. we present the evolutionof seds and ir extinction of very young, low-metallicity galaxies. the irextinction curve is also shown. in the first few myrs, the emission peaks at\lambda \sim 30-50um at later times dust self-absorption decreases the apparentgrain temperatures, shifting the bulk of the emission into the submillimetreband. we successfully apply the model to the ir sed of a low metallicity (1/41z_\odot) dwarf galaxy sbs0335-052. we find the sed, optical properties andextinction of the star forming region to be consistent with a very young andcompact starburst. we also predict the sed of another extremely low-metallicitygalaxy, i zw 18, for future observational tests. some prospects for futureobservations are discussed.

astro-ph;0308531	star formation rate in galaxies from uv, ir, and h-alpha estimators	infrared (ir) luminosity of galaxies originating from dust emission can beused as an indicator of the star formation rate (sfr). inoue et al. (2000, ihk)have derived a formula for the conversion from ir luminosity to sfr by usingthe following three quantities: the fraction of lyman continuum luminosityabsorbed by gas (f), the fraction of uv luminosity absorbed by dust (epsilon),and the fraction of dust heating from old (&gt;10^8 yr) stellar populations (eta).we develop a method to estimate those three quantities based on the idea thatthe various way of sfr estimates should return the same sfr. after applying ourmethod to samples of galaxies, the following results are obtained. first, ourmethod is applied to star-forming galaxies, finding that f~0.6, epsilon~0.5,and eta~0.4 as representative values. next, we apply the method to a starburstsample, which shows larger extinction than the star-forming galaxy sample. withthe aid of f, epsilon, and eta, we estimate reliable sfrs. moreover, theh-alpha luminosity, if the h-alpha extinction is corrected by using the balmerdecrement, is suitable for a statistical analysis of sfr, because the samecorrection factor for the lyman continuum extinction is applicable to bothnormal and starburst galaxies over all the range of sfr. the metallicitydependence of f and epsilon is also tested: only the latter proves to have acorrelation with metallicity. as an extension of our result, we show that alluv, h-alpha, and ir comoving luminosity densities at z=0 give a consistent sfr(~ 3x10^{-2}h m_sun/mpc^3). useful formulae for sfr estimate are listed.

(2003) (n03), we constructed a model of dust emission fromforming galaxies on the basis of the theoretical framework of takeuchi et al.(2003) (t03). n03 showed that the produced dust species depends strongly on themixing within sne. we treated both unmixed and mixed cases and calculated theinfrared (ir) spectral energy distribution (sed) of forming galaxies for bothcases. our model sed is less luminous than the sed of t03 model by a factor of2-3. the difference is due to our improved treatment of uv photon absorptioncross section, as well as different grain size and species newly adopted inthis work. the sed for the unmixed case is found to have an enhanced near tomid-ir (n-mir) continuum radiation in its early phase of the evolution (age &lt;10^{7.25} yr) compared with that for the mixed case. the strong n--mircontinuum is due to the emission from si grains, which only exist in thespecies of the unmixed dust production. we also calculated the ir extinctioncurves for forming galaxies. then we calculated the sed of a local starburstingdwarf galaxy sbs 0335-052. our present model sed naturally reproduced thestrong n--mir continuum and the lack of cold fir emission of sbs 0335-052. wefound that only the sed of unmixed case can reproduce the nir continuum of thisgalaxy. we then made a prediction for the sed of another typical star-formingdwarf, i zw 18. we also presented the evolution of the sed of lbgs. finally, wediscussed the possibility of observing forming galaxies at z &gt; 5.

0809.0552	far-infrared properties of blue compact dwarf galaxies observed with  akari/far-infrared surveyor (fis)	we report basic far-infrared (fir) properties of eight blue compact dwarfgalaxies (bcds) observed by akari. we measure the fluxes at the four fis bands(wavelengths of 65 um, 90 um, 140 um, and 160 um). based on these fluxes, weestimate basic quantities about dust: dust temperature, dust mass, and totalfir luminosity. we find that the typical dust temperature of the bcd sample issystematically higher than that of normal spiral galaxies, although there is alarge variety. the interstellar radiation field estimated from the dusttemperature ranges up to 100 times of the galactic value. this confirms theconcentrated star-forming activity in bcds. the star formation rate can beevaluated from the fir luminosity as 0.01--0.5 $m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. combiningthis quantity with gas mass taken from the literature, we estimate the gasconsumption timescales (gas mass divided by the star formation rate), whichprove to span a wide range from 1 gyr to 100 gyr. a natural interpretation ofthis large variety can be provided by intermittent star formation activity. wefinally show the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity (we utilizeour estimate of dust mass, and take other necessary quantities from theliterature). there is a positive correlation between dust-to-gas ratio andmetallicity as expected from chemical evolution models.

astro-ph;0509261	fate of clumps in damped ly$\alpha$ systems	recent observations have revealed that damped ly$\alpha$ clouds (dlas) hoststar formation activity. in order to examine if such star formation activitycan be triggered by ionization fronts, we perform high-resolution hydrodynamicsand radiative transfer simulations of the effect of radiative feedback frompropagating ionization fronts on high-density clumps. we examine two sources ofultraviolet (uv) radiation field to which high-redshift (z ~ 3) galaxies couldbe exposed: one corresponding to the uv radiation originating from stars withinthe dla, itself, and the other corresponding to the uv background radiation. wefind that, for larger clouds, the propagating i-fronts created by local stellarsources can trigger cooling instability and collapse of significant part, up to85%, of the cloud, creating conditions for star formation in a timescale of afew myr. the passage of the i-front also triggers collapse of smaller clumps(with radii below ~4 pc), but in these cases the resulting cold and dense gasdoes not reach conditions conducive to star formation. assuming that 85% of thegas initially in the clump is converted into stars, we obtain a star formationrate of $\sim 0.25 m_\odot {yr}^{-1} {kpc}^{-2}$. this is somewhat higher thanthe value derived from recent observations. on the other hand, the backgrounduv radiation which has harder spectrum fails to trigger cooling and collapse.instead, the hard photons which have long mean-free-path heat the dense clumps,which as a result expand and essentially dissolve in the ambient medium.therefore, the star formation activity in dlas is strongly regulated by theradiative feedback, both from the external uv background and internal stellarsources and we predict quiescent evolution of dlas (not starburst-likeevolution).

astro-ph;0604191	common correlations between 60, 100 and 140 um intensities in the  galactic plane and magellanic clouds	we investigate the far-infrared sed of the galaxy and the magellanic cloudsby using the cobe (cosmic background explorer) / dirbe (diffuse infraredbackground experiment) zsma (zodi - subtracted mission average) maps atwavelengths of 60 um, 100 um and 140 um. we analyze three regions: the galacticplane region with the galactic latitude |b|&lt;5 degree, the large magellaniccloud (lmc) region, and the small magellanic cloud (smc) region. because thedust optical depth is much smaller in the far-infrared than in the visible, wemay observe cumulative far-infrared radiation from regions with variousinterstellar radiation field (irsf) in a line of sight. as consequence ofconsidering such an effect, we find a common far-infrared color correlationbetween the 140 - 100 um and 60 - 100 um intensity ratios in all the threegalaxies. although this color correlation cannot be explained by any existingmodel, it fits very well the far-infrared color of nearby star forminggalaxies.

astro-ph;0703517	far-infrared dust properties in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds	a recent data analysis of the far-infrared (fir) map of the galaxy and themagellanic clouds has shown that there is a tight correlation between two fircolours: the 60 um-100 um and 100 um-140 um colours. this fir colour relationcalled ``main correlation'' can be interpreted as indicative of a sequence ofvarious interstellar radiation fields with a common fir optical property ofgrains. in this paper, we constrain the fir optical properties of grains bycomparing the calculated fir colours with the observational main correlation.we show that neither of the ``standard'' grain species (i.e. astronomicalsilicate and graphite grains) reproduces the main correlation. however, if theemissivity index at ~ 100--200 um is changed to ~ 1--1.5 (not ~ 2 as the abovetwo species), the main correlation can be successfully explained. thus, wepropose that the fir emissivity index is ~ 1--1.5 for the dust in the galaxyand the magellanic clouds at ~ 100--200 um. we also consider the origin of theminor correlation called ``sub-correlation'', which can be used to estimate thegalactic star formation rate.

astro-ph;9812224	the iris far-infrared galaxy survey : expected number count, redshift,  and perspective	infrared imaging surveyor (iris) is a satellite which will be launched in thebeginning of 2003. one of the main purposes of the iris mission is an all-skysurvey at far-infrared (fir) with a flux limit much deeper than that of iras.in order to examine the performance of the survey, we estimated the fir galaxycounts in four (50, 70, 120, and 150 $\mu$m) bands based on some models. weadopted a multicomponent model which consists of cirrus and starburstcomponents for galaxy spectra, and the nearby fir luminosity function derivedfrom that of iras galaxies. we derived the number counts, redshiftdistributions, and infrared diffuse background radiation spectra for i) noevolution, ii) pure luminosity evolution, iii) pure density evolution with $q_0= 0.1$ and 0.5. we found that a large number of galaxies ($\sim {\rm a few}\times 10^6$ in the whole sky) will be detected in this survey. with the aid ofa vast number of detection, we will detect the effect of galaxy evolution, andevaluate the amplitude of evolution at least in the nearby universe in the irissurvey, though it will be still difficult to constrain which type of evolutiontakes place from the number count alone. we also studied the estimation ofredshifts of detected galaxies by their infrared colors alone. althoughsignificant contamination takes place among nearby faint galaxies and high-$z$ones, we found that rough estimation of galaxy redshift can be practicable byjointly using present and future optical surveys.

0812.3451	shattering and coagulation of dust grains in interstellar turbulence	we investigate shattering and coagulation of dust grains in turbulentinterstellar medium (ism). the typical velocity of dust grain as a function ofgrain size has been calculated for various ism phases based on a theory ofgrain dynamics in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. in this paper,we develop a scheme of grain shattering and coagulation and apply it toturbulent ism by using the grain velocities predicted by the above turbulencetheory. since large grains tend to acquire large velocity dispersions as shownby earlier studies, large grains tend to be shattered. large shattering effectsare indeed seen in warm ionized medium (wim) within a few myr for grains withradius $a\ga 10^{-6}$ cm. we also show that shattering in warm neutral medium(wnm) can limit the largest grain size in ism ($a\sim 2\times 10^{-5}\mathrm{cm}$). on the other hand, coagulation tends to modify small grainssince it only occurs when the grain velocity is small enough. coagulationsignificantly modifies the grain size distribution in dense clouds (dc), wherea large fraction of the grains with $a&lt;10^{-6}$ cm coagulate in 10 myr. infact, the correlation among $r_v$, the carbon bump strength, and theultraviolet slope in the observed milky way extinction curves can be explainedby the coagulation in dc. it is possible that the grain size distribution inthe milky way is determined by a combination of all the above effects ofshattering and coagulation. considering that shattering and coagulation inturbulence are effective if dust-to-gas ratio is typically more than $\sim1/10$ of the galactic value, the regulation mechanism of grain sizedistribution should be different between metal-poor and metal-richenvironments.
