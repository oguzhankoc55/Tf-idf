0902.0978	the role of molecular gas in obscuring seyfert active galactic nuclei	in a sample of local active galactic nuclei studied at a spatial resolutionon the order of 10 pc we show that the interstellar medium traced by themolecular hydrogen v=1-0 s(1) 2.1um line forms a geometrically thick, clumpydisk. the kinematics of the molecular gas reveals general rotation, although anadditional significant component of random bulk motion is required by the highlocal velocity dispersion. the size scale of the typical gas disk is found tohave a radius of ~30 pc with a comparable vertical height. within this radiusthe average gas mass is estimated to be ~10^7 msun based on a typical gas massfraction of 10%, which suggests column densities of nh ~ 5x10^23 cm^-2.extinction of the stellar continuum within this same region suggest lowercolumn densities of nh ~ 2x10^22 cm^-2, indicating that the gas distribution onthese scales is dominated by dense clumps. in half of the observed seyfertgalaxies this lower column density is still great enough to obscure the agn atoptical/infrared wavelengths. we conclude, based on the spatial distribution,kinematics, and column densities that the molecular gas observed is spatiallymixed with the nuclear stellar population and is likely to be associated withthe outer extent of any smaller scale nuclear obscuring structure. furthermore,we find that the velocity dispersion of the molecular gas is correlated withthe star formation rate per unit area, suggesting a link between the twophenomena, and that the gas surface density follows known "schmidt-kennicutt"relations. the molecular/dusty structure on these scales may be dynamic sinceit is possible that the velocity dispersion of the gas, and hence the verticaldisk height, is maintained by a short, massive inflow of material into thenuclear region and/or by intense, short-lived nuclear star formation.

0902.4701	the sins survey: modeling the dynamics of z~2 galaxies and the high-z  tully-fisher relation	we present the modeling of sinfoni integral field dynamics of 18 star forminggalaxies at z ~ 2 from halpha line emission. the galaxies are selected from thelarger sample of the sins survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotationalmotions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. the quality ofthe data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated byrotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitableexponential disk models. we obtain a good correlation between the dynamicalmass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions mgas~m*) arerequired to explain the difference between the two quantities. we use thederived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity vmax from the modeling toconstruct for the first time the stellar mass tully-fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.the relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lowerredshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. we find that at z ~ 2.2there is an offset in log(m*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11with respect to the local universe. this result is consistent with thepredictions of the latest n-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formationand evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filamentsand cooling flows. this scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidencefrom sins, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce theobserved properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.

0903.1872	the sins survey: sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of z ~ 2  star-forming galaxies	we present the sins survey with sinfoni of high redshift galaxies. with 80objects observed and 63 detected, sins is the largest survey of spatiallyresolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forminggalaxies at z~1-3. we describe the selection of the targets, the observations,and the data reduction. we then focus on the "sins halpha sample" of 62rest-uv/optically-selected sources at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.6 for which we targeted primarilythe halpha and [nii] emission lines. only 30% of this sample had previousnear-ir spectroscopic observations. as a whole, the sins halpha sample covers areasonable representation of massive log(m*/msun)&gt;~10 star-forming galaxies atz~1.5-2.5, with some bias towards bluer systems compared to pure k-selectedsamples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. the sample spans twoorders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formationrates, with median values of approximately log(m*/msun) = 10.5, 70 msun/yr, and3/gyr. the ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved onscales ranging from 1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations totypically 4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. the halpha morphologies tend to beirregular and/or clumpy. about one-third are rotation-dominated yet turbulentdisks, another third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominatedobjects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; thefraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part ofthe sample. the halpha luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on averageroughly twice higher dust attenuation towards the hii regions relative to thebulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formationrates.

0706.2656	dynamical properties of z~2 star forming galaxies and a universal star  formation relation	we present the first comparison of the dynamical properties of differentsamples of z~1.4-3.4 star forming galaxies from spatially resolved imagingspectroscopy from sinfoni/vlt integral field spectroscopy and iram comillimeter interferometry. our samples include 16 rest-frame uv-selected, 16rest-frame optically-selected and 13 submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we findthat restframe uv- and optically bright (k&lt;20) z~2 star forming galaxies aredynamically similar, and follow the same velocity-size relation as diskgalaxies at z~0. in the theoretical framework of rotating disks forming fromdissipative collapse in dark matter halos, the two samples require a spinparameter ranging from 0.06 to 0.2. in contrast bright smgs have largervelocity widths and are much more compact. hence, smgs have lower angularmomenta and higher matter densities than either of the uv- or opticallyselected populations. this indicates that dissipative major mergers maydominate the smgs population, resulting in early spheroids, and that themajority of uv/optically bright galaxies have evolved less violently [...].these early disks may later evolve into spheroids via disk instabilities ormergers. because of their small sizes and large densities, smgs lie at the highsurface density end of a universal (out to z=2.5) "schmidt-kennicutt" relationbetween gas surface density and star formation rate surface density with aslope of ~1.7.

0905.1577	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest). iv. comparison of 1-jy  ultraluminous infrared galaxies with palomar-green quasars	we report the results from a comprehensive study of 74 ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) and 34 palomar-green (pg) quasars within z ~ 0.3$ observedwith the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the contribution of nuclearactivity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using sixindependent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent resultswithin ~ +/-10-15% on average. the average derived agn contribution in ulirgsis ~35-40%, ranging from ~15-35% among "cool" (f_25/f_60 =&lt; 0.2) opticallyclassified hii-like and liner ulirgs to ~50 and ~75% among warm seyfert 2 andseyfert 1 ulirgs, respectively. this number exceeds ~80% in pg qsos. ulirgsfall in one of three distinct agn classes: (1) objects with small extinctionsand large pah equivalent widths are highly starburst-dominated; (2) systemswith large extinctions and modest pah equivalent widths have larger agncontributions, but still tend to be starburst-dominated; and (3) ulirgs withboth small extinctions and small pah equivalent widths host agn that are atleast as powerful as the starbursts. the agn contributions in class 2 ulirgsare more uncertain than in the other objects, and we cannot formally rule outthe possibility that these objects represent a physically distinct type ofulirgs. a morphological trend is seen along the sequence (1)-(2)-(3), ingeneral agreement with the standard ulirg - qso evolution scenario andsuggestive of a broad peak in extinction during the intermediate stages ofmerger evolution. however, the scatter in this sequence, implies that blackhole accretion, in addition to depending on the merger phase, also has a strongchaotic/random component, as in local agn.

0704.1374	a close look at star formation around active galactic nuclei	we analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 seyfert galaxies at spatialresolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than10pc in some objects. our data were taken mostly with the near infraredadaptive optics integral field spectrograph sinfoni. the stellar light profilestypically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. in two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. in thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300myr. the stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the agn in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. the surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}l_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4m_sun/pc^2. the intense starbursts were probably eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. the data hint at a delay of 50--100myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. we discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. while a significant mass is ejected by ob winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.on the other hand winds from agb stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

0907.4777	high-redshift star-forming galaxies: angular momentum and baryon  fraction, turbulent pressure effects and the origin of turbulence	the structure of a sample of high-redshift (z=2), rotating galaxies with highstar formation rates and turbulent gas velocities of sigma=40-80 km/s isinvestigated. fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with amo, mao, white (1998) (mmw) model requires unusually large disk spin parameterslambda_d&gt;0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmicbaryon fraction. the galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with1&lt;vmax/sigma&lt;3, maximum rotational velocities vmax&lt;200 km/s and disk half-lightradii rd=1-3 kpc and rotation-dominated systems with vmax&gt;200 km/s,vmax/sigma&gt;3 and rd=4-8 kpc. for the dispersion-dominated sample, radialpressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing therotational velocities. including this pressure effect in the mmw model,dispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lflambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and withlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05. these values are in good agreement withcosmological expectations. for the rotation-dominated sample however pressureeffects are small and better agreement with theoretically expected disk spinparameters can only be achieved if the dark halo mass contribution in thevisible disk regime (2-3*rd) is smaller than predicted by the mmw model. weargue that these galaxies can still be embedded in standard cold dark matterhalos if the halos did not contract adiabatically in response to diskformation. it is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of thegalaxies are consistent with a toomre instability parameter q=1 which is equalto the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be themajor driver of turbulence. the dominant energy source of turbulence is thenthe potential energy of the gas in the disk.

0908.2177	an extremely top-heavy imf in the galactic center stellar disks	we present new observations of the nuclear star cluster in the central parsecof the galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field spectrographsinfoni on the eso/vlt. our work allows the spectroscopic detection of earlyand late type stars to m_k &gt;= 16, more than 2 magnitudes deeper than ourprevious data sets. our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fideearly-type stars. we find that most of these wolf rayet (wr), o- and b- starsreside in two strongly warped disks between 0.8" and 12" from sgra*, as well asa central compact concentration (the s-star cluster) centered on sgra*. thelater type b stars (m_k&gt;15) in the radial interval between 0.8" and 12" seem tobe in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. the observed dearth oflate type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowingfor stellar collisions. the stellar mass function of the disk stars isextremely top heavy with a best fit power law of dn/dm ~ m^(-0.45+/-0.3). sinceat least the wr/o-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6myrs ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (imf).the mass functions of the s-stars inside 0.8" and of the early-type stars atdistances beyond 12" are compatible with a standard salpeter/kroupa imf (bestfit power law of dn/dm ~ m^(-2.15+/-0.3)).

0911.4355	[the impact of nuclear star formation on gas inflow to agn	our adaptive optics observations of nearby agn at spatial resolutions assmall as 0.085arcsec show strong evidence for recent, but no longer active,nuclear star formation. we begin by describing observations that highlight twocontrasting methods by which gas can flow into the central tens of parsecs. gasaccumulation in this region will inevitably lead to a starburst, and we discussthe evidence for such events. we then turn to the impact of stellar evolutionon the further inflow of gas by combining a phenomenological approach withanalytical modelling and hydrodynamic simulations. these complementaryperspectives paint a picture in which all the processes are ultimatelyregulated by the mass accretion rate into the central hundred parsecs, and theensuing starburst that occurs there. the resulting supernovae delay accretionby generating a starburst wind, which leaves behind a clumpy interstellarmedium. this provides an ideal environment for slower stellar outflows toaccrete inwards and form a dense turbulent disk on scales of a few parsecs.such a scenario may resolve the discrepancy between the larger scale structureseen with adaptive optics and the small scale structure seen with vlti.

0911.5566	gravity-driven lyman-alpha blobs from cold streams into galaxies	we use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical amr simulations to predictthe characteristics of la emission from the cold gas streams that fed galaxiesin massive haloes at high redshift. the la luminosity in our simulations ispowered by the release of gravitational energy as gas flows from theintergalactic medium into the halo potential wells. the uv backgroundcontributes only &lt;20% to the gas heating. the la emissivity is due primarily toelectron-impact excitation cooling radiation in gas ~2x10^4k. we calculate thela emissivities assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium (cie) at all gastemperatures. the simulated streams are self-shielded against the uvbackground, so photoionisation and recombination contribute negligibly to thela line formation. we produce theoretical maps of the la surface brightnesses,assuming that ~85% of the la photons are directly observable. we find thattypical haloes of mass mv~10^12-13 msun at z~3 emit as la blobs (labs) withluminosities 10^43-44 erg/s. most of the la comes from the extended narrow,partly clumpy, inflowing, cold streams that feed the growing galaxies. thepredicted lab morphology is therefore irregular, with dense clumps andelongated extensions. the linewidth is expected to range from 10^2 to more than10^3 km/s with a large variance. the typical la surface brightness profile isproportional to r^-1.2 where r is the distance from the halo centre. oursimulated labs are similar in luminosity, morphology and extent to the observedlabs, with distinct kinematic features. the predicted la luminosity function isconsistent with observations, and the predicted areas and linewidths roughlyrecover the observed scaling relations. this mechanism for producing labsappears inevitable in many high-z galaxies. some of the labs may thus beregarded as direct detections of the cold streams that drove galaxy evolutionat high z.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

1104.0248	constraints on the assembly and dynamics of galaxies. ii. properties of  kiloparsec-scale clumps in rest-frame optical emission of z ~ 2 star-forming  galaxies	we study the properties of luminous stellar clumps identified in deep, highresolution hst/nic2 f160w imaging at 1.6um of six z~2 star-forming galaxieswith existing near-ir integral field spectroscopy from sinfoni at the vlt.individual clumps contribute ~0.5%-15% of the galaxy-integrated rest-frame~5000a emission, with median of about 2%; the total contribution of clump lightranges from 10%-25%. the median intrinsic clump size and stellar mass are ~1kpcand log(mstar[msun])~9, in the ranges for clumps identified in rest-uv or lineemission in other studies. the clump sizes and masses in the subset of disksare broadly consistent with expectations for clump formation via gravitationalinstabilities in gas-rich, turbulent disks given the host galaxies' globalproperties. by combining the nic2 data with acs/f814w imaging available for onesource, and ao-assisted sinfoni halpha data for another, we infer modest color,m/l, and stellar age variations within each galaxy. in these two objects, setsof clumps identified at different wavelengths do not fully overlap;nic2-identified clumps tend to be redder/older than acs- or halpha-identifiedclumps without rest-frame optical counterparts. there is evidence for asystematic trend of older ages at smaller galactocentric radii among theclumps, consistent with scenarios where inward migration of clumps transportsmaterial towards the central regions. from constraints on a bulge-likecomponent at radii &lt;1-3kpc, none of the five disks in our sample appears tocontain a compact massive stellar core, and we do not discern a trend of bulgestellar mass fraction with stellar age of the galaxy. further observations arenecessary to probe the build-up of stellar bulges and the role of clumps inthis process.

1105.1731	massive molecular outflows and negative feedback in ulirgs observed by  herschel-pacs	mass outflows driven by stars and active galactic nuclei are a key element inmany current models of galaxy evolution. they may produce the observed blackhole-galaxy mass relation and regulate and quench both star formation in thehost galaxy and black hole accretion. however, observational evidence of suchfeedback processes through outflows of the bulk of the star forming moleculargas is still scarce. here we report the detection of massive molecularoutflows, traced by the hydroxyl molecule (oh), in far-infrared spectra ofulirgs obtained with herschel-pacs as part of the shining key project. in someof these objects the (terminal) outflow velocities exceed 1000 km/s, and theiroutflow rates (up to ~1200 m_sol/yr) are several times larger than their starformation rates. we compare the outflow signatures in different types of ulirgsand in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (agn orstarburst) of these outflows. we report preliminary evidence that ulirgs with ahigher agn luminosity (and higher agn contribution to l_ir) have higherterminal velocities and shorter gas depletion time scales. the outflows in theobserved ulirgs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centres ofthese objects within ~1e6-1e8 years.

1106.2098	the metallicity dependence of the co {\rightarrow} h_2 conversion factor  in z&gt;1 star forming galaxies	we use the first systematic samples of co millimeter emission in z&gt;1'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (sfgs) to study the metallicitydependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}co, from co line luminosity tomolecular gas mass. the molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio ofthe star formation rate (sfr) to co luminosity, is ~1 gyr-1 for near-solarmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above m_s~1e11 m_sun. in this regimethe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as afunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. belowm_s the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. we arguethat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physicalparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamentalmetallicity-sfr-stellar mass relation. a more probable explanation is that theconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in'co-dark' gas. the trend is also expected theoretically from the effect ofenhanced photodissociation of co by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.from the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of thelog({\alpha}co) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairlyinsensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formationactivity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas massesestimated from co luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward forgalaxies below m_s.

1108.0285	how well can we measure the intrinsic velocity dispersion of distant  disk galaxies?	the kinematics of distant galaxies, from z=0.1 to z&gt;2, play a key role in ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution from early times to the present. one of theimportant parameters is the intrinsic, or local, velocity dispersion of agalaxy, which allows one to quantify the degree of non-circular motions such aspressure support. however, this is difficult to measure because the observeddispersion includes the effects of (often severe) beam smearing on the velocitygradient. here we investigate four methods of measuring the dispersion thathave been used in the literature, to assess their effectiveness at recoveringthe intrinsic dispersion. we discuss the biasses inherent in each method, andapply them to model disk galaxies in order to determine which methods yieldmeaningful quantities, and under what conditions. all the mean weighteddispersion estimators are affected by (residual) beam smearing. in contrast,the dispersion recovered by fitting a spatially and spectrally convolved diskmodel to the data is unbiassed by the beam smearing it is trying to compensate.because of this, and because the bias it does exhibit depends only on thesignal-to-noise, it can be considered reliable. however, at very lowsignal-to-noise, all methods should be used with caution.

1110.1633	the star formation history of the milky way's nuclear star cluster	we present spatially resolved imaging and integral field spectroscopy datafor 450 cool giant stars within 1\,pc from sgr\,a*. we use the prominent cobandheads to derive effective temperatures of individual giants. additionallywe present the deepest spectroscopic observation of the galactic center so far,probing the number of b9/a0 main sequence stars ($2.2-2.8\,m_\odot$) in twodeep fields. from spectro-photometry we construct a hertzsprung-russell diagramof the red giant population and fit the observed diagram with model populationsto derive the star formation history of the nuclear cluster.  we find that (1) the average nuclear star-formation rate dropped from aninitial maximum $\sim10$\,gyrs ago to a deep minimum 1-2\,gyrs ago andincreased again during the last few hundred myrs, and (2) that roughly 80% ofthe stellar mass formed more than 5\,gyrs ago; (3) mass estimates within $\rmr\sim1\,pc$ from sgr\,a* favor a dominant star formation mode with a 'normal'chabrier/kroupa initial mass function for the majority of the past starformation in the galactic center. the bulk stellar mass seems to have formedunder conditions significantly different from the young stellar disks, perhapsbecause at the time of the formation of the nuclear cluster the massive blackhole and its sphere of influence was much smaller than today.

1111.3816	dense molecular gas around agn: hcn/co in ngc3227	there is now convincing evidence that the intensity of hcn molecular lineemission is enhanced around active galactic nuclei. in this paper we examinethe specific case of the seyfert galaxy ngc3227, for which there aresubarcsecond resolution data for the hcn (1-0) 88 ghz and co (2-1) 230 ghzrotational lines, enabling us to spatially separate a circumnuclear ring at aradius of 140pc and an inner nuclear region within 40pc of the agn. thehcn(1-0)/co(2-1) flux ratio differs by more than an order of magnitude betweenthese two regions. we carry out large velocity gradient (lvg) computations todetermine the range of parameters (gas temperature and density, hcn/coabundance ratio, column densities and velocity gradients) that yield physicallyplausible solutions for the observed flux ratio in the central 100pc. theobserved hcn/co intensity ratio in the nucleus is consistent with veryoptically thick thermalized emission in very dense (&gt;=10^5cm^{-3}) gas, inwhich case the hcn/co abundance ratio there is unconstrained. alternatively,the hcn/co intensity ratio could be due to optically thinner emissions but withvery high (~10^{-2}) hcn/co abundance ratios. this possibility is moreconsistent with the co and hcn emissions seen in the nuclei of the seyfertgalaxies ngc1068 and ngc6951. it would imply the velocity gradients are largeand the clouds may be gravitationally unbound. we estimate that the x-rayionisation rate at radii less than 20pc in the centre of ngc3227 exceeds10^{-13}s^{-1}. x-ray ionisation and heating may lead to high hcn/co ratios inwarm gas in a high-ionisation molecular phase near the agn.

1202.5746	herschel-pacs observations of far-ir co line emission in ngc 1068:  highly excited molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk	we report the detection of far-ir co rotational emission from theprototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. using herschel-pacs, we have detected11 transitions in the j_upper=14-30 (e_upper/k_b = 580-2565 k) range, all ofwhich are consistent with arising from within the central 10" (700 pc). thedetected transitions are modeled as arising from 2 different components: amoderate excitation (me) component close to the galaxy systemic velocity, and ahigh excitation (he) component that is blueshifted by ~80 km s^{-1}. we employa large velocity gradient (lvg) model and derive n_h2~10^{5.6} cm^{-3},t_kin~170 k, and m_h2~10^{6.7} m_sun for the me component, and n_h2~10^{6.4}cm^{-3}, t_kin~570 k, and m_h2~10^{5.6} m_sun for the he component, althoughfor both components the uncertainties in the density and mass are plus/minus(0.6-0.9) dex. we compare the co line profiles with those of other moleculartracers observed at higher spatial and spectral resolution, and find that theme transitions are consistent with these lines arising in the ~200 pc diameterring of material traced by h_2 1-0 s(1) observations. the blueshift of the helines may also be consistent with the bluest regions of this h_2 ring, but abetter kinematic match is found with a clump of infalling gas ~40 pc north ofthe agn. we discuss the prospects of placing the he component near the agn, andconclude that while the moderate thermal pressure precludes an association withthe ~1 pc radius h_2o maser disk, the he component could potentially be locatedonly a few parsecs more distant from the agn, and might then provide then_h~10^{25} cm^{-2} column obscuring the nuclear hard x-rays. finally, we alsoreport sensitive upper limits extending up to j_upper=50, which placeconstraints on a previous model prediction for the co emission from the x-rayobscuring torus.

1205.4242	physical properties of dense molecular gas in centres of seyfert  galaxies	we present new ~1" resolution data of the dense molecular gas in the central50-100 pc of four nearby seyfert galaxies. pdbi observations of hcn and, in 2of the 4 sources, simultaneously hco+ allow us to carefully constrain thedynamical state of the dense gas surrounding the agn. analysis of thekinematics shows large line widths of 100-200 km/s fwhm that can only partiallyarise from beam smearing of the velocity gradient. the observed morphologicaland kinematic parameters (dimensions, major axis position angle, red and bluechannel separation, and integrated line width) are well reproduced by a thickdisk, where the emitting dense gas has a large intrinsic dispersion (20-40km/s), implying that it exists at significant scale heights (25-30% of the diskradius). to put the observed kinematics in the context of the starburst and agnevolution, we estimate the toomre q parameter. we find this is always greaterthan the critical value, i.e. q is above the limit such that the gas is stableagainst rapid star formation. this is supported by the lack of direct evidence,in these 4 seyfert galaxies, for on-going star formation close around the agn.instead, any current star formation tends to be located in a circumnuclearring. we conclude that the physical conditions are indeed not suited to starformation within the central ~100 pc.

1211.5064	excited oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220	we report on herschel/pacs observations of absorption lines of oh+, h2o+ andh3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220. excited lines of oh+ and h2o+ with e_lower of atleast 285 and \sim200 k, respectively, are detected in both sources, indicatingradiative pumping and location in the high radiation density environment of thenuclear regions. abundance ratios oh+/h2o+ of 1-2.5 are estimated in the nucleiof both sources. the inferred oh+ column and abundance relative to h nuclei are(0.5-1)x10^{16} cm-2 and \sim2x10^{-8}, respectively. additionally, in arp 220,an extended low excitation component around the nuclear region is found to haveoh+/h2o+\sim5-10. h3o+ is detected in both sources withn(h3o+)\sim(0.5-2)x10^{16} cm-2, and in arp 220 the pure inversion, metastablelines indicate a high rotational temperature of ~500 k, indicative of formationpumping and/or hot gas. simple chemical models favor an ionization sequencedominated by h+ - o+ - oh+ - h2o+ - h3o+, and we also argue that the h+production is most likely dominated by x-ray/cosmic ray ionization. the fullset of observations and models leads us to propose that the molecular ionsarise in a relatively low density (\gtrsim10^4 cm-3) interclump medium, inwhich case the ionization rate per h nucleus (including secondary ionizations)is zeta&gt;10^{-13} s-1, a lower limit that is severalx10^2 times the highest rateestimates for galactic regions. in arp 220, our lower limit for zeta iscompatible with estimates for the cosmic ray energy density inferred previouslyfrom the supernova rate and synchrotron radio emission, and also with theexpected ionization rate produced by x-rays. in ngc 4418, we argue that x-rayionization due to an agn is responsible for the molecular ion production.

1211.5743	phibss: molecular gas content and scaling relations in z~1-3 normal star  forming galaxies	we present phibss, the iram plateau de bure high-z blue sequence co 3-2survey of the molecular gas properties in normal star forming galaxies (sfgs)near the cosmic star formation peak. phibss provides 52 co detections in tworedshift slices at z~1.2 and 2.2, with log(m*(m_solar))&gt;10.4 andlog(sfr(m_solar/yr))&gt;1.5. including a correction for the incomplete coverage ofthe m*-sfr plane, we infer average gas fractions of ~0.33 at z~1.2 and ~0.47 atz~2.2. gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmologicalsimulations including strong star formation feedback. most of the z~1-3 sfgsare rotationally supported turbulent disks. the sizes of co and uv/opticalemission are comparable. the molecular gas - star formation relation for thez=1-3 sfgs is near-linear, with a ~0.7 gyrs gas depletion timescale; changes indepletion time are only a secondary effect. since this timescale is much lessthan the hubble time in all sfgs between z~0 and 2, fresh gas must be suppliedwith a fairly high duty cycle over several billion years. at given z and m*,gas fractions correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate. thevariation of specific star formation rate between z~0 and 3 is mainlycontrolled by the fraction of baryonic mass that resides in cold gas.

1301.0628	towards a resolved kennicutt-schmidt law at high redshift	massive galaxies in the distant universe form stars at much higher rates thantoday. although direct resolution of the star forming regions of these galaxiesis still a challenge, recent molecular gas observations at the iram plateau debure interferometer enable us to study the star formation efficiency onsubgalactic scales around redshift z = 1.2. we present a method for obtainingthe gas and star formation rate (sfr) surface densities of ensembles of clumpscomposing galaxies at this redshift, even though the corresponding scales arenot resolved. this method is based on identifying these structures inposition-velocity diagrams corresponding to slices within the galaxies. we useunique iram observations of the co(3-2) rotational line and deep2 spectra offour massive star forming distant galaxies - egs13003805, egs13004291,egs12007881, and egs13019128 in the aegis terminology - to determine the gasand sfr surface densities of the identifiable ensembles of clumps thatconstitute them. the integrated co line luminosity is assumed to be directlyproportional to the total gas mass, and the sfr is deduced from the [oii] line.we identify the ensembles of clumps with the angular resolution available inboth co and [oii] spectroscopy; i.e., 1-1.5". sfr and gas surface densities areaveraged in areas of this size, which is also the thickness of the deep2 slitsand of the extracted iram slices, and we derive a spatially resolvedkennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on a scale of ~8 kpc. the data generallyindicates an average depletion time of 1.9 gyr, but with significant variationsfrom point to point within the galaxies.

1306.6676	nebular excitation in z~2 star-forming galaxies from the sins and luci  surveys: the influence of shocks and agn	based on high-resolution, spatially resolved data of 10 z~2 star-forminggalaxies from the sins/zc-sinf survey and luci data for 12 additional galaxies,we probe the excitation properties of high-z galaxies and the impact of activegalactic nuclei (agn), shocks and photoionization. we explore how thesespatially-resolved line ratios can inform our interpretation of integratedemission line ratios obtained at high redshift. many of our galaxies fall inthe `composite' region of the z~0 [nii]/ha versus [oiii]/hb diagnostic (bpt)diagram, between star-forming galaxies and those with agn. based on ourresolved measurements, we find that some of these galaxies likely host an agn,while others appear to be affected by the presence of shocks possibly caused byan outflow or from enhanced ionization parameter as compared with hii regionsin normal local star-forming galaxies. we find that the mass-excitation (mex)diagnostic, which separates purely star-forming and agn hosting local galaxiesin the [oiii]/hb versus stellar mass plane, does not properly separate z~2galaxies classified according to the bpt diagram. however, if we shift thegalaxies based on the offset between the local and z~2 mass-metallicityrelation (i.e. to the mass they would have at z~0 with the same metallicity),we find better agreement between the mex and bpt diagnostics. finally, we findthat metallicity calibrations based on [nii]/ha are more biased by shocks andagn at high-z than the [oiii]/hb/[nii]/ha calibration.

1307.2366	a multi-wavelength investigation of the radio-loud supernova ptf11qcj  and its circumstellar environment	we present the discovery, classification, and extensive panchromatic (fromradio to x-ray) follow-up observations of ptf11qcj, a supernova discovered bythe palomar transient factory. ptf11qcj is located at a distance of dl ~ 124mpc. our observations with the karl g. jansky very large array show that thisevent is radio-loud: ptf11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable tothat of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated supernova 1998bw (l_{5ghz} ~10^{29} erg/s/hz). ptf11qcj is also detected in x-rays with the chandraobservatory, and in the infrared band with spitzer. our multi-wavelengthanalysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material. theradio observations suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of ~10^{-4} msun/yr x(v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest moving ejecta(at ~10d after explosion). however, these estimates are derived assuming thesimplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellarmaterial characterized by radial power-law density profile, and do not accountfor possible inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.the radio light curve shows deviations from such a simple model, as well as are-brightening at late times. the x-ray flux from ptf11qcj is compatible withthe high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission (within thelarge uncertainties). an ir light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreementwith our infrared data. our analysis of pre-explosion data from the palomartransient factory suggests that a precursor eruption of absolute magnitude m_r~ -13 mag may have occurred ~ 2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion. based onour panchromatic follow-up campaign, we conclude that ptf11qcj fits theexpectations from the explosion of a wolf-rayet star. precursor eruptions maybe a feature characterizing the final pre-explosion evolution of such stars.

1308.3139	fast molecular outflows in luminous galaxy mergers: evidence for quasar  feedback from herschel	we report the results from a systematic search for molecular (oh-119 um)outflows with herschel-pacs in a sample of 43 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) galaxy mergers,mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos. we find that thecharacter of the oh feature (strength of the absorption relative to theemission) correlates with that of the 9.7-um silicate feature, a measure ofobscuration in ulirgs. unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based onthe detection of oh absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshiftedthan -50 km/sec, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 oh-detected targets, suggestinga wide-angle (~145 degrees) outflow geometry. conversely, unambiguous evidencefor molecular inflows, based on the detection of oh absorption profiles withmedian velocities more redshifted than +50 km/sec, is seen in only 4 objects,suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. terminaloutflow velocities of ~-1000 km/sec are measured in several objects, but medianoutflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s^{-1}. while the outflow velocitiesshow no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, theyare distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large agn fractions andluminosities [log (l_agn / l_sun) &gt; 11.8 +/- 0.3]. the quasars in these systemsplay a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. in contrast, the mostagn dominated systems, where oh is seen purely in emission, show relativelymodest oh line widths, despite their large agn luminosities, perhaps indicatingthat molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through theobscuring material.

1310.3838	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for  gravitational quenching	as part of the sins/zc-sinf surveys of high-z galaxy kinematics, we derivethe radial distributions of h-alpha surface brightness, stellar mass surfacedensity, and dynamical mass at ~2 kpc resolution in 19 z~2 star-forming diskswith deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. from these data we infer theradial distribution of the toomre q-parameter for these main-sequence starforming galaxies (sfgs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (10^9.6 to10^11.5 solar masses). in more than half of our sfgs, the h-alpha distributionscannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, butare better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and anexponential. at the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of amass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponentialdistribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. the resulting q-distributions arecentrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for threequarters of the sfgs. the occurrence of h-alpha rings and of large nuclearq-values is strongly correlated, and is more common for the more massive sfgs.while our sample is small and there remain substantial uncertainties andcaveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloudfragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas richhigh-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of thedisks grows.

1311.0147	on the source of the dust extinction in type ia supernovae and the  discovery of anomalously strong na i absorption	high-dispersion observations of the na i d 5890, 5896 and k i 7665, 7699interstellar lines, and the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms in thespectra of 32 type ia supernovae are used as an independent means of probingdust extinction. we show that the dust extinction of the objects where thediffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms is detected is consistent with thevisual extinction derived from the supernova colors. this strongly suggeststhat the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar materialassociated with the progenitor system. one quarter of the supernovae displayanomalously large na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dustextinction derived from their colors. remarkably, all of the cases of unusuallystrong na i d absorption correspond to "blueshifted" profiles in theclassification scheme of sternberg et al. (2011). this coincidence suggeststhat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the casesof anomalously large na i column densities. two supernovae with unusuallystrong na i d absorption showed essentially normal k i column densities for thedust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be auniversal characteristic. overall, we find the most accurate predictor ofindividual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuseinterstellar band at 5780 angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for itsuse. finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the naabundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate anddouble-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.

1311.3645	multi-epoch high-spectral-resolution observations of neutral sodium in  14 type ia supernovae	one of the main questions concerning type ia supernovae is the nature of thebinary companion of the exploding white dwarf. a major discriminant betweendifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties ofcircumstellar material at the time of explosion. if present, this material willbe ionized by the ultra-violet radiation of the explosion and later recombine.this ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variableabsorption features that can be detected via multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution observations. previous studies have shown that thestrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium d lines. we report onobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epochhigh-resolution spectra of 14 type ia supernova events. this is the firstmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple sne. no variability inline strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.we find that ~18% of the events in the extended sample exhibit time-variablesodium features associated with circumstellar material. we explore theimplication of this study on our understanding of the progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae via the current type ia supernova multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution sample.

1409.1171	combined co &amp; dust scaling relations of depletion time and molecular gas  fractions with cosmic time, specific star formation rate and stellar mass	we combine molecular gas masses inferred from co emission in 500 star forminggalaxies (sfgs) between z=0 and 3, from the iram-coldgass, phibss1/2 and othersurveys, with gas masses derived from herschel far-ir dust measurements in 512galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. we constrain thescaling relations of molecular gas depletion time scale (tdepl) and gas tostellar mass ratio (mmolgas/m*) of sfgs near the star formation main-sequencewith redshift, specific star formation rate (ssfr) and stellar mass (m*). theco- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. this suggests thatthe co-h2 mass conversion factor varies little within 0.6dex of the mainsequence (ssfr(ms,z,m*)), and less than 0.3dex throughout this redshift range.this study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. we find thattdepl scales as (1+z)^-0.3 *(ssfr/ssfr(ms,z,m*))^-0.5, with little dependenceon m*. the resulting steep redshift dependence of mmolgas/m* ~(1+z)^3 mirrorsthat of the ssfr and probably reflects the gas supply rate. the decreasing gasfractions at high m* are driven by the flattening of the sfr-m* relation.throughout the redshift range probed a larger ssfr at constant m* is due to acombination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale. as a result galaxy integrated samples of the mmolgas-sfr rate relationexhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of ssfr. withthese new relations it is now possible to determine mmolgas with an accuracy of0.1dex in relative terms, and 0.2dex including systematic uncertainties.

1504.01104	obscuration in agns: near-infrared luminosity relations and dust colors	we combine two approaches to isolate the agn luminosity at near-infraredwavelengths and relate the near-ir pure agn luminosity to other tracers of theagn. using integral-field spectroscopic data of an archival sample of 51 localagns, we estimate the fraction of non-stellar light by comparing the nuclearequivalent width of the stellar 2.3 micron co absorption feature with theintrinsic value for each galaxy. we compare this fraction to that derived froma spectral decomposition of the integrated light in the central arc second andfind them to be consistent with each other. using our estimates of the near-iragn light, we find a strong correlation with presumably isotropic agn tracers.we show that a significant offset exists between type 1 and type 2 sources inthe sense that type 1 sources are 7 (10) times brighter in the near-ir at logl_mir = 42.5 (log l_x = 42.5). these offsets only becomes clear when treatinginfrared type 1 sources as type 1 agns.  all agns have very red near-to-mid-ir dust colors. this, as well as the rangeof observed near-ir temperatures, can be explained with a simple model withonly two free parameters: the obscuration to the hot dust and the ratio betweenthe warm and hot dust areas. we find obscurations of a_v (hot) = 5 - 15 mag forinfrared type 1 sources and a_v (hot) = 15 - 35 mag for type 2 sources. theratio of hot dust to warm dust areas of about 1000 is nicely consistent withthe ratio of radii of the respective regions as found by infraredinterferometry.

1505.00536	insights on the dusty torus and neutral torus from optical and x-ray  obscuration in a complete volume limited hard x-ray agn sample	we describe a complete volume limited sample of nearby active galaxiesselected by their 14-195kev luminosity, and outline its rationale for studyingthe mechanisms regulating gas inflow and outflow. we describe also acomplementary sample of inactive galaxies, selected to match the agn hostgalaxy properties. the active sample appears to have no bias in terms of agntype, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is twoorders of magnitude greater for the seyfert 2s. in the luminosity range spannedby the sample, log l_{14-195kev} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscuredand x-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65%. the similarity of these fractions tomore distant spectroscopic agn samples, although over a limited luminosityrange, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. oursample confirms that x-ray unabsorbed seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not morethan a few percent of the seyfert 2 population. at higher luminosities, theoptically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dustsublimation radius), but the x-ray absorbed fraction changes little. we arguethat the cold x-ray absorption in these seyfert 1s can be accounted for byneutral gas in clouds that also contribute to the broad line region (blr)emission; and suggest that a geometrically thick neutral gas torus co-existswith the blr and bridges the gap to the dusty torus.

1508.07165	a deep herschel/pacs observation of co(40-39) in ngc 1068: a search for  the molecular torus	emission from high-j co lines in galaxies has long been proposed as a tracerof x-ray dominated regions (xdrs) produced by agn. of particular interest isthe question of whether the obscuring torus, which is required by agnunification models, can be observed via high-j co cooling lines. here we reporton the analysis of a deep herschel-pacs observation of an extremely high j cotransition (40-39) in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. the line was not detected,with a derived 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $2 \times10^{-17}\,\text{w}\,\text{m}^{-2}$. we apply an xdr model in order toinvestigate whether the upper limit constrains the properties of a moleculartorus in ngc 1068. the xdr model predicts the co spectral line energydistributions for various gas densities and illuminating x-ray fluxes. in ourmodel, the co(40-39) upper limit is matched by gas with densities $\sim10^{6}-10^{7}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, located at $1.6-5\,\text{pc}$ from the agn,with column densities of at least $10^{25}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. at such highcolumn densities, however, dust absorbs most of the co(40-39) line emission at$\lambda = 65.69\, \mu$m. therefore, even if ngc 1068 has a molecular toruswhich radiates in the co(40-39) line, the dust can attenuate the line emissionto below the pacs detection limit. the upper limit is thus consistent with theexistence of a molecular torus in ngc 1068. in general, we expect that theco(40-39) is observable in only a few agn nuclei (if at all), because of therequired high gas column density, and absorption by dust.

0807.1184	from rings to bulges: evidence for rapid secular galaxy evolution at z~2  from integral field spectroscopy in the sins survey	we present ha integral field spectroscopy of well resolved, uv/opticallyselected z~2 star-forming galaxies as part of the sins survey with sinfoni onthe eso vlt. our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show thepresence of turbulent rotating star forming rings/disks, plus centralbulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to total dynamicalmass appears to scale with [nii]/ha flux ratio and star formation age. wepropose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies atz~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. highredshift disks exhibit large random motions. this turbulence may in part bestirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid cold accretionflows along the filaments of the cosmic web. as a result dynamical friction andviscous processes proceed on a time scale of &lt;1 gyr, at least an order ofmagnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. early secular evolution thus drivesgas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks andmassive bulges, even without major mergers. secular evolution along withincreased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also helpto account for the short time scales of the stellar buildup observed in massivegalaxies at z~2.

0808.0194	mergers and mass accretion rates in galaxy assembly: the millennium  simulation compared to observations of z~2 galaxies	recent observations of uv-/optically selected, massive star forming galaxiesat z~2 indicate that the baryonic mass assembly and star formation history isdominated by continuous rapid accretion of gas and internal secular evolution,rather than by major mergers. we use the millennium simulation to build newhalo merger trees, and extract halo merger fractions and mass accretion rates.we find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretionrates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation ratesobserved in z~2 disks. on the other hand, the fraction of major mergers in themillennium simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts ofsubmillimeter galaxies (smgs), in support of observational evidence that theseare major mergers. when following the fate of these two populations in themillennium simulation to z=0, we find that subsequent mergers are not frequentenough to convert all z~2 turbulent disks into elliptical galaxies at z=0.similarly, mergers cannot transform the compact smgs/red sequence galaxies atz~2 into observed massive cluster ellipticals at z=0. we argue therefore, thatsecular and internal evolution must play an important role in the evolution ofa significant fraction of z~2 uv-/optically and submillimeter selected galaxypopulations.

astro-ph;0002008	iso-sws spectroscopy of ngc 1068	we present iso-sws spectroscopy of ngc 1068 for the wavelength range 2.4 to45um, detecting a total of 36 emission lines. most of the observed transitionsare fine structure and recombination lines originating in the narrow lineregion. we compare the line profiles of optical lines and reddening-insensitiveinfrared lines to constrain the dynamical structure and extinction propertiesof the nlr. the considerable differences found are most likely explained by twoeffects. (1) the spatial structure of the nlr is a combination of a highlyionized outflow cone and lower excitation extended emission. (2) parts of thenlr, mainly in the receding part at velocities above systemic, are subject toextinction that is significantly suppressing optical emission. line asymmetriesand net blueshifts remain, however, even for infrared fine structure linessuffering very little obscuration. this may be either due to an intrinsicasymmetry of the nlr, or due to a very high column density obscuring componentwhich is hiding part of the nlr even from infrared view. mid-infrared emissionof molecular hydrogen in ngc 1068 arises in a dense molecular medium attemperatures of a few hundred kelvin that is most likely closely related to thewarm and dense components seen in the near-infrared h2 transitions, and inmillimeter wave tracers of molecular gas. any emission of the putative pc-scalemolecular torus is likely overwhelmed by this larger scale emission.

astro-ph;0003334	massive star formation and evolution in starburst galaxies: mid-infrared  spectroscopy with iso-sws	we present new iso-sws data for a sample of 27 starburst galaxies, and withthese data examine the issues of formation and evolution of the most massivestars in starburst galaxies. using starburst models which incorporate timeevolution, new stellar atmosphere models for massive stars, and a starburstmodel geometry derived from observations of the prototypical starburst m82, wemodel the integrated mid-infrared line ratio [neiii](15.6 microns)/[neii](12.8microns). this line ratio is sensitive to the hardness of the stellar energydistribution and therefore to the most massive stars present.  we conclude from our models, with consideration of recent determinations ofthe stellar census in local, high-mass star forming regions, that the[neiii]/[neii] ratios we measure are consistent with the formation of massive(~50-100 solar mass) stars in most starbursts. in this framework, the lownebular excitation inferred from the measured line ratios can be attributed toaging effects. by including estimates of the ratio of infrared-to-lymancontinuum luminosity for the galaxies in our sample, we further find that moststarbursts are relatively short-lived (1-10 million years), only a few o-starlifetimes. we discuss a possible cause of such short events: the effectivenessof stellar winds and supernovae in destroying the starburst environment.

astro-ph;0601268	the two young star disks in the central parsec of the galaxy:  properties, dynamics and formation	we report the definite spectroscopic identification of 41 ob supergiants,giants and main sequence stars in the central parsec of the galaxy. detectionof their absorption lines have become possible with the high spatial andspectral resolution and sensitivity of the adaptive optics integral fieldspectrometer spiffi/sinfoni on the eso vlt. several of these ob stars appear tobe helium and nitrogen rich. almost all of the ~80 massive stars now known inthe central parsec (central arcsecond excluded) reside in one of two somewhatthick (&lt;|h|/r&gt;~0.14) rotating disks. these stellar disks have fairly sharpinner edges (r~1") and surface density profiles that scale as r^{-2}. we do notdetect any ob stars outside the central 0.5 pc. the majority of the stars inthe clockwise system appear to be on almost circular orbits, whereas most ofthose in the `counter-clockwise' disk appear to be on eccentric orbits. basedon its stellar surface density distribution and dynamics we propose that irs13e is an extremely dense cluster (core density &gt; 3x10^8 sunmass/pc^3), whichhas formed in the counter-clockwise disk. the stellar contents of both systemsare remarkably similar, indicating a common age of ~6+/-2 myr. the k-bandluminosity function of the massive stars suggests a top-heavy mass function andlimits the total stellar mass contained in both disks to ~1.5x10^4 sunmass. ourdata strongly favor in situ star formation from dense gas accretion disks forthe two stellar disks. this conclusion is very clear for the clockwise disk andhighly plausible for the counter-clockwise system.

astro-ph;0603559	sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of z~2 uv-selected galaxies:  rotation curves and dynamical evolution	we present 0.5" resolution near-ir integral field spectroscopy of the ha lineemission of 14 z~2 uv-selected bm/bx galaxies obtained with sinfoni at eso/vlt.the mean ha half-light radius r_1/2 is about 4kpc and line emission is detectedover &gt; ~20kpc in several sources. in 9 sources, we detect spatially-resolvedvelocity gradients, from 40 to 410 km/s over ~10kpc. the observed kinematics ofthe larger systems are consistent with orbital motions. four galaxies are welldescribed by rotating disks with clumpy morphologies and we extract rotationcurves out to radii &gt; ~10kpc. one or two galaxies exhibit signatures moreconsistent with mergers. analyzing all 14 galaxies in the framework of rotatingdisks, we infer mean inclination- and beam-corrected maximum circularvelocities v_c of 180+-90 km/s and dynamical masses of (0.5-25)x10^10 msunwithin r_1/2. on average, the dynamical masses are consistent with photometricstellar masses assuming a chabrier/kroupa imf but too small for a 0.1-100 msunsalpeter imf. the specific angular momenta of our bm/bx galaxies are similar tothose of local late-type galaxies. the specific angular momenta of theirbaryons are comparable to those of their dark matter halos. extrapolating fromthe average v_c at 10kpc, the virial mass of the typical halo of a galaxy inour sample is 10^(11.7+-0.5) msun. kinematic modeling of the 3 best casesimplies a ratio of v_c to local velocity dispersion of order 2-4 andaccordingly a large geometric thickness. we argue that this suggests a massaccretion (alternatively, gas exhaustion) timescale of ~500myr. we also arguethat if our bm/bx galaxies were initially gas rich, their clumpy disks willsubsequently lose their angular momentum and form compact bulges on a timescaleof ~1 gyr.

astro-ph;0604125	the star-forming torus and stellar dynamical black hole mass in the  seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc3227	we report r~4300 vlt sinfoni adaptive optics integral field k-bandspectroscopy of the nucleus of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc3227 at a spatialresolution of 0.085" (7pc). we present the morphologies and kinematics ofemission lines and absorption features, and give the first derivation of ablack hole mass in a seyfert 1 nucleus from spatially resolved stellardynamics. we show that the gas in the nucleus has a mean column density oforder 10^{24}-10^{25}cm^{-2} and that it is geometrically thick, in agreementwith the standard `molecular torus' scenario. we discuss which heatingprocesses may be responsible for maintaining the vertical height of the torus.we have also resolved the nuclear stellar distribution, and find that within afew parsecs of the agn there has been an intense starburst, the most recentepisode of which began ~40myr ago but has now ceased. the current luminosity ofstars within 30pc of the agn, ~3x10^9l_sun, is comparable to that of the agn.based on a comparison of the respective size scales, we argue that the starformation has been occuring in the obscuring torus. finally, we present thefirst derivation of a black hole mass in a seyfert 1 nucleus from stellardynamics which marginally spatially resolve the black hole's sphere ofinfluence. we apply schwarzschild orbit superposition models to our full2-dimensional data and derive the mass of the black hole, paying carefulattention to the input parameters which are often uncertain: the contributionof the large scale bulge and its mass-to-light ratio; the recent star formationin the nucleus and its mass-to-light ratio; the contribution of the gas mass tothe potential; and the inclination. our models yield a 1sigma range for theblack hole mass of m_{bh} = 7x10^6-2x10^7m_sun.

astro-ph;0604317	sinfoni adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy of the circinus  galaxy	aims. to investigate the star formation activity and the gas and stellardynamics on scales of a few parsecs in the nucleus of the circinus galaxy.methods.using the adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrometersinfoni on the vlt, we have obtained observations of the circinus galaxy onscales of a few parsecs and at a spectral resolution of 70 km s^{-1} fwhm. thephysical properties of the nucleus are analyzed by means of line and velocitymaps extracted from the sinfoni datacube. starburst models are constrainedusing the br-gamma flux, stellar continuum (as traced via the co absorptionbandheads longward of 2.3um), and radio continuum. results. the similarity ofthe morphologies of the h_2 (1-0)s(1) 2.12um and br-gamma 2.17um lines to thestellar continuum and also their kinematics, suggest a common origin in starformation. within 8 pc of the agn we find there has been a recent starburst inthe last 100 myr, which currently accounts for 1.4% of the galaxy's bolometricluminosity. the similarity of the spatial scales over which the stars and gasexist indicates that this star formation is occuring within the torus; andcomparison of the gas column density through the torus to the maximum possibleoptical depth to the stars implies the torus is a clumpy medium. the coronallines show asymmetric profiles with a spatially compact narrow component and aspatially extended blue wing. these characteristics are consistent with some ofthe emission arising in clouds gravitationally bound to the agn, and someoutflowing in cloudlets which have been eroded away from the bound clouds.

astro-ph;0606158	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest): i. the origin of the  far infrared continuum of qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the far-infrared (fir) continuum of qsos,based on the quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest) of nearby qsos and ulirgsusing observations with the spitzer space telescope. for 27 palomar-green qsosat z &lt;~ 0.3, we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([neii]12.8um,[nev]14.3um, [oiv]25.9um) and emission features (pah7.7um emission which isrelated to star formation), as well as continuum luminosities over a range ofmid- to far-infrared wavelengths between 6 and 60um. we detect star-formationrelated pah emission in 11/26 qsos and fine-structure line emission in all ofthem, often in multiple lines. the detection of pahs in the average spectrum ofsources which lack individual pah detections provides further evidence for thewidespread presence of pahs in qsos. similar pah/fir and [neii]/fir ratios arefound in qsos and in starburst-dominated ulirgs and lower luminositystarbursts. we conclude that the typical qso in our sample has at least 30% butlikely most of the far-infrared luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)lsun) arising fromstar formation, with a tendency for larger star formation contribution at thelargest fir luminosities. in the qso sample, we find correlations between mostof the quantities studied including combinations of agn tracers and starbursttracers. the common scaling of agn and starburst luminosities (and fluxes) isevidence for a starburst-agn connection in luminous agn. strong correlations offar-infrared continuum and starburst related quantities (pah, low excitation[neii]) offer additional support for the starburst origin of far-infraredemission.

astro-ph;0610772	mid-infrared diagnostics of liners	we report results from the first mid-infrared spectroscopic study of acomprehensive sample of 33 liners, observed with the spitzer space telescope.we compare the properties of two different liner populations: infrared-faintliners, with liner emission arising mostly in compact nuclear regions, andinfrared-luminous liners, which often show spatially extended (non-agn) lineremission. we show that these two populations can be easily distinguished bytheir mid-infrared spectra in three different ways: (i) their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions (seds), (ii) the emission features of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs), and (iii) various combinations of ir fine-structure lineratios. ir-luminous liners show mid-ir seds typical of starburst galaxies,while the mid-ir seds of ir-faint liners are much bluer. pah flux ratios aresignificantly different in the two groups. fine structure emission lines fromhighly excited gas, such as [o iv], are detected in both populations,suggesting the presence of an additional agn also in a large fraction ofir-bright liners, which contributes little to the combined mid-ir light. thetwo liner groups occupy different regions of mid-infrared emission-lineexcitation diagrams. the positions of the various liner types in our diagnosticdiagrams provide important clues regarding the power source of each liner type.most of these mid-infrared diagnostics can be applied at low spectralresolution, making agn- and starburst-excited liners distinguishable also athigh redshifts.

astro-ph;0702231	a pdr-code comparison study	we present a comparison between independent computer codes, modeling thephysics and chemistry of interstellar photon dominated regions (pdrs). our goalwas to understand the mutual differences in the pdr codes and their effects onthe physical and chemical structure of the model clouds, and to converge theoutput of different codes to a common solution. a number of benchmark modelshave been created, covering low and high gas densities and far ultravioletintensities. the benchmark models were computed in two ways: one set assumingconstant temperatures, thus testing the consistency of the chemical network andphoto-processes, and a second set determining the temperature selfconsistently.we investigated the impact of pdr geometry and agreed on the comparison ofresults from spherical and plane-parallel pdr models. we identified a number ofkey processes governing the chemical network which have been treateddifferently in the various codes, and defined a proper common treatment. weestablished a comprehensive set of reference models for ongoing and future pdrmodel bench-marking and were able to increase the agreement in modelpredictions for all benchmark models significantly.

astro-ph;0703178	the structure of the nuclear stellar cluster of the milky way	we present high-resolution seeing limited and ao nir imaging observations ofthe stellar cluster within about one parsec of sgr a*, the massive black holeat the centre of the milky way. stellar number counts and the diffusebackground light density were extracted from these observations in order toexamine the structure of the nuclear stellar cluster.our findings are asfollows: (a) a broken-power law provides an excellent fit to the overallstructure of the gc nuclear cluster. the power-law slope of the cusp is$\gamma=0.19\pm0.05$, the break radius is $r_{\rm break} = 6.0'' \pm 1.0''$ or$0.22\pm0.04$ pc, and the cluster density decreases with a power-law index of$\gamma=0.75\pm0.1$ outside of $r_{\rm break}$. (b) using the best velocitydispersion measurements from the literature, we derive higher mass estimatesfor the central parsec than assumed until now. the inferred density of thecluster at the break radius is $2.8\pm1.3\times 10^{6} {\rm m_{\odot}pc^{-3}}$. this high density agrees well with the small extent and flat slopeof the cusp. possibly, the mass of the stars makes up only about 50% of thetotal cluster mass. (c) possible indications of mass segregation in the cuspare found (d) the cluster appears not entirely homogeneous. several densityclumps are detected that are concentrated at projected distances of $r=3''$ and$r=7''$ from sgr a*.(e) there appears to exist an under-density of horizontalbranch/red clump stars near $r=5''$, or an over-density of stars of similarbrightness at $r=3''$ and $r=7''$. (f) the extinction map in combination withcometary-like features in an l'-band image may provide support for theassumption of an outflow from sgr a*.

astro-ph;9711255	what powers ultra-luminous iras galaxies?	we present an iso sws and isophot-s, mid-infrared spectroscopic survey of 15ultra-luminous iras galaxies. we combine the survey results with a detailedcase study, based on near-ir and mm imaging spectroscopy, of one of the samplegalaxies (ugc 5101). we compare the near- and mid-ir characteristics of theseultra-luminous galaxies to iso and literature data of thirty starburst andactive galactic nuclei (agn), template galaxies. we find that  1) 70-80% of the ultra-luminous iras galaxies in our sample are predominantlypowered by recently formed massive stars. 20-30% are powered by a central agn.these conclusions are based on a new infrared 'diagnostic diagram' involvingthe ratio of high to low excitation mid-ir emission lines on the one hand, andon the strength of the 7.7um pah feature on the other hand.  2) at least half of the sources probably have simultaneously an activenucleus and starburst activity in a 1-2 kpc diameter circum-nuclear disk/ring.  3) the mid-infrared emitting regions are highly obscured. after correctionfor these extinctions, we estimate that the star forming regions in ulirgs haveages between 10^7 and 10^8 years, similar to but somewhat larger than thosefound in lower luminosity starburst galaxies.  4) in the sample we have studied there is no obvious trend for the agncomponent to dominate in the most compact, and thus most advanced mergers.instead, at any given time during the merger evolution, the time dependentcompression of the circum-nuclear interstellar gas, the accretion rate onto thecentral black hole and the associated radiation efficiency may determinewhether star formation or agn activity dominates the luminosity of the system.

astro-ph;9809090	infrared spectroscopy of ngc 4151: iso observations and nlr line  profiles	we present iso-sws and isophot-s spectroscopy of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151.we detect a total of 17 fine structure emission lines emitted by a wide rangeof low- and high-excitation ions, two rotational lines of molecular hydrogen,and the br beta hi line.  we find that the mid-ir fine structure line profiles display blue asymmetrieswhich are very similar to those observed in the optical lines produced in thenarrow line region. because the mid-infrared lines are much less sensitive toextinction than are the optical lines this similarity places strong constraintson scenarios which have been invoked to explain the optical line asymmetries.for example, we are able to rule out the simplest radial-motion-plus-dustscenarios for the production of the line asymmetries. our preferred model isthat of a central, geometrically thin but optically thick, obscuring screen ofsub-arcsecond extension, enclosing a total hydrogen gas mass of &gt;~5e6 msun.this mass may be molecular.  the weakness of `pah' emission features in the low resolution spectrum isevidence that star formation plays a minor role in the circumnuclear region ofngc 4151. in a companion paper (alexander et al., accepted by apj), we use therich set of mid-infrared lines to determine the obscured photoionizingcontinuum produced by the active galactic nucleus.

0811.3903	evidence for warped disks of young stars in the galactic center	the central parsec around the super-massive black hole in the galactic centerhosts more than 100 young and massive stars. outside the central cusp (r~1")the majority of these o and wolf-rayet (wr) stars reside in a main clockwisesystem, plus a second, less prominent disk or streamer system at large angleswith respect to the main system. here we present the results from newobservations of the galactic center with the ao-assisted near-infrared imagernaco and the integral field spectrograph sinfoni on the eso/vlt. these includethe detection of 27 new reliably measured wr/o stars in the central 12" andimproved measurements of 63 previously detected stars, with proper motionuncertainties reduced by a factor of four compared to our earlier work. wedevelop a detailed statistical analysis of their orbital properties andorientations. half of the wr/o stars are compatible with being members of aclockwise rotating system. the rotation axis of this system shows a strongtransition as a function of the projected distance from sgra*. the mainclockwise system either is either a strongly warped single disk with athickness of about 10 degrees, or consists of a series of streamers withsignificant radial variation in their orbital planes. 11 out of 61 clockwisemoving stars have an angular separation of more than 30 degrees from theclockwise system. the mean eccentricity of the clockwise system is 0.36+/-0.06.the distribution of the counter-clockwise wr/o star is not isotropic at the 98%confidence level. it is compatible with a coherent structure such as stellarfilaments, streams, small clusters or possibly a disk in a dissolving state.the observed disk warp and the steep surface density distribution favor in situstar formation in gaseous accretion disks as the origin of the young stars.

0812.3154	the halo merger rate in the millennium simulation and implications for  observed galaxy merger fractions	we developed a new method to extract halo merger rates from the millenniumsimulation. first, by removing superfluous mergers that are artifacts of thefof halo finder, we find a lower merger rate compared to previous work. thereductions are more significant at lower redshifts, lower halo masses, andminor mergers. our approach agrees better with predictions from the eps model.second, we find that the fof halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to50% for halos that are about to merge, which leads to an additional ~20%overestimate of the merger rate. therefore, we define halo masses by includingonly gravitationally bound particles. we provide new best-fitting parametersfor a global formula to account for these improvements. in addition, we extractthe merger rate per progenitor halo, as well as per descendant halo. the formeris the quantity that is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when theyare measured via pair counting. at low mass/redshift the merger rate increaseswith mass and redshift. at high mass/redshift (for halos with masses a fewtimes the "knee" of the mass function) these trends break down, and the mergerrate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately withredshift. defining the merger rate per progenitor halo also allows us toquantify the rate at which halos are being accreted onto larger halos. weprovide an analytic formula to convert given merger rates per descendant halointo merger rates per progenitor halo. finally, we perform a comparison betweenobserved merger fractions and the fraction of halos that have undergone a majormerger during the recent dynamical friction time, and find a fair agreement,within the large uncertainties of the observations. our new halo merger treesare available at http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/millenniummergertrees/.
