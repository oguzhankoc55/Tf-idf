0904.2748	star formation in extremely faint dwarf galaxies	we study the relationship between the gas column density (derived from gmrt21 cm data) and the star formation rate surface density (derived from publiclyavailable galex data) for a sample of 23 extremely faint dwarf irregulargalaxies drawn from the faint irregular galaxy gmrt survey (figgs). our samplegalaxies have a median hi mass of 2.8e07 solar masses and a median bluemagnitude -13.2. we find that gas column density averaged over the star formingregion of the disk lies below most estimates of the "threshold density" forstar formation, and that the average star formation rate surface density formost of the galaxies is also lower than would be expected from the"kennicutt-schmidt" law (kennnicutt 1998}. we also use our data to look forsmall scale (400 pc and 200 pc) correlations. at 400 pc linear resolution, for18 of our 23 galaxies, we find that star formation rate surface density can beparametrized as having a power law dependence on gas column density, whichvaries accross the sample and is in general steeper than "kennicutt-schmidt"law. the power law relation holds until one reaches the sensitivity limit ofthe galex data, i.e. we find no evidence for a "threshold density" below whichstar formation is completely cut off. for the 5 galaxies for which a power lawdoes not provide a good parametrization, there are substantial offsets betweenthe uv bright regions and the hi high column density maps. at 200 pcresolution, the offsets between the peaks in the hi and uv images are morepronounced, and a power law parametrization is possible for only 5 of 10galaxies.

0904.4797	hi in very metal-poor galaxies: the sbs 0335-052 system	we present giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), hi 21cm observations ofsbs 0335-052e and sbs 0335-052w, a close pair of dwarf galaxies, which arefurther unusual in being the most metal-poor star-forming galaxies known. wepresent images at several angular resolutions, ranging from ~40 to 4 arcsec.these images show that sbs 0335-052 is a strongly interacting system, with afaint diffuse hi bridge seen at low resolution, and elongated tails seen at thehigher resolutions. the overall morphology suggests that the pair represents amajor merger of extremely gas-rich galaxies. the low-resolution velocity fieldis dominated by the velocity difference between the two galaxies and thevelocity gradient along the tidal features. however, for sbs 0335-052w atleast, at high angular resolution, one sees a central velocity field that couldbe associated with the spin of the original undisturbed disc. the highestangular resolution hi images show that the ionized superbubble, identified bythuan, izotov &amp; lipovetsky (1997), in the hubble space telescope (hst) imagesof sbs 0335-052e, is extended along one of the diffuse tidal features, and thatthere is a high-density hi clump at the other end of the superbubble. the starformation in sbs 0335-052e occurs mainly in a group of superstar clusters(sscs) with a clear age gradient; the age decreases as one approaches the densehi clump. we suggest that this propagating star formation is driven by thesuperbubble expanding into a medium with a tidally-produced density gradient.the high pressures associated with the compressed material would also naturallyexplain why current star formation is mainly concentrated in superstarclusters.

0905.1756	a study of ism of dwarf galaxies using hi power spectrum analysis	we estimate the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations for a sample of 8galaxies (7 dwarf and one spiral). the power spectrum can be fitted to a powerlaw p_hi(u) = a u^\alpha for 6 of these galaxies, indicating turbulence isoperational. the estimated best fit value for the slope ranges from ~ -1.5 (andiv, ngc 628, ugc 4459 and gr 8) to ~ -2.6 (ddo 210 and ngc 3741). we interpretthis bi-modality as being due to having effectively 2d turbulence on lengthscales much larger than the scale height of the galaxy disk and 3d otherwise.this allows us to use the estimated slope to set bounds on the scale heights ofthe face-on galaxies in our sample. we also find that the power law sloperemains constant as we increase the channel thickness for all these galaxies,suggesting that the fluctuations in hi intensity are due to densityfluctuations and not velocity fluctuations, or that the slope of the velocitystructure function is ~ 0. finally, for the four galaxies with "2d turbulence"we find that the slope \alpha correlates with the star formation rate per unitarea, with larger star formation rates leading to steeper power laws. given oursmall sample size this result needs to be confirmed with a larger sample.

0907.1416	the hi gas content of galaxies around abell 370, a galaxy cluster at z =  0.37	we used observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope to measure theatomic hydrogen gas content of 324 galaxies around the galaxy cluster abell 370at a redshift of z = 0.37 (a look-back time of ~4 billion years). the hi 21-cmemission from these galaxies was measured by coadding their signals usingprecise optical redshifts obtained with the anglo-australian telescope. theaverage hi mass measured for all 324 galaxies is (6.6 +- 3.5)x10^9 solarmasses, while the average hi mass measured for the 105 optically blue galaxiesis (19.0 +- 6.5)x10^9 solar masses. the significant quantities of gas foundaround abell 370, suggest that there has been substantial evolution in the gascontent of galaxy clusters since redshift z = 0.37. the total amount of hi gasfound around abell 370 is up to ~8 times more than that seen around the comacluster, a nearby galaxy cluster of similar size. despite this higher gascontent, abell 370 shows the same trend as nearby clusters, that galaxies closeto the cluster core have lower hi gas content than galaxies further away. theabell 370 galaxies have hi mass to optical light ratios similar to local galaxysamples and have the same correlation between their star formation rate and himass as found in nearby galaxies. the average star formation rate derived from[oii] emission and from de-redshifted 1.4 ghz radio continuum for the abell 370galaxies also follows the correlation found in the local universe. the largeamounts of hi gas found around the cluster can easily be consumed by theobserved star formation rate in the galaxies over the ~4 billion years (from z= 0.37) to the present day.

0909.2459	a metallicity-spin temperature relation in damped lyman-$\alpha$ systems	we report evidence for an anti-correlation between spin temperature $t_s$ andmetallicity [z/h], detected at $3.6 \sigma$ significance in a sample of 26damped lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (dlas) at redshifts $0.09 &lt; z &lt; 3.45$. theanti-correlation is detected at $3 \sigma$ significance in a sub-sample of 20dlas with measured covering factors, implying that it does not stem from lowcovering factors. we obtain $t_s = (-0.68 \pm 0.17) \times {\rm [z/h]} + (2.13\pm 0.21)$ from a linear regression analysis. our results indicate that thehigh $t_s$ values found in dlas do not arise from differences between theoptical and radio sightlines, but are likely to reflect the underlying gastemperature distribution. the trend between $t_s$ and [z/h] can be explained bythe larger number of radiation pathways for gas cooling in galaxies with highmetal abundances, resulting in a high cold gas fraction, and hence, a low spintemperature. conversely, low-metallicity galaxies have fewer cooling routes,yielding a larger warm gas fraction and a high $t_s$. most dlas at $z&gt;1.7$ havelow metallicities, [z/h] $&lt; -1$, implying that the hi in high-$z$ dlas ispredominantly warm. the anti-correlation between $t_s$ and [z/h] is consistentwith the presence of a mass-metallicity relation in dlas, suggested by thetight correlation between dla metallicity and the kinematic widths of metallines. most high-$z$ dlas are likely to arise in galaxies with low masses($m_{\rm vir} &lt; 10^{10.5} m_\odot$), low metallicities ([z/h]$&lt; -1$, and lowcold gas fractions.

1002.4192	hi 21 cm opacity fluctuations power spectra towards cassiopeia a	the angular power spectrum of hi 21 cm opacity fluctuations is a usefulstatistic for quantifying the observed opacity fluctuations as well as forcomparing these with theoretical models. we present here the hi 21 cm opacityfluctuation power spectrum towards the supernova remnant cas a frominterferometric data with spacial resolution of 5" and spectral resolution of0.4 km/s. the power spectrum has been estimated using a simple but robustvisibility based technique. we find that the power spectrum is well fit by apower law p_tau(u) = u^{alpha} with a power law index of alpha ~ -2.86 +/- 0.10(3 sigma error) over the scales of 0.07 - 2.3 pc for the gas in the perseusspiral arm and 0.002 - 0.07 pc (480 - 15730 au) for that in the local arm. thisestimated power law index is consistent with earlier observational resultsbased on both hi emission over larger scales and absorption studies over asimilar range of scales. we do not detect any statistically significant changein the power law index with the velocity width of the frequency channels. thisconstrains the power law index of the velocity structure function to be beta =0.2 +/- 0.6 (3 sigma error).

1002.4474	thick gas discs in faint dwarf galaxies	we determine the intrinsic axial ratio distribution of the 'gas' disks ofextremely faint m_b &gt; -14.5 dwarf irregular galaxies. we start with themeasured (beam corrected) distribution of apparent axial ratios in the hi 21cmimages of dwarf irregular galaxies observed as part of the faint irregulargalaxy gmrt survey (figgs). assuming that the disks can be approximated asoblate spheroids, the intrinsic axial ratio distribution can be obtained fromthe observed apparent axial ratio distribution. we use a couple of methods todo this, and our final results are based on using lucy's deconvolutionalgorithm. this method is constrained to produce physically plausibledistributions, and also has the added advantage of allowing for observationalerrors to be accounted for. while one might a priori expect that gas diskswould be thin (because collisions between gas clouds would cause them toquickly settle down to a thin disk), we find that the hi disks of faint dwarfirregulars are quite thick, with mean axial ratio &lt;q&gt; ~ 0.6. while this issubstantially larger than the typical value of ~ 0.2 for the 'stellar' disks oflarge spiral galaxies, it is consistent with the much larger ratio of velocitydispersion to rotational velocity (sigma/v_c) in dwarf galaxy hi disks ascompared to that in spiral galaxies. our findings have implications for studiesof the mass distribution in and the tully - fisher relation for faint dwarfirregular galaxies, where it is often assumed that the gas is in a thin disk.

1003.6026	when are extremely metal-deficient galaxies extremely metal-deficient?	extremely metal-deficient (xmd) galaxies, by definition, have oxygenabundances \le 1/10 solar, and form a very small fraction of the localgas-rich, star-forming dwarf galaxy population. we examine their positions inthe luminousity-metallicity (l-z) and mass-metallicity (m-z) planes, withrespect to the l-z and m-z relations of other gas-rich, star-forming dwarfgalaxies, viz., blue compact galaxies (bcgs) and dwarf irregular (di) galaxies.we find that while the metallicities of some low-luminousity xmd galaxies areconsistent with those expected from the l-z relation, other xmd galaxies aredeviant. we determine the 95 per cent confidence interval around the l-zrelation for bcgs, and find that its lower boundary is given by 12 + log(o/h) =-0.177 m_{b} + 4.87. we suggest that a galaxy should be regarded as xmd, in astatistically significant manner, only if it lies below this boundary in thel-z plane. of our sample of xmd galaxies, we find that more than half are xmdby this criterion. we also determine the gas mass fractions and chemical yieldsof galaxies in all three samples. we find that the effective chemical yieldincreases with increasing baryonic mass, consistent with what is expected ifoutflows of metal-enriched gas are important in determining the effectiveyield. xmd galaxies have lower effective yield than bcg/di galaxies of similarbaryonic mass. motivated by the fact that interactions are common in xmdgalaxies, we suggest that improved (tidally-driven) mixing of the interstellarmedia (ism) in xmd galaxies leads to a lowering of both, the measuredmetallicity and the calculated effective yield. we suggest that xmd galaxiesare deviant from the l-z relation because of a combination of being gas-rich(i.e., having processed less gas into stars) and having more uniform mixing ofmetals in their ism.

1004.1528	turbulence in the harassed galaxy ngc 4254	galaxy harassment is an important mechanism for the morphological evolutionof galaxies in clusters. the spiral galaxy ngc 4254 in the virgo cluster isbelieved to be a harassed galaxy. we have analyzed the power spectrum of hiemission fluctuations from ngc 4254 to investigate whether it carries anyimprint of galaxy harassment. the power spectrum, as determined using the 16central channels which contain most of the hi emission, is found to be wellfitted by a power law $p(u)=au^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\ =-\ 1.7\pm 0.2$ atlength-scales $1.7 \, {\rm k pc}$ to $ 8.4 \, {\rm kpc}$. this is similar toother normal spiral galaxies which have a slope of $\sim -1.5$ and isinterpreted as arising from two dimensional turbulence at length-scales largerthan the galaxy's scale-height. ngc 4254 is hence yet another example of aspiral galaxy that exhibits scale-invariant density fluctuations out tolength-scales comparable to the diameter of the hi disk. while a large varietyof possible energy sources like proto-stellar winds, supernovae, shocks, etc.have been proposed to produce turbulence, it is still to be seen whether theseare effective on length-scales comparable to that of the entire hi disk. onseparately analyzing the hi power spectrum in different parts of ngc 4254, wefind that the outer parts have a different slope ($ \alpha = -2.0\pm0.3$)compared to the central part of the galaxy ($\alpha = -1.5\pm0.2$). such achange in slope is not seen in other, undisturbed galaxies. we suggest that, inaddition to changing the overall morphology, galaxy harassment also effects thefine scale structure of the ism, causing the power spectrum to have a steeperslope in the outer parts.

1004.4419	a search for the 55 mhz oh line	the oh molecule, found abundantly in the milky way, has four transitions atthe ground state rotational level(j = 3/2) at cm wavelengths. these are e1transitions between the f+ and f- hyperfine levels of the lambda doublet of thej=3/2 state. there are also forbidden m1 transitions between the hyperfinelevels within each of the doublet states occuring at frequencies 53.171 mhz and55.128 mhz. these are extremely weak and hence difficult to detect. howeverthere is a possibility that the level populations giving rise to these linesare inverted under special conditions, in which case it may be possible todetect them through their maser emission. we describe the observationaldiagnostics for determining when the hyperfine levels are inverted, andidentify a region near w44 where these conditions are satisfied. ahigh-velocity-resolution search for these hyperfine oh lines using the lowfrequency feeds on four antennas of the gmrt and the new gmrt softwarebackend(gsb) was performed on this target near w44. we place a 3-sigma upperlimit of ~17.3 jy (at 1 km/s velocity resolution) for the 55 mhz line from thisregion. this corresponds to an upper limit of 3 x 10^8 for the amplification ofthe galactic synchrotron emission providing the background.

1010.4489	gmrt observation towards detecting the post-reionization 21-cm signal	we have analyzed 610 mhz gmrt observations towards detecting the redshifted21-cm signal from z=1.32. the multi-frequency angular power spectrum c_l(deltanu) is used to characterize the statistical properties of the backgroundradiation across angular scales ~20" to 10', and a frequency bandwidth of 7.5mhz with resolution 125 khz. the measured c_l(delta nu) which ranges from 7mk^2 to 18 mk^2 is dominated by foregrounds, the expected hi signalc_l^hi(delta nu) ~10^{-6}- 10^{-7} mk^2 is several orders of magnitude smaller.the foregrounds, believed to originate from continuum sources, is expected tovary smoothly with delta nu whereas the hi signal decorrelates within ~0.5 mhzand this holds the promise of separating the two. for each l, we use theinterval 0.5 &lt; delta nu &lt; 7.5 mhz to fit a fourth order polynomial which issubtracted from the measured c_l(delta nu) to remove any smoothly varyingcomponent across the entire bandwidth delta nu &lt; 7.5 mhz. the residualc_l(delta nu), we find, has an oscillatory pattern with amplitude and periodrespectively ~0.1 mk^2 and delta nu = 3 mhz at the smallest l value of 1476,and the amplitude and period decreasing with increasing l. applying a suitablychosen high pass filter, we are able to remove the residual oscillatory patternfor l=1476 where the residual c_l(delta nu) is now consistent with zero at the3-sigma noise level. we conclude that we have successfully removed theforegrounds at l=1476 and the residuals are consistent with noise. we use thisto place an upper limit on the hi signal whose amplitude is determined by x_hib where x_hi and b are the hi neutral fraction and the hi bias respectively. avalue of x_hi b greater than 7.95 would have been detected in our observation,and is therefore ruled out at the 3-sigma level.

1103.6117	small bites: star formation recipes in extreme dwarfs	we study the relationship between the gas column density (sigma_hi) and thestar formation rate surface density (sigma_sfr) for a sample of extremely small(m_b ~ -13, delta v_50 ~ 30 km/s) dwarf irregular galaxies. we find a clearstochasticity in the relation between the gas column density and starformation. all gas with sigma_hi &gt;~ 10 m_sun/pc^2 has some ongoing starformation, but the fraction of gas with ongoing star formation decreases as thegas column density decreases, and falls to about 50% at sigma_hi ~ 3m_sun/pc^2. further, even for the most dense gas, the star formation efficiencyis at least a factor of ~ 2 smaller than typical of star forming regions inspirals. we also find that the ratio of h-alpha emission to fuv emissionincreases with increasing gas column density. this is unlikely to be due toincreasing dust extinction because the required dust to gas ratios are toohigh. we suggest instead that this correlation arises because massive (i.e.h-alpha producing) stars are formed preferentially in regions with high gasdensity.

1108.3707	improved foreground removal in gmrt 610 mhz observations towards  redshifted 21-cm tomography	foreground removal is a challenge for 21-cm tomography of the high redshiftuniverse. we use archival gmrt data (obtained for completely differentastronomical goals) to estimate the foregrounds at a redshift ~ 1. thestatistic we use is the cross power spectrum between two frequencies separatedby \delta{\nu} at the angular multipole l, or equivalently the multi-frequencyangular power spectrum c_l(\delta{\nu}). an earlier measurement ofc_l(\delta{\nu}) using this data had revealed the presence of oscillatorypatterns along \delta{\nu}, which turned out to be a severe impediment forforeground removal (ghosh et al. 2011). using the same data, in this paper weshow that it is possible to considerably reduce these oscillations bysuppressing the sidelobe response of the primary antenna elements. thesuppression works best at the angular multipoles l for which there is a densesampling of the u-v plane. for three angular multipoles l = 1405, 1602 and1876, this sidelobe suppression along with a low order polynomial fittingcompletely results in residuals of (\leq 0.02 mk^2), consistent with the noiseat the 3{\sigma} level. since the polynomial fitting is done after estimationof the power spectrum it can be ensured that the estimation of the hi signal isnot biased. the corresponding 99% upper limit on the hi signal is xhi b \leq2.9, where xhi is the mean neutral fraction and b is the bias.

0710.3224	outflowing atomic and molecular gas at $z \sim 0.67$ towards 1504+377	we report the detection of oh 1667 mhz and wide hi 21cm absorption at $z \sim0.67$ towards the red quasar 1504+377, with the green bank telescope and thegiant metrewave radio telescope. the hi 21cm absorption extends over a velocityrange of $\sim 600$ km/s blueward of the quasar redshift ($z=0.674$), with thenew oh 1667 mhz absorption component at $\sim -430$ \kms, nearly coincidentwith earlier detections of mm-wave absorption at $z \sim 0.6715$. the atomicand molecular absorption appear to arise from a fast gas outflow from thequasar, with a mass outflow rate ${\dot m} \sim 12 m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and amolecular hydrogen fraction $f_{\rm h_2} \equiv (n_{\rm h_2}/n_{\rm hi}) \sim0.2$. the radio structure of 1504+377 is consistent with the outflow arisingdue to a jet-cloud interaction, followed by rapid cooling of the cloudmaterial. the observed ratio of hco$^+$ to oh column densities is $\sim 20$times higher than typical values in galactic and high-$z$ absorbers. this couldarise due to small-scale structure in the outflowing gas on sub-parsec scales,which would also explain the observed variability in the hi 21cm line.

1204.3305	the radio - far infrared correlation in the faintest star forming dwarf  galaxies	we study the radio - far-infrared (fir) correlation in a sample of faintdwarf irregular galaxies using nvss data for 1.4 ghz radio flux, spitzer mips70 um data for fir flux, and galex fuv data to estimate the star formationrates (sfr). since our target galaxies are extremely faint, we stack images ofmany galaxies together to estimate the average radio and fir fluxes. we findthat for a given sfr both 70 um and 1.4 ghz fluxes are low compared to thecalibration for large spirals. nonetheless, the ratio of 70 um to 1.4 ghz fluxagrees within errorbars with that seen for large galaxies. the radio-fircorrelation thus appears to be the result of a 'conspiracy'. we use the sfr toestimate the non-thermal fraction of the 1.4 ghz radio emission and find it tobe around 50%, much smaller than the 90% typical for spirals. we also estimatethe equipartition magnetic field and find it to be ~ 2 microgauss, about fivetimes smaller than that typical for spirals.

0711.1588	life in the last lane: star formation and chemical evolution in an  extremely gas-rich dwarf	we present an analysis of hi, h-alpha, and oxygen abundance data for ngc3741. this galaxy has a very extended gas disk (~8.8 times the holmbergradius), and a dark to luminous (i.e. stellar) mass ratio of ~149, which makesit one of the ``darkest'' dwarf irregular galaxies known. however its ratio ofbaryons (i.e. gas + stellar) mass to dark mass is typical of that in galaxies.our new high-resolution hi images of the galaxy show evidence for a large scale(purely gaseous) spiral arm and central bar. despite the gaseous spiral featureand the on-going star formation, we find that the global gas density in ngc3741 is significantly lower than the toomre instability criterion. we also findthat the star formation rate is consistent with that expected from the observedcorrelations between hi mass and sfr and the global kennicutt-schmidt lawrespectively. we measure the oxygen abundance to be 12+ log(o/h)=7.66$\pm$0.10,which is consistent with that expected from the metallicity-luminosityrelation, despite its extreme gas mass ratio. we also examine the issue ofchemical evolution of ngc 3741 in the context of closed-box model of chemicalevolution. the effective oxygen yield of ngc 3741 is consistent with recentmodel estimates of closed-box yields, provided one assumes that the gas hasbeen efficiently mixed all the way to edge of the hi disk (i.e. &gt;8 times theoptical radius). this seems a priori unlikely. on the other hand, using asample of galaxies with both interferometric hi maps and chemical abundancemeasurements, we find that the effective yield is anti-correlated with thetotal dynamical mass, as expected in leaky box models (slightly abridged).

1211.6208	the hi column density distribution function in faint dwarf galaxies	we present the hi column density distribution function,\fnh, as measured fromdwarf galaxies observed as part of the faint irregular galaxy gmrt (figgs)survey. we find that the shape of the dwarf galaxy \fnh\ is significantlydifferent from the \fnh\ for high redshift damped \lya\ absorbers (dlas) or the\fnh\ for a representative sample of $z = 0$ gas rich galaxies. the dwarf \fnh\falls much more steeply at high hi column densities as compared to the otherdeterminations. while $\sim 10%$ of the cross section above $\nh = 10^{20.3}\acc$ at $z = 0$ is provided by dwarf galaxies, the fraction falls to $\lesssim1%$ by $\nh \sim 10^{21.5} \acc.$ in the local universe, the contribution tothe high \nh\ end of the \fnh\ distribution comes predominantly from theinclined disks of large galaxies. dwarf galaxies, both because of their smallerscale lengths, and their larger intrinsic axial ratios do not produce large hicolumn densities even when viewed edge-on. if high column density dlas/grbhosts correspond to galaxies like the local dwarfs, this would require eitherthat (i) the absorption arises from merging and not isolated systems or (ii)the observed lines of sight are strongly biased towards high column densityregions.

1305.0951	accurate measurement of the hi column density from hi 21cm  absorption-emission spectroscopy	we present a detailed study of an estimator of the hi column density, basedon a combination of hi 21cm absorption and hi 21cm emission spectroscopy. this"isothermal" estimate is given by $n_{\rm hi,iso} = 1.823 \times 10^{18} \int\left[ \tau_{\rm tot} \times {\rm t_b} \right] / \left[ 1 - e^{-\tau_{\rm tot}}\right] {\rm dv}$, where $\tau_{\rm tot}$ is the total hi 21cm optical depthalong the sightline and ${\rm t_b}$ is the measured brightness temperature. wehave used a monte carlo simulation to quantify the accuracy of the isothermalestimate by comparing the derived $n_{\rm hi,iso}$ with the true hi columndensity $n_{\rm hi}$. the simulation was carried out for a wide range ofsightlines, including gas in different temperature phases and random locationsalong the path. we find that the results are statistically insensitive to theassumed gas temperature distribution and the positions of different phasesalong the line of sight. the median value of the ratio of the true h{\sc i}column density to the isothermal estimate, $n_{\rm hi}/{n_{\rm hi, iso}}$, iswithin a factor of 2 of unity while the 68.2% confidence intervals are within afactor of $\approx 3$ of unity, out to high hi column densities, $\le 5 \times10^{23}$\,cm$^{-2}$ per 1 km s$^{-1}$ channel, and high total optical depths,$\le 1000$. the isothermal estimator thus provides a significantly bettermeasure of the hi column density than other methods, within a factor of a fewof the true value even at the highest columns, and should allow us to directlyprobe the existence of high hi column density gas in the milky way.

0801.2424	foregrounds for redshifted 21 cm studies of reionization: gmrt 153 mhz  observations	foreground subtraction is the biggest challenge for future redshifted 21 cmobservations to probe reionization. we use a short gmrt observation at 153 mhzto characterize the statistical properties of the background radiation across ~one degree to sub-arcminutes angular scales, and across a frequency band of 5mhz with 62.5 khz resolution. the statistic we use is the visibilitycorrelation function, or equivalently the angular power spectrum c_l. wepresent the results obtained from using relatively unsophisticated,conventional data calibration procedures. we find that even fairly simpleminded calibration allows one to estimate the visibility correlation functionat a given frequency v_2(u,0). from our observations we find that v_2(u,0) isconsistent with foreground model predictions at all angular scales except thelargest ones probed by our observations where the the model predictions aresomewhat in excess. on the other hand the visibility correlation betweendifferent frequencies kappa(u, delta nu), seems to be much more sensitive tocalibration errors. we find a rapid decline in kappa(u, delta nu), in contrastwith the prediction of less than 1 % variation across 2.5 mhz. in this casehowever, it seems likely that a substantial part of the discrepancy may be dueto limitations of data reduction procedures.

1308.1462	neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) gas evolution in field galaxies at z ~ 0.1  and 0.2	we measure the neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) gas content of field galaxies atintermediate redshifts of z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 0.2 using hydrogen 21-cm emissionlines observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt). in orderto make high signal-to-noise ratio detections, an hi signal stacking techniqueis applied: hi emission spectra from multiple galaxies, optically selected bythe cnoc2 redshift survey project, are co-added to measure the average hi massof galaxies in the two redshift bins. we calculate the cosmic hi gas densities({\omega}_{hi}) at the two redshift regimes and compare those with measurementsat other redshifts to investigate the global evolution of the hi gas densityover cosmic time. from a total of 59 galaxies at z ~ 0.1 we find {\omega}_{hi}= (0.33 $\pm$ 0.05) ~ $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, and at z ~ 0.2 we find {\omega}_{hi}= (0.34 $\pm$ 0.09) ~ $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, based on 96 galaxies. thesemeasurements help bridge the gap between high-z damped lyman-$\alpha$observations and blind 21-cm surveys at $z=$ 0. we find that our measurementsof {\omega}_{hi} at z ~ 0.1 and 0.2 are consistent with the hi gas density at z~ 0 and that all measurements of {\omega}_{hi} from 21-cm emission observationsat $z \la$ ~ 0.2 are in agreement with no evolution of the hi gas content ingalaxies during the last 2.4 gyr.

1308.6200	the intrinsic shapes of dwarf irregular galaxies	we use the measured b band axial ratios of galaxies from an updated catalogof local volume galaxies to determine the intrinsic shape of dwarf irregulargalaxies (de vacouleurs' morphological types 8, 9 and 10). we find that theshapes change systematically with luminosity, with fainter galaxies beingthicker. in particular, we divide our sample into sub-samples and find that themost luminous dwarfs (-19.6 &lt; m_b &lt; -14.8) have thin discs (thickness ~ 0.2),with the disc being slightly elliptical (axial ratio ~ 0.8). at intermediateluminosity, viz. -14.8 &lt; m_b &lt; -12.6, the galaxies are still characterized byelliptical discs (axial ratio ~ 0.7), but the discs are somewhat thicker(thickness ~ 0.4). the faintest dwarfs, viz. those with -12.6 &lt; m_b &lt; -6.7 arewell described as being oblate spheroids with an axial ratio ~ 0.5. theincreasing thickness of the stellar discs of dwarf irregulars with decreasingluminosity is compatible with the increasing ratio of velocity dispersion torotational velocity with decreasing galaxy size.

0801.3606	baryonic tully-fisher relation for extremely low mass galaxies	we study tully-fisher relations for a sample that combines extremely faint(m_b &gt; -14.0) galaxies along with bright (i.e. l_*) galaxies. accurate (~ 10%)distances, i band photometry, and b-v colors are known for the majority of thegalaxies in our sample. the faint galaxies are drawn from the faint irregulargalaxy gmrt survey (figgs), and we have hi rotation velocities derived fromaperture synthesis observations for all of them. for the faint galaxies, wefind that even though the median hi and stellar masses are comparable, the himass correlates significantly better with the circular velocity indicators thanthe stellar mass. we also find that w$_{20}$ correlates better with mass thanthe rotation velocity, although the difference is not statisticallysignificant. the faint galaxies lie systematically below the i band tf relationdefined by bright galaxies, and also show significantly more intrinsic scatter.this implies that the integrated star formation in these galaxies has been bothless efficient and also less regulated than in large galaxies. we find thatwhile the faint end deviation is greatly reduced in baryonic tully-fisher (btf)relations, the existence of a break at the faint end of the btf is subject tosystematics such as the assumed stellar mass to light ratio. if we assume thatthere is an intrinsic btf and try to determine the baryonic mass by searchingfor prescriptions that lead to the tightest btf, we find that scaling the himass leads to a much more significant tightening than scaling the stellar massto light ratio. the most significant tightening that we find however, is if wescale the entire baryonic mass of the faint (but not the bright) galaxies. sucha scenario would be consistent with models where dwarf (but not large) galaxieshave a large fraction of dark or ``missing'' baryons (slightly abridged)

1309.4098	the temperature of the diffuse hi in the milky way i: high resolution hi  21 cm absorption studies	we have carried out deep, high velocity resolution, interferometric galactichi 21 cm absorption spectroscopy towards 32 compact extra-galactic radiosources with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) and the westerborksynthesis radio telescope (wsrt). the optical depth spectra for most sourceshave root mean square noise values \lesssim 10^{-3} per 1 km/s velocity channeland are thus sufficiently sensitive to detect absorption by warm neutralhydrogen with hi column densities n_hi \gtrsim 10^{20} cm^{-2}, spintemperatures t_s \leq 5000 k, and line widths equal to the thermal width (20km/s). hi 21 cm absorption was detected against all background sources but one,b0438-436. the spectra of sources observed separately with gmrt and wsrt showexcellent agreement, indicating that spectral baseline problems andcontamination from hi 21 cm emission are negligible. this paper presents theabsorption spectra, the emission spectra along neighbouring sightlines from theleiden-argentine-bonn survey, and the derived spin temperature spectra. onevery sightline, the maximum spin temperature detected (at \ge 3 sigmasignificance) even at a velocity resolution of 1 km/s is \gtrsim 1000 k,indicating that we are detecting the warm neutral medium along most sightlines.this is by far the largest sample of galactic hi 21 cm absorption spectra ofthis quality, providing a sensitive probe of physical conditions in the neutralatomic ism.

1309.4099	the temperature of the diffuse hi in the milky way ii: gaussian  decomposition of the hi 21 cm absorption spectra	we discuss physical conditions in galactic neutral hydrogen based on deep,high velocity resolution interferometric hi 21 cm absorption spectroscopytowards 33 compact extra-galactic radio sources. the hi 21 cm optical depthspectra have root-mean-square noise values \lesssim 10^{-3} per 1 km/s velocitychannel, i.e., sufficiently sensitive to detect hi 21 cm absorption by the warmneutral medium (wnm). comparing these spectra with hi 21 cm emission spectrafrom the leiden-argentine-bonn (lab) survey, we show that some of theabsorption detected on most sightlines must arise in gas with temperatureshigher than that in the stable cold neutral medium (cnm). a multi-gaussiandecomposition of 30 of the hi 21 cm absorption spectra yielded very fewcomponents with line widths in the temperature range of stable wnm, with nosuch wnm components detected for sixteen of the thirty sightlines. we find thatsome of the detected hi 21 cm absorption along thirteen of these sightlinesmust arise in gas with spin temperatures larger than the cnm range. for thesesightlines, we use very conservative estimates of the cnm spin temperature andthe non-thermal broadening to derive strict upper limits to the gas columndensities in the cnm and wnm phases. comparing these upper limits to the totalhi column density, we find that typically at least 28% of the gas must havetemperatures in the thermally unstable range (200-5000 k). our observationshence robustly indicate that a significant fraction of the gas in the galacticinterstellar medium has temperatures outside the ranges expected for thermallystable gas in two-phase models.

0802.3982	figgs: faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey - overview, observations and  first results	the faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey (figgs) is a giant metrewave radiotelescope (gmrt) based hi imaging survey of a systematically selected sample ofextremely faint nearby dwarf irregular galaxies. the primary goal of figgs isto provide a comprehensive and statistically robust characterization of theneutral inter-stellar medium properties of faint, gas rich dwarf galaxies. thefiggs galaxies represent the extremely low-mass end of the dwarf irregulargalaxies population, with a median m${\rm{_b\sim-13.0}}$ and median hi mass of$\sim 3 \times 10^7$ m$_\odot$, extending the baseline in mass and luminosityspace for a comparative study of galaxy properties. the hi data is supplementedwith observations at other wavelengths. in addition, distances accurate to ~10% are available for most of the sample galaxies. this paper gives anintroduction to figgs, describe the gmrt observations and presents the firstresults from the hi observations. from the figgs data we confirm the trend ofincreasing hi to optical diameter ratio with decreasing optical luminosity; themedian ratio of d$_{\rm hi}$/d$_{\rm ho}$ for the figgs sample is 2.4. further,on comparing our data with aperture synthesis surveys of bright spirals, wefind at best marginal evidence for a decrease in average surface density withdecreasing hi mass. to a good approximation the disks of gas rich galaxies,ranging over 3 orders of magnitude in hi mass, can be described as being drawnfrom a family with constant hi surface density.

1405.1696	the structure function of galactic \hi opacity fluctuations on au scales  based on merlin, vla and vlba data	we use merlin, vla and vlba observations of galactic \hi absorption towards3c~138 to estimate the structure function of the \hi opacity fluctuations at auscales. using monte carlo simulations, we show that there is likely to be asignificant bias in the estimated structure function at signal-to-noise ratioscharacteristic of our observations, if the structure function is constructed inthe manner most commonly used in the literature. we develop a new estimatorthat is free from this bias and use it to estimate the true underlyingstructure function slope on length scales ranging $5$ to $40$~au. from a powerlaw fit to the structure function, we derive a slope of $0.81^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$,i.e. similar to the value observed at parsec scales. the estimated upper limitfor the amplitude of the structure function is also consistent with themeasurements carried out at parsec scales. our measurements are henceconsistent with the \hi opacity fluctuation in the galaxy being characterizedby a power law structure function over length scales that span six orders ofmagnitude. this result implies that the dissipation scale has to be smallerthan a few au if the fluctuations are produced by turbulence. this inferredsmaller dissipation scale implies that the dissipation occurs either in (i)regions with densities $\gtrsim 10^3 $cm$^-3$ (i.e. similar to that inferredfor "tiny scale" atomic clouds or (ii) regions with a mix of ionized and atomicgas (i.e. the observed structure in the atomic gas has a magneto-hydrodynamicorigin).

0803.2511	turbulence measurements from hi absorption spectra	we use the millennium arecibo 21 cm absorption-line survey measurements toexamine the issue of the non-thermal contribution to the observed galactic hiline widths. if we assume a simple, constant pressure model for the hi in thegalaxy, we find that the non-thermal contribution to the line width, v_{nt}scales as v^2_{nt} \propto l^{\alpha}, for v_{nt} larger than \sim 0.7 kms^{-1}. here l is a derived length scale and \alpha \sim 0.7 \pm 0.1. this isconsistent with what one would expect from a turbulent medium with a kolmogorovscaling. such a scaling is also predicted by theoretical models and numericalsimulations of turbulence in a magnetized medium. for non-thermal line widthsnarrower than \sim 0.7 km s^{-1}, this scaling breaks down, and we find thatthe likely reason is ambiguities arising from gaussian decomposition ofintrinsically narrow, blended lines. we use the above estimate of thenon-thermal contribution to the line width to determine corrected hi kinetictemperature. the new limits that we obtain imply that a significantly smaller(\sim 40% as opposed to 60%) fraction of the atomic interstellar medium in ourgalaxy is in the warm neutral medium phase.

1407.7538	highmass -- high hi mass, hi-rich galaxies at z~0: sample definition,  optical and halpha imaging, and star formation properties	we present first results of the study of a set of exceptional hi sourcesidentified in the 40% alfalfa extragalactic hi survey catalog alpha.40 as beingboth hi massive (m_hi &gt; 10^10 msun) and having high gas fractions for theirstellar masses: the highmass galaxy sample. we analyze uv- andoptical-broadband and halpha images to understand the nature of theirrelatively underluminous disks in optical and to test whether their high gasfractions can be tracked to higher dark matter halo spin parameters or late gasaccretion. estimates of their star formation rates (sfrs) based on sed-fittingagree within uncertainties with the halpha luminosity inferred sfrs. the hiiregion luminosity functions have standard slopes at the luminous end. theglobal sfrs demonstrate that the highmass galaxies exhibit active ongoing starformation (sf) with moderate sf efficiency, but relative to normal spirals, alower integrated sfr in the past. because the sf activity in these systems isspread throughout their extended disks, they have overall lower sfr surfacedensities and lower surface brightness in the optical bands. relative to normaldisk galaxies, the majority of highmass galaxies have higher halpha equivalentwidths and are bluer in their outer disks, implying an inside-out disk growthscenario. downbending double exponential disks are more frequent than upbendingdisks among the gas-rich galaxies, suggesting that sf thresholds exist in thedownbending disks, probably as a result of concentrated gas distribution.

1409.1061	the relation between atomic gas and star formation rate densities in  faint irregular galaxies	we use data for faint (m_b &gt; -14.5) dwarf irregular galaxies drawn from thefiggs survey to study the correlation between the atomic gas density(sigma_gas,atomic) and star formation rate (sigma_sfr) in the galaxies. theestimated gas phase metallicity of our sample galaxies is z ~ 0.1 z_sun.understanding star formation in such molecule poor gas is of particularimportance since it is likely to be of direct relevance to simulations of earlygalaxy formation. for about 20% (9/43) of our sample galaxies, we find that thehi distribution is significantly disturbed, with little correspondence betweenthe optical and hi distributions. we exclude these galaxies from thecomparison. we also exclude galaxies with very low star formation rates, forwhich stochastic effects make it difficult to estimate the true star formationrates. for the remaining galaxies we compute the sigma_gas,atomic and sigma_sfraveraged over the entire star forming disk of the galaxy. for these galaxies wefind a nearly linear relation between the star formation rate and the atomicgas surface densities. the corresponding gas consumption timescale is ~ 10 gyr,i.e. significantly smaller than the ~ 100 gyr estimated for the outer regionsof spiral galaxies. we also estimate the gas consumption timescale computedusing the global gas content and the global star formation rate for allgalaxies with a reliable measurement of the star formation rate, regardless ofwhether the hi distribution is disturbed or not. the mean gas consumptiontimescale computed using this entire gas reservoir is ~ 18 gyr, i.e. stillsignificantly smaller than that estimated for the outer parts of spirals. thegas consumption timescale for dwarfs is intermediate between the values of ~100 gyr and ~ 2 gyr estimated for the outer molecule poor and inner moleculerich regions of spiral disks.

1411.4310	modeling hi distribution and kinematics in the edge-on dwarf irregular  galaxy kk250	we model the observed vertical distribution of the neutral hydrogen (hi) inthe faint (m_b ~ -13.7 mag) edge-on dwarf irregular galaxy kk250. our modelassumes that the galaxy consists of axi-symmetric, co-planar gas and stellardiscs in the external force-field of a spherical dark matter halo, and invertical hydrostatic equilibrium. the velocity dispersion of the gas is left asa free parameter in the model. our best fit model is able to reproduce theobserved vertical distribution of the hi gas, as well as the observed velocityprofiles. the best fit model has a large velocity dispersion (~ 22 km/s) at thecentre of the galaxy, which falls to a value of ~ 8 km/s by a galacto-centricradius of ~ 1 kpc, which is similar to both the scale-length of the stellardisc, as well as the angular resolution of the data along the radial direction.similarly we find that the thickness of the hi disc is also minimum at ~ 1 kpc,and increases by about a factor of ~ 2 as one goes to the centre of the galaxyor out to ~ 3 kpc. the minimum intrinsic hwhm of the hi vertical distributionin kk250 is ~ 350 pc. for comparison the hwhm of the vertical distribution ofthe hi in the solar neighbourhood is ~ 70-140 pc. our results are henceconsistent with other observations which indicate that dwarf galaxies havesignificantly puffier gas discs than spirals.

1503.02667	the spatially resolved kennicutt-schmidt relation in the hi dominated  regions of spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies	we study the kennicutt-schmidt relation between average star formation rateand average cold gas surface density in the hi dominated ism of nearby spiraland dwarf irregular galaxies. we divide the galaxies into grid cells varyingfrom sub-kpc to tens of kpc in size. grid-cell measurements of low sfrs usingh-alpha emission can be biased and scatter may be introduced because ofnon-uniform sampling of the imf or because of stochastically varying starformation. in order to alleviate these issues, we use far-ultraviolet emissionto trace sfr, and we sum up the fluxes from different bins with the same gassurface density to calculate the average $\sigma_{sfr}$ at a given value of$\sigma_{gas}$. we study the resulting kennicutt-schmidt relation in 400 pc, 1kpc and 10 kpc scale grids in nearby massive spirals and in 400 pc scale gridsin nearby faint dwarf irregulars. we find a relation with a power law slope of1.5 in the hi-dominated regions for both kinds of galaxies. the relation isoffset towards longer gas consumption timescales compared to the molecularhydrogen dominated centres of spirals, but the offset is an order-of-magnitudeless than that quoted by earlier studies. our results lead to the surprisingconclusion that conversion of gas to stars is independent of metallicity in thehi dominated regions of star-forming galaxies. our observed relations arebetter fit by a model of star formation based on thermal and hydrostaticequilibrium in the ism, in which feedback driven turbulence sets the thermalpressure.

1512.06346	cold hi in faint dwarf galaxies	we present the results of a study of the amount and distribution of coldatomic gas, as well its correlation with recent star formation in a sample ofextremely faint dwarf irregular galaxies. our sample is drawn from the faintirregular galaxy gmrt survey (figgs) and its extension, figgs2. we use twodifferent methods to identify cold atomic gas. in the first method,line-of-sight hi spectra were decomposed into multiple gaussian components andnarrow gaussian components were identified as cold hi. in the second method,the brightness temperature (t_b) is used as a tracer of cold hi. we find thatthe amount of cold gas identified using the t_b method is significantly largerthan the amount of gas identified using gaussian decomposition. we also findthat a large fraction of the cold gas identified using the t_b method isspatially coincident with regions of recent star formation, although theconverse is not true. that is only a small fraction of the regions with recentstar formation are also covered by cold gas. for regions where the starformation and the cold gas overlap, we study the relationship between the starformation rate density and the cold \hi column density. we find that the starformation rate density has a power law dependence on the hi column density, butthat the slope of this power law is significantly flatter than that of thecanonical kennicutt-schmidt relation.

astro-ph;0104331	hi in abell 3128	we discuss australia telescope compact array (atca) hi 21cm data for thegalaxy cluster a3128. our observations are intentionally relatively shallow,and a blind search through our data cube yields (tentative) detections of onlytwo galaxies, of which one is probably spurious.  a3128 is part of the eso nearby abell cluster survey (enacs); redshifts areavailable for 193 galaxies in the a3128 region. for 148 of these galaxies theredshifts are such that the hi emission (if any) would lie within our datacube. we use the known redshifts of these galaxies to coadd their spectra andthus improve our sensitivity to hi emission. the technique is fairly successful-- the coadded spectra allow detection of an average mass content of ~ 9x10^8msun, almost an order of magnitude lower than for direct detection ofindividual objects.  by dividing the total galaxy sample into subsamples we find that the gascontent of late type galaxies that lie outside the x-ray emitting core of thecluster is substantially higher than that of those within the core. evenoutside the x-ray emitting region the distribution of gas-rich galaxies in thecluster is not uniform, we find that gas-rich galaxies are concentrated in theeast of the cluster. this is consistent with earlier analyses of the kinematicsof the galaxies in a3128 which indicate the presence of subclustering.  in summary we find that coadding spectra is a powerful tool for the study ofhi in cluster galaxies, and suggest that this technique could be applied tosubstantially increase the redshift range over which such observations could becarried out.

astro-ph;0310764	constraining the variation of fundamental constants using 18cm oh lines	we describe a new technique to estimate variations in the fundamentalconstants using 18cm oh absorption lines. this has the advantage that all linesarise in the same species, allowing a clean comparison between the measuredredshifts. in conjunction with one additional transition (for example, anhco$^+$ line), it is possible to simultaneously measure changes in $\alpha$,$g_p$ and $y \equiv m_e/m_p$. at present, only the 1665 mhz and 1667 mhz lineshave been detected at cosmological distances; we use these line redshifts inconjunction with those of hi 21cm and mm-wave molecular absorption in agravitational lens at $z\sim 0.68$ to constrain changes in the above threeparameters over the redshift range $0 &lt; z \lesssim 0.68$. while the constraintsare relatively weak ($\lesssim$ 1 part in $10^3$), this is the firstsimultaneous constraint on the variation of all three parameters. we alsodemonstrate that either one (or more) of $\alpha$, $g_p$ and $y$ must vary withcosmological time or there must be systematic velocity offsets between the oh,hco$^+$ and hi absorbing clouds.

astro-ph;0503125	resolving the mystery of the dwarf galaxy hizss003	the nearby galaxy hizss003 was recently discovered during a blind hi surveyof the zone of avoidance (henning et al. 2000). follow up vla as well asoptical and near-ir imaging and spectroscopy (massey et al. 2003; silva et al.2005) confirm that it is a low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxy. howeverthere were two puzzling aspects of the observations, (i) current starformation, as traced by h$\alpha$ emission, is confined to a small region atthe edge of the vla hi image and (ii) the metallicity of the older rgb stars ishigher than that of the gas in hii region. we present high spatial and velocityresolution giant meterwave radio telescope (gmrt) observations that resolvethese puzzles by showing that hizss003 is actually a galaxy pair and that thehii region lies at the center of a much smaller companion galaxy (hizss003b) tothe main galaxy (hizss003a). the hi emission from these two galaxies overlapsin projection, but can be separated in velocity space. hizss003b has an hi massof 2.6 x 10^6 m$_\odot$, and a highly disturbed velocity field. since thevelocity field is disturbed, an accurate rotation curve cannot be derived,however, the indicative dynamical mass is ~5 x 10^7 m$_\odot$. for the biggergalaxy hizss003a we derive an hi mass of 1.4 x 10^7 m$_\odot$. the velocityfield of this galaxy is quite regular and from its rotation curve we derive atotal dynamical mass of ~6.5 x 10^8 m$_\odot$.

0809.1772	hi and star formation in the most metal-deficient galaxies	we present giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) observations for three(viz., ddo 68, sdss j2104-0035 and ugc 772) of the six most metal-deficientactively star-forming galaxies known. although there is a debate as to whetherthese galaxies are undergoing their first episode of star formation or not,they are `young' in the sense that their ism is chemically unevolved. in thisregard, they are the nearest equivalents of young galaxies in the earlyuniverse. all three galaxies, that we have observed, have irregular himorphologies and kinematics, which we interpret as either due to tidalinteraction with neighbouring galaxies, or the consequences of a recent merger.the remaining three of the six most metal-deficient galaxies are also known tohave highly disturbed hi distributions and are interacting. it is interestingbecause these galaxies were chosen solely on the basis of their metallicity andnot for any particular signs of interaction. in this sense (i.e., their gas hasnot yet had time to settle into a regular disc), one could regard theseextremely metal deficient (xmd) galaxies as `young'. the current star formationepisode is likely to have been triggered by interaction/merger. it is alsopossible that the tidal interaction has lead to enhanced mixing with metal-poorgas in outer disc, and hence to a low gas-phase metallicity in the centralstar-forming regions. we also find that in general these galaxies do not show aone-to-one correspondence between regions of high hi column density and regionswith current star formation. however, to the extent that one can define athreshold density, its value (~10^{21} atoms cm^{-2}) is similar to that ingalaxies with much higher metallicity.

astro-ph;0701668	the hi content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24	we use observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) tomeasure the atomic hydrogen gas content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24(i.e. a look-backtime of ~3 gyr). the sample of galaxies studied were selectedfrom halpha-emitting field galaxies detected in a narrow-band imaging surveywith the subaru telescope. the anglo-australian telescope was used to obtainprecise optical redshifts for these galaxies. we then coadded the hi 21 cmemission signal for all the galaxies within the gmrt spectral line data cube.  from the coadded signal of 121 galaxies, we measure an average atomichydrogen gas mass of (2.26 +- 0.90)*10^9 solar masses. we translate this hisignal into a cosmic density of neutral gas at z = 0.24 of omega_gas = (0.91 +-0.42)*10^-3. this is the current highest redshift at which omega_gas has beenconstrained from 21 cm emission and our value is consistent with that estimatedfrom damped lyman-alpha systems around this redshift. we also find that thecorrelations between the halpha luminosity and the radio continuum luminosityand between the star formation rate and the hi gas content in star-forminggalaxies at z = 0.24 are consistent with the correlations found at z = 0. thesetwo results suggest that the star formation mechanisms in field galaxies ~3 gyrago were not substantially different from the present, even though the starformation rate is 3 times higher.

astro-ph;9512069	a radio search for high redshift hi absorption	ground based optical observations have yielded considerable information onthe statistics of damped-lyman alpha systems. in particular these systems areknown to be the dominant repository of the observed neutral gas at highredshift. however, particularly at high redshift, there is the possibility thatoptical observations could be biased due to the exclusion of damped-lyman alphasystems that contain moderate to significant amounts of dust. independentobservational constraints on the neutral hydrogen content at high redshifts andthe amount of dust in high redshift systems can be obtained from a radio searchagainst the bright lobes of distant radio galaxies (which is less affected bythe presence of dust in foreground damped-lyman alpha systems). we describehere a pilot radio survey along the line of sight to a small sample of highredshift radio galaxies, and also present some preliminary results. the surveyuses a novel observing mode at the wsrt which enables one to make sensitivesearches of a large redshift interval in a modest amount of telescope time.

(1993).
