0903.1108	a chandra x-ray analysis of abell 1664: cooling, feedback and star  formation in the central cluster galaxy	the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in the abell 1664 cluster is unusuallyblue and is forming stars at a rate of ~ 23 m_{\sun} yr^{-1}. the bcg islocated within 5 kpc of the x-ray peak, where the cooling time of 3.5x10^8 yrand entropy of 10.4 kev cm^2 are consistent with other star-forming bcgs incooling flow clusters. the center of a1664 has an elongated, "bar-like" x-raystructure whose mass is comparable to the mass of molecular hydrogen, ~ 10^{10}m_{\sun} in the bcg. we show that this gas is unlikely to have been strippedfrom interloping galaxies. the cooling rate in this region is roughlyconsistent with the star formation rate, suggesting that the hot gas iscondensing onto the bcg. we use the scaling relations of birzan et al. 2008 toshow that the agn is underpowered compared to the central x-ray coolingluminosity by roughly a factor of three. we suggest that a1664 is experiencingrapid cooling and star formation during a low-state of an agn feedback cyclethat regulates the rates of cooling and star formation. modeling the emissionas a single temperature plasma, we find that the metallicity peaks 100 kpc fromthe x-ray center, resulting in a central metallicity dip. however, amulti-temperature cooling flow model improves the fit to the x-ray emission andis able to recover the expected, centrally-peaked metallicity profile.

0903.2297	cosmological studies with a large-area x-ray telescope	a moderate investment of observing time with the international x-rayobservatory to study high-redshift galaxy clusters detected in futurelarge-scale surveys, will provide cosmological measurements of fundamentalimportance. ixo observations, combined with lensing follow-up, will measure theperturbation growth factor from z=0-2 with an accuracy comparable to, orpossibly better than, that expected from observations of cosmic shear withjdem, and redshift-space distortions with euclid. the growth of structure dataderived from clusters will significantly improve our knowledge of the darkenergy equation of state and will aid in constraining non-gr models for cosmicacceleration. ixo observations of the largest, dynamically relaxed clusterswill provide a powerful, independent measurement of the cosmological expansionhistory using the apparent f_gas(z) trend. systematic and statistical errorsfrom this technique are competitive with snia and bao studies, making the testextremely useful for improving the accuracy and reliability of the geometriccosmological measurements planned for lsst and jdem. only by employing a rangeof powerful, independent approaches, including those discussed here, can robustanswers to puzzles as profound as the origin of cosmic acceleration beexpected.

0909.2252	direct evidence for outflow of metal-enriched gas along the radio jets  of hydra a	using deep chandra observations of the hydra a galaxy cluster, we examine themetallicity structure near the central galaxy and along its powerful radiosource. we show that the metallicity of the intracluster medium is enhanced byup to 0.2 dex along the radio jets and lobes compared to the metallicity of theundisturbed gas. the enhancements extend from a radius of 20 kpc from thecentral galaxy to a distance of ~ 120 kpc. we estimate the total iron mass thathas been transported out of the central galaxy to be between 2 x 10^7 m_sun and7 x 10^7 m_sun which represents 10% - 20% of the iron mass within the centralgalaxy. the energy required to lift this gas is roughly 1% to 5% of the totalenergetic output of the agn. evidently, hydra a's powerful radio source is ableto redistribute metal-enriched, low entropy gas throughout the core of thegalaxy cluster. the short re-enrichment time scale &lt; 10^9 yr implies that themetals lost from the central galaxy will be quickly replenished.

1004.1559	chandra observation of two shock fronts in the merging galaxy cluster  abell 2146	we present a new chandra observation of the galaxy cluster abell 2146 whichhas revealed a complex merging system with a gas structure that is remarkablysimilar to the bullet cluster (eg. markevitch et al. 2002). the x-ray image andtemperature map show a cool 2-3 kev subcluster with a ram pressure strippedtail of gas just exiting the disrupted 6-7 kev primary cluster. from the sharpjump in the temperature and density of the gas, we determine that thesubcluster is preceded by a bow shock with a mach number m=2.2+/-0.8,corresponding to a velocity v=2200^{+1000}_{-900} km/s relative to the maincluster. we estimate that the subcluster passed through the primary core only0.1-0.3 gyr ago. in addition, we observe a slower upstream shock propagatingthrough the outer region of the primary cluster and calculate a mach numberm=1.7+/-0.3. based on the measured shock mach numbers m~2 and the strength ofthe upstream shock, we argue that the mass ratio between the two mergingclusters is between 3 and 4 to one. by comparing the chandra observation withan archival hst observation, we find that a group of galaxies is located infront of the x-ray subcluster core but the brightest cluster galaxy is locatedimmediately behind the x-ray peak.

0708.0579	jet interactions with the hot halos of clusters and galaxies	x-ray observations of cavities and shock fronts produced by jets streamingthrough hot halos have significantly advanced our understanding of theenergetics and dynamics of extragalactic radio sources. radio sources at thecenters of clusters have dynamical ages between ten and several hundred millionyears. they liberate between 1e58-1e62 erg per outburst, which is enough energyto regulate cooling of hot halos from galaxies to the richest clusters. jetpower scales approximately with the radio synchrotron luminosity to the onehalf power. however, the synchrotron efficiency varies widely from nearly unityto one part in 10,000, such that relatively feeble radio source can havequasar-like mechanical power. the synchrotron ages of cluster radio sources aredecoupled from their dynamical ages, which tend to be factors of several toorders of magnitude older. magnetic fields and particles in the lobes tend tobe out of equipartition. the lobes may be maintained by heavy particles (e.g.,protons), low energy electrons, a hot, diffuse thermal gas, or possiblymagnetic (poynting) stresses. sensitive x-ray images of shock fronts andcavities can be used to study the dynamics of extragalactic radio sources.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

1006.5699	a relationship between agn jet power and radio power	using chandra x-ray and vla radio data, we investigate the scalingrelationship between jet power, p_jet, and synchrotron luminosity, p_rad. weexpand the sample presented in birzan et al. (2008) to lower radio power byincorporating measurements for 21 ges to determine if the birzan et al. (2008)p_jet-p_rad scaling relations are continuous in form and scatter from giantelliptical galaxies (ges) up to brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). we find amean scaling relation of p_jet approximately 5.8x10^43 (p_rad/10^40)^(0.70)erg/s which is continuous over ~6-8 decades in p_jet and p_rad with a scatterof approximately 0.7 dex. our mean scaling relationship is consistent with themodel presented in willott et al. (1999) if the typical fraction of lobe energyin non-radiating particles to that in relativistic electrons is &gt; 100. weidentify several ges whose radio luminosities are unusually large for their jetpowers and have radio sources which extend well beyond the densest parts oftheir x-ray halos. we suggest that these radio sources are unusually luminousbecause they were unable to entrain appreciable amounts of gas.

1007.1227	are radio agn powered by accretion or black hole spin?	we compare accretion and black hole spin as potential energy sources foroutbursts from agn in brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). based on our adoptedspin model, we find that the distribution of agn power estimated from x-raycavities is consistent with a broad range of both spin parameter and accretionrate. sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most bcgs topower their agn by accretion alone. however, we find no correlation between agnpower and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. for agiven agn power, the bcg's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as thefraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the agn,both vary by more than two orders of magnitude. most of the molecular gas inbcgs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleusby the agn before it reaches the nuclear black hole. bondi accretion from hotatmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful agn, unless their black holesare more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. we identify severalpowerful agn that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating anunusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their agn are powered by anothermechanism. if these systems are powered primarily by black hole spin, ratherthan by accretion, spin must also be tapped efficiently in some systems, i.e.,$p_{\rm jet} &gt; \dot mc^2$, or their black hole masses must be substantiallylarger than the values implied by their bulge luminosities. we constrain the(model dependent) accretion rate at the transition from radiatively inefficientto radiatively efficient accretion flows to be a few percent of the eddingtonrate, a value that is consistent with other estimates.

1101.4966	evidence for rapid redshift evolution of strong cluster cooling flows	we present equivalent widths of the [oii] and ha nebular emission lines for77 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) selected from the 160 square degree$rosat$ x-ray survey. we find no [oii] or ha emission stronger than -15angstroms or -5 angstroms, respectively, in any bcg. the corresponding emissionline luminosities lie below 6e40 erg/s, which is a factor of 30 below that ofngc1275 in the perseus cluster. a comparison to the detection frequency ofnebular emission in bcgs lying at redshifts above z = 0.35 drawn from thebrightest cluster survey (crawford et al. 1999) indicates that we should havedetected roughly one dozen emission-line galaxies, assuming the two surveys areselecting similar clusters in the x-ray luminosity range 10e42 erg/s to 10e45erg/s. the absence of luminous nebular emission (ie., perseus-like systems) inour sample is consistent with an increase in the number density of {\it strong}cooling flow (cooling core) clusters between $\rm z=0.5$ and today. the declinein their numbers at higher redshift could be due to cluster mergers and agnheating.

0709.2152	heating hot atmospheres with active galactic nuclei	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the hot gas in galaxy clusters hasshown that the gas is not cooling to low temperatures at the predicted rates ofhundreds to thousands of solar masses per year. x-ray images have revealedgiant cavities and shock fronts in the hot gas that provide a direct andrelatively reliable means of measuring the energy injected into hot atmospheresby active galactic nuclei (agn). average radio jet powers are near thoserequired to offset radiative losses and to suppress cooling in isolated giantelliptical galaxies, and in larger systems up to the richest galaxy clusters.this coincidence suggests that heating and cooling are coupled by feedback,which suppresses star formation and the growth of luminous galaxies. how jetenergy is converted to heat and the degree to which other heating mechanismsare contributing, eg. thermal conduction, are not well understood. outburstenergies require substantial late growth of supermassive black holes. unlessall of the approximately 10e62 erg required to suppress star formation isdeposited in the cooling regions of clusters, agn outbursts must alterlarge-scale properties of the intracluster medium.

1103.0630	a powerful agn outburst in rbs 797	utilizing $\sim 50$ ks of chandra x-ray observatory imaging, we present ananalysis of the intracluster medium (icm) and cavity system in the galaxycluster rbs 797. in addition to the two previously known cavities in thecluster core, the new and deeper x-ray image has revealed additional structureassociated with the active galactic nucleus (agn). the surface brightnessdecrements of the two cavities are unusually large, and are consistent withelongated cavities lying close to our line-of-sight. we estimate a total agnoutburst energy and mean jet power of $\approx 3 - 6 \times 10^{60}$ erg and$\approx 3 - 6 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively, depending on theassumed geometrical configuration of the cavities. thus, rbs 797 is apparentlyamong the the most powerful agn outbursts known in a cluster. the average massaccretion rate needed to power the agn by accretion alone is $\sim 1 m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. we show that accretion of cold gas onto the agn at this level isplausible, but that bondi accretion of the hot atmosphere is probably not. thebcg harbors an unresolved, non-thermal nuclear x-ray source with a bolometricluminosity of $\approx 2 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the nuclear emission isprobably associated with a rapidly-accreting, radiatively inefficient accretionflow. we present tentative evidence that star formation in the bcg is beingtriggered by the radio jets and suggest that the cavities may be driving weakshocks ($m \sim 1.5$) into the icm, similar to the process in the galaxycluster ms 0735.6+7421.

1103.0793	anisotropic metal-enriched outflows driven by agn in clusters of  galaxies	we present an analysis of the spatial distribution of metal-rich gas in tengalaxy clusters using deep observations from the chandra x-ray observatory. thebrightest cluster galaxies have experienced recent agn activity in the forms ofbright radio emission, cavities, and shock fronts embedded in the hotatmospheres. the heavy elements are distributed anisotropically and are alignedwith the large-scale radio and cavity axes. they are apparently beingtransported from the halo of the brightest cluster galaxy into the intraclustermedium along large-scale outflows driven by the radio jets. the radial rangesof the metal-enriched outflows are found to scale with jet power as r_fe ~p_jet^0.42, with a scatter of only 0.5 dex. the heavy elements are transportedbeyond the extent of the inner cavities in all clusters, suggesting this is along lasting effect sustained over multiple generations of outbursts. blackholes in bcgs will likely have difficulty ejecting metal enriched gas beyond 1mpc unless their masses substantially exceed 10^9 m_sun.

1107.2946	average heating rate of hot atmospheres in distant clusters by radio  agn: evidence for continuous agn heating	we examine atmospheric heating by radio active galactic nuclei (agn) indistant x-ray clusters by cross correlating clusters selected from the 400square degree (400sd) x-ray cluster survey with radio sources in the nrao vlasky survey. roughly 30% of the clusters show radio emission above a fluxthreshold of 3 mjy within a projected radius of 250 kpc. the radio emission ispresumably associated with the brightest cluster galaxy. the mechanical jetpower for each radio source was determined using scaling relations betweenradio power and cavity (mechanical) power determined for nearby clusters,groups, and galaxies with hot atmospheres containing x-ray cavities. theaverage jet power of the central radio agn is approximately $2\times10^{44}$\ergs. we find no significant correlation between radio power, hencemechanical jet power, and the x-ray luminosities of clusters in the redshiftrange 0.1 -- 0.6. this implies that the mechanical heating rate per particle ishigher in lower mass, lower x-ray luminosity clusters. the jet power averagedover the sample corresponds to an atmospheric heating of approximately 0.2 kevper particle within r$_{500}$. assuming the current agn heating rate does notevolve but remains constant to redshifts of 2, the heating rate per particlewould rise by a factor of two. we find that the energy injected from radio agncontribute substantially to the excess entropy in hot atmospheres needed tobreak self-similarity in cluster scaling relations. the detection frequency ofradio agn is inconsistent with the presence of strong cooling flows in 400sdclusters, but does not exclude weak cooling flows. it is unclear whethercentral agn in 400sd clusters are maintained by feedback at the base of acooling flow. atmospheric heating by radio agn may retard the development ofstrong cooling flows at early epochs.

1204.0006	mechanical feedback from active galactic nuclei in galaxies, groups, and  clusters	the radiative cooling timescales at the centers of hot atmospheressurrounding elliptical galaxies, groups, and clusters are much shorter thantheir ages. therefore, hot atmospheres are expected to cool and to form stars.cold gas and star formation are observed in central cluster galaxies but atlevels below those expected from an unimpeded cooling flow. x-ray observationshave shown that wholesale cooling is being offset by mechanical heating fromradio active galactic nuclei. feedback is widely considered to be an importantand perhaps unavoidable consequence of the evolution of galaxies andsupermassive black holes. we show that cooling x-ray atmospheres and theensuing star formation and nuclear activity are probably coupled to aself-regulated feedback loop. while the energetics are now reasonably wellunderstood, other aspects of feedback are not. we highlight the problems ofatmospheric heating and transport processes, accretion, and nuclear activity,and we discuss the potential role of black hole spin. we discuss x-ray imageryshowing that the chemical elements produced by central galaxies are beingdispersed on large scales by outflows launched from the vicinity ofsupermassive black holes. finally, we comment on the growing evidence formechanical heating of distant cluster atmospheres by radio jets and itspotential consequences for the excess entropy in hot halos and a possibledecline in the number of distant cooling flows.

1206.7071	radio agn in galaxy clusters: heating hot atmospheres and driving  supermassive black hole growth over cosmic time	we estimate the average radio-agn (mechanical) power deposited into the hotatmospheres of galaxy clusters over more than three quarters of the age of theuniverse. our sample was drawn from eight major x-ray cluster surveys, andincludes 685 clusters in the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 that overlap the areacovered by the nvss. the radio agn mechanical power was estimated from theradio luminosity of central nvss sources, using the relation of cavagnolo etal. 2010 that is based on mechanical powers determined from the enthalpies ofx-ray cavities. we find only a weak correlation between radio luminosity andcluster x-ray luminosity, although the most powerful radio sources resides inluminous clusters. the average agn mechanical power of 3x10^{44} erg/s exceedsthe x-ray luminosity of 44% of the clusters, indicating that the accumulationof radio-agn energy is significant in these clusters. integrating the agnmechanical power to redshift z=2, using simple models for its evolution anddisregarding the hierarchical growth of clusters, we find that the agn energyaccumulated per particle in low luminosity x-ray clusters exceeds 1 kev perparticle. this result represents a conservative lower limit to the accumulatedthermal energy. the estimate is comparable to the level of energy needed to"preheat" clusters, indicating that continual outbursts from radio-agn are asignificant source of gas energy in hot atmospheres. assuming an average massconversion efficiency of $\eta=0.1$, our result implies that the supermassiveblack holes that released this energy did so by accreting an average of ~10^9m_{sun} over time, which is comparable to the level of growth expected duringthe quasar era.

1210.7100	the duty cycle of radio-mode feedback in complete samples of clusters	the chandra x-ray observatory has revealed x-ray bubbles in the intraclustermedium (icm) of many nearby cooling flow clusters. the bubbles trace feedbackthat is thought to couple the central active galactic nucleus (agn) to the icm,helping to stabilize cooling flows and govern the evolution of massivegalaxies. however, the prevalence and duty cycle of such agn outbursts is notwell understood. to this end, we study how cooling is balanced by bubbleheating for complete samples of clusters (the brightest 55 clusters ofgalaxies, hereafter b55, and the highest x-ray flux galaxy cluster sample,hiflugcs). we find that the radio luminosity of the central galaxy only exceeds2.5 x 10^30 erg s^-1 hz^-1 in cooling flow clusters. this result implies aconnection between the central radio source and the icm, as expected if agnfeedback is operating. additionally, we find a duty cycle for radio modefeedback, the fraction of time that a system possesses bubbles inflated by itscentral radio source, of &gt; 69 per cent for b55 and &gt; 63 per cent for hiflugcs.these duty cycles are lower limits since some bubbles are likely missed inexisting images. we used simulations to constrain the bubble power that mightbe present and remain undetected in the cooling flow systems without detectedbubbles. among theses systems, almost all could have significant bubble power.therefore, our results imply that the duty cycle of agn outbursts with thepotential to heat the gas significantly in cooling flow clusters is at least 60per cent and could approach 100 per cent.

1211.5604	radiative efficiency, variability and bondi accretion onto massive black  holes: from mechanical to quasar feedback in brightest cluster galaxies	we examine unresolved nuclear x-ray sources in 57 brightest cluster galaxiesto study the relationship between nuclear x-ray emission and accretion ontosupermassive black holes (smbhs). the majority of the clusters in our samplehave prominent x-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres,which we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate onto thesmbhs over the past several hundred myr. we find that ~50% of the sample havedetectable nuclear x-ray emission. the nuclear x-ray luminosity is correlatedwith average accretion rate determined using x-ray cavities, which isconsistent with the hypothesis that nuclear x-ray emission traces ongoingaccretion. the results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recentagn outbursts, in the last ~10^7yr, are `on' at least half of the time. nuclearx-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power asthe mean accretion rate rises. we show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jetpower when the mean accretion rate rises above a few percent of the eddingtonrate, where the agn apparently transitions to a quasar. the nuclear x-rayemission from three objects (a2052, hydra a, m84) varies by factors of 2-10 ontimescales of 6 months to 10 years. if variability at this level is a commonphenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship betweenmean accretion rate and nuclear x-ray luminosity. we find no significant changein the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variableobjects. the relationship between accretion and nuclear x-ray luminosity isconsistent with emission from either a jet, an adaf, or a combination of thetwo, although other origins are possible. we also consider the longstandingproblem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gasor nearly spherical inflows of hot kev gas.[abridged]

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

1309.0014	massive molecular gas flows in the abell 1664 brightest cluster galaxy	we report alma early science co(1-0) and co(3-2) observations of thebrightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in abell 1664. the bcg contains 1.1x10^{10}solar masses of molecular gas divided roughly equally between two distinctvelocity systems: one from -250 to +250 km/s centred on the bcg's systemicvelocity and a high velocity system blueshifted by 570 km/s with respect to thesystemic velocity. the bcg's systemic component shows a smooth velocitygradient across the bcg center with velocity proportional to radius suggestiveof solid body rotation about the nucleus. however, the mass and velocitystructure are highly asymmetric and there is little star formation coincidentwith a putative disk. it may be an inflow of gas that will settle into a diskover several 10^8 yr. the high velocity system consists of two gas clumps, each~2 kpc across, located to the north and southeast of the nucleus. each has aline of sight velocity spread of 250-300 km/s. the velocity of the gas in thehigh velocity system tends to increase towards the bcg center and could signifya massive high velocity flow onto the nucleus. however, the velocity gradientis not smooth and these structures are also coincident with low optical-uvsurface brightness regions, which could indicate dust extinction associatedwith each clump. if so, the high velocity gas would be projected in front ofthe bcg and moving toward us along the line of sight in a massive outflow mostlikely driven by the agn. a merger origin is unlikely but cannot be ruled out.

1310.4501	cold gas dynamics in hydra-a: evidence for a rotating disk	we present multi-frequency observations of the radio galaxy hydra-a (3c218)located in the core of a massive, x-ray luminous galaxy cluster. ifuspectroscopy is used to trace the kinematics of the ionised and warm molecularhydrogen which are consistent with a ~ 5 kpc rotating disc. broad,double-peaked lines of co(2-1), [cii]157 $\mu$m and [oi]63 $\mu$m are detected.we estimate the mass of the cold gas within the disc to be m$_{gas}$ = 2.3$\pm$ 0.3 x 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$. these observations demonstrate that the complexline profiles found in the cold atomic and molecular gas are related to therotating disc or ring of gas. finally, an hst image of the galaxy shows thatthis gas disc contains a substantial mass of dust. the large gas mass, sfr andkinematics are consistent with the levels of gas cooling from the icm. weconclude that the cold gas originates from the continual quiescent accumulationof cooled icm gas. the rotation is in a plane perpendicular to the projectedorientation of the radio jets and icm cavities hinting at a possible connectionbetween the kpc-scale cooling gas and the accretion of material onto the blackhole. we discuss the implications of these observations for models of coldaccretion, agn feedback and cooling flows.

1405.6208	cycling of the powerful agn in ms 0735.6+7421 and the duty cycle of  radio agn in clusters	we present an analysis of deep chandra x-ray observations of the galaxycluster ms 0735.6+7421, which hosts the most energetic radio agn known. ouranalysis has revealed two cavities in its hot atmosphere with diameters of200-240 kpc. the total cavity enthalpy, mean age, and mean jet power are$9\times 10^{61}$ erg, $1.6\times 10^{8}$ yr, and $1.7\times 10^{46}$ erg/s,respectively. the cavities are surrounded by nearly continuous temperature andsurface brightness discontinuities associated with an elliptical shock front ofmach number 1.26 (1.17-1.30) and age of $1.1\times 10^{8}$ yr. the shock hasinjected at least $4\times 10^{61}$ erg into the hot atmosphere at a rate of$1.1\times 10^{46}$ erg/s. a second pair of cavities and possibly a secondshock front are located along the radio jets, indicating that the agn power hasdeclined by a factor of 30 over the past 100 myr. the multiphase atmospheresurrounding the central galaxy is cooling at a rate of 36 msun/yr, but does notfuel star formation at an appreciable rate. in addition to heating, entrainmentin the radio jet may be depleting the nucleus of fuel and preventing gas fromcondensing out of the intracluster medium. finally, we examine the mean timeintervals between agn outbursts in systems with multiple generations of x-raycavities. we find that, like ms0735, their agn rejuvenate on a timescale thatis approximately 1/3 of their mean central cooling timescales, indicating thatjet heating is outpacing cooling in these systems.

1408.4512	jet-intracluster medium interaction in hydra a. i estimates of jet  velocity from inner knots	we present the first stage of an investigation of the interactions of thejets in the radio galaxy hydra a with the intracluster medium. we consider thejet kinetic power, the galaxy and cluster atmosphere, and the inner structureof the radio source. analysing radio observations of the inner lobes of hydra aby taylor et al. (1990) we confirm the jet power estimates of about 1e45 ergs/sderived by wise et al. (2007) from dynamical analysis of the x-ray cavities.with this result and a model for the galaxy halo, we explore thejet-intracluster medium interactions occurring on a scale of 10 kpc usingtwo-dimensional, axisymmetric, relativistic pure hydrodynamic simulations. akey feature is that we identify the three bright knots in the northern jet asbiconical reconfinement shocks, which result when an over pressured jet startsto come into equilibrium with the galactic atmosphere. through an extensiveparameter space study we deduce that the jet velocity is approximately 0.8 c ata distance 0.5 kpc from the black hole. the combined constraints of jet power,the observed jet radius profile along the jet, and the estimated jet pressureand jet velocity imply a value of the jet density parameter approximately 13for the northern jet. we show that for a jet velocity = 0.8c and angle betweenthe jet and the line of sight = 42 deg, an intrinsic asymmetry in theemissivity of the northern and southern jet is required for a consistentbrightness ratio approximately 7 estimated from the 6cm vla image of hydra a.

1507.03022	high radio frequency properties and variability of brightest cluster  galaxies	we consider the high radio frequency (15 ghz - 353 ghz) properties andvariability of 35 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). these are the mostcore-dominated sources drawn from a parent sample of more than 700 x-rayselected clusters, thus allowing us to relate our results to the generalpopulation. we find that &gt;6.0% of our parent sample (&gt;15.1% if only cool-coreclusters are considered) contain a radio-source at 150 ghz of at least 3mjy(~1x10^23 w/hz at our median redshift of z~0.13). furthermore, &gt;3.4% of thebcgs in our parent sample contain a peaked component (gigahertz peakedspectrum, gps) in their spectra that peaks above 2 ghz, increasing to &gt;8.5% ifonly cool-core clusters are considered. we see little evidence for strongvariability at 15 ghz on short (week-month) time-scales although we seevariations greater than 20% at 150 ghz over 6-month times-frames for 4 of the23 sources with multi-epoch observations. much more prevalent is long-term(year-decade time-scale) variability, with average annual amplitude variationsgreater than 1% at 15 ghz being commonplace. there is a weak trend towardshigher variability as the peak of the gps-like component occurs at higherfrequency. we demonstrate the complexity that is seen in the radio spectra ofbcgs and discuss the potentially significant implications of these high-peakingcomponents for sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster searches.

0806.1929	radiative efficiency and content of extragalactic radio sources: toward  a universal scaling relation between jet power and radio power	we present an analysis of the energetics and particle content of the lobes of24 radio galaxies at the cores of cooling clusters. the radio lobes in thesesystems have created visible cavities in the surrounding hot, x-ray-emittinggas, which allow direct measurement of the mechanical jet power of radiosources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radioproperties themselves. using these measurements, we examine the ratio betweenradio power and total jet power (the radiative efficiency). we find that jet(cavity) power increases with radio synchrotron power approximately as p_jet ~(l_radio)^beta, where 0.35 &lt; beta &lt; 0.70 depending on the bandpass ofmeasurement and state of the source. however, the scatter about these relationscaused by variations in radiative efficiency spans more than four orders ofmagnitude. after accounting for variations in synchrotron break frequency(age), the scatter is reduced by ~ 50%, yielding the most accurate scalingrelation available between the lobe bolometric radio power and the jet (cavity)power. we place limits on the magnetic field strengths and particle content ofthe radio lobes using a variety of x-ray constraints. we find that the lobemagnetic field strengths vary between a few to several tens of microgaussdepending on the age and dynamical state of the lobes. if the cavities aremaintained in pressure balance with their surroundings and are supported byinternal fields and particles in equipartition, the ratio of energy inelectrons to heavy particles (k) must vary widely from approximately unity to4000, consistent with heavy (hadronic) jets.

astro-ph;0110523	interaction of radio lobes with the hot intracluster medium: driving  convective outflow in hydra a	the radio lobes of hydra a lie within cavities surrounded by a rim ofenhanced x-ray emission in the intracluster gas. although the bright rimappears cooler than the surrounding gas, existing chandra data do not excludethe possibility that the rim is produced by a weak shock. a temperature mapshows that cool gas extends out along the radio axis of hydra a. the age of theradio source and equipartition pressure of the radio lobe argue against ashock, and comparison with similar structure in the perseus cluster alsosuggests that the rim is cool. we show that the cool bright rim cannot be theresult of shock induced cooling, or due to the effect of magnetic fields inshocks. the most likely source of low entropy (cool) gas is entrainment by therising cavity. this requires some means of communicating the bouyant force onthe cavity to the surrounding gas. the magnetic field required to produce thefaraday rotation in hydra a has the appropriate properties for this, if thefaraday screen is mainly in this bright rim. in hydra a, the mass outflow dueto the rising cavities could be sufficient to balance cooling driven inflow, sopreventing the build up of low entropy gas in the cluster core.

astro-ph;0202199	clusters of galaxies at sharp focus: cooling flows and radio sources  unveiled by chandra	chandra images of galaxy clusters have revealed a wealth of structure unseenby previous generations of low resolution x-ray observatories. in the cores ofclusters, bright, irregular x-ray emission is now routinely seen within centraldominant galaxies (cdgs) harboring powerful radio sources. the radio sourcesare interacting with and are often displacing the hot gas leaving cavities intheir wakes. the cavities rise buoyantly, transporting up to 10e61 ergs ofenergy to the intracluster medium over the life of a cluster. the dynamicallyimportant magnetic fields observed in cooling flows may have originated fromthese cavities. the cooling rates found by chandra and xmm-newton are muchsmaller than previously reported, and they are more in line with the levels ofcold gas and star formation seen in other bandpasses. i discuss the emergingcorrelation between extended h-alpha emission, star formation, and bright x-rayemission at locations where the cooling time of the kev gas approaches a fewhundred million years. data from a variety of disciplines suggest repeated,short duration bursts of cooling and star formation are occurring, possiblyinduced and regulated in some instances by the central radio source. finally, idiscuss the interesting possibility that radio sources quench cooling flows,while emphasizing the difficulties with some proposed scenarios.

astro-ph;0305228	the 160 square degree rosat survey: the revised catalog of 201 clusters  with spectroscopic redshifts	we present the revised catalog of galaxy clusters detected as extended x-raysources in the 160 square degree rosat survey, including spectroscopicredshifts and x-ray luminosities for 200 of the 201 members. the medianredshift is z~0.25 and the median x-ray luminosity is 4.2e+43 erg/s/h50^2(0.5-2.0 kev). this is the largest high-redshift sample of x-ray selectedclusters published to date. there are 73 objects at z&gt;0.3 and 22 objects atz&gt;0.5 drawn from a statistically complete flux-limited survey with a medianobject flux of 1.4d-13 erg/cm^2/s. we describe the optical follow-up of theseclusters with an emphasis on our spectroscopy which has yielded 155 clusterredshifts, 110 of which are presented here for the first time. thesemeasurements combined with 45 from the literature and other sources providenear-complete spectroscopic coverage for our survey. we discuss the finaloptical identifications for the extended x-ray sources in the survey region andcompare our results to similar x-ray cluster searches.

astro-ph;0310035	the insignificance of global reheating in the abell 1068 cluster:  multiwavelength analysis	we present a detailed, multiwavelength study of the abell 1068 galaxycluster, and we use this data to test cooling and energy feedback models ofgalaxy clusters. near ultraviolet and infrared images of the cluster show thatthe cd galaxy is experiencing star formation at a rate of ~20-70 m_o/yr overthe past ~100 myr. the dusty starburst is concentrated toward the nucleus ofthe cd galaxy and in filamentary structures projecting 60 kpc into its halo.the chandra x-ray image presented in wmm reveals a steep temperature gradientthat drops from roughly 4.8 kev beyond 120 kpc to roughly 2.3 kev in the inner10 kpc of the galaxy where the starburst peaks. over 95% of the ultraviolet andhalpha photons associated with the starburst are emerging from regions cloakedin kev gas with very short cooling times ~100 myr, as would be expected fromstar formation fueled by cooling condensations in the intracluster medium. thelocal cooling rate in the vicinity of the central starburst is &lt; 40 m_o/yr,which is consistent with the star formation rate determined with u-band andinfrared data. we find that energy feedback from both the radio source andthermal conduction are inconsequential in abell 1068. although supernovaexplosions associated with the starburst may be able to retard by ~18% or so,they are incapable of maintaining the cooling gas at kev temperatures.

astro-ph;0401605	evolution of the cluster x-ray luminosity function	we report measurements of the cluster x-ray luminosity function out to z=0.8based on the final sample of 201 galaxy systems from the 160 square degreerosat cluster survey. there is little evidence for any measurable change incluster abundance out to z~0.6 at luminosities less than a few times 10^44ergs/s (0.5-2.0 kev). however, between 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and at luminosities above10^44 ergs/s, the observed volume densities are significantly lower than thoseof the present-day population. we quantify this cluster deficit usingintegrated number counts and a maximum-likelihood analysis of the observedluminosity-redshift distribution fit with a model luminosity function. thenegative evolution signal is &gt;3 sigma regardless of the adopted localluminosity function or cosmological framework. our results and those fromseveral other surveys independently confirm the presence of evolution. whereasthe bulk of the cluster population does not evolve, the most luminous andpresumably most massive structures evolve appreciably between z=0.8 and thepresent. interpreted in the context of hierarchical structure formation, we areprobing sufficiently large mass aggregations at sufficiently early times incosmological history where the universe has yet to assemble these clusters topresent-day volume densities.

astro-ph;0402348	a systematic study of radio-induced x-ray cavities in clusters, groups,  and galaxies	we present an analysis of sixteen galaxy clusters, one group and one galaxydrawn from the chandra x-ray observatory's data archive. these systems possessprominent x-ray surface brightness depressions associated with cavities orbubbles that were created by interactions between powerful radio sources andthe surrounding hot gas. the minimum energy associated with the cavities rangesbetween pv~10^55 erg in galaxies, groups, and poor clusters to pv~10^60 erg inrich clusters. we evaluate the hypothesis that cooling in the hot gas can bequenched by energy injected into the surrounding gas by the rising bubbles.nearly half of the systems in this study may have instantaneous mechanicalluminosities large enough to balance cooling, at least for a short period oftime, if the cavities are filled with a relativistic gas. we find a trend orupper envelope in the distribution of central x-ray luminosity versusinstantaneous mechanical luminosity with the sense that the most powerfulcavities are found in the most x-ray luminous systems. such a trend would beexpected if many of these systems produce bubbles at a rate that scales inproportion to the cooling rate of the surrounding gas. finally, we use thex-ray cavities to measure the mechanical power of radio sources over sixdecades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio properties themselves.we find that the ratio of the instantaneous mechanical (kinetic) luminosity tothe 1.4 ghz synchrotron luminosity ranges from a few to roughly a thousand.this wide range implies that the 1.4 ghz synchrotron luminosity is anunreliable gauge of the mechanical power of radio sources.

astro-ph;0408315	the cluster-scale agn outburst in hydra a	deep chandra observations of the hydra a cluster reveal a feature in thex-ray surface brightness that surrounds the 330 mhz radio lobes of the agn atthe cluster center. surface brightness profiles of this feature and its closeassociation with the radio lobes argue strongly that it is a shock front drivenby the expanding radio lobes. the chandra image also reveals other newstructure on smaller scales that is associated with the radio source, includinga large cavity and filament. the shock front extends 200 - 300 kpc from the agnat the cluster center and its strength varies along the front, with machnumbers in the range ~ 1.2 - 1.4. it is stronger where it is more distant fromthe cluster center, as expected for a shock driven by expanding radio lobes.simple modeling gives an age for the shock front ~ 1.4\times10^8 y and a totalenergy driving it of ~ 10^{61} erg. the mean mechanical power driving the shockis comparable to quasar luminosities, well in excess of that needed to regulatethe cooling core in hydra a. this suggests that the feedback regulating coolingcores is inefficient, in that the bulk of the energy is deposited beyond thecooling core. in that case, a significant part of cluster "preheating" is abyproduct of the regulation of cooling cores.

astro-ph;0411553	heating a distant galaxy cluster by giant x-ray cavities and large-scale  shock fronts	we report the discovery of a pair of giant cavities, each nearly 200 kpc indiameter, embedded in the gaseous halo of the redshift z=0.216 galaxy clusterms0735.6+7421. the cavities appear as surface brightness depressions in animage of the cluster taken with the chandra x-ray observatory. the x-raycavities are filled with radio emission and are bounded by an elliptical shockstructure resembling a ``radio cocoon.'' the shock's energy and age, ~6e61 ergand ~100 myr, respectively, give a time averaged power of ~1.7e46 erg/s, makingit the most powerful radio outburst known. the outburst is apparently heatingthe cluster by 1/3 kev per particle, which is sufficient to quench a largecooling flow for several gyr and to supply a substantial fraction of the energyrequired to "preheat" the cluster. if the outburst was powered by accretiononto a supermassive black hole, more than 3e8 solar masses of material would berequired to do so. this implies that the putative supermassive black hole lyingat the center of the cd galaxy has accreted a substantial fraction of its ownmass in less than 100 myr.

astro-ph;0504350	the powerful outburst in hercules a	the radio source hercules a resides at the center of a cooling flow clusterof galaxies at redshift z = 0.154. a chandra x-ray image reveals a shock frontin the intracluster medium (icm) surrounding the radio source, about 160 kpcfrom the active galactic nucleus (agn) that hosts it. the shock has a machnumber of 1.65, making it the strongest of the cluster-scale shocks driven byan agn outburst found so far. the age of the outburst ~5.9e7 y, its energyabout 3e61 erg and its mean power ~1.6e46 erg/s. as for the other large agnoutbursts in cooling flow clusters, this outburst overwhelms radiative lossesfrom the icm of the hercules a cluster by a factor of ~100. it adds to the casethat agn outbursts are a significant source of preheating for the icm. unlessthe mechanical efficiency of the agn in hercules a exceeds 10%, the centralblack hole must have grown by more than 1.7e8 msun to power this one outburst.

astro-ph;0604044	the starburst in the abell 1835 cluster central galaxy: a case study of  galaxy formation regulated by an outburst from a supermassive black hole	we present an optical, x-ray, and radio analysis of the starburst in theabell 1835 cluster's central cd galaxy. the dense gas surrounding the galaxy isradiating x-rays with a luminosity of ~1e45 erg/s consistent with a coolingrate of ~1000-2000 solar masses per year. however, chandra and xmm-newtonobservations find less than 200 solar masses per year of gas cooling below ~2kev, a level that is consistent with the cd's current star formation rate of100-180 solar masses per year. one or more heating agents (feedback) must thenbe replenishing the remaining radiative losses. the heat fluxes from supernovaexplosions and thermal conduction alone are unable to do so. however, a pair ofx-ray cavities from an agn outburst has deposited ~1.7e60 erg into thesurrounding gas over the past 40 myr. the corresponding jet power 1.4e45erg/sec is enough to offset most of the radiative losses from the cooling gas.the jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron power by ~4000 times, making thisone of the most radiatively inefficient radio sources known. the large jetpower implies that the cd's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate of  ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 myr or so, which is a smallfraction of the eddington accretion rate for a 10e9 solar mass black hole. theratio of the bulge growth rate through star formation and the black hole growthrate through accretion is consistent with the slope of the (magorrian)relationship between bulge and central black hole mass in nearby quiescentgalaxies. the consistency between net cooling, heating (feedback), and thecooling sink (star formation) in this system resolves the primary objection totraditional cooling flow models.

astro-ph;0605323	the feedback-regulated growth of black holes and bulges through gas  accretion and starbursts in cluster central dominant galaxies	we present an analysis of the growth of black holes through accretion andbulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at the centers of cooling flows.most of these systems show evidence of cavities in the intracluster medium(icm) inflated by radio jets emanating from their active galactic nuclei (agn).we present a new and extensive analysis of x-ray cavities in these systems. wefind that agn are energetically able to balance radiative losses (cooling) fromthe icm in more than half of our sample. using a subsample of 17 systems, weexamine the relationship between cooling and star formation. we find that thestar formation rates are approaching or are comparable to x-ray and far uvlimits on the rates of gas condensation onto the central galaxy. the remainingradiative losses could be offset by agn feedback. the vast gulf betweenradiative losses and the sink of cooling material, which has been the primaryobjection to cooling flows, has narrowed and, in some cases, is no longer aserious issue. using the cavity (jet) powers, we place strong lower limits onthe rate of growth of supermassive black holes in central galaxies, and we findthat they are growing at an average rate of ~ 0.1 solar masses per year, withsome systems growing as quickly as ~ 1 solar mass per year. we find a trendbetween bulge growth (star formation) and black hole growth that isapproximately in accordance with the slope of the local (magorrian) relationbetween black hole and bulge mass. however, the large scatter in the trendsuggests that bulges and black holes do not always grow in lock step.(abridged)

astro-ph;0612100	x-ray supercavities in the hydra a cluster and the outburst history of  the central galaxy's active nucleus	a 227 ksec chandra observatory x-ray image of the hot plasma in the hydra acluster has revealed an extensive cavity system. the system was created by acontinuous outflow or a series of bursts from the nucleus of the central galaxyover the past 200-500 myr. the cavities have displaced 10% of the plasma withina 300 kpc radius of the central galaxy, creating a swiss-cheese-like topologyin the hot gas. the surface brightness decrements are consistent with emptycavities oriented within 40 degrees of the plane of the sky. the outflow hasdeposited upward of 10^61 erg into the cluster gas, most of which was propelledbeyond the inner ~100 kpc cooling region. the supermassive black hole hasaccreted at a rate of approximately 0.1-0.25 solar masses per year over thistime frame, which is a small fraction of the eddington rate of a ~10^9 solarmass black hole, but is dramatically larger than the bondi rate. given theprevious evidence for a circumnuclear disk of cold gas in hydra a, theseresults are consistent with the agn being powered primarily by infalling coldgas. the cavity system is shadowed perfectly by 330 mhz radio emission. suchlow frequency synchrotron emission may be an excellent proxy for x-ray cavitiesand thus the total energy liberated by the supermassive black hole.

astro-ph;0612258	the growth of black holes and bulges at the cores of cooling flows	central cluster galaxies (cds) in cooling flows are growing rapidly throughgas accretion and star formation. at the same time, agn outbursts fueled byaccretion onto supermassive black holes are generating x-ray cavity systems anddriving outflows that exceed those in powerful quasars. we show that theresulting bulge and black hole growth follows a trend that is roughlyconsistent with the slope of the local (magorrian) relation between bulge andblack hole mass for nearby quiescent ellipticals. however, a large scattersuggests that cd bulges and black holes do not always grow in lock-step. newmeasurements made with xmm, chandra, and fuse of the condensation rates incooling flows are now approaching or are comparable to the star formationrates, alleviating the need for an invisible sink of cold matter. we show thatthe remaining radiation losses can be offset by agn outbursts in more than halfof the systems in our sample, indicating that the level of cooling and starformation is regulated by agn feedback.

0811.3020	an energetic agn outburst powered by a rapidly spinning supermassive  black hole or an accreting ultramassive black hole	powering the 10^62 erg nuclear outburst in the ms0735.6+7421 cluster centralgalaxy by accretion implies that its supermassive black hole (smbh) grew by~6x10^8 solar masses over the past 100 myr. we place upper limits on the amountof cold gas and star formation near the nucleus of &lt;10^9 solar masses and &lt;2solar masses per year, respectively. these limits imply that an implausiblylarge fraction of the preexisting cold gas in the bulge must have been consumedby its smbh at the rate of ~3-5 solar masses per year while leaving no trace ofstar formation. such a high accretion rate would be difficult to maintain bystellar accretion or the bondi mechanism, unless the black hole mass approaches10^11 solar masses. its feeble nuclear luminosities in the uv, i, and x-raybands compared to its enormous mechanical power are inconsistent with rapidaccretion onto a ~5x10^9 solar mass black hole. we suggest instead that the agnoutburst is powered by a rapidly-spinning black hole. a maximally-spinning,10^9 solar mass black hole contains enough rotational energy, ~10^62 erg, toquench a cooling flow over its lifetime and to contribute significantly to theexcess entropy found in the hot atmospheres of groups and clusters. two modesof agn feedback may be quenching star formation in elliptical galaxies centeredin cooling halos at late times. an accretion mode that operates in gas-richsystems, and a spin mode operating at modest accretion rates. the spinconjecture may be avoided in ms0735 by appealing to bondi accretion onto acentral black hole whose mass greatly exceeds 10^10 solar mass. the hostgalaxy's unusually large, 3.8 kpc stellar core radius (light deficit) maywitness the presence of an ultramassive black hole.
