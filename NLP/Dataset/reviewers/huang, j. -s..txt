0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0908.2307	spectral energy distributions of type 2 qsos: obscured star formation at  high redshifts	we present new mid-infrared and submillimetre observations for a sample ofeight high redshift type-2 qsos located in the chandra deep field south. thesources are x-ray absorbed with luminosities in excess of 10^44 erg/s. two ofthe targets have robust detections, s/n &gt; 4, while a further three targets aremarginally detected with s/n &gt; =2.5. all sources are detected in multiplemid-infrared bands with the spitzer space telescope. the multiwavelengthspectral energy distributions (seds) of the type-2 qsos are compared to thoseof two local ultraluminous galaxies (arp220 and ir22491) in order to assesscontributions from a star-forming component in various parts of the sed. wesuggest that their submillimetre emission is possibly due to a starburst whilea large fraction of the mid-infrared energy is likely to originate in theobscured central quasar. using the mid-infrared and submm observations wederive infrared luminosities which are found to be in excess of l&gt;10^12lsun.the submillimetre (850micron) to x-ray (2 kev) spectral indices (alpha_sx) spana wide range. about half of the type-2 qsos have values typical for acompton-thick agn with only 1 per cent of the nuclear emission seen throughscattering and, the remaining with values typical of submm-bright galaxies.combining the available observational evidence we outline a possible scenariofor the early stages of evolution of these sources.

0909.3299	the aztec/sma interferometric imaging survey of submillimeter-selected  high-redshift galaxies	we present results from a continuing interferometric survey of high-redshiftsubmillimeter galaxies with the submillimeter array, including high-resolution(beam size ~2 arcsec) imaging of eight additional aztec 1.1mm selected sourcesin the cosmos field, for which we obtain six reliable (peak s/n&gt;5 or peak s/n&gt;4with multiwavelength counterparts within the beam) and two moderatesignificance (peak s/n&gt;4) detections. when combined with previous detections,this yields an unbiased sample of millimeter-selected smgs with completeinterferometric followup. with this sample in hand, we (1) empirically confirmthe radio-submillimeter association, (2) examine the submillimeter morphology -including the nature of submillimeter galaxies with multiple radio counterpartsand constraints on the physical scale of the far infrared - of the sample, and(3) find additional evidence for a population of extremely luminous, radio-dimsubmillimeter galaxies that peaks at higher redshift than previous,radio-selected samples. in particular, the presence of such a population ofhigh-redshift sources has important consequences for models of galaxy formation- which struggle to account for such objects even under liberal assumptions -and dust production models given the limited time since the big bang.

0909.5367	on the nature of the first galaxies selected at 350 microns	[abridged] we present constraints on the nature of the first galaxiesselected at 350 microns. the sample includes galaxies discovered in the deepestblank-field survey at 350 microns (in the bootes deep field) and also laterserendipitous detections in the lockman hole. spectral energy distributiontemplates are fit to identified counterparts, and the sample is found tocomprise ir-luminous galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 predominantly powered by star formation.the first spectrum of a 350-micron-selected galaxy provides an additionalconfirmation, showing prominent dust grain features typically associated withstar-forming galaxies.  compared to submillimeter galaxies selected at 850 and 1100 microns, galaxiesselected at 350 microns have a similar range of far-infrared colortemperatures. however, no 350-micron-selected sources are reliably detected at850 or 1100 microns. galaxies in our sample with redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;2 show a tightcorrelation between the far- and mid-infrared flux densities, but galaxies athigher redshifts show a large dispersion in their mid- to far-infrared colors.  the 350-micron flux densities (15&lt;s(350)&lt;40 mjy) place these objects near theherschel/spire 350-micron confusion threshold, with the lower limit on the starformation rate density suggesting the bulk of the 350-micron contribution willcome from less luminous infrared sources and normal galaxies.

0910.1141	the evolution of the hard x-ray luminosity function of agn	we present new observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10kevx-ray luminosity function (xlf) of agn. we utilise data from a number ofsurveys including both the 2ms chandra deep fields and the aegis-x 200kssurvey, enabling accurate measurements of the evolution of the faint end of thexlf. we combine direct, hard x-ray selection and spectroscopic follow-up orphotometric redshift estimates at z&lt;1.2 with a rest-frame uv colourpre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated withcatastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. only robust opticalcounterparts to x-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matchingtechnique. a bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshiftprobability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our highredshift samples, and allows robust comparison of different evolutionarymodels. we find that the xlf retains the same shape at all redshifts, butundergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z~1, and an overall negativedensity evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolutionat earlier times. we do not find evidence that a luminosity-dependent densityevolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required todescribe the evolution of the xlf. we find significantly higher space densitiesof low-luminosity, high-redshift agn than in prior studies, and a smaller shiftin the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasingluminosity. the total luminosity density of agn peaks at z=1.2+/-0.1, but thereis a mild decline to higher redshifts. we find &gt;50% of black hole growth takesplace at z&gt;1, with around half in lx&lt;10^44 erg/s agn.

1003.4264	the physical scale of the far-infrared emission in the most luminous  submillimetre galaxies ii: evidence for merger-driven star formation	we present high-resolution 345 ghz interferometric observations of twoextreme luminous (l_{ir}&gt;10^{13} l_sun), submillimetre-selected galaxies (smgs)in the cosmos field with the submillimeter array (sma). both targets werepreviously detected as unresolved point-sources by the sma in its compactconfiguration, also at 345 ghz. these new data, which provide a factor of ~3improvement in resolution, allow us to measure the physical scale of thefar-infrared in the submillimetre directly. the visibility functions of bothtargets show significant evidence for structure on 0.5-1 arcsec scales, whichat z=1.5 translates into a physical scale of 5-8 kpc. our results areconsistent with the angular and physical scales of two comparably luminousobjects with high-resolution sma followup, as well as radio continuum and cosizes. these relatively compact sizes (&lt;5-10 kpc) argue strongly formerger-driven starbursts, rather than extended gas-rich disks, as the preferredchannel for forming smgs. for the most luminous objects, the derived sizes mayalso have important physical consequences; under a series of simplifyingassumptions, we find that these two objects in particular are forming starsclose to or at the eddington limit for a starburst.

1007.1459	extragalactic background light inferred from aegis galaxy sed-type  fractions	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is of fundamental importance bothfor understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for gamma-rayastronomy, but the overall spectrum of the ebl between 0.1-1000 microns hasnever been determined directly from galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed)observations over a wide redshift range. the evolving, overall spectrum of theebl is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. thisis achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame k-band galaxyluminosity function up to redshift 4 (cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with adetermination of galaxy sed-type fractions. these are based on fitting swiretemplates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshiftrange from 0.2 to 1 from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). the changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forminggalaxies, starburst galaxies and agn galaxies in that redshift range areestimated, and two alternative extrapolations of sed-types to higher redshiftsare considered. this allows calculation of the evolution of the luminositydensities from the uv to the ir, the evolving star formation rate density ofthe universe, the evolving contribution to the bolometric ebl from thedifferent galaxy populations including agn galaxies and the buildup of the ebl.our ebl calculations are compared with those from a semi-analytic model, fromanother observationally-based model and observational data. the ebluncertainties in our modeling based directly on the data are quantified, andtheir consequences for attenuation of very high energy gamma-rays due to pairproduction on the ebl are discussed. it is concluded that the ebl is wellconstrained from the uv to the mid-ir, but independent efforts from infraredand gamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in thefar-ir.

1108.4037	ultra steep spectrum radio sources in the lockman hole: servs  identifications and redshift distribution at the faintest radio fluxes	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources have been successfully used toselect powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z&gt;~2). typically restricted tolarge-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has graduallybecome possible to extend the uss search to sub-mjy levels, thanks to therecent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. here a firstdetailed analysis of the nature of the faintest uss sources is presented. byusing giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array radio observationsof the lockman hole at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz, a sample of 58 uss sources, with610 mhz integrated fluxes above 100 microjy, is assembled. deep infrared dataat 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the spitzer extragalactic representative volumesurvey (servs) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of thesesources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](ab)=19.8 mag.spectroscopic redshifts for 14 uss sources, together with photometric redshiftestimates, improved by the use of the deep servs data, for a further 19objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 andtailing off at high redshifts. the remaining 25 uss sources, with no redshiftestimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]&gt;22-23 mag, from local measurements), whichsuggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mjy usspopulation. the comparison with the square kilometre array design studiessimulated skies models indicate that fanaroff-riley type i radio sources andradio-quiet active galactic nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest usspopulation, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the usstechnique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at thesub-mjy level.

0704.3609	the local galaxy 8 micron luminosity function	a sst survey in the noao deep-wide field in bo\"otes provides a complete,8-micron-selected sample of galaxies to a limiting (vega) magnitude of 13.5. inthe 6.88 deg$^2$ field sampled, 79% of the 4867 galaxies have spectroscopicredshifts, allowing an accurate determination of the local (z&lt;0.3) galaxyluminosity function. stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis ofobserved galaxy colors. dust emission (mostly pah) accounts for 80% of the 8micron luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19%, and agn emissionaccounts for roughly 1 %. a sub-sample of the 8 micron-selected galaxies haveblue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant pah emission.the luminosity functions for the total 8 micron luminosity and for the dustemission alone are both well fit by schechter functions. for the 8 micronluminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is \nu l_{\nu}^*(8.0\micron) = 1.8 \times 10^{10}$ \lsun while for the dust emission alone it is1.6 x 10^{10}$ \lsun\null. the average 8 \micron luminosity density at z&lt;0.3 is3.1 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}, and the average luminosity density from dust aloneis 2.5 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}. this luminos ity arises predominantly fromgalaxies with 8 \micron luminosities ($\nu l_{\nu}$) between $2\times 10^9$ and$2 x 10^{10}$ \lsun, i.e., normal galaxies, not lirgs or ulirgs.

1210.4173	the dependence of quenching upon the inner structure of galaxies at  0.5&lt;z&lt; 0.8 in the deep2/aegis survey	the shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'.although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exactmechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.this paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenchingprocesses through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surfacestellar mass density and sersic index (n). we analyze the rest-frame u-b colorcorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies inthe redshift range 0.5&lt; z&lt;0.8 from the deep2/aegis survey. we find that sersicindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters andresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. there exists,however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. we hypothesize that their sersicvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, agns, and/or poor fits,leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternativeto sersic index. not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tightrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies ismost physically linked with quenching. furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority ofthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since theirgim2d bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses ofsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass mustabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. we discuss atwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates arecontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and asecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellarmass build-up.

1310.2020	the formation of the massive galaxies in the ssa22 z=3.1 protocluster	the properties of k-band selected galaxies (k_ab&lt;24) in the z = 3.09 ssa22protocluster field are studied. 430 galaxies at 2.6 &lt; z_phot &lt; 3.6 are selectedas potential protocluster members in a 112 arcmin^2 area based on theirphotometric redshifts. we find that \approx 20% of the massive galaxies withstellar masses &gt;10^11 m_sun at z_phot \sim 3.1 have colors consistent withthose of quiescent galaxies with ages &gt; 0.5 gyr. this fraction increases to\approx 50% after correcting for unrelated foreground/background objects. wealso find that 30% of the massive galaxies are heavily reddened dustystar-forming galaxies. few such quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts areseen in typical survey fields. an excess surface density of 24\mu m sources atz_phot \sim 3.1 is also observed, implying the presence of dusty star-formationactivity in the protocluster. cross-correlation with the x-ray data indicatesthat the fraction of k-band selected protocluster galaxies hosting activegalactic nuclei (agn) is also high compared with the field. the skydistribution of the quiescent galaxies, the 24\mu m sources, and the x-ray agnsshow clustering around a density peak of z=3.1 ly\alpha emitters (laes). asignificant fraction of the massive galaxies have already become quiescent,while the dusty star-formation is still active in the ssa22 protocluster. thesefindings indicate that we are witnessing the formation epoch of massiveearly-type galaxies at the center of predecessors to present-day rich galaxyclusters.

1310.6031	a rapidly star-forming galaxy 700 million years after the big bang at  z=7.51	out of several dozen z &gt; 7 candidate galaxies observed spectroscopically,only five have been confirmed via lyman-alpha emission, at z=7.008, 7.045,7.109, 7.213 and 7.215. the small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicatethat the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium (igm) rises quickly at z&gt; 6.5, as lyman-alpha is resonantly scattered by neutral gas. however, thesmall samples and limited depth of previous observations makes theseconclusions tentative. here we report the results of a deep near-infraredspectroscopic survey of 43 z &gt; 6.5 galaxies. we detect only a single galaxy,confirming that some process is making lyman-alpha difficult to detect. thedetected emission line at 1.0343 um is likely to be lyman-alpha emission,placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years afterthe big bang. this galaxy's colors are consistent with significant metalcontent, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. we measure asurprisingly high star formation rate of 330 msol/yr, more than a factor of 100greater than seen in the milky way. such a galaxy is unexpected in a survey ofour size, suggesting that the early universe may harbor more intense sites ofstar-formation than expected.

1401.6079	hermes: spectral energy distributions of submillimeter galaxies at z &gt;4	we present a study of the infrared properties for a sample of sevenspectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies at $z&gt;$4.0. by combiningground-based near-infrared, spitzer irac and mips, herschel spire, andground-based submillimeter/millimeter photometry, we construct their spectralenergy distributions (sed) and a composite model to fit the seds. the modelincludes a stellar emission component at $\lambda_{\rm rest} &lt;$ 3.5$ \mu$m; ahot dust component peaking at $\lambda_{rest} \sim$ 5$\,\mu$m; and cold dustcomponent which becomes significant for $\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt;$ 50$\,\mu$m. sixobjects in the sample are detected at 250 and 350$ \mu$m. the dust temperaturesfor the sources in this sample are in the range of 40$-$80 k, and their $l_{\rmfir}$ $\sim$ 10$^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$ qualifies them as hyper$-$luminous infraredgalaxies (hyperlirgs). the mean fir-radio index for this sample is around $&lt; q&gt; = 2.2$ indicating no radio excess in their radio emission. most sources inthe sample have 24$ \mu$m detections corresponding to a rest-frame 4.5$ \mu$mluminosity of log$_{10}$(l$_{4.5}$ / l$_{\odot}$) = 11 $\sim$ 11.5. theirl$_{\rm 4.5}$/$l_{\rm fir}$ ratios are very similar to those of starburstdominated submillimeter galaxies at $z \sim$ 2. the $l_{\rm co}-l_{\rm fir}$relation for this sample is consistent with that determined for local ulirgsand smgs at $z \sim$ 2. we conclude that submillimeter galaxies at $z &gt;$ 4 arehotter and more luminous in the fir, but otherwise very similar to those at $z\sim$ 2. none of these sources show any sign of the strong qso phase beingtriggered.

1402.3599	the properties of h{\alpha} emission-line galaxies at z = 2.24	using deep narrow-band $h_2s1$ and $k_{s}$-band imaging data obtained withcfht/wircam, we identify a sample of 56 h$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies (elgs)at $z=2.24$ with the 5$\sigma$ depths of $h_2s1=22.8$ and $k_{s}=24.8$ (ab)over 383 arcmin$^{2}$ area in the ecdfs. a detailed analysis is carried outwith existing multi-wavelength data in this field. three of the 56 h$\alpha$elgs are detected in chandra 4 ms x-ray observation and two of them areclassified as agns. the rest-frame uv and optical morphologies revealed byhst/acs and wfc3 deep images show that nearly half of the h$\alpha$ elgs areeither merging systems or with a close companion, indicating that themerging/interacting processes play a key role in regulating star formation atcosmic epoch z=2-3; about 14% are too faint to be resolved in the rest-frame uvmorphology due to high dust extinction. we estimate dust extinction from seds.we find that dust extinction is generally correlated with h$\alpha$ luminosityand stellar mass (sm). our results suggest that h$\alpha$ elgs arerepresentative of star-forming galaxies (sfgs). applying extinction correctionfor individual objects, we examine the intrinsic h$\alpha$ luminosity function(lf) at $z=2.24$, obtaining a best-fit schechter function characterized by afaint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.3$. this is shallower than the typical slope of$\alpha \sim -1.6$ in previous works based on constant extinction correction.we demonstrate that this difference is mainly due to the different extinctioncorrections. the proper extinction correction is thus key to recovering theintrinsic lf as the extinction globally increases with h$\alpha$ luminosity.moreover, we find that our h$\alpha$ lf mirrors the sm function of sfgs at thesame cosmic epoch. this finding indeed reflects the tight correlation betweensfr and sm for the sfgs, i.e., the so-called main sequence.

1412.0663	high-precision photometric redshifts from spitzer/irac: extreme  [3.6]-[4.5] colors identify galaxies in the redshift range z~6.6-6.9	one of the most challenging aspects of studying galaxies in the z&gt;~7 universeis the infrequent confirmation of their redshifts through spectroscopy, aphenomenon thought to occur from the increasing opacity of the intergalacticmedium to lya photons at z&gt;6.5. the resulting redshift uncertainties inhibitthe efficient search for [c ii] in z~7 galaxies with sub-mm instruments such asalma, given their limited scan speed for faint lines. one means by which toimprove the precision of the inferred redshifts is to exploit the potentialimpact of strong nebular emission lines on the colors of z~4-8 galaxies asobserved by spitzer/irac. at z~6.8, galaxies exhibit irac colors as blue as[3.6]-[4.5] ~-1, likely due to the contribution of [o iii]+hb to the 3.6 mumflux combined with the absence of line contamination in the 4.5 mum band. inthis paper we explore the use of extremely blue [3.6]-[4.5] colors to identifygalaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-6.9. when combined with ani-dropout criterion, we demonstrate that we can plausibly select a relativelyclean sample of z~6.8 galaxies. through a systematic application of thisselection technique to our catalogs from all five candels fields, we identify20 probable z~6.6-6.9 galaxies. we estimate that our criteria select the ~50%strongest line emitters at z~6.8 and from the irac colors we estimate a typical[o iii]+hb rest-frame equivalent width of 1085a for this sample. the smallredshift uncertainties on our sample make it particularly well suited forfollow-up studies with facilities such as alma.

0805.1148	comparisons between isothermal and nfw mass profiles for strong-lensing  galaxy clusters	while both isothermal and nfw-based mass models for galaxy clusters arewidely adopted in strong-lensing studies, they cannot easily be distinguishedbased solely on observed positions of arcs and arclets. we compare themagnifications predicted for giant arcs obtained from isothermal and nfwprofiles, taking axially-symmetric and asymmetric mass distributions intoaccount. we find that arc magnifications can differ strongly between the twotypes of density profiles even if the image morphology is well reproduced.magnifications by lenses with nfw density profiles are usually larger thanthose for lenses with singular or nearly singular isothermal density profiles,unless the latter have large cores. asymmetries play an important role. weillustrate our results with the two well-studied clusters ms 2137 and a~370. weconfirm earlier results showing that both isothermal and nfw mass models canvery well reproduce the observed arcs, radial arcs and other arclets. while themass model for ms 2137 is not very well constrained, the two types of massmodels produce strongly differing critical curves and caustics for a~370. wefind that the nfw mass profile is preferred for a~370. we identify new arcletcandidates in the field of a~370. redshift estimates allowed by the lens modelare consistent with results in the literature, where available. three newlyfound counter-images are suggested to arise from an active, dust-enshroudedstar-forming galaxy at $z\approx1.1$.

1506.01323	s-candels: the spitzer-cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic  survey. survey design, photometry, and deep irac source counts	the spitzer-cosmic assembly deep near-infrared extragalactic legacy survey(s-candels; pi g. fazio) is a cycle 8 exploration program designed to detectgalaxies at very high redshifts (z &gt; 5). to mitigate the effects of cosmicvariance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiplebands by the hubble space telescope multi-cycle treasury program candels,s-candels was carried out within five widely separated extragalactic fields:the ukidss ultra-deep survey, the extended chandra deep field south, cosmos,the hst deep field north, and the extended groth strip. s-candels builds uponthe existing coverage of these fields from the spitzer extended deep survey(seds) by increasing the integration time from 12 hours to a total of 50 hoursbut within a smaller area, 0.16 square degrees. the additional depthsignificantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. this paperdescribes the s-candels survey design, processing, and publicly-available dataproducts. we present irac dual-band 3.6+4.5 micron catalogs reaching to a depthof 26.5 ab mag. deep irac counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected bys-candels are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. theincrease in depth beyond earlier spitzer/irac surveys does not reveal asignificant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse cosmicinfrared background (cib). thus it remains true that only roughly half of theestimated cib flux from cobe/dirbe is resolved.

0806.2158	spitzer irac infrared colours of submillimetre-bright galaxies	high-redshift submillimetre-bright galaxies identified by blank field surveysat millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths appear in the region of the iraccolour-colour diagrams previously identified as the domain of luminous activegalactic nuclei (agns). our analysis using a set of empirical and theoreticaldusty starburst spectral energy distribution (sed) models shows that power-lawcontinuum sources associated with hot dust heated by young (&lt;100 myr old),extreme starbursts at z&gt;2 also occupy the same general area as agns in the iraccolour-colour plots. a detailed comparison of the irac colours and sedsdemonstrates that the two populations are distinct from each other, withsubmillimetre-bright galaxies having a systematically flatter irac spectrum (&gt;1mag bluer in the observed [4.5]-[8.0] colour). only about 20% of the objectsoverlap in the colour-colour plots, and this low fraction suggests thatsubmillimetre galaxies powered by a dust-obscured agn are not common. the redir colours of the submillimetre galaxies are distinct from those of theubiquitous foreground irac sources, and we propose a set of ir colour selectioncriteria for identifying smg counterparts that can be used even in the absenceof radio or spitzer mips 24 micron data.

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0406276	the off-nuclear starbursts in ngc 4038/4039 (the antennae galaxies)	imaging of the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/4039) with the infrared arraycamera (irac) aboard the spitzer space telescope reveals large concentrationsof star forming activity away from both nuclei of the two merging galaxies.these images confirm earlier findings based on iso data with lower angularresolution. the short wavelength emission shows numerous compact sourcesidentified as stellar clusters. at the longer wavelengths, bright, moreamorphous and filamentary features correlate well with the known distributionsof denser gas, warm dust, and hii regions. there are also fainter, more diffusecomponents at all wavelengths that permeate the entire region and extend intothe two tidal tails. non-stellar dust emission dominates the 5.8 and 8.0 micronimages, accounting for as much as 79% of the light at 5.8 micron and 95% at 8micron, averaged over the entire galaxy. assuming that the non-stellar emissiontraces star formation, the irac data provide a view into the total underlyingstar forming activities unaffected by obscuration. using the flux ratio ofnon-stellar to stellar emission as a guide, we map the local star formationrate in the antennae and compare that to similar measurements in both normaland infrared-luminous galaxies. this rate in the active regions is found to beas high as those seen in starburst and some ultra-luminous infrared galaxies on``per unit mass'' basis. the two galactic centers actually have lower starforming rates than the off-nuclear regions despite the presence of abundantdense gas and dust, suggesting that the latter is a necessary but notsufficient condition for on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0507685	infrared luminous lyman break galaxies: a population that bridges lbgs  and scuba galaxies	a deep mid- and far-infrared survey in the extended groth strip (egs) areagives 3.6 to 8\micron flux densities or upper limits for 253 lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). the lbgs are a diverse population but with propertiescorrelated with luminosity. the lbgs show a factor of 30 range in indicatedstellar mass and a factor of 10 in apparent dust content relative to stellarmass. about 5% of lbgs are luminous at all wavelengths with powerful emissionat rest 6\micron. in the rest 0.9 to 2\micron spectral range these galaxieshave stellar spectral slopes with no sign of an agn power law component,suggesting that their emission is mainly powered by intensive star formation.galaxies in this luminous population share the infrared properties of coldscuba sources: both are massive and dusty starburst galaxies at $2&lt;z&lt;3$; theirstellar mass is larger than $10^{11} m_{\odot}$. we suggest that these galaxiesare the progenitors of present-day giant elliptical galaxies, with asubstantial fraction of their stars already formed at $z \approx 3$.

astro-ph;0509566	the diverse infrared properties of a complete sample of star-forming  dwarf galaxies	we present mid-infrared spitzer space telescope observations of a completesample of star-forming dwarf galaxies selected from the kpno internationalspectroscopic survey. the galaxies span a wide range in mid-infraredproperties. contrary to expectations, some of the galaxies emit strongly at 8micron indicating the presence of hot dust and/or pahs. the ratio of thismid-infrared dust emission to the stellar emission is compared with thegalaxies' luminosity, star-formation rate, metallicity, and optical reddening.we find that the strength of the 8.0 micron dust emission to the stellaremission ratio is more strongly correlated with the star-formation rate than itis with the metallicity or the optical reddening in these systems. nonetheless,there is a correlation between the 8.0 micron luminosity and metallicity. theslope of this luminosity-metallicity correlation is shallower thancorresponding ones in the b-band and 3.6 micron. the precise nature of the 8.0micron emission seen in these galaxies (i.e., pah versus hot dust or somecombination of the two) will require future study, including deep mid-irspectroscopy.

astro-ph;0511507	infrared power-law galaxies in the chandra deep field south: agn and  ulirgs	we investigate the nature of a sample of 92 spitzer/mips 24 micron selectedgalaxies in the cdfs, showing power law-like emission in the spitzer/irac 3.6-8micron bands. the main goal is to determine whether the galaxies not detectedin x-rays (47% of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population ofobscured agn not detected even in deep x-ray surveys. the majority of the irpower-law galaxies are ulirgs at z&gt;1, and those with lirg-like ir luminositiesare usually detected in x-rays. the optical to ir spectral energy distributions(seds) of the x-ray detected galaxies are almost equally divided between ablagn sed class (similar to an optically selected qso) and a nlagn sed (similarto the blagn sed but with an obscured uv/optical continuum). a small fractionof seds resemble warm ulirg galaxies (e.g., mrk231). most galaxies not detectedin x-rays have seds in the nlagn+ulirg class as they tend to be opticallyfainter, and possibly more obscured. moreover, the ir power-law galaxies haveseds significantly different from those of high-z (z_sp&gt;1) ir (24 micron)selected and optically bright (vvds i_ab&lt;=24) star-forming galaxies whose sedsshow a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron. the galaxies detected inx-rays have 2-8 kev rest-frame luminosities typical of agn. the galaxies notdetected in x-rays have global x-ray to mid-ir sed properties that make themgood candidates to contain ir bright x-ray absorbed agn. if all these sourcesare actually obscured agn, we would observe a ratio of obscured to unobscured24 micron detected agn of 2:1, whereas models predict a ratio of up to 3:1.additional studies using spitzer to detect x-ray-quiet agn are likely to findmore such obscured sources.

astro-ph;0512357	an investigation of the submillimeter background radiation using scuba  and spitzer	we investigate the redshift dependence of the contribution to theextragalactic far-infrared/sub-millimeter background from galaxies detected bythe spitzer space telescope at 8um and 24um. using seven-band optical tomid-infrared photometry, we estimate photometric redshifts for the spitzersources which appear to be mostly l* galaxies at a median redshift of z=1.0.these sources, extracted from deep 8um and 24um mosaics of the cudss 14-hourfield with 5sigma limits of 5.8ujy and 70ujy respectively, exhibit significant850um and 450um emission as observed by scuba. at 850um, after removing&gt;=4sigma sources and those securely identified in our previous cross-matchingpaper, we measure stacked flux at the significance level of 4.4sigma and2.9sigma from the full 8um and 24um galaxy catalogue respectively. at 450um,flux is detected from all 8um galaxies at the level of 3.5sigma, while there isno significant emission from the 24um galaxies. we find that the 850um flux isemitted almost exclusively at z&gt;~1.3 from the spitzer sources with 0.44mjy(4.7sigma) per 8um source and 0.51mjy (2.8sigma) per 24um source. thiscorresponds to a contribution of (16+/-3)% toward the 850um extra-galacticbackground from the 8um sources and (5.0+/-1.8)% from the 24um sources. at450um, only the 8um sources within the redshift interval 1&lt;z&lt;2 exhibitsignificant emission with an average flux per source of 3.35mjy (3.0sigma).this is a contribution of (37+/-12)% to the 450um background.

astro-ph;0512618	mid-infrared properties of x-ray sources in the extended groth strip	mid-infrared observations of active galactic nuclei (agn) are important forunderstanding of the physical conditions around the central accretion engines.chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations of a 300 arcmin^2 region in theextended groth strip are used to select a sample of~150 agn. the spitzerinstruments irac and mips detect 68-80% of these sources, which show a widerange of mid-infrared properties. about 40% of the sources have red power-lawspectral energy distributions (f_nu ~ nu^alpha, alpha&lt;0) in the 3.6-8 um iracbands. in these sources the central engine dominates the emission at both x-rayand ir wavelengths. another 40% of the sources have blue mid-ir spectral energydistributions (alpha&gt;0) with their infrared emission dominated by the hostgalaxy; the remaining 20% are not well-fit by a power law. published irac colorcriteria for agn select most of the red sources, but only some of the bluesources. as with all other known methods, selecting agn with mid-ir colors willnot produce a sample that is simultaneously complete and reliable. the irac sedtype does not directly correspond to x-ray spectral type (hard/soft). themid-ir properties of x-ray-detected lyman-break, radio, submillimeter, andoptically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part, are not distinctfrom those of the general x-ray/infrared source population. x-ray sources emit6-11% of the integrated mid--ir light, making them significant contributors tothe cosmic infrared background.

astro-ph;0603656	spitzer observations of the brightest galaxies in x-ray-luminous  clusters	we have studied the infrared properties of the brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) located in the cores of x-ray-luminous clusters at 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.35. themajority of the bcgs are not particularly infrared-luminous compared with othermassive early-type galaxies, suggesting that the cluster environment has littleinfluence on the infrared luminosities of the bcgs. the exceptions, however,are the bcgs in the three x-ray-brightest clusters in the sample, a1835, z3146,and a2390. these bcgs have a prominent far-infrared peak in their spectralenergy distributions (seds), and two of them (those in a1835 and z3146) can beclassified as luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs: l_{ir} &gt; 10^{11} l_{sun}).although radio agns are found to be prevalent among the bcgs, the infraredluminosities of these three bcgs, judged from the infrared sed signatures, arelikely to be powered by star formation. considering the overall trend thatclusters with shorter radiative gas cooling times harbor more infrared-luminousbcgs, the enhanced star formation may be caused by the cooling cluster gasaccreting onto the bcgs.

astro-ph;0605355	spitzer observations of z~3 lyman break galaxies: stellar masses and  mid-infrared properties	we describe the spectral energy distributions (seds) of lyman break galaxies(lbgs) at z~3 using deep mid-infrared and optical observations of the extendedgroth strip, obtained with irac and mips on board spitzer and from the ground,respectively. we focus on lbgs with detections at all four irac bands, inparticular the 26 galaxies with irac 8 micron band (rest--frame k-band)detections. we use stellar population synthesis models and probe the stellarcontent of these galaxies. based on best--fit continuous star-formation modelswe derive estimates of the stellar mass for these lbgs. as in previous studies,we find that a fraction of lbgs have very red colors and large estimatedstellar masses (m_stellar &gt; 5 x 10 ^{10} m_solar): the present spitzer dataallow us, for the first time, to study these massive lbgs in detail. we discussthe link between these lbgs and submm-luminous galaxies.we find that the numberdensity of these massive lbgs at high redshift is higher than predicted bycurrent semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0607271	aegis20: a radio survey of the extended groth strip	we describe aegis20 - a radio survey of the extended groth strip (egs)conducted with the very large array (vla) at 1.4ghz. the resulting catalogcontains 1,123 emitters and is sensitive to ultraluminous starbursts to z&lt;=1.3,well matched to the redshift range of the deep2 spectroscopic survey in thisregion. we use stacking techniques to explore the ujy-level emission from avariety of galaxy populations selected via conventional criteria - lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs), distant red galaxies (drgs), uv-selected galaxies andextremely red objects (eros) - determining their properties as a function ofcolor, magnitude and redshift and their extinction-free contributions to thehistory of star formation. we confirm the familiar pattern that thestar-formation-rate (sfr) density, sfrd, rises by at least ~5x from z=0-1,although we note highly discrepant uv- and radio-based sfr estimates. ourradio-based sfrs become more difficult to interpret at z&gt;1 where correcting forcontamination by radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) comes at the price ofrejecting luminous starbursts. whilst stacking radio images is a usefultechnique, accurate radio-based sfrs for z&gt;&gt;1 galaxies require preciseredshifts and extraordinarily high-fidelity radio data to identify and removeaccretion-related emission.

astro-ph;0607272	aegis: enhancement of dust-enshrouded star formation in close galaxy  pairs and merging galaxies up to z ~ 1	using data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and hst/acs imaging in theextended groth strip, we select nearly 100 interacting galaxy systems includingkinematic close pairs and morphologically identified merging galaxies. spitzermips 24 micron fluxes of these systems reflect the current dusty star formationactivity, and at a fixed stellar mass (m_{*}) the median infrared luminosity(l_{ir}) among merging galaxies and close pairs of blue galaxies is twice (1.9+/- 0.4) that of control pairs drawn from isolated blue galaxies. enhancementdeclines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs and mergers andweaker in wide pairs compared to the control sample. at z ~ 0.9, 7.1% +/- 4.3%of massive interacting galaxies (m_{*} &gt; 2*10^{10} m_{solar}) are found to beulirgs, compared to 2.6% +/- 0.7% in the control sample. the large spread of irluminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting galaxies suggests that thisenhancement may depend on the merger stage as well as other as yet unidentifiedfactors (e.g., galaxy structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics, presenceof agn or bar). the contribution of interacting systems to the total irluminosity density is moderate (&lt;= 36 %).

astro-ph;0609466	far-infrared characterization of an ultra-luminous starburst associated  with a massively-accreting black hole at z=1.15	as part of the "all wavelength extended groth strip international survey"(aegis), we describe the panchromatic characterization of an x-ray luminousactive galactic nucleus (agn) in a merging galaxy at z=1.15. this object isdetected at infrared (8mic, 24mic, 70mic, 160mic), submillimeter (850mic) andradio wavelengths, from which we derive a bolometric luminosity l_bol ~ 9x10^12lsol. we find that the agn clearly dominates the hot dust emission below 40micbut its total energetic power inferred from the hard x-rays is substantiallyless than the bolometric output of the system. about 50% of the infraredluminosity is indeed produced by a cold dust component that probably originatesfrom enshrouded star formation in the host galaxy. in the context of a coevalgrowth of stellar bulges and massive black holes, this source might represent a``transition'' object sharing properties with both quasars and luminousstarbursts. study of such composite galaxies will help address how the starformation and disk-accretion phenomena may have regulated each other at highredshift and how this coordination may have participated to the build-up of therelationship observed locally between the masses of black holes and stellarspheroids.

astro-ph;0609579	a scuba/spitzer investigation of the far infra-red extragalactic  background	we have measured the contribution of submillimeter and mid-infrared sourcesto the extragalactic background radiation at 70 and 160um. specifically, wehave stacked flux in 70 and 160um spitzer space telescope (spitzer)observations of the canada-uk deep sub-millimeter survey 14h field at thepositions of 850um sources detected by scuba and also 8 and 24um sourcesdetected by spitzer. we find that per source, the scuba galaxies are thestrongest and the 8um sources the weakest contributors to the background fluxat both 70 and 160um. our estimate of the contribution of the scuba sources ishigher than previous estimates. however, expressed as a total contribution, thefull 8um source catalogue accounts for twice the total 24um source contributionand ~10 times the total scuba source contribution. the 8um sources account forthe majority of the background radiation at 160um with a flux of 0.87+/-0.16mjy/sr and at least a third at 70um with a flux of 0.103+/-0.019 mjy/sr. thesemeasurements are consistent with current lower limits on the background at 70and 160um. finally, we have investigated the 70 and 160um emission from the 8and 24um sources as a function of redshift. we find that the average 70um fluxper 24um source and the average 160um flux per 8 and 24um source is constantover all redshifts, up to z~4. in contrast, the low-redshift half (z&lt;1) of theof 8um sample contributes approximately four times the total 70um flux of thehigh-redshift half. these trends can be explained by a single non-evolving sed.
