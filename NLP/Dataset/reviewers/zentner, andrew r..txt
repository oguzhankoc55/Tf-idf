0902.1983	cold dark matter substructure and galactic disks ii: dynamical effects  of hierarchical satellite accretion	(abridged) we perform dissipationless n-body simulations to elucidate thedynamical response of thin disks to bombardment by cold dark matter (cdm)substructure. our method combines (1) cosmological simulations of the formationof milky way (mw)-sized cdm halos to derive the properties of substructure and(2) controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts onto aninitially-thin, fully-formed mw type disk galaxy. the present study is thefirst to account for the evolution of satellite populations over cosmic time insuch an investigation of disk structure. we find that accretions of massivesubhalos onto the central regions of host halos, where the galactic disksreside, since z~1 should be common. one host halo accretion history is used toinitialize the controlled simulations of satellite-disk encounters. we showthat these accretion events severely perturb the thin galactic disk and producea wealth of distinctive dynamical signatures on its structure and kinematics.these include (1) considerable thickening and heating at all radii, with thedisk thickness and velocity ellipsoid nearly doubling at the solar radius; (2)prominent flaring associated with an increase in disk thickness greater than afactor of 4 in the disk outskirts; (3) surface density excesses at large radii,beyond ~5 disk scale lengths, resembling those of observed antitruncated disks;(4) lopsidedness at levels similar to those measured in observational samplesof disk galaxies; and (5) substantial tilting. the interaction with the mostmassive subhalo drives the disk response while subsequent bombardment is muchless efficient at disturbing the disk. we conclude that substructure-diskencounters of the kind expected in the lcdm paradigm play a significant role insetting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.

0904.3334	the influence of galaxy formation physics on weak lensing tests of  general relativity	forthcoming projects such as the des, a jdem, and lsst, aim to measure weaklensing shear correlations with unprecedented accuracy. weak lensingobservables are sensitive to both the distance-redshift relation and the growthof structure in the universe. if the cause of accelerated cosmic expansion isdark energy within general relativity (gr), both cosmic distances and structuregrowth are governed by the properties of dark energy. consequently, one may uselensing to check for this consistency and test gr. after reviewing thephenomenology of such tests, we address one major challenge to such a program.the evolution of the baryonic component of the universe is highly uncertain andcan influence lensing observables, manifesting as modified structure growth fora fixed cosmic distance scale. using two proposed methods, we show that onecould be led to reject the null hypothesis of gr when it is the true theory ifthis uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected. recent simulations suggestthat we can correct for baryonic effects using a parametrized model in whichthe halo mass-concentration relation is modified. the correction renders biasessmall compared to statistical uncertainties. we study the ability of futureweak lensing surveys to constrain the internal structures of halos and test thenull hypothesis of gr simultaneously. compared to nulling information fromsmall-scales to mitigate sensitivity to baryonic physics, this internalcalibration program should provide limits on deviations from gr that areseveral times more constraining. specifically, we find that limits on generalrelativity in the case of internal calibration are degraded by only ~30% orless compared to the case of perfect knowledge of nonlinear structure.

0905.4736	dark matter annihilation around intermediate mass black holes: an update	the formation and evolution of black holes inevitably affects thedistribution of dark and baryonic matter in the neighborhood of the black hole.these effects may be particularly relevant around supermassive and intermediatemass black holes (imbhs), the formation of which can lead to large dark matteroverdensities, called {\em spikes} and {\em mini-spikes} respectively. despitebeing larger and more dense, spikes evolve at the very centers of galactichalos, in regions where numerous dynamical effects tend to destroy them.mini-spikes may be more likely to survive, and they have been proposed asworthwhile targets for indirect dark matter searches. we review here theformation scenarios and the prospects for detection of mini-spikes, and wepresent new estimates for the abundances of mini-spikes to illustrate thesensitivity of such predictions to cosmological parameters and uncertaintiesregarding the astrophysics of black hole formation at high redshift. we alsoconnect the imbhs scenario to the recent measurements of cosmic-ray electronand positron spectra by the pamela, atic, h.e.s.s., and fermi collaborations.

0907.3448	high-energy neutrinos from dark matter particle self-capture within the  sun	a potential flux of high-energy neutrinos from the annihilation of darkmatter particles trapped within the sun has been exploited to place indirectlimits on particle dark matter. in most models, the dark matter interactsweakly, but the possibility of a dark matter particle with a large crosssection for elastic scattering with itself has been proposed in severalcontexts. i study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions forthe high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the sun. theself-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within thesun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the sun. thiseffect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameterspace. enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the sun oftens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameterspace. enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized inextreme regions of the viable parameter space. large enhancements require thedark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v &lt;~10^-27 cm^3/s. this phenomenology is interesting. first, self-capture isnegligible for the earth, so dark matter self-interactions break thecorrespondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. likewise,the correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scatteringcross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction. these brokencorrespondences may evince strong dark matter self-interactions. in some cases,self-capture can lead to observable indirect signals in regions of parameterspace where limits on dark matter-nucleon cross sections from direct detectionwould indicate that no such signal should be observable.

0910.3668	the impact of theoretical uncertainties in the halo mass function and  halo bias on precision cosmology	we study the impact of theoretical uncertainty in the dark matter halo massfunction and halo bias on dark energy constraints from imminent galaxy clustersurveys. we find that for an optical cluster survey like the dark energysurvey, the accuracy required on the predicted halo mass function to make it aninsignificant source of error on dark energy parameters is ~ 1%. the analogousrequirement on the predicted halo bias is less stringent (~ 5%), particularlyif the observable-mass distribution can be well constrained by other means.these requirements depend upon survey area but are relatively insensitive tosurvey depth. the most stringent requirements are likely to come from a surveyover a significant fraction of the sky that aims to observe clusters down torelatively low mass, mth ~ 10^13.7 msun/h; for such a survey, the mass functionand halo bias must be predicted to accuracies of ~ 0.5% and ~ 1%, respectively.these accuracies represent a limit on the practical need to calibrate ever moreaccurate halo mass and bias functions. we find that improving predictions forthe mass function in the low-redshift and low-mass regimes is the mosteffective way to improve dark energy constraints.

1002.3383	a general study of the influence of catastrophic photometric redshift  errors on cosmology with cosmic shear tomography	a goal of forthcoming imaging surveys is to use weak gravitational lensingshear measurements to constrain dark energy. we quantify the importance ofuncalibrated photometric redshift outliers to the dark energy goals offorthcoming imaging surveys in a manner that does not assume any particularphotometric redshift technique or template. in so doing, we provide anapproximate blueprint for computing the influence of specific outlierpopulations on dark energy constraints. we find that outliers whose photo-zdistributions are tightly localized about a significantly biased redshift mustbe controlled to a per-galaxy rate of &lt;~ a few times 10^-3 to insure thatsystematic errors on dark energy parameters are rendered negligible. in thecomplementary limit, a subset of imaged galaxies with uncalibrated photometricredshifts distributed over a broad range must be limited to fewer than aper-galaxy error rate of &lt;~ a few times 10^-4. additionally, we explore therelative importance of calibrating the photo-z's of a core set of relativelywell-understood galaxies as compared to the need to identify potentialcatastrophic photo-z outliers. we discuss the degradation of the statisticalconstraints on dark energy parameters induced by excising source galaxies athigh- and low-photometric redshifts, concluding that removing galaxies withz_phot &gt;~ 2.4 and z_phot &lt;~ 0.3 may mitigate damaging catastrophic redshiftoutliers at a relatively small (~ 20%) cost in statistical error. in anappendix, we show that forecasts for the degradation in dark energy parameterconstraints due to uncertain photometric redshifts depend sensitively on thetreatment of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. previous work using pd96 mayhave overestimated the photo-z calibration requirements of future surveys.

1003.2270	shapes of gas, gravitational potential and dark matter in lambda-cdm  clusters	we present analysis of the three-dimensional shape of intracluster gas inclusters formed in cosmological simulations of the lambda-cdm cosmology andcompare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of theoverall isopotential surfaces. we find that in simulations with radiativecooling, star formation and stellar feedback (csf), intracluster gas outsidethe cluster core is more spherical compared to non-radiative (nr) simulations,while in the core the gas in the csf runs is more triaxial and has a distinctlyoblate shape. the latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settlesinto a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. the shape of the gasin the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gascooling. we find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential ratherwell outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. at smallerradii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. in the csfruns, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationallysupported. interestingly, we find that in nr simulations the difference betweengas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which makethe gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. finally,we use mock chandra x-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observedin three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity ofx-ray isophotes. contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clustersagainst observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling of theintracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.

0708.1949	cold dark matter substructure and galactic disks i: morphological  signatures of hierarchical satellite accretion	(abridged) we conduct a series of high-resolution, dissipationless n-bodysimulations to investigate the cumulative effect of substructure mergers ontothin disk galaxies in the context of the lcdm paradigm of structure formation.our simulation campaign is based on a hybrid approach. substructure propertiesare culled directly from cosmological simulations of galaxy-sized cold darkmatter (cdm) halos. in contrast to what can be inferred from statistics of thepresent-day substructure populations, accretions of massive subhalos onto thecentral regions of host halos, where the galactic disk resides, since z~1should be common occurrences. one host halo merger history is subsequently usedto seed controlled numerical experiments of repeated satellite impacts on aninitially-thin milky way-type disk galaxy. we show that these accretion eventsproduce several distinctive observational signatures in the stellar diskincluding: a ring-like feature in the outskirts; a significant flare; a centralbar; and faint filamentary structures that (spuriously) resemble tidal streams.the final distribution of disk stars exhibits a complex vertical structure thatis well-described by a standard ``thin-thick'' disk decomposition. we concludethat satellite-disk encounters of the kind expected in lcdm models can inducemorphological features in galactic disks that are similar to those beingdiscovered in the milky way, m31, and in other disk galaxies. these resultshighlight the significant role of cdm substructure in setting the structure ofdisk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution. upcoming galactic structure surveysand astrometric satellites may be able to distinguish between competingcosmological models by testing whether the detailed structure of galactic disksis as excited as predicted by the cdm paradigm.

0708.2912	isolating triggered star formation	galaxy pairs provide a potentially powerful means of studying triggered starformation from galaxy interactions. we use a large cosmological n-bodysimulation coupled with a well-tested semi-analytic substructure model todemonstrate that the majority of galaxies in close pairs reside within clusteror group-size halos and therefore represent a biased population, poorly suitedfor direct comparison to ``field'' galaxies. thus, the frequent observationthat some types of galaxies in pairs have redder colors than ``field'' galaxiesis primarily a selection effect. we select galaxy pairs that are isolated intheir dark matter halos with respect to other massive subhalos (n=2 halos) anda control sample of isolated galaxies (n=1 halos) for comparison. we then applythese selection criteria to a volume-limited subset of the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey with m_bj &lt;= -19 and obtain the first clean measure of the typicalfraction of galaxies affected by triggered star formation and the averageelevation in the star formation rate. we find that 24% (30.5%) of these l^\starand sub-l^{\star} galaxies in isolated 50 (30) kpc/h pairs exhibit starformation that is boosted by a factor of &gt;~ 5 above their average past value,while only 10% of isolated galaxies in the control sample show this level ofenhancement. thus, 14% (20 %) of the galaxies in these close pairs show cleartriggered star formation. the isolation criteria we develop provide a means toconstrain star formation and feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamic simulationsand a very general method of understanding the importance of triggered starformation in a cosmological context.

1008.2560	galaxy peculiar velocities from large-scale supernova surveys as a dark  energy probe	upcoming imaging surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope willrepeatedly scan large areas of sky and have the potential to yieldmillion-supernova catalogs. type ia supernovae are excellent standard candlesand will provide distance measures that suffice to detect mean pairwisevelocities of their host galaxies. we show that when combining these distancemeasures with photometric redshifts for either the supernovae or their hostgalaxies, the mean pairwise velocities of the host galaxies will provide a darkenergy probe which is competitive with other widely discussed methods. addinginformation from this test to type ia supernova photometric luminositydistances from the same experiment, plus the cosmic microwave background powerspectrum from the planck satellite, improves the dark energy task force figureof merit by a factor of 1.8. pairwise velocity measurements require noadditional observational effort beyond that required to perform the traditionalsupernova luminosity distance test, but may provide complementary constraintson dark energy parameters and the nature of gravity. incorporating additionalspectroscopic redshift follow-up observations could provide important darkenergy constraints from pairwise velocities alone. mean pairwise velocities aremuch less sensitive to systematic redshift errors than the luminosity distancetest or weak lensing techniques, and also are only mildly affected bysystematic evolution of supernova luminosity.

1010.5518	counts-in-cylinders in the sloan digital sky survey with comparisons to  n-body simulations	environmental statistics provide a necessary means of comparing theproperties of galaxies in different environments and a vital test of models ofgalaxy formation within the prevailing, hierarchical cosmological model. weexplore counts-in-cylinders, a common statistic defined as the number ofcompanions of a particular galaxy found within a given projected radius andredshift interval. galaxy distributions with the same two-point correlationfunctions do not necessarily have the same companion count distributions. weuse this statistic to examine the environments of galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey, data release 4. we also make preliminary comparisons to four modelsfor the spatial distributions of galaxies, based on n-body simulations, anddata from sdss dr4 to study the utility of the counts-in-cylinders statistic.there is a very large scatter between the number of companions a galaxy has andthe mass of its parent dark matter halo and the halo occupation, limiting theutility of this statistic for certain kinds of environmental studies. we alsoshow that prevalent, empirical models of galaxy clustering that match observedtwo- and three-point clustering statistics well fail to reproduce some aspectsof the observed distribution of counts-in-cylinders on 1, 3 and 6-mpc/h scales.all models that we explore underpredict the fraction of galaxies with few or nocompanions in 3 and 6-mpc/h cylinders. roughly 7% of galaxies in the realuniverse are significantly more isolated within a 6 mpc/h cylinder than thegalaxies in any of the models we use. simple, phenomenological models that mapgalaxies to dark matter halos fail to reproduce high-order clusteringstatistics in low-density environments.

1011.2774	weak gravitational lensing as a method to constrain unstable dark matter	the nature of the dark matter remains a mystery. the possibility of anunstable dark matter particle decaying to invisible daughter particles has beenexplored many times in the past few decades. meanwhile, weak gravitationallensing shear has gained a lot of attention as a probe of dark energy. weaklensing is a useful tool for constraining the stability of the dark matter. inthe coming decade a number of large, galaxy imaging surveys will be undertakenand will measure the statistics of cosmological weak lensing with unprecedentedprecision. weak lensing statistics are sensitive to unstable dark matter in atleast two ways. dark matter decays alter the matter power spectrum and changethe angular diameter distance-redshift relation. we show how measurements ofweak lensing shear correlations may provide the most restrictive,model-independent constraints on the lifetime of unstable dark matter. ourresults rely on assumptions regarding nonlinear evolution of densityfluctuations in scenarios of unstable dark matter and one of our aims is tostimulate interest in theoretical work on nonlinear structure growth inunstable dark matter models.

1101.2916	the effects of halo-to-halo variation on substructure lensing	we explore the halo-to-halo variation of dark matter substructure ingalaxy-sized dark matter halos, focusing on its implications for stronglygravitational lensed systems. we find that the median value for projectedsubstructure mass fractions within projected radii of 3% of the host halovirial radius is approximately fsub ~ 0.25%, but that the variance is largewith a 95-percentile range of 0 &lt;= fsub &lt;= 1%. we quantify possible effects ofsubstructure on quadruply-imaged lens systems using the cusp relation and thesimple statistic, rcusp. we estimate that the probability of obtaining thelarge values of the rcusp which have been observed from substructure effects isroughly ~10^-3 to ~10^-2. we consider a variety of possible correlationsbetween host halo properties and substructure properties in order to probepossible sample biases. in particular, low-concentration host dark matter haloshave more large substructures and give rise to large values of rcusp moreoften. however, there is no known observational bias that would drive observedquadruply-imaged quasars to be produced by low-concentration lens halos.finally, we show that the substructure mass fraction is a relatively reliablepredictor of the value of rcusp.

1101.5155	a cosmic coincidence: the power-law galaxy correlation function	we model the evolution of galaxy clustering through cosmic time toinvestigate the nature of the power-law shape of xi(r), the galaxy two-pointcorrelation function. departures from a power law are mainly governed by galaxypair counts on small scales, subject to non-linear dynamics. we assume thatgalaxies reside within dark matter halos and subhalos and use a semi-analyticsubstructure evolution model to study subhalo populations within host halos. wefind that tidal mass loss and, to a lesser degree, dynamical friction depletethe number of subhalos within larger host halos over time by ~90%, just theright amount for achieving a power-law xi(r) at z = 0. we find that xi(r)breaks from a power law at high masses, implying that only galaxies ofluminosities &lt;= lstar should exhibit power-law clustering. we also demonstratethat xi(r) evolves from being far from a power law at high redshift, toward anear power law at z = 0 and deviates in the future. this is mainly caused bythe evolving competition between the accretion and destruction rates ofsubhalos, which happen to strike just the right balance at z~0. we show thatkey ingredients determining the shape of xi(r) are the fraction of galaxiesthat are satellites, the relative difference in mass between the halos ofisolated galaxies and halos that contain a single satellite on average, and therareness of halos that host galaxies. these pieces are intertwined and we findno simple, universal rule for which a power-law xi(r) will occur. however, wedo show that the physics responsible for setting the galaxy content of halos donot care about the conditions needed to achieve a power law xi(r) and theseconditions are met only in a narrow mass and redshift range. we conclude thatthe power-law nature of xi(r) for lstar and fainter galaxy samples at lowredshift is a cosmic coincidence.

0709.4029	self calibration of tomographic weak lensing for the physics of baryons  to constrain dark energy	numerical studies indicate that uncertainties in the treatment of baryonicphysics can affect predictions for shear power spectra at a level that issignificant for forthcoming surveys such as des, snap, and lsst.correspondingly, we show that baryonic effects can significantly bias darkenergy parameter measurements. eliminating such biases by neglectinginformation in multipoles beyond several hundred leads to weaker parameterconstraints by a factor of approximately 2 to 3 compared with using informationout to multipoles of several thousand. fortunately, the same numerical studiesthat explore the influence of baryons indicate that they primarily affect powerspectra by altering halo structure through the relation between halo mass andmean effective halo concentration. we explore the ability of future weaklensing surveys to constrain both the internal structures of halos and theproperties of the dark energy simultaneously as a first step toward selfcalibrating for the physics of baryons. this greatly reduces parameter biasesand no parameter constraint is degraded by more than 40% in the case of lsst or30% in the cases of snap or des. modest prior knowledge of the haloconcentration relation greatly improves even these forecasts. additionally, wefind that these surveys can constrain effective halo concentrations nearm~10^14 msun/h and z~0.2 to better than 10% with shear power spectra alone.these results suggest that inferring dark energy parameters with measurementsof shear power spectra can be made robust to baryonic effects and maysimultaneously be competitive with other methods to inform models of galaxyformation.

1108.2269	testing the origin of the cmb large-angle correlation deficit with a  galaxy imaging survey	the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature distribution measured bythe wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) exhibits anomalously lowcorrelation at large angles. quantifying the degree to which this feature inthe temperature data is in conflict with standard lambda-cdm cosmology issomewhat ambiguous because of the a posteriori nature of the observation. onephysical mechanism that has been proposed as a possible explanation for thedeficit in the large-angle temperature correlations is a suppression ofprimordial power on ~gpc scales. to distinguish whether the anomaly is a signalof new physics, such as suppressed primordial power, it would be invaluable toperform experimental tests of the authenticity of this signal in data setswhich are independent of the wmap temperature measurements or even other cmbmeasurements. we explore the possibility of testing models of power suppressionwith large-scale structure observations, and compare the ability of plannedphotometric and spectroscopic surveys to constrain the power spectrum. of thesurveys planned for the next decade, a spectroscopic redshift survey such asbigboss will have a greater number of radial modes available for study, but wefind that this advantage is outweighed by the greater surface density ofhigh-redshift sources that will be observed by photometric surveys such as lsstor euclid. we also find that the ability to constrain primordial powersuppression is insensitive to the precision of the calibration of photometricredshifts. we conclude that very-wide-area imaging surveys have the potentialto probe viable models for the missing power but that it will be difficult touse such surveys to conclusively rule out primordial power suppression as themechanism behind the observed anomaly.

0710.1683	biases in the gravitational lens population induced by halo and galaxy  triaxiality	the lensing cross section of triaxial halos depends on the relativeorientation between a halo's principal axes and its line of sight.consequently, a lensing subsample of randomly oriented halos is not, ingeneral,randomly oriented. using an isothermal mass model for the lensinggalaxies and their host halos, we show that the lensing subsample of halos thatproduces doubles is preferentially aligned along the lines of sight, whereashalos that produce quads tend to be projected along their middle axes. thesepreferred orientations result in different projected ellipticity distributionsfor quad, doubles, and random galaxies. we show that ~300 lens systems must bediscovered to detect this effect at the 95% confidence level. we alsoinvestigate the importance of halo shape for predicting the quad-to-doubleratio and find that the latter depends quite sensitively on the distribution ofthe short-to-long axis ratio, but is otherwise nearly independent of haloshape. finally, we estimate the impact of the preferred orientation of lensinggalaxies on their projected substructure mass fraction, and find that theobserved alignment between the substructure distribution and the massdistribution of halos result in a negligible bias.

1201.2168	constraining cluster physics with the shape of x-ray clusters:  comparison of local x-ray clusters versus lcdm clusters	simulations of cluster formation have demonstrated that condensation ofbaryons into central galaxies during cluster formation can drive the shape ofthe gas distribution in galaxy clusters significantly rounder, even at radii aslarge as half of the virial radius. however, such simulations generally predictstellar fractions within cluster virial radii that are ~2 to 3 times largerthan the stellar masses deduced from observations. in this work we compareellipticity profiles of clusters simulated with and without baryonic cooling tothe cluster ellipticity profiles derived from chandra and rosat observations inan effort to constrain the fraction of gas that cools and condenses into thecentral galaxies within clusters. we find that the observed ellipticityprofiles are fairly constant with radius, with an average ellipticity of 0.18+/- 0.05. the observed ellipticity profiles are in good agreement with thepredictions of non-radiative simulations. on the other hand, the ellipticityprofiles of the clusters in simulations that include radiative cooling, starformation, and supernova feedback (but no agn feedback) deviate significantlyfrom the observed ellipticity profiles at all radii. the simulations withcooling overpredict (underpredict) ellipticity in the inner (outer) regions ofgalaxy clusters. by comparing the simulations with and without cooling, we showthat the cooling of gas via cooling flows in the central regions of simulatedclusters causes the gas distribution to be more oblate in the central regions,but makes the outer gas distribution more spherical. we find that late-time gascooling and star formation are responsible for the significantly oblate gasdistributions in cluster cores, but the gas shapes outside of cluster cores areset primarily by baryon dissipation at high redshift z &gt; 2.

1201.2407	constraining satellite galaxy stellar mass loss and predicting intrahalo  light i: framework and results at low redshift	we introduce a new technique that uses galaxy clustering to constrain howsatellite galaxies lose stellar mass and contribute to the diffuse "intrahalolight" (ihl). we implement two models that relate satellite galaxy stellar massloss to the detailed knowledge of subhalo dark matter mass loss. model 1assumes that the fractional stellar mass loss of a galaxy is proportional tothe fractional amount of dark matter mass loss of its subhalo. model 2 accountsfor a delay in the time that stellar mass is lost since the galaxy resides deepin the potential well of the subhalo which may experience dark matter mass lossfor some time before the galaxy is affected. we use these models to predict thestellar masses of a population of galaxies and use abundance matching topredict the clustering of several r-band luminosity threshold samples from thesloan digital sky survey. abundance matching assuming no stellar mass loss(akin to abundance matching at the time of subhalo infall) over-estimates thecorrelation function on small scales (&lt;~ 1 mpc), while allowing too muchstellar mass loss leads to an under-estimate. for each sample, we are thus ableto constrain the amount of stellar mass loss required to match the observedclustering. we find that less luminous satellite galaxies experience moreefficient stellar mass loss than luminous satellites. from these models, we caninfer the amount of stellar mass that is deposited into the ihl. we find thatboth of our model predictions for the mean amount of ihl as a function of halomass are consistent with current observational measurements. however, our twomodels predict a different amount of scatter in the ihl from halo to halo, withmodel 2 being favored by observations. this demonstrates that a comparison toihl measurements provides independent verification of our stellar mass lossmodels.

1201.2426	effects of unstable dark matter on large-scale structure and constraints  from future surveys	in this paper we explore the effect of decaying dark matter (ddm) onlarge-scale structure and possible constraints from galaxy imaging surveys. ddmmodels have been studied, in part, as a way to address apparent discrepanciesbetween the predictions of standard cold dark matter models and observations ofgalactic structure. our study is aimed at developing independent constraints onthese models. in such models, ddm decays into a less massive, stable darkmatter (sdm) particle and a significantly lighter particle. the small masssplitting between the parent ddm and the daughter sdm provides the sdm with arecoil or "kick" velocity vk, inducing a free-streaming suppression of matterfluctuations. this suppression may be probed via weak lensing power spectrameasured by a number of forthcoming imaging surveys that aim primarily toconstrain dark energy. using scales on which linear perturbation theory aloneis valid (multipoles &lt; 300), surveys like euclid or lsst can be sensitive to vk&gt; 90 km/s for lifetimes ~ 1-5 gyr. to estimate more aggressive constraints, wemodel nonlinear corrections to lensing power using a simple halo evolutionmodel that is in good agreement with numerical simulations. in our mostambitious forecasts, using multipoles &lt; 3000, we find that imaging surveys canbe sensitive to vk ~ 10 km/s for lifetimes &lt; 10 gyr. lensing will provide aparticularly interesting complement to existing constraints in that they willprobe the long lifetime regime far better than contemporary techniques. acaveat to these ambitious forecasts is that the evolution of perturbations onnonlinear scales will need to be well calibrated by numerical simulationsbefore they can be realized. this work motivates the pursuit of such anumerical simulation campaign to constrain dark matter with cosmological weaklensing.

1203.6617	dark matter direct search rates in simulations of the milky way and  sagittarius stream	we analyze self-consistent n-body simulations of the milky way disk and theongoing disruption of the sagittarius dwarf satellite to study the effect ofsagittarius tidal debris on dark matter detection experiments. in agreementwith significant previous work, we reiterate that the standard halo model isinsufficient to describe the non-maxwellian velocity distribution of the milkyway halo in our equilibrium halo-only and halo/galaxy models, and offersuggestions for correcting for this discrepancy. more importantly, we emphasizethat the dark matter component of the leading tidal arm of the sagittariusdwarf is significantly more extended than the stellar component of the arm,since the dark matter and stellar streams are not necessarily coaxial and maybe offset by several kpc at the point at which they impact the galactic disk.this suggests that the dark matter component of the sagittarius debris islikely to have a non-negligible influence on dark matter detection experimentseven when the stellar debris is centered several kpc from the solarneighborhood. relative to models without an infalling sagittarius dwarf, thesagittarius dark matter debris in our models induces an energy-dependentenhancement of direct search event rates of as much as ~20 - 45%, anenergy-dependent reduction in the amplitude of the annual modulation of theevent rate by as much as a factor of two, a shift in the phase of the annualmodulation by as much as ~20 days, and a shift in the recoil energy at whichthe modulation reverses phase. these influences of sagittarius are of generalinterest in the interpretation of dark matter searches, but may be particularlyimportant in the case of relatively light (m_x &lt; 20 gev) dark matter becausethe sagittarius stream impacts the solar system at high speed compared to theprimary halo dark matter.

1207.1074	mind the gap: tightening the mass-richness relation with magnitude gaps	we investigate the potential to improve optical tracers of cluster mass byexploiting measurements of the magnitude gap, m12, defined as the differencebetween the r-band absolute magnitude of the two brightest cluster members. wefind that in a mock sample of galaxy groups and clusters constructed from thebolshoi simulation, the scatter about the mass-richness relation decreases by15-20% when magnitude gap information is included. a similar trend is evidentin a volume-limited, spectroscopic sample of galaxy groups observed in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that sdss groups with small magnitudegaps are richer than large-gap groups at fixed values of the one-dimensionalvelocity dispersion among group members sigma_v, which we use as a mass proxy.we demonstrate explicitly that m12 contains information about cluster mass thatsupplements the information provided by group richness and the luminosity ofthe brightest cluster galaxy, l_bcg. in so doing, we show that the luminositiesof the members of a group with richness n are inconsistent with thedistribution of luminosities that results from n random draws from the globalgalaxy luminosity function. as the cosmological constraining power of galaxyclusters is limited by the precision in cluster mass determination, ourfindings suggest a new way to improve the cosmological constraints derived fromgalaxy clusters.

1208.4602	bailing out the milky way: variation in the properties of massive dwarfs  among galaxy-sized systems	recent kinematical constraints on the internal densities of the milky way'sdwarf satellites have revealed a discrepancy with the subhalo populations ofsimulated galaxy-scale halos in the standard cdm model of hierarchicalstructure formation. this has been dubbed the "too big to fail" problem, withreference to the improbability of large and invisible companions existing inthe galactic environment. in this paper, we argue that both the milky wayobservations and simulated subhalos are consistent with the predictions of thestandard model for structure formation. specifically, we show that there issignificant variation in the properties of subhalos among distinct host halosof fixed mass and suggest that this can reasonably account for the deficit ofdense satellites in the milky way. we exploit well-tested analytic techniquesto predict the properties in a large sample of distinct host halos with avariety of masses spanning the range expected of the galactic halo. theanalytic model produces subhalo populations consistent with both via lactea iiand aquarius, and our results suggest that natural variation in subhaloproperties suffices to explain the discrepancy between milky way satellitekinematics and these numerical simulations. at least ~10% of milky way-sizedhalos host subhalo populations for which there is no "too big to fail" problem,even when the host halo mass is as large as m_host = 10^12.2 h^-1 m_sun.follow-up studies consisting of high-resolution simulations of a large numberof milky way-sized hosts are necessary to confirm our predictions. in theabsence of such efforts, the "too big to fail" problem does not appear to be asignificant challenge to the standard model of hierarchical formation.[abridged]

1210.4927	sham beyond clustering: new tests of galaxy-halo abundance matching with  galaxy groups	we construct mock catalogs of galaxy groups using subhalo abundance matching(sham) and undertake several new tests of the sham prescription for thegalaxy-dark matter connection. all sham models we studied exhibit significanttension with galaxy groups observed in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). thesham prediction for the field galaxy luminosity function (lf) is systematicallytoo dim, and the group galaxy lf systematically too bright, regardless of thedetails of the sham prescription. sham models connecting r-band luminosity, mr,to vacc, the maximum circular velocity of a subhalo at the time of accretiononto the host, faithfully reproduce galaxy group abundance as a function ofrichness, g(n). however, sham models connecting mr with vpeak, the peak valueof vmax over the entire merger history of the halo, over-predict galaxy groupabundance. our results suggest that no sham model can simultaneously reproducethe observed g(n) and two-point projected galaxy clustering. nevertheless, wealso report a new success of sham: an accurate prediction for phi(m12), theabundance of galaxy groups as a function of magnitude gap m12, defined as thedifference between the r-band absolute magnitude of the two brightest groupmembers. we show that it may be possible to use joint measurements of g(n) andphi(m12) to tightly constrain the details of the sham implementation.additionally, we show that the hypothesis that the luminosity gap isconstructed via random draws from a universal lf provides a poor description ofthe data, contradicting recent claims in the literature. finally, we test acommon assumption of the conditional luminosity function (clf) formalism, thatthe satellite lf need only be conditioned by the brightness of the centralgalaxy. we find this assumption to be well-supported by the observed phi(m12).

0711.5027	merger histories of galaxy halos and implications for disk survival	we study the merger histories of galaxy dark matter halos using a highresolution lcdm n-body simulation. our merger trees follow ~17,000 halos withmasses m_0 = (10^11--10^13) msun at z=0 and track accretion events involvingobjects as small as m = 10^10 msun. we find that mass assembly is remarkablyself-similar in m/m_0, and dominated by mergers that are ~10% of the final halomass. while very large mergers, m &gt; 0.4 m_0, are quite rare, sizeable accretionevents, m ~ 0.1 m_0, are common. over the last 10 gyr, an overwhelming majority(~95%) of milky way-sized halos with m_0 = 10^12 msun have accreted at leastone object with greater total mass than the milky way disk (m &gt; 5x10^10 msun),and approximately 70% have accreted an object with more than twice that mass (m&gt; 10^11 msun). our results raise serious concerns about the survival ofthin-disk dominated galaxies within the current paradigm for galaxy formationin a cdm universe. in order to achieve a ~70% disk-dominated fraction in milkyway-sized cdm halos, mergers involving m ~ 2x10^11 msun objects must notdestroy disks. considering that most thick disks and bulges contain old stellarpopulations, the situation is even more restrictive: these mergers must notheat disks or drive gas into their centers to create young bulges.

1212.1177	accounting for baryons in cosmological constraints from cosmic shear	one of the most pernicious theoretical systematics facing upcominggravitational lensing surveys is the uncertainty introduced by the effects ofbaryons on the power spectrum of the convergence field. one method that hasbeen proposed to account for these effects is to allow several additionalparameters (that characterize dark matter halos) to vary and to fit lensingdata to these halo parameters concurrently with the standard set ofcosmological parameters. we test this method. in particular, we use thistechnique to model convergence power spectrum predictions from a set ofcosmological simulations. we estimate biases in dark energy equation of stateparameters that would be incurred if one were to fit the spectra predicted bythe simulations either with no model for baryons, or with the proposed method.we show that neglecting baryonic effect leads to biases in dark energyparameters that are several times the statistical errors for a survey like thedark energy survey. the proposed method to correct for baryonic effects rendersthe residual biases in dark energy equation of state parameters smaller thanthe statistical errors. these results suggest that this mitigation method maybe applied to analyze convergence spectra from a survey like the dark energysurvey. for significantly larger surveys, such as will be carried out by thelarge synoptic survey telescope, the biases introduced by baryonic effects aremuch more significant. we show that this mitigation technique significantlyreduces the biases for such larger surveys, but that a more effectivemitigation strategy will need to be developed in order ensure that the residualbiases in these surveys fall below the statistical errors.

1301.5870	groups of two galaxies in sdss: implications of colours on star  formation quenching time-scales	we have devised a method to select galaxies that are isolated in their darkmatter halo (n=1 systems) and galaxies that reside in a group of exactly two(n=2 systems). our n=2 systems are widely-separated (up to$\sim$\,200\,$h^{-1}$\,kpc), where close galaxy-galaxy interactions are notdominant. we apply our selection criteria to two volume-limited samples ofgalaxies from sdss dr6 with $m_{r}-5 \log_{10} h \leq$ -19 and -20 to study theeffects of the environment of very sparse groups on galaxy colour. forsatellite galaxies in a group of two, we find a red excess attributed to starformation quenching of 0.15\,$\pm$\,0.01 and 0.14\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and-20 samples, respectively, relative to isolated galaxies of the same stellarmass. assuming n=1 systems are the progenitors of n=2 systems, animmediate-rapid star formation quenching scenario is inconsistent with theseobservations. a delayed-then-rapid star formation quenching scenario with adelay time of 3.3 and 3.7\,gyr for the -19 and -20 samples, respectively,yields a red excess prediction in agreement with the observations. theobservations also reveal that central galaxies in a group of two have a slightblue excess of 0.06\,$\pm$\,0.02 and 0.02\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and -20samples, respectively, relative to n=1 populations of the same stellar mass.our results demonstrate that even the environment of very sparse groups ofluminous galaxies influence galaxy evolution and in-depth studies of thesesimple systems are an essential step towards understanding galaxy evolution ingeneral.

1309.7354	lyman-alpha forest constraints on decaying dark matter	we present an analysis of high-resolution n-body simulations of decaying darkmatter cosmologies focusing on the statistical properties of the transmittedlyman-alpha forest flux in the high-redshift intergalactic medium. in this typeof model a dark matter particle decays into a slightly less massive stable darkmatter daughter particle and a comparably light particle. the small masssplitting provides a non-relativistic kick velocity v_k to the daughterparticle resulting in free-streaming and subsequent damping of small-scaledensity fluctuations. current lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurementsprobe comoving scales up to ~ 2-3 h^-1 mpc at redshifts z ~ 2-4, providing oneof the most robust ways to probe cosmological density fluctuations onrelatively small scales. the suppression of structure growth due to thefree-streaming of dark matter daughter particles also has a significant impacton the neutral hydrogen cloud distribution, which traces the underlying darkmatter distribution well at high redshift. we exploit lyman-alpha forest powerspectrum measurements to constrain the amount of free-streaming of dark matterin such models and thereby place limits on decaying dark matter based only onthe dynamics of cosmological perturbations without any assumptions about theinteractions of the decay products. we find that sdss 1d lyman-alpha forestpower spectrum data place a lifetime-dependent upper limit v_k &lt; 30-70 km/s fordecay lifetimes &lt; 10 gyr. this is the most stringent model-independent bound oninvisible dark matter decays with small mass splittings. for large masssplittings (large v_k), lyman-alpha forest data restrict the dark matterlifetime to gamma^-1 &gt; 40 gyr. forthcoming boss data should be able to providemore stringent constraints on exotic dark matter, mainly because the largerboss quasar spectrum sample will significantly reduce statistical errors.

1310.6747	the dark side of galaxy color: evidence from new sdss measurements of  galaxy clustering and lensing	the age matching model has recently been shown to predict correctly theluminosity l and g-r color of galaxies residing within dark matter halos. thecentral tenet of the model is intuitive: older halos tend to host galaxies witholder stellar populations. in this paper, we demonstrate that age matching alsocorrectly predicts the g-r color trends exhibited in a wide variety ofstatistics of the galaxy distribution for stellar mass m* threshold samples. inparticular, we present new measurements of the galaxy two-point correlationfunction and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal as a function of m* and g-r colorfrom the sloan digital sky survey, and show that age matching exhibitsremarkable agreement with these and other statistics of low-redshift galaxies.in so doing, we also demonstrate good agreement between the galaxy-galaxylensing observed by sdss and the signal predicted by abundance matching, a newsuccess of this model. we describe how age matching is a specific example of alarger class of conditional abundance matching models (cam), a theoreticalframework we introduce here for the first time. cam provides a generalformalism to study correlations at fixed mass between any galaxy property andany halo property. the striking success of our simple implementation of camprovides compelling evidence that this technique has the potential to describethe same set of data as alternative models, but with a dramatic reduction inthe required number of parameters. cam achieves this reduction by exploitingthe capability of contemporary n-body simulations to determine dark matter haloproperties other than mass alone, which distinguishes our model fromconventional approaches to the galaxy-halo connection.

1311.1818	galaxy assembly bias: a significant source of systematic error in the  galaxy-halo relationship	it is common practice for methods that use galaxy clustering to constrain thegalaxy-halo relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (hod) and/orconditional luminosity function (clf), to assume that halo mass alone sufficesto determine a halo's resident galaxy population. yet, the clustering strengthof cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass,such as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. if galaxycharacteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, thebasic assumption of hod/clf methods is violated. we estimate the potential forassembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupationstatistics. we use halo abundance matching and age matching to constructfiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additionalmock catalogs with identical hods, but with assembly bias removed. we fit aparameterized hod to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies ineach catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels ofassembly bias. in the absence of assembly bias, the inferred hods generallydescribe the true underlying hods well, validating the basic methodology.however, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred hods havesystematic errors that are statistically significant. in most cases, thesesystematic errors cannot be identified using void statistics as auxiliaryobservables. we conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxyclustering should be subject to a non-negligible systematic error induced byassembly bias. our work suggests that efforts to model and/or constrainassembly bias should be high priorities as it is a threatening source ofsystematic error in galaxy evolution studies as well as the precision cosmologyprogram.

1403.1578	predicting galaxy star formation rates via the co-evolution of galaxies  and halos	in this paper, we test the age matching hypothesis that the star formationrate (sfr) of a galaxy of fixed stellar mass is determined by its dark matterhalo formation history, and as such, that more quiescent galaxies reside inolder halos. this simple model has been remarkably successful at predictingcolor-based galaxy statistics at low redshift as measured in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). to further test this method with observations, we presentnew sdss measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function andgalaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass and sfr, separated intoquenched and star-forming galaxy samples. we find that our age matching modelis in excellent agreement with these new measurements. we also employ a galaxygroup finder and show that our model is able to predict: (1) the relative sfrsof central and satellite galaxies, (2) the sfr-dependence of the radialdistribution of satellite galaxy populations within galaxy groups, rich groups,and clusters and their surrounding larger scale environments, and (3) theinteresting feature that the satellite quenched fraction as a function ofprojected radial distance from the central galaxy exhibits an ~ r^-.15 slope,independent of environment. the accurate prediction for the spatialdistribution of satellites is intriguing given the fact that we do notexplicitly model satellite-specific processes after infall, and that in ourmodel the virial radius does not mark a special transition region in theevolution of a satellite, contrary to most galaxy evolution models. the successof the model suggests that present-day galaxy sfr is strongly correlated withhalo mass assembly history.

1405.6205	systematic errors in the measurement of neutrino masses due to baryonic  feedback processes: prospects for stage iv lensing surveys	we examine the importance of baryonic feedback effects on the matter powerspectrum on small scales, and the implications for the precise measurement ofneutrino masses through gravitational weak lensing. planned large galaxysurveys such as the large synoptic sky telescope (lsst) and euclid are expectedto measure the sum of neutrino masses to extremely high precision, sufficientto detect non-zero neutrino masses even in the minimal mass normal hierarchy.we show that weak lensing of galaxies while being a very good probe of neutrinomasses, is extremely sensitive to baryonic feedback processes. we use publiclyavailable results from the overwhelmingly large simulations (owls) project toinvestigate the effects of active galactic nuclei feedback, the nature of thestellar initial mass function, and gas cooling rates, on the measured weaklensing shear power spectrum. using the fisher matrix formalism and priors fromcmb+bao data, we show that when one does not account for feedback, the measuredneutrino mass may be substantially larger or smaller than the true mass,depending on the dominant feedback mechanism, with the mass error |\delta m_nu|often exceeding the mass m_nu itself. we also consider gravitational lensing ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) and show that it is not sensitive tobaryonic feedback on scales l &lt; 2000, although cmb experiments that aim forsensitivities sigma(m_nu) &lt; 0.02 ev will need to include baryonic effects inmodeling the cmb lensing potential. a combination of cmb lensing and galaxylensing can help break the degeneracy between neutrino masses and baryonicfeedback processes. we conclude that future large galaxy lensing surveys suchas lsst and euclid can only measure neutrino masses accurately if the matterpower spectrum can be measured to similar accuracy.

1406.0527	cosmological simulations of decaying dark matter: implications for  small-scale structure of dark matter halos	we present a set of n-body simulations of a class of models in which anunstable dark matter particle decays into a stable non-interacting dark matterparticle, with decay lifetime comparable to the hubble time. we study theeffects of the kinematic recoil velocity received by the stable dark matter onthe structures of dark matter halos ranging from galaxy-cluster to milky waymass scales. for milky way-mass halos, we use high-resolution, zoom-insimulations to explore the effects of decays on galactic substructure. ingeneral, halos with circular velocities comparable to the magnitude of kickvelocity are most strongly affected by decays. we show that decaying darkmatter models with lifetimes comparable to hubble time and recoil speeds about20-40 km/s can significantly reduce both the abundance of galactic subhalos andthe internal densities of the subhalos. we also compare subhalo circularvelocity profiles with observational constraints on the milky way dwarfsatellite galaxies. interestingly, we find that decaying dark matter modelsthat do not violate current astrophysical constraints, can significantlymitigate both the well-documented "missing satellites problem" and the morerecent "too big to fail problem" associated with the abundances and densitiesof local group dwarf satellite galaxies. a relatively unique feature of latedecaying dark matter models is that they predict significant evolution of halosas a function of time. this is an important consideration because at highredshifts, prior to decays, decaying models exhibit the same sequence ofstructure formation as cold dark matter. we conclude that models of decayingdark matter make predictions that are relevant for the interpretation ofobservations of small galaxies in the local group and can be tested orconstrained by the kinematics of local group dwarf galaxies as well as byforthcoming large-scale surveys.

1410.3925	indirect probes of dark matter and globular cluster properties from dark  matter annihilation within the coolest white dwarfs	white dwarfs (wd) capture dark matter (dm) as they orbit within their hosthalos. these captured particles may subsequently annihilate, heating thestellar core and preventing the wd from cooling. the potential wells of wds areconsiderably deeper and core temperatures significantly cooler than those ofmain sequence stars. consequently, dm evaporation is less important in wds anddm with masses $m_{\chi} \gtrsim 100\, \kev$ and annihilation cross-sectionsorders of magnitude below the canonical thermal cross-section ($\sigmav \gtrsim10^{-46}\, \cm^3$/s) can significantly alter wd cooling in particularastrophysical environments. we consider wds in globular clusters (gcs) anddwarf galaxies. if the parameters of the dm particle are known, then thetemperature of the coolest wd in a gc can be used to constrain the dm densityof the cluster's halo (potentially even ruling out the presence of a halo ifthe inferred density is of order the ambient galactic density). recentlyseveral direct detection experiments have seen signals whose origins might bedue to low mass dm. in this paper, we show that if these claims from cresst,dama, cdms-si, and cogent could be interpreted as dm, then observations of ngc6397 limit the fraction of dm in that cluster to be $f_{\mathrm{dm}} \lesssim10^{-3}$. this would be an improvement over existing constraints of 3 orders ofmagnitude and clearly rule out a significant dm halo for this cluster...

1509.04308	mass assembly history and infall time of the fornax dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	we use cosmological simulations to identify dark matter subhalo hostcandidates of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy using the stellar kinematicproperties of fornax. we consider cold dark matter (cdm), warm dark matter(wdm), and decaying dark matter (ddm) simulations for our models of structureformation. the subhalo candidates in cdm typically have smaller mass and higherconcentrations at z = 0 than the corresponding candidates in wdm and ddm. weexamine the formation histories of the ~ 100 fornax candidate subhalosidentified in cdm simulations and, using approximate luminosity-massrelationships for subhalos, we find two of these subhalos that are consistentwith both the fornax luminosity and kinematics. these two subhalos have a peakmass over ten times larger than their z = 0 mass. we suggest that in cdm thedark matter halo hosting fornax must have been severely stripped of mass andthat it had an infall time into the milky way of ~ 9 gyr ago. in wdm, we findthat candidate subhalos consistent with the properties of fornax have a similarinfall time and a similar degree of mass loss, while in ddm we find a laterinfall time of ~ 3 - 4 gyr ago and significantly less mass loss. we discussthese results in the context of the fornax star formation history, and showthat these predicted subhalo infall times can be linked to different starformation quenching mechanisms. this emphasizes the links between theproperties of the dark matter and the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution.

1512.03050	introducing decorated hods: modeling assembly bias in the galaxy-halo  connection	the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often inferred fromdata using probabilistic models, such as the halo occupation distribution(hod). conventional hod formulations assume that only halo mass governs thegalaxy-halo connection. violations of this assumption, known as galaxy assemblybias, threaten the hod program. we introduce decorated hods, a new, flexibleclass of models designed to account for assembly bias. decorated hods minimallyexpand the parameter space and maximize the independence between traditionaland novel hod parameters. we use decorated hods to quantify the influence ofassembly bias on clustering and lensing statistics. for sdss-like samples, theimpact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering can be as large as a factor of twoon r ~ 200 kpc scales and ~15% in the linear regime. assembly bias can eitherenhance or diminish clustering on large scales, but generally increasesclustering on scales r &lt;~ 1 mpc. we performed our calculations with halotools,an open-source, community-driven python package for studying the galaxy-haloconnection (http://halotools.readthedocs.org). we conclude by describing theuse of decorated hods to treat assembly bias in otherwise conventionallikelihood analyses.

0807.2863	cold dark matter substructure and galactic disks	we perform a set of high-resolution, dissipationless n-body simulations toinvestigate the influence of cold dark matter (cdm) substructure on thedynamical evolution of thin galactic disks. our method combines cosmologicalsimulations of galaxy-sized cdm halos to derive the properties of substructurepopulations and controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impactsonto initially-thin, fully-formed disk galaxies. we demonstrate that closeencounters between massive subhalos and galactic disks since z~1 should becommon occurrences in lcdm models. in contrast, extremely few satellites inpresent-day cdm halos are likely to have a significant impact on the diskstructure. one typical host halo merger history is used to seed controlledn-body experiments of subhalo-disk encounters. as a result of these accretionevents, the disk thickens considerably at all radii with the disk scale heightincreasing in excess of a factor of 2 in the solar neighborhood. we show thatinteractions with the subhalo population produce a wealth of distinctivemorphological signatures in the disk stars including: conspicuous flares; bars;low-lived, ring-like features in the outskirts; and low-density, filamentarystructures above the disk plane. we compare a resulting dynamically-cold,ring-like feature in our simulations to the monoceros ring stellar structure inthe mw. the comparison shows quantitative agreement in both spatialdistribution and kinematics, suggesting that such observed complex stellarcomponents may arise naturally as disk stars are excited by encounters withsubhalos. these findings highlight the significant role of cdm substructure insetting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0205216	inflation, cold dark matter, and the central density problem	a problem with high central densities in dark halos has arisen in the contextof lcdm cosmologies with scale-invariant initial power spectra. although n=1 isoften justified by appealing to the inflation scenario, inflationary modelswith mild deviations from scale-invariance are not uncommon and models withsignificant running of the spectral index are plausible. even mild deviationsfrom scale-invariance can be important because halo collapse times anddensities depend on the relative amount of small-scale power. we choose severalpopular models of inflation and work out the ramifications for galaxy centraldensities. for each model, we calculate its cobe-normalized power spectrum anddeduce the implied halo densities using a semi-analytic method calibratedagainst n-body simulations. we compare our predictions to a sample of darkmatter-dominated galaxies using a non-parametric measure of the density. whilestandard n=1, lcdm halos are overdense by a factor of 6, several of our exampleinflation+cdm models predict halo densities well within the range preferred byobservations. we also show how the presence of massive (0.5 ev) neutrinos mayhelp to alleviate the central density problem even with n=1. we conclude thatgalaxy central densities may not be as problematic for the cdm paradigm as issometimes assumed: rather than telling us something about the nature of thedark matter, galaxy rotation curves may be telling us something about inflationand/or neutrinos. an important test of this idea will be an eventual consensuson the value of sigma_8, the rms overdensity on the scale 8 h^-1 mpc. oursuccessful models have values of sigma_8 approximately 0.75, which is withinthe range of recent determinations. finally, models with n&gt;1 (or sigma_8 &gt; 1)are highly disfavored.

astro-ph;0207534	dark halo densities, substructure, and the initial power spectrum	although the currently favored cold dark matter plus cosmological constantmodel for structure formation assumes an n=1 scale-invariant initial powerspectrum, most inflation models produce at least mild deviations from n=1.because the lever arm from the cmb normalization to galaxy scales is long, evena small ``tilt'' can have important implications for galactic observations.here we calculate the cobe-normalized power spectra for several well-motivatedmodels of inflation and compute implications for the substructure content andcentral densities of galaxy halos. using an analytic model, normalized againstn-body simulations, we show that while halos in the standard (n=1) model areoverdense by a factor of ~6 compared to observations, several of our exampleinflation+lcdm models predict halo densities well within the range ofobservations, which prefer models with n ~ 0.85. we go on to use asemi-analytic model (also normalized against n-body simulations) to follow themerger histories of galaxy-sized halos and track the orbital decay, disruption,and evolution of the merging substructure. models with n ~0.85 predict a factorof ~3 fewer subhalos at a fixed circular velocity than the standard $n = 1$case. although this level of reduction does not resolve the ``dwarf satelliteproblem'', it does imply that the level of feedback required to match theobserved number of dwarfs is sensitive to the initial power spectrum. finally,the fraction of galaxy-halo mass that is bound up in substructure is consistentwith limits imposed by multiply imaged quasars for all models considered: f_sub&gt; 0.01 even for an effective tilt of n ~0.8.we conclude that, at their currentlevel, lensing constraints of this kind do not provide strong limits on theprimordial power spectrum.

astro-ph;0212339	halo substructure and the power spectrum	in this proceeding, we present the results of a semi-analytic study of cdmsubstructure as a function of the primordial power spectrum. we apply ourmethod to several tilted models in the lcdm framework with n=0.85-1.1,sigma_8=0.65-1.2 when cobe normalized. we also study a more extreme, warm darkmatter-like spectrum that is sharply truncated below a scale of 10^10 h^-1msun. we show that the mass fraction of halo substructure is not a strongfunction of spectral slope, so it likely will be difficult to constrain tiltusing flux ratios of gravitationally lensed quasars. on the positive side, allof our cdm-type models yield projected mass fractions in good agreement withstrong lensing estimates: f \sim 1.5% at m \sim 10^8 msun. the truncated modelproduces a significantly smaller fraction, f \lsim 0.3%, suggesting that warmdark matter-like spectra may be distinguished from cdm spectra using lensing.we also discuss the issue of dwarf satellite abundances, with emphasis on thecosmological dependence of the map between the observed central velocitydispersion of milky way satellites and the maximum circular velocities of theirhost halos. in agreement with earlier work, we find that standard lcdmover-predicts the estimated count of milky way satellites at fixed vmax by anorder of magnitude, but tilted models do better because subhalos are lessconcentrated. interestingly, under the assumption that dwarfs have isotropicvelocity dispersion tensors, models with significantly tilted spectra (n \lsim0.85, sigma_8 \lsim 0.7) may under-predict the number of large milky waysatellites with vmax \gsim 40 km/s.

astro-ph;0304292	halo substructure and the power spectrum	(abridged) we present a semi-analytic model to explore merger histories,destruction rates, and survival probabilities of substructure in dark matterhalos and use it to study the substructure populations of galaxy-sized halos asa function of the power spectrum. we successfully reproduce the subhalovelocity function and radial distribution seen in n-body simulations forstandard lcdm. we explore the implications of spectra with normalizations andtilts spanning sigma_8 = 0.65-1 and n = 0.8-1. we also study a running index(ri) model with dn/dlnk=-0.03, as discussed in the first year wmap report, andseveral wdm models with masses m_w = 0.75, 1.5, 3.0 kev. the substructure massfraction is relatively insensitive to the tilt and overall normalization of thepower spectrum. all cdm-type models yield projected substructure mass fractionsthat are consistent with, but on the low side of, estimates from strong lenssystems: f = 0.4-1.5% (64 percentile) in systems m_sub &lt; 10^9 msun. truncatedmodels produce significantly smaller fractions and are disfavored by lensingresults. we compare our predicted subhalo velocity functions to the dwarfsatellite population of the milky way. assuming isotropic velocity dispersions,we find the standard n=1 model overpredicts the number of mw satellites asexpected. models with less small-scale power are more successful because thereare fewer subhalos of a given circular velocity and the mapping betweenobserved velocity dispersion and halo circular velocity is markedly altered.the ri model, or a fixed tilt with sigma_8=0.75, can account for the mw dwarfswithout the need for differential feedback; however, these comparisons dependsensitively on the assumption of isotropic velocities in satellite galaxies.

astro-ph;0309464	the observability of gamma-rays from neutralino annihilations in milky  way substructure	we estimate the probability of detecting gamma-rays from the annihilation ofneutralino dark matter in dense, central regions of milky way substructure. wecharacterize galactic substructure statistically based on monte carlorealizations of the formation of a milky way-like halo using a semi-analyticmethod that has been calibrated against the results of high-resolution n-bodysimulations. we find that it may be possible for the upcoming experiments glastand veritas, working in concert, to detect gamma-rays from dark mattersubstructure if the neutralino is relatively light ($\mchi \lsim 100 \gev$),while for $\mchi \gsim 500 \gev$ such a detection would be unlikely. we performmost of our calculations within the framework of the standard $\lambda$cdmcosmological model; however, we also investigate the robustness of our resultsto various assumptions and find that the probability of detection is sensitiveto poorly-constrained input parameters, particularly those that characterizethe primordial power spectrum. specifically, the best-fitting power spectrum ofthe wmap team, with a running spectral index, predicts roughly a factor offifty fewer detectable subhalos compared to the standard $\lcdm$ cosmologicalmodel with scale-invariant power spectrum. we conclude that the lack of adetected gamma-ray signal gives very little information about thesupersymmetric parameter space due to uncertainties associated with both theproperties of substructure and cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0405189	the effect of gas cooling on the shapes of dark matter halos	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the shapes of dark matter (dm) halosusing high-resolution cosmological gasdynamics simulations of clusters andgalaxies in the lcdm cosmology. we find that halos formed in simulations withgas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed inadiabatic simulations. gas cooling results in an average increase of theprinciple axis ratios of halos by ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. thesystematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to thevirial radius. we argue that the differences in simulations with and withoutcooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools andcondenses toward the center, and during major mergers. we perform a series ofhigh-resolution n-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in majormergers of dm halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. in the dm halo-onlymergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentumof the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. however,significant shape changes in the dm distribution may result if stellar disksare included. in this case the shape of the dm halos is correlated with themorphology of the stellar remnants.

astro-ph;0411586	the physics of galaxy clustering i: a model for subhalo populations	(abridged) we present a semi-analytic model for cold dark matter halosubstructure that can be used as a framework for studying galaxy formation andan ingredient in halo models of galaxy clustering. we perform a comprehensivecomparison of the model to the results of a suite of high-resolutioncosmological simulations. the comparisons reveal that subhalo statistics, suchas velocity and mass functions, radial distributions, and the halo occupationdistributions, agree well over three orders of magnitude in host halo mass atvarious redshifts. both in the simulations and in our model, the radialdistributions of subhalos are significantly shallower than that of the darkmatter density. the abundance of subhalos in a host is set by competitionbetween destruction and new accretion. high mass halos and halos at highredshift tend to host more subhalos because the subhalos have, on average, beenaccreted more recently. similarly, at fixed mass, halos that formed morerecently host more subhalos. observed "fossil groups" may represent an extremetail of this correlation. we find a related correlation between host haloconcentration and subhalo abundance at fixed host mass, nsat ~ c^-a, where achanges with redshift and host-to-subhalo mass ratio. lastly, we use our modelto populate host halos in one of our high-resolution cosmological simulations,replacing the subhalos resolved in the simulation with subhalos computedaccording to our model. we show that the resulting 2pt correlation function ofsuch a "hybrid" halo ensemble is indistinguishable from that measured directlyin the simulation. this supports one of the key tenets of the standard halomodel -- the assumption that the halo occupation distribution is statisticallyindependent of host halo environment.

astro-ph;0502496	the anisotropic distribution of galactic satellites	we present a study of the spatial distribution of subhalos in galactic darkmatter halos using dissipationless cosmological simulations of the concordancelcdm model. we find that subhalos are distributed anisotropically and arepreferentially located along the major axes of the triaxial mass distributionsof their hosts. the kolmogorov-smirnov probability for drawing our simulatedsubhalo sample from an isotropic distribution is p_ks \simeq 1.5 \times10^{-4}. an isotropic distribution of subhalos is thus not the correct nullhypothesis for testing the cdm paradigm. the nearly planar distribution ofobserved milky way (mw) satellites is marginally consistent (probability \simeq0.02) with being drawn randomly from the subhalo distribution in oursimulations. furthermore, if we select the subhalos likely to be luminous, wefind a distribution that is consistent with the observed mw satellites. infact, we show that subsamples of the subhalo population with acentrally-concentrated radial distribution, similar to that of the mw dwarfs,typically exhibit a comparable degree of planarity. we explore the origin ofthe observed subhalo anisotropy and conclude that it is likely due to (1)preferential accretion of subhalos along filaments, often closely aligned withthe major axis of the host halo, and (2) evolution of satellite orbits withinthe prolate, triaxial potentials typical of cdm halos. agreement betweenpredictions and observations requires the major axis of the outer dark matterhalo of the milky way to be nearly perpendicular to the disk. we discusspossible observational tests of such disk-halo alignment with current largegalaxy surveys.

astro-ph;0503511	testing models of supermassive black hole seed formation through gravity  waves	we study the gravitational wave background produced from the formation andassembly of supermassive black holes within the cosmological paradigm ofhierarchical structure formation. in particular, we focus on a supermassiveblack hole formation scenario in which the present-day population ofsupermassive black holes is built from high-mass seed black holes and wecompute the concomitant spectrum of gravitational radiation produced by mergersof the seed black holes. we find that this scenario predicts a large,gravitational wave background that should be resolved into individual sourceswith space interferometers such as the proposed laser interferometric spaceantenna (lisa). the number of inspiral, merger and ringdown events above asignal to noise ratio of 5 that result from massive black hole seeds is oforder 10^3. this prediction is robust and insensitive to several of the detailsof the model. we conclude that an interferometer such as lisa will be able toeffectively rule out or confirm a class of models where supermassive blackholes grow from high-mass seed black holes and may be able to place stronglimits on the role of mergers as a channel for supermassive black hole growth.supermassive black hole seeds likely form in the earliest proto-galacticstructures at high redshift and the masses of supermassive black holes areknown to be strongly correlated with the potentials of the spheroids in whichthey reside, therefore these results imply that space interferometers can beused as a powerful probe of the physics of galaxy formation and proto-galaxyformation at very high redshift.

astro-ph;0508114	the effect of baryons on halo shapes	observational evidence indicates a mismatch between the shapes ofcollisionless dark matter (dm) halos and those of observed systems. usinghydrodynamical cosmological simulations we investigate the effect of baryonicdissipation on halo shapes. we show that dissipational simulations producesignificantly rounder halos than those formed in equivalent dissipationlesssimulations. gas cooling causes an average increase in halo principal axisratios of ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions and a systematic shift that persistsout to the virial radius, alleviating any tension between theory andobservations. although the magnitude of the effect may be overestimated due toovercooling, cluster formation simulations designed to reproduce the observedfraction of cold baryons still produce substantially rounder halos. subhalosalso exhibit a trend of increased axis ratios in dissipational simulations.moreover, we demonstrate that subhalos are generally rounder than correspondingfield halos even in dissipationless simulations. lastly, we analyze a series ofbinary, equal-mass merger simulations of disk galaxies. collisionless mergersreveal a strong correlation between dm halo shape and stellar remnantmorphology. in dissipational mergers, the combination of strong gas inflows andstar formation leads to an increase of the dm axis ratios in the remnant. allof these results highlight the vital role of baryonic processes in comparingtheory with observations and warn against over-interpreting discrepancies withcollisionless simulations on small scales.

astro-ph;0510376	the anisotropic spatial distribution of cdm subhalos	i review recent results on the spatial distribution of substructure in cdmhalos. i show that the spatial distribution of subhalos is anisotropic andgenerally prolate with a long axis that is closely aligned with the long axisof the total mass distribution of the host halo. i show that the correlationbetween the subhalo distribution and the long axis of the host halo is strongboth in dissipationless and dissipational gasdynamical simulations. moremassive subhalos tend to be more strongly clustered along the major axis of thehost halo reflecting filamentary accretion. the anisotropy of subhalos haspotential implications for the interpretation of several observations in thelocal group and beyond. for example, i show that while the mean projected massfraction in substructure in the central regions of cdm halos is fsub \approx0.4%, fsub is a strong function of projection angle and is ~ 5 to 6 timeshigher for projections that are nearly collinear with the major axis of thehost halo.

astro-ph;0510583	the robustness of dark matter density profiles in dissipationless  mergers	we present a comprehensive series of dissipationless n-body simulations toinvestigate the evolution of density distribution in equal-mass mergers betweendark matter (dm) halos and multicomponent galaxies. the dm halo models areconstructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cuspsto core-like profiles and the structural properties of the galaxy models aremotivated by the lcdm paradigm of structure formation. the adopted forceresolution allows robust density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of thevirial radii of the simulated systems. we demonstrate that the central slopesand overall shapes of the remnant density profiles are virtually identical tothose of the initial systems suggesting that the remnants retain a remarkablememory of the density structure of their progenitors, despite the relaxationthat accompanies merger activity. we also find that halo concentrations remainapproximately constant through hierarchical merging involving identical systemsand show that remnants contain significant fractions of their bound mass wellbeyond their formal virial radii. these conclusions hold for a wide variety ofinitial asymptotic density slopes, orbital energies, and encounterconfigurations, including sequences of consecutive merger events, simultaneousmergers of severals ystems, and mergers of halos with embedded cold baryoniccomponents in the form of disks, spheroids, or both. as an immediateconsequence, the net effect of gas cooling, which contracts and steepens theinner density profiles of dm halos, should be preserved through a period ofdissipationless major merging. our results imply that the characteristicuniversal shape of dm density profiles may be set early in the evolution ofhalos.

astro-ph;0512416	the dependence of halo clustering on halo formation history,  concentration, and occupation	we investigate the dependence of dark matter halo clustering on haloformation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number,using high-resolution numerical simulations of a lcdm cosmology. we confirmresults that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time, and thatthis trend depends on halo mass. for the first time, we show unequivocally thathalo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that thedependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accuratelyparameterized in a simple way: b(c,m|z) = b(m|z) b(c|m/m*). the scaling betweenbias and concentration changes sign with the value of m/m*: high concentration(early forming) objects cluster more strongly for m &lt;~ m* while lowconcentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-masshalos, m &gt;~ m*. we show the first explicit demonstration that host dark haloclustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) anddiscuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectraand galaxy clustering statistics. the effect of these halo properties onclustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which aresignificantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. our resultssuggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g. low surface-brightness dwarfs)should have more slowly-rising rotation curves than their clusteredcounterparts, and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies invoids. they also imply that self calibrating richness-selected cluster sampleswith their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and biascosmological parameter estimation.

astro-ph;0604506	close galaxy counts as a probe of hierarchical structure formation	standard lcdm predicts that the major merger rate of galaxy-size dark matterhalos rises rapidly with redshift. the average number of close companions pergalaxy, nc, is often used to infer the galaxy merger rate, however, recentobservational studies suggest that nc evolves very little with redshift. herewe use a "hybrid" n- body simulation plus analytic substructure model topredict nc directly. we identify dark matter subhalos with galaxies and showthat the observed lack of close pair count evolution arises because the highmerger rate per halo at early times is counteracted by a decrease in the numberof halos massive enough to host a galaxy pair. we compare our results to datacompiled from the deep2, ssrs2, and the uzc redshift surveys. observed paircounts match our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxyluminosity and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo had when it wasfirst accreted onto its host halo. this suggests that satellite galaxies aresignificantly more resilient to destruction than are dissipationless darkmatter subhalos. we argue that while nc does not provide a direct measure ofthe halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to constrain the halooccupation distribution and the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos.interpreted in this way, close pair counts provide a useful test of galaxyformation processes on &lt; 100 kpc scales.

astro-ph;0608190	formation of z ~ 6 quasars from hierarchical galaxy mergers	the discovery of luminous quasars at redshift z ~ 6 indicates the presence ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) of mass ~10^9 msun when the universe was lessthan one billion years old. this finding presents several challenges fortheoretical models. here, we present the first multi-scale simulations that,together with a self-regulated model for the smbh growth, produce a luminousquasar at z ~ 6.5 in the lcdm paradigm. we follow the hierarchical assemblyhistory of the most massive halo in a ~ 3 gpc^3 volume, and find that this haloof ~ 8x 10^{12} msun forming at z ~ 6.5 after several major mergers is able toreproduce a number of observed properties of sdss j1148+5251, the most distantquasar detected at z =6.42 (fan et al. 2003). moreover, the smbhs grow throughgas accretion below the eddington limit in a self-regulated manner owing tofeedback. we find that the progenitors experience significant star formation(up to 10^4 msun/yr) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellarmass of the quasar host reaches 10^{12} msun at z ~ 6.5, consistent withobservations of significant metal enrichment in sdss j1148+5251. our resultsprovide a viable formation mechanism for z ~ 6 quasars in the standard lcdmcosmology, and demonstrate a common, merger-driven origin for the rarestquasars and the fundamental smbh-host correlation in a hierarchicaluniverse.(abridged)

astro-ph;0703004	shredded galaxies as the source of diffuse intrahalo light on varying  scales	we make predictions for diffuse stellar mass fractions in dark matter halosfrom the scales of small spiral galaxies to those of large galaxy clusters. weuse an extensively-tested analytic model for subhalo infall and evolution andempirical constraints from galaxy survey data to set the stellar mass in eachaccreted subhalo to model diffuse light. we add stellar mass to the diffuselight as subhalos become disrupted due to interactions within their host halos.we predict that the stellar mass fraction in diffuse, intrahalo light shouldrise on average from ~0.5% to approximately 20% from small galaxy halos to poorgroups. the trend with mass flattens considerably beyond the group scale,increasing weakly from a fraction of ~20% in poor galaxy clusters (~10^14m_sun) to roughly ~30% in massive clusters (~10^15 m_sun). the mass-dependentdiffuse light fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that themass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass.galaxy halos have little diffuse light because they accrete most of their massin small subhalos that themselves have high mass-to-light ratios; stellar halosaround galaxies are built primarily from disrupted dwarf-irregular-typegalaxies with m*~10^8.5 m_sun. the diffuse light in group and cluster halos isbuilt from satellite galaxies that form stars efficiently and havecorrespondingly low mass-to-light ratios; intracluster light is dominated bymaterial liberated from massive galaxies with m*~10^11 m_sun. our results areconsistent with existing observations spanning the galaxy, group, and clusterscale; however, they can be tested more rigorously in future deep surveys forfaint diffuse light.

astro-ph;0703741	effects of baryons and dissipation on the matter power spectrum	we study the importance of baryonic physics on predictions of the matterpower spectrum as it is relevant for forthcoming weak lensing surveys. wequantify the impact of baryonic physics using a set of three cosmologicalnumerical simulations. each simulation has the same initial density field, butmodels a different set of physical processes. the first simulation evolves thedensity field using gravity alone, the second includes non-radiativegasdynamics, and the third includes radiative heating and cooling of baryons,star formation, and supernova feedback. we find that baryonic processes alterpredictions for the matter power spectrum significantly relative to models thatinclude only gravitational interactions. our results imply that future weaklensing experiments such as lsst and snap will be very sensitive to thepoorly-understood physics governing the nonlinear evolution of the baryoniccomponent of the universe. the net effect is significantly larger in the caseof the model with cooling and star formation, in which case our results implythat contemporary surveys such as the cfht wide survey may also be sensitive tobaryonic processes. in particular, this effect could be important for forecastsof the constraining power of future surveys if information from scales largerthan l ~ 1000 is included in the analysis. we find that deviations are causedprimarily by the rearrangement of matter within individual dark matter halosrelative to the gravity-only case, rather than a large-scale rearrangement ofmatter. consequently, we propose a simple model, based on the phenomenologicalhalo model of dark matter clustering, for baryonic effects that can be used toaid in the interpretation of forthcoming weak lensing data.

0812.0358	utilizing type ia supernovae in a large, fast, imaging survey to  constrain dark energy	we study the utility of a large sample of type ia supernovae that might beobserved in an imaging survey that rapidly scans a large fraction of the skyfor constraining dark energy. we consider information from the traditionalluminosity distance test as well as the spread in sneia fluxes at fixedredshift induced by gravitational lensing. we include a treatment ofphotometric redshift uncertainties in our analysis. our primary result is thatthe information contained in the mean distance moduli of sneia and thedispersion among sneia distance moduli complement each other, breaking adegeneracy between the present dark energy equation of state and its timevariation without the need for a high-redshift supernova sample. to addressphotometric redshift uncertainties, we present dark energy constraints as afunction of the size of an external set of spectroscopically-observed sneiathat may be used for redshift calibration, nspec. we find that an imagingsurvey can constrain the dark energy equation of state at the epoch where it isbest constrained with a 1-sigma error of sigma(wpiv)~0.03-0.09$, depending uponvarious assumptions. in addition, the marginal improvement in the errorsigma(wpiv) from an increase in the spectroscopic calibration sample drops oncenspec ~ 10^3. this result is important because it is of the order of the sizeof calibration samples likely to be compiled in the coming decade and because,for samples of this size, the spectroscopic and imaging surveys individuallyplace comparable constraints on the dark energy equation of state. in allcases, it is best to calibrate photometric redshifts with a set ofspectroscopically-observed sneia with relatively more objects at high redshiftthan the parent sample of imaging sneia.
