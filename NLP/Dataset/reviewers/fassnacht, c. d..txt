0902.2963	dark matter structures in the universe: prospects for optical astronomy  in the next decade	the cold dark matter theory of gravitationally-driven hierarchical structureformation has earned its status as a paradigm by explaining the distribution ofmatter over large spans of cosmic distance and time. however, its centraltenet, that most of the matter in the universe is dark and exotic, is stillunproven; the dark matter hypothesis is sufficiently audacious as to continueto warrant a diverse battery of tests. while local searches for dark matterparticles or their annihilation signals could prove the existence of thesubstance itself, studies of cosmological dark matter in situ are vital tofully understand its role in structure formation and evolution. we argue thatgravitational lensing provides the cleanest and farthest-reaching probe of darkmatter in the universe, which can be combined with other observationaltechniques to answer the most challenging and exciting questions that willdrive the subject in the next decade: what is the distribution of mass onsub-galactic scales? how do galaxy disks form and bulges grow in dark matterhalos? how accurate are cdm predictions of halo structure? can we distinguishbetween a need for a new substance (dark matter) and a need for new physics(departures from general relativity)? what is the dark matter made of anyway?we propose that the central tool in this program should be a wide-field opticalimaging survey, whose true value is realized with support in the form ofhigh-resolution, cadenced optical/infra-red imaging, and massive-throughputoptical spectroscopy.

0902.3186	strong gravitational lensing as a probe of gravity, dark-matter and  super-massive black holes	whereas considerable effort has been afforded in understanding the propertiesof galaxies, a full physical picture, connecting their baryonic and dark-mattercontent, super-massive black holes, and (metric) theories of gravity, is stillill-defined. strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probegravity in the central regions of galaxies. it can (1) provide a uniquedetection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detectionexperiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe centralsuper-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxyformation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of thenature and state of dark matter. to seriously address the above questions, aconsiderable increase in the number of strong gravitational-lens systems isrequired. in the timeframe 2010-2020, a staged approach with radio (e.g. evla,e-merlin, lofar, ska phase-i) and optical (e.g. lsst and jdem) instruments canprovide 10^(2-4) new lenses, and up to 10^(4-6) new lens systems fromska/lsst/jdem all-sky surveys around ~2020. follow-up imaging of (radio) lensesis necessary with moderate ground/space-based optical-ir telescopes and with30-50m telescopes for spectroscopy (e.g. tmt, gmt, elt). to answer thesefundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investmentin large radio and optical-ir facilities is therefore critical in the comingdecade. in particular, only large-scale radio lens surveys (e.g. with ska)provide the large numbers of high-resolution and high-fidelity images of lensesneeded for smbh and flux-ratio anomaly studies.

0905.2982	identifying compact symmetric objects from the vlba imaging and  polarization survey	compact symmetric objects (csos) are small (less than 1 kpc) radio sourceswhich have symmetric double lobes or jets. the dominant theory for the smallsize of these objects is that they are young radio sources which could growinto larger radio galaxies, but the currently small population of known csosmakes it difficult to definitively determine whether or not this is the case.while a greater number of gigahertz peaked sources can be identified by siftingthrough spectral surveys, this yields none of the dynamics of the sources, andalso brings quasars into the sample, which although interesting are peakedaround 1 gigahertz for very different reasons. we have used the 5 ghz vlbaimaging and polarization survey (vips) to identify 103 cso candidatesmorphologically, and are following up on these sources with multifrequency vlbaobservations to confirm cso identifications and to study their dynamics. theidentification of candidates from within the survey will be discussed, as wellas preliminary results from the follow-up observations.

0909.4301	galaxy number counts and implications for strong lensing	we compare galaxy number counts in hst/acs fields containingmoderate-redshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0) strong gravitational lenses with those in twocontrol samples: (1) the first square degree of the cosmos survey, comprising259 acs fields and (2) 20 "pure parallel" fields randomly located on the sky.through a bayesian analysis we determine the expectation values (mu_0) andconfidence levels of the underlying number counts for a range of apertures andmagnitude bins. our analysis has produced the following results: (i) we inferthat our control samples are not consistent, with the number counts in thecosmos sample being significantly higher than in the pure parallel sample for21 &lt;= f814w &lt;= 23. this result matches those found in previous analyses ofcosmos data using different techniques. (ii) we find that small-size apertures,centered on strong lenses, are overdense compared with randomly placedapertures in the control samples, even compared to the cosmos sample.correcting for the local clustering of elliptical galaxies, based on theaverage two-point correlation function reduces this overdensity to the 1-2sigma level. thus, the overdensity of galaxies seen along a typical line ofsight to a lens can be explained mostly by the natural clustering of galaxies,rather than being due to lenses lying along otherwise biased lines of sight.however, a larger sample of lenses is needed to see if the remaining biaspersists when the lens-field uncertainties are smaller. (iii) there isconsiderable scatter in the lines of sight to _individual_ lens systems, butquantities that are linearly dependent on the external convergence (e.g., h_0)should become unbiased if the extra galaxies that cause the bias can beaccounted for in the lens models either through direct modeling or via aninformed prior on the external convergence. the number counts can used to setsuch an informed prior.

0910.1133	the mass distribution of a moderate redshift galaxy group and brightest  group galaxy from gravitational lensing and kinematics	the gravitational lens system class b2108+213 has two radio-loud lensedimages separated by 4.56 arcsec. the relatively large image separation impliesthat the lensing is caused by a group of galaxies. in this paper, new opticalimaging and spectroscopic data for the lensing galaxies of b2108+213 and thesurrounding field galaxies are presented. these data are used to investigatethe mass and composition of the lensing structure. the redshift and stellarvelocity dispersion of the main lensing galaxy (g1) are found to be z = 0.3648+/- 0.0002 and sigma_v = 325 +/- 25 km/s, respectively. the optical spectrum ofthe lensed quasar shows no obvious emission or absorption features and isconsistent with a bl lac type radio source. however, the tentative detection ofthe g-band and mg-b absorption lines, and a break in the spectrum of the hostgalaxy of the lensed quasar gives a likely source redshift of z = 0.67.spectroscopy of the field around b2108+213 finds 51 galaxies at a similarredshift to g1, thus confirming that there is a much larger structure at z ~0.365 associated with this system. the width of the group velocity distributionis 694 +/- 93 km/s, but is non-gaussian, implying that the structure is not yetviralized. the main lensing galaxy is also the brightest group member and has asurface brightness profile consistent with a typical cd galaxy. a lensing anddynamics analysis of the mass distribution, which also includes the newly foundgroup members, finds that the logarithmic slope of the mass density profile ison average isothermal inside the einstein radius, but steeper at the locationof the einstein radius. this apparent change in slope can be accounted for ifan external convergence gradient, representing the underlying parent halo ofthe galaxy group, is included in the mass model.

0910.2773	dissecting the gravitational lens b1608+656. ii. precision measurements  of the hubble constant, spatial curvature, and the dark energy equation of  state	strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between themultiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to thelens, and thus the hubble constant. we present a bayesian analysis of thestrong gravitational lens system b1608+656, incorporating (i) new, deep hubblespace telescope (hst) observations, (ii) a new velocity dispersion measurementof 260+/-15 km/s for the primary lens galaxy, and (iii) an updated study of thelens' environment. when modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lensgalaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitlyinclude the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma' and theexternal convergence kappa_ext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigningwell-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors intostatistical ones. the hst images provide one such prior, constraining the lensmass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma'=2.08+/-0.03; a combinationof numerical simulations and photometric observations of the b1608+656 fieldprovides an estimate of the prior for kappa_ext: 0.10 +0.08/-0.05. this latterdistribution dominates the final uncertainty on h_0. compared with previouswork on this system, the new data provide an increase in precision of more thana factor of two. in combination with the wmap 5-year data set, we find that theb1608+656 data set constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 &lt; omega_k &lt;0.009 (95% cl), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the currenttype ia sne sample. asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, incombination with wmap, h_0 = 69.7 +4.9/-5.0 km/s/mpc and w=-0.94 +0.17/-0.19(68% cl), suggesting that the observations of b1608+656 constrain w as tightlyas do the current baryon acoustic oscillation data.

1011.6604	a method for efficient measurement of gravitational lens time delays	the hubble constant value is currently known to 10% accuracy unlessassumptions are made for the cosmology (sandage et al. 2006). gravitationallens systems provide another probe of the hubble constant using time delaymeasurements. however, current investigations of ~20 time delay lenses, albeitof varying levels of sophistication, have resulted in different values of thehubble constant ranging from 50-80 km/s/mpc. in order to reduce uncertainties,more time delay measurements are essential together with better determined massmodels (oguri 2007, saha et al. 2006). we propose a more efficient techniquefor measuring time delays which does not require regular monitoring with ahigh-resolution interferometer array. the method uses double image andlong-axis quadruple lens systems in which the brighter component varies firstand dominates the total flux density. monitoring the total flux density withlow-resolution but high sensitivity radio telescopes provides the variation ofthe brighter image and is used to trigger high-resolution observations whichcan then be used to see the variation in the fainter image. we presentsimulations of this method together with a pilot project using the wsrt(westerbork radio synthesis telescope) to trigger vla (very large array)observations. this new method is promising for measuring time delays because ituses relatively small amounts of time on high-resolution telescopes. this willbe important because many ska pathfinder telescopes, such as meerkat (karooarray telescope) and askap (australian square kilometre array pathfinder), havehigh sensitivity but limited resolution.

1102.1426	luminous satellites of early-type galaxies i: spatial distribution	we study the spatial distribution of faint satellites of intermediateredshift (0.1&lt;z&lt;0.8), early-type galaxies, selected from the goods fields. wecombine high resolution hst images and state-of-the-art host subtractiontechniques to detect satellites of unprecedented faintness and proximity tointermediate redshift host galaxies (up to 5.5 magnitudes fainter and as closeas 0."5/2.5 kpc to the host centers). we model the spatial distribution ofobjects near the hosts as a combination of an isotropic, homogenousbackground/foreground population and a satellite population with a power lawradial profile and an elliptical angular distribution. we detect a significantpopulation of satellites, ns =1.7 (+0.9,-0.8) that is comparable to the numberof milky way satellites with similar host-satellite contrast.the averageprojected radial profile of the satellite distribution is isothermal, gamma_p=-1.0(+0.3,-0.4), which is consistent with the observed central mass densityprofile of massive early-type galaxies. furthermore, the satellite distributionis highly anisotropic (isotropy is ruled out at a &gt;99.99% confidence level).defining phi to be the offset between the major axis of the satellite spatialdistribution and the major axis of the host light profile, we find a maximumposterior probability of phi = 0 and |phi| less than 42 degrees at the 68%confidence level. the alignment of the satellite distribution with the light ofthe host is consistent with simulations, assuming that light traces mass forthe host galaxy as observed for lens galaxies. the anisotropy of the satellitepopulation enhances its ability to produce the flux ratio anomalies observed ingravitationally lensed quasars.

1110.2536	disentangling baryons and dark matter in the spiral gravitational lens  b1933+503	measuring the relative mass contributions of luminous and dark matter inspiral galaxies is important for understanding their formation and evolution.the combination of a galaxy rotation curve and strong lensing is a powerful wayto break the disk-halo degeneracy that is inherent in each of the methodsindividually. we present an analysis of the 10-image radio spiral lensb1933+503 at z_l=0.755, incorporating (1) new global vlbi observations, (2) newadaptive-optics assisted k-band imaging, (3) new spectroscopic observations forthe lens galaxy rotation curve and the source redshift. we construct athree-dimensionally axisymmetric mass distribution with 3 components: anexponential profile for the disk, a point mass for the bulge, and an nfwprofile for the halo. the mass model is simultaneously fitted to the kinematicsand the lensing data. the nfw halo needs to be oblate with a flattening ofa/c=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.05} to be consistent with the radio data. this suggeststhat baryons are effective at making the halos oblate near the center. thelensing and kinematics analysis probe the inner ~10 kpc of the galaxy, and weobtain a lower limit on the halo scale radius of 16 kpc (95% ci). the darkmatter mass fraction inside a sphere with a radius of 2.2 disk scale lengths isf_{dm,2.2}=0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}. the contribution of the disk to the totalcircular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths is 0.76^{+0.05}_{-0.06}, suggestingthat the disk is marginally submaximal. the stellar mass of the disk from ourmodeling is log_{10}(m_{*}/m_{sun}) = 11.06^{+0.09}_{-0.11} assuming that thecold gas contributes ~20% to the total disk mass. in comparison to the stellarmasses estimated from stellar population synthesis models, the stellar initialmass function of chabrier is preferred to that of salpeter by a probabilityfactor of 7.2.

1201.3643	gravitational detection of a low-mass dark satellite at cosmological  distance	the mass-function of dwarf satellite galaxies that are observed around localgroup galaxies substantially differs from simulations based on cold darkmatter: the simulations predict many more dwarf galaxies than are seen. thelocal group, however, may be anomalous in this regard. a massive dark satellitein an early-type lens galaxy at z = 0.222 was recently found using a new methodbased on gravitational lensing, suggesting that the mass fraction contained insubstructure could be higher than is predicted from simulations. the lack ofvery low mass detections, however, prohibited any constraint on their massfunction. here we report the presence of a 1.9 +/- 0.1 x 10^8 m_sun darksatellite in the einstein-ring system jvas b1938+666 at z = 0.881, where m_sundenotes solar mass. this satellite galaxy has a mass similar to the sagittariusgalaxy, which is a satellite of the milky way. we determine the logarithmicslope of the mass function for substructure beyond the local universe to bealpha = 1.1^+0.6_-0.4, with an average mass-fraction of f = 3.3^+3.6_-1.8 %, bycombining data on both of these recently discovered galaxies. our results areconsistent with the predictions from cold dark matter simulations at the 95 percent confidence level, and therefore agree with the view that galaxies formedhierarchically in a universe composed of cold dark matter.

0712.1145	probing a massive radio galaxy with gravitational lensing	the gravitational lens system class b2108+213 has two lensed images separatedby 4.56 arcsec. such a wide image separation suggests that the lens is either amassive galaxy, or is composed of a group of galaxies. to investigate thestructure of the lensing potential we have carried out new high resolutionimaging of the two lensed images at 1.7 ghz with the vlba and at 5 ghz withglobal vlbi. compact and extended emission is detected from the two lensedimages, which provides additional constraints to the lensing mass model. wefind that the data are consistent with either a single lensing galaxy, or a twogalaxy lens model that takes account of a nearby companion to the main lensinggalaxy within the einstein radius of the system. however, for an ensemble ofglobal power-law mass models, those with density profiles steeper thanisothermal are a better fit. the best-fitting profile for a single sphericalmass model has a slope of $\gamma=$~2.45$_{-0.18}^{+0.19}$. the system also hasa third radio component which is coincident with the main lensing galaxy. thiscomponent is detected at milli-arcsecond scales for the first time by the 1.7ghz vlba and 5 ghz global vlbi imaging. however, the third radio component isfound not to be consistent with a core lensed image because the radio spectrumdiffers from the two lensed images, and its flux-density is too high whencompared to what is expected from simple mass models with a variable power-lawdensity profile and/or a reasonable core radius. furthermore, 1.4 ghz imagingof the system with the merlin finds extended lobe emission on either side ofthe main lensing galaxy. therefore, the radio emission from the third radiocomponent is almost certainly from an agn within the main lensing galaxy, whichis classified as an fr i type radio source.

1306.1272	dark energy with gravitational lens time delays	strong lensing gravitational time delays are a powerful and cost effectiveprobe of dark energy. recent studies have shown that a single lens can providea distance measurement with 6-7 % accuracy (including random and systematicuncertainties), provided sufficient data are available to determine the timedelay and reconstruct the gravitational potential of the deflector.gravitational-time delays are a low redshift (z~0-2) probe and thus allow oneto break degeneracies in the interpretation of data from higher-redshift probeslike the cosmic microwave background in terms of the dark energy equation ofstate. current studies are limited by the size of the sample of known lensedquasars, but this situation is about to change. even in this decade, wide fieldimaging surveys are likely to discover thousands of lensed quasars, enablingthe targeted study of ~100 of these systems and resulting in substantial gainsin the dark energy figure of merit. in the next decade, a further order ofmagnitude improvement will be possible with the 10000 systems expected to bedetected and measured with lsst and euclid. to fully exploit these gains, weidentify three priorities. first, support for the development of softwarerequired for the analysis of the data. second, in this decade, small robotictelescopes (1-4m in diameter) dedicated to monitoring of lensed quasars willtransform the field by delivering accurate time delays for ~100 systems. third,in the 2020's, lsst will deliver 1000's of time delays; the bottleneck willinstead be the aquisition and analysis of high resolution imaging follow-up.thus, the top priority for the next decade is to support fast high resolutionimaging capabilities, such as those enabled by the james webb space telescopeand next generation adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes.

1402.1496	detection of substructure with adaptive optics integral field  spectroscopy of the gravitational lens b1422+231	strong gravitational lenses can be used to detect low mass subhalos, based ondeviations in image fluxes and positions from what can be achieved with asmooth mass distribution. so far, this method has been limited by the smallnumber of (radio-loud, microlensing free) systems which can be analysed for thepresence of substructure. using the gravitational lens b1422+231, wedemonstrate that adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy can also be usedto detect dark substructures. we analyse data obtained with osiris on the kecki telescope, using a bayesian method that accounts for uncertainties relatingto the point spread function and image positions in the separate exposures. thenarrow-line [oiii] fluxes measured for the lensed images are consistent withthose measured in the radio, and show a significant deviation from what wouldbe expected in a smooth mass distribution, consistent with the presence of aperturbing low mass halo. detailed lens modelling shows that image fluxes andpositions are fit significantly better when the lens is modelled as a systemcontaining a single perturbing subhalo in addition to the main halo, ratherthan by the main halo on its own, indicating the significant detection ofsubstructure.the inferred mass of the subhalo depends on the subhalo massdensity profile: the 68% confidence interval for the perturber mass within 600pc are: 8.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$, 8.2$^{+0.6}_{-1}$ and 7.6$\pm0.3$$\log_{10}$[m$_{\rm{sub}}$/m$_\odot$] respectively for a singular isothermalsphere, a pseudo-jaffe, and an nfw mass profile. this method can extend thestudy of flux ratio anomalies to virtually all quadruply imaged quasars, andtherefore offers great potential to improve the determination of the subhalomass function in the near future.

1403.4986	measuring gravitational lens time delays using low-resolution radio  monitoring observations	obtaining lensing time delay measurements requires long-term monitoringcampaigns with a high enough resolution (&lt; 1 arcsec) to separate the multipleimages. in the radio, a limited number of high-resolution interferometer arraysmake these observations difficult to schedule. to overcome this problem, wepropose a technique for measuring gravitational time delays which relies onmonitoring the total flux density with low-resolution but high-sensitivityradio telescopes to follow the variation of the brighter image. this is thenused to trigger high-resolution observations in optimal numbers which thenreveal the variation in the fainter image. we present simulations to assess theefficiency of this method together with a pilot project observing radio lenssystems with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) to trigger verylarge array (vla) observations. this new method is promising for measuring timedelays because it uses relatively small amounts of time on high-resolutiontelescopes. this will be important because instruments that have highsensitivity but limited resolution, together with an optimum usage of followuphigh-resolution observations from appropriate radio telescopes may in thefuture be useful for gravitational lensing time delay measurements by means ofthis new method.

0804.2827	dissecting the gravitational lens b1608+656. i. lens potential  reconstruction	strong gravitational lensing is a powerful technique for probing galaxy massdistributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. we present a pixelatedapproach to modeling simultaneously the lens potential and source intensity ofstrong gravitational lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions.for systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensedimages are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in thereconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. we applythis potential reconstruction technique to deep hst observations of b1608+656,a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lensgalaxies. we present a comprehensive bayesian analysis of the system that takesinto account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, andthe interacting lens galaxies. our approach allows us to compare various modelsof the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function(psf), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lenspotential. using optimal combinations of the psf, dust, and lens galaxy lightmodels, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extendedsource-intensity distribution of b1608+656. the resulting reconstruction can beused as the basis of a measurement of the hubble constant. we use ourreconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relativedistribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. we find that themass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0+/-0.2)h m_{\sun}l_{b,\sun}^{-1} within the einstein radius 3.9 h^{-1} kpc, in agreement withwhat is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales.

astro-ph;0211073	the cosmic lens all-sky survey: i. source selection and observations	the cosmic lens all-sky survey (class) is an international collaborativeprogram which has obtained high-resolution radio images of over 10000flat-spectrum radio sources in order to create the largest and best studiedstatistical sample of radio-loud gravitationally lensed systems. with thissurvey, combined with detailed studies of the lenses found therein, constraintscan be placed on the expansion rate, matter density, and dark energy (e.g.cosmological constant, quintessence) content of the universe that arecomplementary to and independent of those obtained through other methods. classis aimed at identifying lenses where multiple images are formed from compactflat-spectrum radio sources, which should be easily identifiable in the radiomaps. because class is radio-based, dust obscuration in lensing galaxies is nota factor, and the relative insensitivity of the instrument to environmentalconditions leads to nearly uniform sensitivity and resolution over the entiresurvey. in four observing seasons from 1994-1999, class has observed 13783radio sources with the vla at 8.4 ghz at 0.2 arcsecond resolution. whencombined with the jvas survey, the class sample contains over 16,000 images. acomplete sample of 11685 flat-spectrum sources was observed, selected from gb6catalogue at 4.85 ghz and the nvss at 1.4 ghz. so far, class has found 16 newgravitational lens systems, and the jvas/class survey contains a total of 22lenses.

astro-ph;0506193	faint radio sources in the noao bootes field. vlba imaging and optical  identifications	as a step toward investigating the parsec-scale properties of faintextragalactic radio sources, the very long baseline array (vlba) was used at5.0 ghz to obtain phase-referenced images of 76 sources in the noao bootesfield. these 76 sources were selected from the first catalog to have peak fluxdensities above 10 mjy at 5 arcsec resolution and deconvolved major diametersof less than 3 arcsec at 1.4 ghz. fifty-seven of these faint radio sources wereidentified with accretion-powered radio galaxies and quasars brighter than 25.5mag in the optical i band. on vla scales at 1.4 ghz, a measure of thecompactness of the faint sources (the ratio of the peak flux density from firstto the integrated flux density from the nvss catalog) spans the full range ofpossibilites arising from source-resolution effects. thirty of the faint radiosources, or 39 +9/-7%, were detected with the vlba at 5.0 ghz with peak fluxdensities above 6 sigma ~2 mjy at 2 mas resolution. the vlba detections occurthrough the full range of compactness ratios. the stronger vlba detections canthemselves serve as phase-reference calibrators, boding well for opening upmuch of the radio sky to vlba imaging. for the adopted cosmology, the vlbaresolution correponds to 17 pc or finer. most vlba detections are unresolved orslightly resolved but one is diffuse and five show either double or core-jetstructures; the properties of these latter six are discussed in detail. threevlba detections are unidentified and fainter than 25.5 mag in the optical iband; their properties are highlighted because they likely markoptically-obscured active nuclei at high redshift.

astro-ph;0510728	mass along the line of sight to the gravitational lens b1608+656: galaxy  groups and implications for h_0	we report the discovery of four groups of galaxies along the line of sight tothe b1608+656 gravitational lens system. one group is at the redshift of theprimary lensing galaxy (z = 0.631) and appears to have a low mass, with eightspectroscopically-confirmed members and an estimated velocity dispersion of150+/-60 km/s. the three other groups are in the foreground of the lens. thesegroups contain ~10 confirmed members each, and are located at redshifts of0.265, 0.426, and 0.520. two of the three additional groups are centeredroughly on the lens system, while the third is centered ~1 arcminute south ofthe lens. we find that each group provides an external convergence (kappa_ext)of ~0.005--0.060, depending on the assumptions made in calculating theconvergence. for lens systems where no additional observables that can breakthe mass-sheet degeneracy exist, the determination of h_0 will be biased highby a factor of (1-kappa_ext)^{-1} if the external convergence is not properlyincluded in the model. for the b1608+656 system, the stellar velocitydispersion of the lensing galaxy has been measured, thus breaking themass-sheet degeneracy due to the group that is physically associated with thelens. the effect of the other groups along the line of sight can be folded intothe overall uncertainties due to large-scale structure (lss) along the line ofsight. because the b1608+656 system appears to lie along an overdense line ofsight, the lss will cause the measurement of h_0 to be biased high for thissystem. the systematic bias introduced by lss could be 5% or greater.(abridged)

astro-ph;0603445	three gravitational lenses for the price of one: enhanced strong lensing  through galaxy clustering	we report the serendipitous discovery of two strong gravitational lenscandidates (acs j160919+6532 and acs j160910+6532) in deep images obtained withthe advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope, each less than40 arcsec from the previously known gravitational lens system class b1608+656.the redshifts of both lens galaxies have been measured with keck and gemini:one is a member of a small galaxy group at z~0.63, which also includes thelensing galaxy in the b1608+656 system, and the second is a member of aforeground group at z~0.43. by measuring the effective radii and surfacebrightnesses of the two lens galaxies, we infer their velocity dispersionsbased on the passively evolving fundamental plane (fp) relation. ellipticalisothermal lens mass models are able to explain their image configurationswithin the lens hypothesis, with a velocity dispersion compatible with thatestimated from the fp for a reasonable source-redshift range. based on thelarge number of massive early-type galaxies in the field and the number-densityof faint blue galaxies, the presence of two additional lens systems aroundclass b1608+656 is not unlikely in hindsight. gravitational lens galaxies arepredominantly early-type galaxies, which are clustered, and the lensed quasarhost galaxies are also clustered. therefore, obtaining deep high-resolutionimages of the fields around known strong lens systems is an excellent method ofenhancing the probability of finding additional strong gravitational lenssystems.

astro-ph;0611215	high resolution imaging of the anomalous flux-ratio gravitational lens  system class b2045+265: dark or luminous satellites?	the existence of flux-ratio anomalies between fold and cusp images ingalaxy-scale strong-lens systems has led to an interpretation based on thepresence of a high mass-fraction of cold-dark-matter (cdm) substructures aroundgalaxies, as predicted by numerical n-body simulations. the flux-ratio anomalyis particularly evident in the radio-loud quadruple gravitational lens systemclass b2045+265. in this paper, new high-resolution radio, optical, andinfrared imaging of b2045+265 is presented which sheds more light on thisanomaly and its possible causes. first, deep very long baseline arrayobservations show very compact images, possibly with a hint of a jet, but withno evidence for differential scattering or scatter broadening. second, opticaland infrared observations with the hubble space telescope and throughadaptive-optics imaging with the w. m. keck telescope, show a previouslyundiscovered object -- interpreted as a (tidally disrupted) dwarf satellitebased on its colours and slight extension -- between the main lens galaxy andthe three anomalous flux-ratio images. third, colour variations in theearly-type lens galaxy indicate recent star-formation, possibly the result ofsecondary infall of gas-rich satellites. a population of such galaxies aroundthe lens system could explain the previously discovered strong [o ii] emission.however, spiral structure and/or normal star formation in the lens galaxycannot be excluded. in light of these new data, we propose a lens model for thesystem, including the observed dwarf satellite, which reproduces all positionaland flux-ratio constraints, without the need for additional cdm substructure.[abridged]

astro-ph;9804136	lensing galaxies: light or dark?	in a recent paper, hawkins (1997) argues on the basis of statistical studiesof double-image gravitational lenses and lens candidates that a largepopulation of dark lenses exists and that these outnumber galaxies with morenormal mass-to-light ratios by a factor of 3:1. if correct, this is a veryimportant result for many areas of astronomy including galaxy formation andcosmology. in this paper we discuss our new radio-selected gravitational lenssample, jvas/class, in order to test and constrain this proposition. we haveobtained ground-based and hst images of all multiple-image lens systems in oursample and in 12 cases out of 12 we find the lensing galaxies in the opticaland/or near infrared. our success in finding lensing galaxies creates problemsfor the dark lens hypothesis. if it is to survive, ad hoc modifications seem tobe necessary: only very massive galaxies (more than about one trillion solarmasses) can be dark, and the cutoff in mass must be sharp. our finding of lensgalaxies in all the jvas/class systems is complementary evidence which supportsthe conclusion of kochanek et al. (1997) that many of the wide-separationoptically-selected pairs are physically distinct quasars rather thangravitational lens systems.

astro-ph;9811167	b2045+265: a new four-image gravitational lens from class	we have discovered a new gravitational lens in the cosmic lens all-sky survey(class). b2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9arcsec. a fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and itspositional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy stronglysuggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. this implies that theb2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed byanother flat-spectrum radio source. infrared images detect the lensed images ofthe background source and the lensing galaxy. the lensed images have relativepositions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radiowavelengths. spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and asource redshift of z_s=1.28. the image splitting and system redshifts implythat the projected mass inside the einstein radius of the lensing galaxy ism_e=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun. an estimate of the light emitted inside theeinstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame b band of(m/l_b)_e = 20 h (m/l_b)_sun. both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higherthan what is seen in nearby sa galaxies. in fact, the implied rotation velocityfor the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearbyspirals. the large projected mass inside the einstein ring radius may be theresult of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from acompact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentificationof the source redshift. a simple model of the gravitational potential of thelens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required tosatisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. with furtherobservations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of h_0.

astro-ph;9910523	a keck survey of gravitational lens systems: i. spectroscopy of sbs  0909+532, hst 1411+5211, and class b2319+051	we present new results from a continuing keck program to study gravitationallens systems. we have obtained redshifts for three lens systems, sbs 0909+532,hst 1411+5211, and class b2319+051. for all of these systems, either the sourceor lens redshift (or both) has been previously unidentified. we find (z_l, z_s)= (0.830, 1.377) for sbs 0909+532; (z_l, z_s) = (0.465, 2.811) for hst1411+5211, although the source redshift is still tentative; and (z_l1, z_l2) =(0.624, 0.588) for the two lensing galaxies in class b2319+051. the backgroundradio source in b2319+051 has not been detected optically; its redshift is,therefore, still unknown. we find that the spectral features of the centrallensing galaxy in all three systems are typical of an early-type galaxy. theobserved image splittings in sbs 0909+532 and hst 1411+5211 imply that themasses within the einstein ring radii of the lensing galaxies are 1.4 x 10^{11}and 2.0 x 10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun, respectively. the resulting b bandmass-to-light ratio for hst 1411+5211 is 41.3 +/- 1.2 h (m/l)_sun, a factor of5 times higher than the average early-type lensing galaxy. this largemass-to-light is almost certainly the result of the additional masscontribution from the cluster cl 3c295 at z = 0.46. for the lensing galaxy insbs 0909+532, we measure (m/l)_b = 4^{+11}_{-3} h (m/l)_sun where the largeerrors are the result of significant uncertainty in the galaxy luminosity.while we cannot measure directly the mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxyin b2319+051, we estimate that (m/l)_b is between 3-7 h (m/l)_sun.

astro-ph;9912188	redshifts and neutral hydrogen observations of compact symmetric objects  in the coins sample	compact symmetric objects (csos) are young radio galaxies whose jet axes lieclose to the plane of the sky, and whose appearance is therefore not dominatedby relativistic beaming effects. the small linear sizes of csos make themvaluable for studies of both the evolution of radio galaxies and testingunified schemes for active galactic nuclei (agn). a parsec-scale region of gassurrounding the central engine is predicted by both accretion and obscurationscenarios. working surfaces, or ``hot spots,'' and the radio jets of csos areclose enough to the central engines that this circumnuclear gas can be seen inabsorption.  the csos observed in the northern sky (coins) sample is comprised of 52 csocandidates identified in three vlbi surveys. of these, 27 have now beenconfirmed as csos. optical redshifts are available in the literature for 28 ofthe cso candidates, and hi absorption has been detected toward four. we presentnew optical spectroscopic redshifts for three of the candidates and summarizethe current status of optical identifications. we further report on thediscovery of hi in absorption towards the cso j1816+3457 and summarize theresults of neutral hydrogen absorption studies of the sources in this sample.
