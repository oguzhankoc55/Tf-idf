0901.2241	from outburst to quiescence: the decay of the transient anomalous x-ray  pulsar xte j1810-197	xte j1810-197 is the first transient anomalous x-ray pulsar ever discovered.its highly variable x-ray flux allowed us to study the timing and spectralemission properties of a magnetar candidate over a flux range of about twoorders of magnitude. we analyzed nine xmm-newton observations of xte j1810-197collected over a four years baseline (september 2003 - september 2007). epic pnand mos data were reduced and used for detailed timing and spectral analysis.pulse phase spectroscopic studies were also carried out for observations withsufficiently high signal to noise. we find that: (i) a three blackbodies modelreproduces the spectral properties of the source over the entire outburststatistically better than the two blackbodies model previously used in theliterature, (ii) the coldest blackbody is consistent with the thermal emissionfrom the whole surface, and has temperature and radius similar to thoseinferred from rosat observations before the outburst onset, (iii) there is aspectral feature around 1.1 kev during six consecutive observations (sincemarch 2005); if due to proton resonant cyclotron scattering, it would imply amagnetic field of around 2e14 g. this is in a very good agreement with thevalue from the spin period measurements.

0901.3453	suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr 0501+4516 in  outburst	we present the first suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr0501+4516, performed on 2008 august 26, four days after the onset of burstingactivity of this new member of the magnetar family. the soft x-ray persistentemission was detected with the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) at a 0.5-10 kevflux of 3.8e-11 erg/s/cm2, with a spectrum well fitted by an absorbed blackbodyplus power-law model. the source pulsation was confirmed at a period of5.762072+/-0.000002 s, and 32 x-ray bursts were detected by the xis, four ofwhich were also detected at higher energies by the hard x-ray detector (hxd).the strongest burst, which occurred at 03:16:16.9 (utc), was so bright that itcaused instrumental saturation, but its precursor phase, lasting for about 200ms, was detected successfully over the 0.5-200 kev range, with a fluence of~2.1e-7 erg/cm2 and a peak intensity of about 89 crab. the entire burst fluenceis estimated to be ~50 times higher. the precursor spectrum was very hard, andwell modeled by a combination of two blackbodies. we discuss the burstingactivity and x/gamma-ray properties of this newly discovered soft gammarepeater in comparison with other members of the class.

0901.3576	vlt/naco near-infrared observations of the transient radio magnetar 1e  1547.0-5408	despite about a decade of observations, very little is known about theoptical and infrared (ir) emission properties of the soft gamma-ray repeaters(sgrs) and of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps), the magnetar candidates, andabout the physical processes which drive their emission at these wavelengths.this is mainly due to the limited number of identifications achieved so far,five in total, and to the sparse spectral coverage obtained from multi-bandoptical/ir photometry. aim of this work is to search for a likely candidatecounterpart to the recently discovered transient radio axp 1e 1547.0-5408. weperformed the first deep near-ir (nir) observations (ks band) of 1e 1547.0-5408with the vlt on three nights (july 8th, 12th, and august 17th), after the x-raysource rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around june 2007.we detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1e1547.0-5408. the faintest of them (object 1) has a brightness k = 20.27 +/-0.05, which would yield an unabsorbed x-ray to nir flux ratio fx/fks ~ 800 for1e 1547.0-5408, i.e. on average lower than those derived for other magnetars.the non-detection of object 1 on the nights of july 8th and august 17th onlyallowed us to set an upper limit of delta ks ~ 0.2 on its nir variability,which prevented us to search for correlations with the radio or x-ray flux. wedetected no other object at the radio position down to a limit of ks ~ 21.7 (at5sigma), computed in our deepest vlt image (july 12th). from our observationswe can not confidently propose a nir counterpart to 1e 1547.0-5408. more nirobservations of object 1, e.g. to determine its colors and to monitorvariability, would be conclusive to determine whether or not it can beconsidered a plausible candidate.

0901.3597	a statistical study of gamma-ray burst afterglows measured by the swift  ultra-violet optical telescope	we present the first statistical analysis of 27 uvot optical/ultra-violetlightcurves of grb afterglows. we have found, through analysis of thelightcurves in the observer's frame, that a significant fraction rise in thefirst 500s after the grb trigger, that all lightcurves decay after 500s,typically as a power-law with a relatively narrow distribution of decayindices, and that the brightest optical afterglows tend to decay the quickest.we find that the rise could either be produced physically by the start of theforward shock, when the jet begins to plough into the external medium, orgeometrically where an off-axis observer sees a rising lightcurve as anincreasing amount of emission enters the observers line of sight, which occursas the jet slows. we find that at 99.8% confidence, there is a correlation, inthe observed frame, between the apparent magnitude of the lightcurves at 400sand the rate of decay after 500s. however, in the rest frame a spearman ranktest shows only a weak correlation of low statistical significance betweenluminosity and decay rate. a correlation should be expected if the afterglowswere produced by off-axis jets, suggesting that the jet is viewed from withinthe half-opening angle theta or within a core of uniform energy densitytheta_c. we also produced logarithmic luminosity distributions for three restframe epochs. we find no evidence for bimodality in any of the distributions.finally, we compare our sample of uvot lightcurves with the xrt lightcurvecanonical model. the range in decay indices seen in uvot lightcurves at anyepoch is most similar to the range in decay of the shallow decay segment of thexrt canonical model. however, in the xrt canonical model there is no indicationof the rising behaviour observed in the uvot lightcurves.

0902.0720	topology of magnetars external field. i. axially symmetric fields	there is an increasing theoretical and observational evidence that theexternal magnetic field of magnetars may contain a toroidal component, likelyof the same order of the poloidal one. such "twisted magnetospheres" arethreaded by currents flowing along the closed field lines which can efficientlyinteract with soft thermal photons via resonant cyclotron scatterings (rcs).actually, rcs spectral models proved quite successful in explaining thepersistent ~1-10 kev emission from the magnetar candidates, the soft gamma-rayrepeaters (sgrs) and the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps). moreover, it has beenproposed that, in presence of highly relativistic electrons, the same processcan give rise to the observed hard x-ray spectral tails extending up to ~200kev. spectral calculations have been restricted up to now to the case of aglobally twisted dipolar magnetosphere, although there are indications that thetwist may be confined only to a portion of the magnetosphere, and/or that thelarge scale field is more complex than a simple dipole. in this paper weinvestigate multipolar, force-free magnetospheres of ultra-magnetized neutronstars. we first discuss a general method to generate multipolar solutions ofthe grad- schluter-shafranov equation, and analyze in detail dipolar,quadrupolar and octupolar fields. the spectra and lightcurves for thesemultipolar, globally twisted fields are then computed using a monte carlo codeand compared with those of a purely dipolar configuration. finally thephase-resolved spectra and energy-dependent lightcurves obtained with a simplemodel of a locally sheared field are confronted with the integral observationsof the axps 1rxs j1708-4009 and 4u 0142+61. results support a picture in whichthe field in these two sources is not globally twisted.

0906.5480	vlt optical observations of the isolated neutron star rx j0420.0-5022	x-ray observations performed with rosat led to the discovery of 7radio-silent isolated neutron stars (inss) which are detected only through therelatively dim and purely thermal x-ray emission from the cooling star surface.a few of these inss (a.k.a. x-ray dim inss, or xdinss) have been also detectedat optical wavelengths where they seem to feature thermal spectra. opticalstudies of xdinss thus play a crucial role in mapping the temperaturedistribution on the neutron star surface and in investigating the existence ofan atmosphere around the neutron star. the aim of this work is to investigatethe optical identification of the xdins rx j0420.0-5022, tentatively proposedby haberl et al. (2004) based on vlt observations. we re-analysed the originalobservations of haberl et al. to assess the detection significance of theproposed counterpart and we performed deeper vlt observations aiming at ahigher confidence detection. with a ~2 sigma detection significance and are-computed flux of b=27.52+/-0.61, we can not rule out that the proposedcounterpart was spurious and produced by the halo of a very bright nearby star.while we could not detect the proposed counterpart in our deeper vltobservations, we found evidence for a marginally significant (~3.9 sigma)detection of a similarly faint object (b= 27.5+/-0.3), ~ 0.5" north of it andcoincident with the updated chandra position of rx j0420.0-5022. interestingly,the angular separation is consistent with the upper limit on the rxj0420.0-5022 proper motion (motch et al. 2009), which suggests that we mighthave actually detected the haberl et al. proposed counterpart. from the flux ofthe putative rx j0420.0-5022 counterpart we can rule out a &gt; 7 optical excesswith respect to the extrapolation of the xmm-newton spectrum.

0907.0054	new limits on radio emission from x-ray dim isolated neutron stars	we have carried out a search for radio emission at 820 mhz from six x-ray dimisolated neutron stars with the robert c. byrd green bank radio telescope. notransient or pulsed emission was found using fast folding, fast fouriertransform, and single-pulse searches. the corresponding flux limits are about0.01 mjy for pulsed emission, depending on the integration time for theparticular source and assuming a duty cycle of 2%, and 20 mjy for singledispersed pulses. these are the most sensitive limits to date on radio emissionfrom x-ray dim isolated neutron stars. there is no evidence for isolated radiopulses, as seen in a class of neutron stars known as rotating radio transients.our results imply that either the radio luminosities of these objects are lowerthan those of any known radio pulsars, or they could simply be long-periodnearby radio pulsars with high magnetic fields beaming away from the earth. totest the latter possibility, we would need around 40 similar sources to providea 1 sigma probability of at least one of them beaming toward us. we also give adetailed description of our implementation of the fast folding algorithm.

0907.2873	spin-down rate and inferred dipole magnetic field of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 1627-41	using chandra data taken on 2008 june, we detected pulsations at 2.59439(4) sin the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41. this is the second measurement ofthe source spin period and allows us to derive for the first time a long-termspin-down rate of (1.9 +/- 0.4)e-11 s/s. from this value we infer for sgr1627-41 a characteristic age of 2.2 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4e+34 erg/s(one of the highest among sources of the same class), and a surface dipolemagnetic field strength of 2e+14 g. these properties confirm the magnetarnature of sgr 1627-41; however, they should be considered with caution sincethey were derived on the basis of a period derivative measurement made usingtwo epochs only and magnetar spin-down rates are generally highly variable. thepulse profile, double-peaked and with a pulsed fraction of (13 +/- 2)% in the2-10 kev range, closely resembles that observed by xmm-newton in 2008september. having for the first time a timing model for this sgr, we alsosearched for a pulsed signal in archival radio data collected with the parkesradio telescope nine months after the previous x-ray outburst. no evidence forradio pulsations was found, down to a luminosity level 10-20 times fainter (fora 10% duty cycle and a distance of 11 kpc) than the peak luminosity shown bythe known radio magnetars.

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

(2007a),namely the canonical absorbed blackbody plus two power-laws, a resonantcyclotron scattering model plus one power-law and two log-parabolic functions.

1006.2950	the 2008 october swift detection of x-ray bursts/outburst from the  transient sgr-like axp 1e 1547.0-5408	we report on the detailed study of the 2008 october outburst from theanomalous x-ray pulsar (axp) 1e 1547.0-5408 discovered through the swift/burstalert telescope (bat) detection of sgr-like short x-ray bursts on 2008 october3. the swift/x-ray telescope (xrt) started observing the source after less than100 s since the bat trigger, when the flux (about 6e-11 erg/cm^2/s in the 2-10kev range) was &gt;50 times higher than its quiescent level. swift monitored theoutbursting activity of 1e 1547.0-5408 on a daily basis for approximately threeweeks. this strategy allowed us to find a phase-coherent solution for thesource pulsations after the burst, which, besides period and period derivative,requires a positive period second derivative term (spin-down increase). thetime evolution of the pulse shape is complex and variable, with the pulsedfraction increasing from 20% to 50% within the swift observational window. thexrt spectra can be fitted well by means of a single component, either apower-law (pl) or a blackbody (bb). during the very initial phases of theoutburst the spectrum is hard, with a pl photon index about 2 (or kt about 1.4kev) which steepens to about 4 (or kt about 0.8 kev) within one day from thebat trigger, though the two components are likely present simultaneously duringthe first day spectra. an integral observation carried out five days after thetrigger provided an upper limit of about 2e-11 erg/cm^2/s to the emission of 1e1547.0-5408 in the 18-60 kev band.

1007.5466	an unified timing and spectral model for the anomalous x-ray pulsars xte  j1810-197 and cxou j164710.2-455216	anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) and soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) are two smallclasses of x-ray sources strongly suspected to host a magnetar, i.e. anultra-magnetized neutron star with $b\approx 10^14-10^15 g. many sgrs/axps areknown to be variable, and recently the existence of genuinely "transient"magnetars was discovered. here we present a comprehensive study of the pulseprofile and spectral evolution of the two transient axps (taxps) xte j1810-197and cxou j164710.2-455216. our analysis was carried out in the framework of thetwisted magnetosphere model for magnetar emission. starting from 3d monte carlosimulations of the emerging spectrum, we produced a large database of syntheticpulse profiles which was fitted to observed lightcurves in different spectralbands and at different epochs. this allowed us to derive the physicalparameters of the model and their evolution with time, together with thegeometry of the two sources, i.e. the inclination of the line-of-sight and ofthe magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis. we then fitted the(phase-averaged) spectra of the two taxps at different epochs using a modelsimilar to that used to calculate the pulse profiles ntzang in xspec) freezingall parameters to the values obtained from the timing analysis, and leavingonly the normalization free to vary. this provided acceptable fits toxmm-newton data in all the observations we analyzed. our results support apicture in which a limited portion of the star surface close to one of themagnetic poles is heated at the outburst onset. the subsequent evolution isdriven both by the cooling/varying size of the heated cap and by a progressiveuntwisting of the magnetosphere.

1105.1323	long-term spectral and timing properties of the soft gamma-ray repeater  sgr 1833-0832 and detection of extended x-ray emission around the radio  pulsar psr b1830-08	sgr 1833-0832 was discovered on 2010 march 19 thanks to the swift detectionof a short hard x-ray burst and follow-up x-ray observations. since then, itwas repeatedly observed with swift, rossi x-ray timing explorer, andxmm-newton. using these data, which span about 225 days, we studied thelong-term spectral and timing characteristics of sgr 1833-0832. we foundevidence for diffuse emission surrounding sgr 1833-0832, which is most likely ahalo produced by the scattering of the point source x-ray radiation by dustalong the line of sight, and we show that the source x-ray spectrum is welldescribed by an absorbed blackbody, with temperature kt=1.2 kev and absorbingcolumn nh=(10.4+/-0.2)e22 cm^-2, while different or more complex models aredisfavoured. the source persistent x-ray emission remained fairly constant atabout 3.7e-12 erg/cm^2/s for the first 20 days after the onset of the burstingepisode, then it faded by a factor 40 in the subsequent 140 days, following apower-law trend with index alpha=-0.5. we obtained a phase-coherent timingsolution with the longest baseline (225 days) to date for this source which,besides period p=7.5654084(4) s and period derivative dp/dt=3.5(3)e-12 s/s,includes higher order period derivatives. we also report on our search of thecounterpart to the sgr at radio frequencies using the australia telescopecompact array and the parkes radio telescope. no evidence for radio emissionwas found, down to flux densities of 0.9 mjy (at 1.5 ghz) and 0.09 mjy (at 1.4ghz) for the continuum and pulsed emissions, respectively, consistently withother observations at different epochs.

1107.5488	is sgr 0418+5729 indeed a waning magnetar ?	sgr 0418+5729 is a transient soft gamma-ray repeater which underwent a majoroutburst in june 2009, during which the emission of short bursts was observed.its properties appeared quite typical of other sources of the same class untillong-term x-ray monitoring failed to detect any period derivative. the presentupper limit on $\dot p$ implies that the surface dipole field is $b_p\lesssim7.5\times 10^{12}\ {\rm g}$ (rea et al 2010), well below those measured inother soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) and in the anomalous x-ray pulsars(axps), a group of similar sources. both sgrs and axps are currently believedto be powered by ultra-magnetized neutron stars (magnetars, $b_p\approx10^{14}$--$10^{15}\ {\rm g}$). sgr 0418+5729 hardly seems to fit in such apicture. we show that the magneto-rotational properties of sgr 0418+5729 can bereproduced if this is an aged magnetar, $\approx 1\ {\rm myr}$ old, whichexperienced substantial field decay. the large initial toroidal component ofthe internal field required to match the observed properties of sgr 0418+5729ensures that crustal fractures, and hence bursting activity, can still occur atpresent time. the thermal spectrum observed during the outburst decay iscompatible with the predictions of a resonant compton scattering model (as inother sgrs/axps) if the field is low and the magnetospheric twist moderate.

1111.4158	the influence of magnetic field geometry on magnetars x-ray spectra	nowadays, the analysis of the x-ray spectra of magnetically powered neutronstars or magnetars is one of the most valuable tools to gain insight into thephysical processes occurring in their interiors and magnetospheres. inparticular, the magnetospheric plasma leaves a strong imprint on the observedx-ray spectrum by means of compton up-scattering of the thermal radiationcoming from the star surface. motivated by the increased quality of theobservational data, much theoretical work has been devoted to develop montecarlo (mc) codes that incorporate the effects of resonant compton scattering inthe modeling of radiative transfer of photons through the magnetosphere. thetwo key ingredients in this simulations are the kinetic plasma properties andthe magnetic field (mf) configuration. the mf geometry is expected to becomplex, but up to now only mathematically simple solutions (self-similarsolutions) have been employed. in this work, we discuss the effects of new,more realistic, mf geometries on synthetic spectra. we use new force-freesolutions in a previously developed mc code to assess the influence of mfgeometry on the emerging spectra. our main result is that the shape of thefinal spectrum is mostly sensitive to uncertain parameters of themagnetospheric plasma, but the mf geometry plays an important role on theangle-dependence of the spectra.

1112.4602	a time-variable, phase-dependent emission line in the x-ray spectrum of  the isolated neutron star rx j0822-4300	rx j0822-4300 is the central compact object associated with the puppis asupernova remnant. previous x-ray observations suggested rx j0822-4300 to be ayoung neutron star with a weak dipole field and a peculiar surface temperaturedistribution dominated by two antipodal spots with different temperatures andsizes. an emission line at 0.8 kev was also detected. we performed a very deep(130 ks) observation with xmm-newton, which allowed us to study in detail thephase-resolved properties of rx j0822-4300. our new data confirm the existenceof a narrow spectral feature, best modelled as an emission line, only seen inthe `soft' phase interval - when the cooler region is best aligned to the lineof sight. surprisingly, comparison of our recent observations to the older onesyields evidence for a variation in the emission line component, which can bemodelled as a decrease in the central energy from ~0.80 kev in 2001 to ~0.73kev in 2009--2010. the line could be generated via cyclotron scattering ofthermal photons in an optically thin layer of gas, or - alternatively - itcould originate in low-rate accretion by a debris disk. in any case, avariation in energy, pointing to a variation of the magnetic field in the lineemitting region, cannot be easily accounted for.

1212.3141	the birthplace and age of the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5-3754	x-ray observations unveiled various types of radio-silent isolated neutronstars (inss), phenomenologically very diverse, e.g. the myr old x-ray dim ins(xdinss) and the kyr old magnetars. although their phenomenology is muchdiverse, the similar periods (p=2--10 s) and magnetic fields (~10^{14} g)suggest that xdinss are evolved magnetars, possibly born from similarpopulations of supermassive stars. one way to test this hypothesis is toidentify their parental star clusters by extrapolating backward the neutronstar velocity vector in the galactic potential. by using the information on theage and space velocity of the xdins rx j1856.5-3754, we computed backwards itsorbit in the galactic potential and searched for its parental stellar clusterby means of a closest approach criterion. we found a very likely associationwith the upper scorpius ob association, for a neutron star age of 0.42+/-0.08myr, a radial velocity v_r^ns =67+/- 13$ km s^{-1}, and a present-timeparallactic distance d_\pi^ns = 123^{+11}_{-15} pc. our result confirms thatthe "true" neutron star age is much lower than the spin-down age (tau_{sd}=3.8myrs), and is in good agreement with the cooling age, as computed withinstandard cooling scenarios. the mismatch between the spin-down and thedynamical/cooling age would require either an anomalously large breaking index(n~20) or a decaying magnetic field with initial value b_0 ~ 10^{14} g.unfortunately, owing to the uncertainty on the age of the upper scorpius obassociation and the masses of its members we cannot yet draw firm conclusionson the estimated mass of the rx j1856.5-3754 progenitor.

1410.8681	loft - the large observatory for x-ray timing	loft (the large observatory for x-ray timing), is a mission concept that wasconsidered by esa as a candidate for an m3 mission and has been studied duringan extended &gt;2-years long assessment phase. the mission was specificallydesigned to perform fast x-ray timing and probe the status of the matter nearblack holes and neutron stars. the loft scientific payload is composed of alarge area detector (lad) and a wide field monitor (wfm). the lad is a 10m^2-class pointed instrument with about 15 times the collecting area of thelargest past timing missions (as the rossi xte) over the 2-30 kev range (30-80kev expanded), combined with ccd-class spectral resolution, which holds thecapability to revolutionise studies of x-ray variability down to themillisecond time scales. its ground-breaking characteristic is a mass per unitsurface in the range of 10 kg/m^2, enabling an effective area of about 10 m^2(at 8 kev) at a reasonable weight. the development of such large but lightexperiment, with low mass and power per unit area, is now made possible by therecent advancements in the field of large-area silicon drift detectors andcapillary-plate x-ray collimators. although the loft mission has not beendown-selected for launch in the m3 esa programme (with launch in 2022-2024),during the assessment phase most of the trade off have been closed leading to arobust and well documented design which will be re-proposed in the future esacalls. in this paper, we will summarize the characteristics of the ladinstrument and briefly describe the status of the detectors design.

1503.01307	the x-ray outburst of the galactic centre magnetar sgr j1745-2900 during  the first 1.5 year	in 2013 april a new magnetar, sgr 1745-2900, was discovered as it entered anoutburst, at only 2.4 arcsec angular distance from the supermassive black holeat the centre of the milky way, sagittarius a*. sgr 1745-2900 has a surfacedipolar magnetic field of ~ 2x10^{14} g, and it is the neutron star closest toa black hole ever observed. the new source was detected both in the radio andx-ray bands, with a peak x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 5x10^{35} erg s^{-1}. here wereport on the long-term chandra (25 observations) and xmm-newton (8observations) x-ray monitoring campaign of sgr 1745-2900, from the onset of theoutburst in april 2013 until september 2014. this unprecedented dataset allowsus to refine the timing properties of the source, as well as to study theoutburst spectral evolution as a function of time and rotational phase. ourtiming analysis confirms the increase in the spin period derivative by a factorof ~2 around june 2013, and reveals that a further increase occurred between2013 oct 30 and 2014 feb 21. we find that the period derivative changed from6.6x10^{-12} s s^{-1} to 3.3x10^{-11} s s^{-1} in 1.5 yr. on the other hand,this magnetar shows a slow flux decay compared to other magnetars and a ratherinefficient surface cooling. in particular, starquake-induced crustal coolingmodels alone have difficulty in explaining the high luminosity of the sourcefor the first ~200 days of its outburst, and additional heating of the starsurface from currents flowing in a twisted magnetic bundle is probably playingan important role in the outburst evolution.

0804.4394	an optical counterpart candidate for the isolated neutron star rbs1774	multiwavelength studies of the seven identified x-ray dim isolated neutronstars (xdinss) offer a unique opportunity to investigate their surface thermaland magnetic structure and the matter-radiation interaction in presence ofstrong gravitational and magnetic fields. as a part of an ongoing campaignaimed at a complete identification and spectral characterization of xdinss inthe optical band, we performed deep imaging with the eso very large telescope(vlt) of the field of the xdins rbs1774 (1rxs j214303.7 +065419). the recentlyupgraded fors1 instrument mounted on the vlt provided the very first detectionof a candidate optical counterpart in the b band. the identification is basedon a very good positional coincidence with the x-ray source (chance probability~2e-3). the source has b=27.4 +/- 0.2 (1 sigma confidence level), and theoptical flux exceeds the extrapolation of the x-ray blackbody at opticalwavelengths by a factor ~35 (+/- 20 at 3sigma confidence level). this is barelycompatible with thermal emission from the neutron star surface, unless thesource distance is d~200-300 pc, and the star is an almost aligned rotator orits spin axis is nearly aligned with the line of sight. at the same time, sucha large optical excess appears difficult to reconcile with rotation-poweredmagnetospheric emission, unless the source has an extremely large opticalemission efficiency. the implications and possible similarities with theoptical spectra of other isolated nss are discussed.

0806.4136	observations of isolated neutron stars with the eso multi-conjugate  adaptive optics demonstrator	high-energy observations have unveiled peculiar classes of isolated neutronstars which, at variance with radio pulsars, are mostly radio silent and notpowered by the star rotation. among these objects are the magnetars,hyper-magnetized neutron stars characterized by transient x-ray/gamma-rayemission, and neutron stars with purely thermal, and in most cases stationary,x-ray emission (a.k.a., x-ray dim isolated neutron stars or xdinss). whileapparently dissimilar in their high-energy behavior and age, both magnetars andxdinss have similar periods and unusually high magnetic fields. this suggests atantalizing scenario where the former evolve into the latter.discovering so faruninvestigated similarities between the multi-wavelength properties of thesetwo classes would be a further step forward to establish an evolutionaryscenario. a most promising channels is the near infrared (nir) one, wheremagnetars are characterized by a distinctive spectral flattening with respectto the extrapolation of the soft x-ray spectrum.we observed the two xdinss rxj0420.0-5022 and rx j1856.5-3754 with the multi-conjugate adaptive opticsdemonstrator (mad) at the very large telescope (vlt) as part of the instrumentguaranteed time observations program, to search for their nir counterparts.both rx j1856.5-3754 and rx j0420.0-5022 were not detected down to k_s ~20 andks ~21.5, respectively. in order to constrain the relation between xdinss andmagnetars it would be of importance to perform deeper nir observations. a goodcandidate is 1rxs j214303.7+065419 which is the xdins with the highest inferredmagnetic field.

astro-ph;0301027	x-ray emission line gas in the liner galaxy m81	we present the soft x-ray spectrum of the liner galaxy m81 derived from along observation with the xmm rgs. the spectrum is dominated by continuumemission from the active nucleus, but also contains emission lines from fe l,and h-like and he-like n, o, and ne. the emission lines are significantlybroader than the rgs point-source spectral resolution; in the cross dispersiondirection the emission lines are detected adjacent to, as well as coincidentwith, the active nucleus. this implies that they originate in a region of a fewarc-minutes spatial extent (1 arc-minute ~ 1 kpc in m81). the flux ratios ofthe ovii triplet suggest that collisional processes are responsible for theline emission. a good fit to the whole rgs spectrum is obtained using a modelconsisting of an absorbed power law from the active nucleus and a 3 temperatureoptically thin thermal plasma. two of the thermal plasma components havetemperatures of 0.18+-0.04 kev and 0.64+-0.04 kev, characteristic of the hotinterstellar medium produced by supernovae; the combined luminosity of theplasma at these two temperatures accounts for all the unresolved bulge x-rayemission seen in the chandra observation by tennant et al.

astro-ph;0302197	rx j1856.5-3754: bare quark star or naked neutron star ?	recent chandra observations have shown that the soft x-ray spectrum from theisolated neutron star rx j1856.5-3754 is featureless and best fitted by ablackbody, in contrast with the predictions of current neutron star atmosphericmodels. the star distance (~120-140 pc) implies a radiation radius of at most\~5-6 km, too small for any neutron star equation of state. proposedexplanations for such a small radius include a reduced x-ray emitting region(as a polar cap), or the presence of a more compact object, as a barequark/strange star. however, both interpretations rely on the presumption thatthe quark star or the cap radiates a pure blackbody spectrum, and nojustification for this assumption has been presented yet. here we discuss analternative possibility. cool neutron stars (t &lt; 10^6 k) endowed with highmagnetic field (b &gt; 10^13 g) may suffer a phase transition in the outermostlayers. the neutron star is then left bare of the gaseous atmosphere. wecomputed spectra from naked neutron stars with a surface fe composition.depending on b, we found that the 0.1-2 kev emission can be featureless andindistinguishable from a blackbody. owing to the reduced surface emissivity,the star only radiates ~30-50 % of the blackbody power, thus that the size ofthe emitting region is larger than for a perfect planckian emitter. whenapplied to rx j1856.5-3754 our model accounts for the observed x-ray propertiesand solves the paradox of the small radius. the apparent star radius is ~10-12km, consistent with equations of state of a neutron star. the optical emissionof rx j1856.5-3754 may be explained by the presence a thin gaseous shell on thetop of the fe condensate.

astro-ph;0607601	anatomy of a dark burst - the afterglow of grb 060108	we report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a grb (060108) thatwould have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-basedoptical imaging with the 2-m robotic faulkes telesscope (ftn). ourmultiwavelength analysis reveals an x-ray light curve typical of many swiftlong grbs (3-segments plus flare). its optical afterglow, however, was alreadyfainter than the detection limit of the uvot within 100s of the burst. opticalimaging in bvri' filters with the ftn began 2.75 minutes after the burst andresulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a ukirtk-band identification at ~45 mins. r and i'-band light curves are consistentwith a single power law decay in flux, f(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 &lt;0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. deep vlt r-band imaging at ~12 daysreveals a faint, extended object (r ~23.5 mag) at the location of theafterglow. although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of thea_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. this impliesthat the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observedin the x-rays. we derive a maximum photometric redshift z&lt;3.2 for grb 060108and a best-fitting optical-to-x-ray sed at 1000 s after the burst consistentwith a power law with index beta_ox = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.the unambiguous detection at b-band and the derived photometric redshift ruleout a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of grb 060108.instead, the hard opt/x-ray spectral index confirms it as one of theoptically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains theuvot non-detection (abridged).

astro-ph;0608588	the first xmm-newton observations of the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr  1900+14	a ~50 ks xmm-newton observation of sgr 1900+14 has been carried out inseptember 2005, after almost three years during which no bursts were detectedfrom this soft gamma-ray repeater. the 0.8-10 kev spectrum was well fit by apower law plus blackbody model with photon index 1.9+/-0.1, temperaturekt=0.47+/-0.02 kev and n_h = (2.12+/-0.08)x10^22 cm^-2, similar to previousobservations of this source. the flux was ~5x10^{-12} erg/cm2/s, a factor 2dimmer than the typical value and the smallest ever seen from sgr 1900+14. thelong term fading of the persistent emission has been interrupted by the recentburst reactivation of the source. a target of opportunity xmm-newtonobservation performed in april 2006 showed a flux ~15% higher. this variationwas not accompanied by significant changes in the spectrum, pulsed fraction andlight curve profile. we searched for emission and absorption lines in thespectra of the two observations, with negative results and setting tight upperlimits of 50-200 ev (3 sigma), depending on the assumed line energy and width,on the equivalent width of lines in the 1-9 kev range.

astro-ph;0610594	intensity-hardness correlation and deep infrared observation of the  anomalous x-ray pulsar 1rxs j170849-400910	we report here on x-ray and ir observations of the anomalous x-ray pulsar1rxs j170849-400910. first, we report on new xmm-newton, swift-xrt and chandraobservations of this axp, which confirm the intensity-hardness correlationobserved in the long term x-ray monitoring of this source by rea et al. (2005).these new x-ray observations show that the axp flux is rising again, and thespectrum hardening. if the increase in the source intensity is indeed connectedwith the glitches and a possible bursting activity, we expect this source toenter in a bursting active phase around 2006-2007. second, we report on deep irobservations of 1rxs j170849-400910, taken with the vlt-naco adaptive optics,showing that there are many weak sources consistent with the axp position.neither star a or b, previously proposed by different authors, might yet beconclusively recognised as the ir counterpart of 1rxs j170849-400910. third,using monte carlo simulations, we re-address the calculation of thesignificance of the absorption line found in a phase-resolved spectrum of thissource by rea et al. (2003), and interpreted as a resonant scattering cyclotronfeature.

astro-ph;0611081	extreme properties of grb061007: a highly energetic or a highly  collimated burst?	grb061007 is the brightest gamma-ray burst (grb) to be detected by swift andis accompanied by an exceptionally luminous afterglow that had a v-bandmagnitude &lt;11.1 at 80s after the prompt emission. from the start of the swiftobservations the afterglow decayed as a power law with a slope of\alpha_x=1.66+/-0.01 in the x-ray and \alpha_{opt}=1.64+/-0.01 in theuv/optical, up to the point that it was no longer detected above background inthe optical or x-ray bands. the brightness of this grb and the similarity inthe decay rate of the x-ray, optical and gamma-ray emission from 100s after thetrigger distinguish this burst from others and present a challenge to thefireball model. the lack of a cooling or jet break in the afterglow up to\~10^5s constrains any model that can produce the large luminosity observed ingrb061007, which we found to require either an excessively large kinetic energyor highly collimated outflow. analysis of the multi-wavelength spectral andhigh-resolution temporal data taken with swift suggest an early time jet-breakto be a more plausible scenario. this must have occurred within 80s of theprompt emission, which places an upper limit on the jet opening angle of\theta_j=0.8deg. such a highly collimated outflow resolves the energy budgetproblem presented in a spherical emission model, reducing the isotropicequivalent energy of this burst to e_{\gamma}^{corr}=10^{50} ergs; consistentwith other grbs.

astro-ph;0702319	the nature of the outflow in gamma-ray bursts	the swift satellite has enabled us to follow the evolution of gamma-ray burst(grb) fireballs from the prompt gamma-ray emission to the afterglow phase. theearly x-ray and optical data obtained by telescopes aboard the swift satelliteshow that the source for prompt gamma-ray emission, the emission that heraldsthese bursts, is short lived and that its source is distinct from that of theensuing, long-lived afterglow. using these data, we determine the distance ofthe gamma-ray source from the center of the explosion. we find this distance tobe 1e15-1e16 cm for most bursts and we show that this is within a factor of tenof the radius of the shock-heated circumstellar medium (csm) producing thex-ray photons. furthermore, using the early gamma-ray, x-ray and optical data,we show that the prompt gamma-ray emission cannot be produced in internalshocks, nor can it be produced in the external shock; in a more general sensegamma-ray generation mechanisms based on shock physics have problems explainingthe grb data for the ten swift bursts analyzed in this work. a magnetic fielddominated outflow model for grbs has some attractive features, although theevidence in its favor is inconclusive. finally, the x-ray and optical dataallow us to provide an upper limit on the density of the csm of about 10protons per cubic cm at a distance of about 5e16 cm from the center ofexplosion.

0809.4688	jet breaks at the end of the slow decline phase of swift grb lightcurves	the swift mission has discovered an intriguing feature of gamma-ray burst(grbs) afterglows, a phase of shallow decline of the flux in the x-ray andoptical lightcurves. this behaviour is typically attributed to energy injectioninto the burst ejecta. at some point this phase ends, resulting in a break inthe lightcurve, which is commonly interpreted as the cessation of the energyinjection. in a few cases, however, while breaks in the x-ray lightcurve areobserved, optical emission continues its slow flux decline. this behavioursuggests a more complex scenario. in this paper, we present a model thatinvokes a double component outflow, in which narrowly collimated ejecta areresponsible for the x-ray emission while a broad outflow is responsible for theoptical emission. the narrow component can produce a jet break in the x-raylightcurve at relatively early times, while the optical emission does not breakdue to its lower degree of collimation. in our model both components aresubject to energy injection for the whole duration of the follow-upobservations. we apply this model to grbs with chromatic breaks, and we showhow it might change the interpretation of the grbs canonical lightcurve. wealso study our model from a theoretical point of view, investigating thepossible configurations of frequencies and the values of grb physicalparameters allowed in our model.

0810.5319	spectral and temporal variations of the isolated neutron star rx  j0720.4-3125: new xmm-newton observations	in the past, the isolated, radio-quiet neutron star rx j0720.4-3125 showedvariations in the spectral parameters (apparent radius, temperature of theemitting area and equivalent width of the absorption feature) seen in the x-rayspectra, not only during the spin period of 8.39s, but also over time scales ofyears. new x-ray observations of rx j0720.4-3125 with xmm newton extend thecoverage to about 7.5 years with the latest pointing performed in november2007. out of a total of fourteen available epic-pn datasets, eleven have beenobtained with an identical instrumental setup (full frame read-out mode withthin filter), and are best suited for a comparative investigations of thespectral and timing properties of this enigmatic x-ray pulsar.  we analysed the new xmm newton observations together with archival data inorder to follow the spectral and temporal evolution of rx j0720.4-3125  all xmm-newton data were reduced with the standard xmm-sas software package.a systematic and consistent data reduction of all these observations wasemphasised in order to reduce systematic errors as far as possible.  we investigate the phase residuals derived from data from different energybands using different timing solutions for the spin period evolution andconfirm the phase lag between hard and soft photons. the phase shift in thex-ray pulses between hard and soft photons varies with time and changes signaround mjd=52800 days, regardless of the chosen timing solution. the phaseresiduals[abridge]

0706.0669	the two-component afterglow of swift grb 050802	this paper investigates grb 050802, one of the best examples of a it swiftgamma-ray burst afterglow that shows a break in the x-ray lightcurve, while theoptical counterpart decays as a single power-law. this burst has an opticallybright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectralrange of the uvot on-board swift. observations began with the xrt and uvottelescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. thex-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. theoptical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_o = 0.82 +/- 0.03throughout the observation. the x-ray data on their own are consistent with thebreak at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. modelling the opticalto x-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow cannot be produced by the same component as the x-ray emission at late times,ruling out a single component afterglow. we therefore considered two-componentjet models and find that the x-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by amodel in which both components are energy injected for the duration of theobserved afterglow and the x-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in thenarrow component. this bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide forinterpreting the surprising finding of swift that bursts seldom displayachromatic jet breaks.

gr-qc;9711050	bar mode instability in relativistic rotating stars: a post newtonian  treatment	we construct analytic models of incompressible, rigidly rotating stars in pngravity and study their stability against nonaxisymmetric jacobi-like barmodes. pn configurations are modeled by homogeneous triaxial ellipsoids and themetric is obtained as a solution of einstein's equations in 3+1 adm form. weuse an approximate subset of the equations well-suited to numerical integrationfor strong field, 3d configurations in quasi--equilibrium. these equations areexact at pn order, and admit an analytic solution for homogeneous ellipsoids.in this paper we present this solution, as well as analytic functionals for theconserved global quantities, m, m_0 and j. by using a variational principle weconstruct sequences of axisymmetric equilibria of constant density and restmass, i.e. the pn generalization of maclaurin spheroids, which are compared toother pn and full relativistic sequences presented by previous authors. we thenconsider nonaxisymmetric ellipsoidal deformations of the configurations,holding j constant and the rotation uniform, and we locate the point at whichthe bar modes will be driven secularly unstable by a dissipative agent likeviscosity. we find that the value of the eccentricity, as well as the ratios\omega^2/(\pi\rho_0) and t/|w|, defined invariantly, all increase at the onsetof instability as the stars become more relativistic. since higher degrees ofrotation are required to trigger a viscosity-driven bar mode as the star'scompactness increases, the effect of gr is to weaken the instability, at leastto pn order. this behavior is opposite to that found for secular instabilityvia dedekind-like modes driven unstable by gravitational radiation, supportingthe suggestion that in gr, nonaxisymmetric modes driven unstable by viscosityand gravitational radiation may no longer coincide.
