0908.1977	the 8 micron phase variation of the hot saturn hd 149026b	we monitor the star hd 149026 and its saturn-mass planet at 8.0 micron overslightly more than half an orbit using the infrared array camera (irac) on thespitzer space telescope. we find an increase of 0.0227% +/- 0.0066% (3.4 sigmasignificance) in the combined planet-star flux during this interval. theminimum flux from the planet is 45% +/- 19% of the maximum planet flux,corresponding to a difference in brightness temperature of 480 +/- 140 kbetween the two hemispheres. we derive a new secondary eclipse depth of 0.0411%+/- 0.0076% in this band, corresponding to a dayside brightness temperature of1440 +/- 150 k. our new secondary eclipse depth is half that of a previousmeasurement (3.0 sigma difference) in this same bandpass by harrington et al.(2007). we re-fit the harrington et al. (2007) data and obtain a comparablygood fit with a smaller eclipse depth that is consistent with our new value. incontrast to earlier claims, our new eclipse depth suggests that this planet'sdayside emission spectrum is relatively cool, with an 8 micron brightnesstemperature that is less than the maximum planet-wide equilibrium temperature.we measure the interval between the transit and secondary eclipse and find thatthat the secondary eclipse occurs 20.9 +7.2 / -6.5 minutes earlier (2.9 sigma)than predicted for a circular orbit, a marginally significant result. thiscorresponds to e*cos(omega) = -0.0079 +0.0027 / -0.0025 where e is the planet'sorbital eccentricity and omega is the argument of pericenter.

0909.4977	elemental abundances and minimum mass of heavy elements in the envelope  of hd 189733b	oxygen (o) and carbon (c) have been inferred recently to be subsolar inabundance from spectra of the atmosphere of the transiting hot jupiter hd189733b. yet, the mass and radius of the planet coupled with structure modelsindicate a strongly supersolar abundance of heavy elements in the interior ofthis object. here we explore the discrepancy between the large amount of heavyelements suspected in the planet's interior and the paucity of volatilesmeasured in its atmosphere. we describe the formation sequence of the icyplanetesimals formed beyond the snow line of the protoplanetary disk andcalculate the composition of ices ultimately accreted in the envelope of hd189733b on its migration pathway. this allows us to reproduce the observedvolatile abundances by adjusting the mass of ices vaporized in the envelope.the predicted elemental mixing ratios should be 0.15--0.3 times solar in theenvelope of hd 189733b if they are fitted to the recent o and c determinations.however, our fit to the minimum mass of heavy elements predicted by internalstructure models gives elemental abundances that are 1.2--2.4 times oversolarin the envelope of hd189733b. we propose that the most likely cause of thisdiscrepancy is irradiation from the central star leading to development of aradiative zone in the planet's outer envelope which would induce gravitationalsettling of elements. hence, all strongly irradiated extrasolar planets shouldpresent subsolar abundances of volatiles. we finally predict that theabundances of nitrogen (n), sulfur (s) and phosphorus (p) are of $\sim$ $2.8\times 10^{-5}$, $5.3 \times 10^{-6}$ and $1.8 \times 10^{-7}$ relative toh$_2$, respectively in the atmosphere of hd 189733b.

0910.3065	generation of equatorial jets by large-scale latent heating on the giant  planets	three-dimensional numerical simulations show that large-scale latent heatingresulting from condensation of water vapor can produce multiple zonal jetssimilar to those on the gas giants (jupiter and saturn) and ice giants (uranusand neptune). for plausible water abundances (3-5 times solar on jupiter/saturnand 30 times solar on uranus/neptune), our simulations produce ~20 zonal jetsfor jupiter and saturn and 3 zonal jets on uranus and neptune, similar to thenumber of jets observed on these planets. moreover, these jupiter/saturn casesproduce equatorial superrotation whereas the uranus/neptune cases produceequatorial subrotation,consistent with the observed equatorial jet direction onthese planets.sensitivity tests show that water abundance, planetary rotationrate,and planetary radius are all controlling factors, with water playing themost important role; modest water abundances, large planetary radii, and fastrotation rates favor equatorial superrotation, whereas large water abundancesfavor equatorial subrotation regardless of the planetary radius and rotationrate. given the larger radii, faster rotation rates, and probable lower waterabundances of jupiter and saturn relative to uranus and neptune, oursimulations therefore provide a possible mechanism for the existence ofequatorial superrotation on jupiter and saturn and the lack of superrotation onuranus and neptune. nevertheless, saturn poses a possible difficulty, as oursimulations were unable to explain the unusually high speed (~400m/s) of thatplanet's superrotating jet. the zonal jets in our simulations exhibit modestviolations of the barotropic and charney-stern stability criteria. overall, oursimulations, while idealized, support the idea that latent heating plays animportant role in generating the jets on the giant planets.

1011.1713	scaling laws for convection and jet speeds in the giant planets	three-dimensional studies of convection in deep spherical shells have beenused to test the hypothesis that the strong jet streams on jupiter, saturn,uranus, and neptune result from convection throughout the molecular envelopes.due to computational limitations, these simulations must adopt viscosities andheat fluxes many orders of magnitude larger than the planetary values. severalnumerical investigations have identified trends for how the mean jet speedvaries with heat flux and viscosity, but no previous theories have beenadvanced to explain these trends. here, we show using simple arguments that ifconvective release of potential energy pumps the jets and viscosity damps them,the mean jet speeds split into two regimes. when the convection is weaklynonlinear, the equilibrated jet speeds should scale approximately with f/nu,where f is the convective heat flux and nu is the viscosity. when theconvection is strongly nonlinear, the jet speeds are faster and should scaleapproximately as (f/nu)^{1/2}. we demonstrate how this regime shift cannaturally result from a shift in the behavior of the jet-pumping efficiencywith heat flux and viscosity. moreover, the simulations hint at a third regimewhere, at sufficiently small viscosities, the jet speed becomes independent ofthe viscosity. we show based on mixing-length estimates that if such a regimeexists, mean jet speeds should scale as heat flux to the 1/4 power. ourscalings provide a good match to the mean jet speeds obtained in previousboussinesq and anelastic, three-dimensional simulations of convection withingiant planets over a broad range of parameters. when extrapolated to the realheat fluxes, these scalings suggest that the mass-weighted jet speeds in themolecular envelopes of the giant planets are much weaker--by an order ofmagnitude or more--than the speeds measured at cloud level.

1011.4066	secondary eclipse photometry of wasp-4b with warm spitzer	we present photometry of the giant extrasolar planet wasp-4b at 3.6 and 4.5micron taken with the infrared array camera on board the spitzer spacetelescope as part of spitzer's extended warm mission. we find secondary eclipsedepths of 0.319+/-0.031% and 0.343+/-0.027% for the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands,respectively and show model emission spectra and pressure-temperature profilesfor the planetary atmosphere. these eclipse depths are well fit by modelemission spectra with water and other molecules in absorption, similar to thoseused for tres-3 and hd 189733b. depending on our choice of model, these resultsindicate that this planet has either a weak dayside temperature inversion or noinversion at all. the absence of a strong thermal inversion on this highlyirradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets areexpected to have inversions, perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber inthe upper atmosphere. this result might be explained by the modestly enhancedactivity level of wasp-4b's g7v host star, which could increase the amount ofuv flux received by the planet, therefore reducing the abundance of the unknownstratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in knutson etal. (2010). we also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of thesecondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0.0024,which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain thisplanet's inflated radius.

1102.0063	disequilibrium carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen chemistry in the atmospheres  of hd 189733b and hd 209458b	we have developed 1-d photochemical and thermochemical kinetics and diffusionmodels for the transiting exoplanets hd 189733b and hd 209458b to study theeffects of disequilibrium chemistry on the atmospheric composition of "hotjupiters." here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon,hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species, and we compare the model results withexisting transit and eclipse observations. we find that the vertical profilesof molecular constituents are significantly affected by transport-inducedquenching and photochemistry, particularly on cooler hd 189733b; however, thewarmer stratospheric temperatures on hd 209458b can help maintainthermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium chemistry.for both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to beenhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few bar to less than ambar due to transport-induced quenching, but ch4 and nh3 are photochemicallyremoved at higher altitudes. atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons(particularly c2h2), some nitriles (particularly hcn), and radicals like oh,ch3, and nh2 are enhanced overequilibrium predictions because of quenching andphotochemistry. in contrast, co, h2o, n2, and co2 more closely follow theirequilibrium profiles, except at pressures &lt; 1 microbar, where co, h2o, and n2are photochemically destroyed and co2 is produced before its eventualhigh-altitude destruction. the enhanced abundances of hcn, ch4, and nh3 inparticular are expected to affect the spectral signatures and thermal profileshd 189733b and other, relatively cool, close-in transiting exoplanets. weexamine the sensitivity of our results to the assumed temperature structure andeddy diffusion coefficientss and discuss further observational consequences ofthese models.

1103.3101	equatorial superrotation on tidally locked exoplanets	the increasing richness of exoplanet observations has motivated a variety ofthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of these planets. understrongly irradiated conditions, models of tidally locked, short-period planets(both hot jupiters and terrestrial planets) tend to exhibit a circulationdominated by a fast eastward, or "superrotating," jet stream at the equator.under appropriate conditions, this phenomenon can cause the hottest regions tobe displaced eastward from the substellar point by tens of degrees longitude.such an offset has been observed on hd 189733b, supporting the possibility ofequatorial jets on short-period exoplanets. despite its relevance, however, thedynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the equatorial superrotation insuch models have not been identified. here, we show that the equatorial jetresults from the interaction of the mean flow with standing, planetary-scalerossby and kelvin waves induced by the day-night thermal forcing. the rossbywaves develop phase tilts that pump eastward momentum from high latitudes tothe equator, thereby inducing equatorial superrotation. we present an analytictheory demonstrating this mechanism and explore its properties in a hierarchyof one-layer (shallow-water) calculations and fully 3d models. thewave-mean-flow interaction produces an equatorial jet whose latitudinal widthis comparable to that of the rossby waves, namely the equatorial rossbydeformation radius modified by radiative and frictional effects. for conditionstypical of synchronously rotating hot jupiters, this length is comparable to aplanetary radius, explaining the broad scale of the equatorial jet obtained inmost hot jupiter models. our theory illuminates the dependence of theequatorial jet speed on forcing amplitude, strength of friction, and otherparameters, as well as the conditions under which jets can form at all.

(2010) and cowan &amp; agol (2011), respectively. ourresults are consistent with these hypotheses, but do not significantlystrengthen them. to measure accurate secondary eclipse central phases, werequire accurate ephemerides. we obtain primary transit observations andsupplement them with publicly available observations to update the orbitalephemerides of the three planets. based on the secondary eclipse timing, we setupper boundaries for e cos(\omega) for hat-p-6b, hat-p-8b and xo-4b and findthat the values are consistent with circular orbits.

(2) a meaneclipse depth of 0.332% +/- 0.026%, somewhat higher than that previouslyreported for this system; this new value brings observations into betteragreement with models. the dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the12% level. (3) eclipses in the system occur 32 s +/- 129 s earlier than wouldbe expected from a circular orbit, which constrains the orbital quantity (e cosomega) to be 0.00004 +/- 0.00033. this result is fully consistent with acircular orbit and sets an upper limit of 140 m/s (3 sigma) on anyeccentricity-induced velocity offset during transit. the phase curveobservations (including one of the transits) exhibit an anomalous trend similarto the detector ramp seen in previous spitzer/irac observations; by modelingthis ramp we recover the system parameters. the photometry which follows theramp and transit exhibits a gradual, ~0.2% decrease in flux, similar to thatseen in pre-launch calibration data. the large uncertainties associated withthis poorly-understood, likely instrumental effect prevent us from usefullyconstraining the planet's thermal phase curve. our observations highlight theneed for a thorough understanding of detector-related instrumental effects onlong time scales when making the high-precision mid-infrared measurementsplanned for future missions such as echo, spica, and jwst.

1203.6070	the evil-mc model for ellipsoidal variations of planet-hosting stars and  applications to the hat-p-7 system	we present a new model for ellipsoidal variations induced by a low-masscompanion, the evil-mc model. we employ several approximations appropriate forplanetary systems to substantially increase the computational efficiency of ourmodel relative to more general ellipsoidal variation models and improve uponthe accuracy of simpler models. this new approach gives us a unique ability torapidly and accurately determine planetary system parameters. we use theevil-mc model to analyze kepler quarter 0-2 (q0-2) observations of the hat-p-7system, an f-type star orbited by a nearly jupiter-mass companion. our analysiscorroborates previous estimates of the planet-star mass ratio q = (1.10 +/-0.06) x 10^(-3), and we have revised the planet's dayside brightnesstemperature to 2680 +10/-20 k. we also find a large difference between the day-and nightside planetary flux, with little nightside emission. preliminarydynamical+radiative modeling of the atmosphere indicates this result isqualitatively consistent with high altitude absorption of stellar heating.similar analyses of kepler and corot photometry of other planets using evil-mcwill play a key role in providing constraints on the properties of manyextrasolar systems, especially given the limited resources for follow-up andcharacterization of these systems. however, as we highlight, there areimportant degeneracies between the contributions from ellipsoidal variationsand planetary emission and reflection. consequently, for many of the hottestand brightest kepler and corot planets, accurate estimates of the planetaryemission and reflection, diagnostic of atmospheric heat budgets, will requireaccurate modeling of the photometric contribution from the stellar ellipsoidalvariation.

1207.5639	doppler signatures of the atmospheric circulation on hot jupiters	the meteorology of hot jupiters has been characterized primarily with thermalmeasurements, but recent observations suggest the possibility of directlydetecting the winds by observing the doppler shift of spectral lines seenduring transit. motivated by these observations, we show how dopplermeasurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. we show thatthe atmospheric circulation--and doppler signature--of hot jupiters splits intotwo regimes. under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcinggenerates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves withthe mean flow. in this regime, air along the terminator (as seen duringtransit) flows toward earth in some regions and away from earth in others,leading to a doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshiftedcomponents. under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermalforcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generatejets. strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jetformation. as a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated byhigh-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifteddoppler signature during transit. we present state-of-the-art circulationmodels including nongray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift andthe resulting doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets likegj 436b lie in the first regime, hd 189733b is transitional, while planetshotter than hd 209458b lie in the second regime. moreover, we show how theamplitude of the doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag inthe upper atmospheres of hot jupiters. if due to winds, the ~2-km/sec blueshiftinferred on hd 209458b may require drag time constants as short as 10^4-10^6seconds, possibly the result of lorentz-force braking on this planet's hotdayside.

1208.0126	atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters: insensitivity to initial  conditions	the ongoing characterization of hot jupiters has motivated a variety ofcirculation models of their atmospheres. such models must be integratedstarting from an assumed initial state, which is typically taken to be awind-free, rest state. here, we investigate the sensitivity of hot-jupiteratmospheric circulation models to initial conditions. we consider two classesof models--shallow-water models, which have proven successful at illuminatingthe dynamical mechanisms at play on these planets, and full three-dimensionalmodels similar to those being explored in the literature. models areinitialized with zonal jets, and we explore a variety of different initial jetprofiles. we demonstrate that, in both classes of models, the final,equilibrated state is independent of initial condition--as long as frictionaldrag near the bottom of the domain and/or interaction with a specifiedplanetary interior are included so that the atmosphere can adjust angularmomentum over time relative to the interior. when such mechanisms are included,otherwise identical models initialized with vastly different initial conditionsall converge to the same statistical steady state. in some cases, the modelsexhibit modest time variability; this variability results in randomfluctuations about the statistical steady state, but we emphasize that, even inthese cases, the statistical steady state itself does not depend on initialconditions. although the outcome of hot-jupiter circulation models depend ondetails of the radiative forcing and frictional drag, aspects of which remainuncertain, we conclude that the specification of initial conditions is not asource of uncertainty, at least over the parameter range explored in mostcurrent models.

1208.3795	three-dimensional atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters on highly  eccentric orbits	of the over 800 exoplanets detected to date, over half are on non-circularorbits, with eccentricities as high as 0.93. such orbits lead to time-variablestellar heating, which has implications for the planet's atmospheric dynamicalregime. however, little is known about this dynamical regime, and how it mayinfluence observations. therefore, we present a systematic study of hotjupiters on highly eccentric orbits using the sparc/mitgcm, a model whichcouples a three-dimensional general circulation model with a plane-parallel,two-stream, non-grey radiative transfer model. in our study, we vary theeccentricity and orbit-average stellar flux over a wide range. we demonstratethat the eccentric hot jupiter regime is qualitatively similar to that ofplanets on circular orbits; the planets possess a superrotating equatorial jetand exhibit large day-night temperature variations. we show that theseday-night heating variations induce momentum fluxes equatorward to maintain thesuperrotating jet throughout its orbit. as the eccentricity and/or stellar fluxis increased, the superrotating jet strengthens and narrows, due to a smallerrossby deformation radius. for a select number of model integrations, wegenerate full-orbit lightcurves and find that the timing of transit andsecondary eclipse viewed from earth with respect to periapse and apoapse cangreatly affect what we see in infrared (ir) lightcurves; the peak in ir fluxcan lead or lag secondary eclipse depending on the geometry. for those planetsthat have large day-night temperature variations and rapid rotation rates, wefind that the lightcurves exhibit "ringing" as the planet's hottest regionrotates in and out of view from earth. these results can be used to explainfuture observations of eccentric transiting exoplanets.

1210.7573	atmospheric dynamics of brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets	a variety of observations provide evidence for vigorous motion in theatmospheres of brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets. motivated bythese observations, we examine the dynamical regime of the circulation in theatmospheres and interiors of these objects. brown dwarfs rotate rapidly, andfor plausible wind speeds, the flow at large scales will be rotationallydominated. we present 3d, global, numerical simulations of convection in theinterior, which demonstrate that, at large scales, the convection aligns in thedirection parallel to the rotation axis. convection occurs more efficiently athigh latitudes than low latitudes, leading to systematic equator-to-poletemperature differences that may reach ~1 k near the top of the convectionzone. the interaction of convection with the overlying, stably stratifiedatmosphere will generate a wealth of atmospheric waves, and we argue that, asin the stratospheres of planets in the solar system, the interaction of thesewaves with the mean flow will cause a significant atmospheric circulation atregional to global scales. at large scales, this should consist of stratifiedturbulence (possibly organizing into coherent structures such as vortices andjets) and an accompanying overturning circulation. we present an approximateanalytic theory of this circulation, which predicts characteristic horizontaltemperature variations of several to ~50 k, horizontal wind speeds of ~10-300m/sec, and vertical velocities that advect air over a scale height in~10^5-10^6 sec. this vertical mixing may help to explain the chemicaldisequilibrium observed on some brown dwarfs. moreover, the implied large-scaleorganization of temperature perturbations and vertical velocities suggeststhat, near the l/t transition, patchy clouds can form near the photosphere,helping to explain recent observations of brown-dwarf variability in thenear-ir.

1301.4522	3d mixing in hot jupiter atmospheres. i. application to the day/night  cold trap in hd 209458b	hot jupiters exhibit atmospheric temperatures ranging from hundreds tothousands of kelvin. because of their large day-night temperature differences,condensable species that are stable in the gas phase on the dayside, such astio and silicates, may condense and gravitationally settle on the nightside.atmospheric circulation may counterbalance this tendency to gravitationallysettle. this three dimensional (3d) mixing of chemical species has notpreviously been studied for hot jupiters, yet it is crucial to assess theexistence and distribution of tio and silicates in the atmospheres of theseplanets. we perform 3d global circulation models of hd209458b including passivetracers that advect with the 3d flow, including a source/sink on the nightsideto represent condensation and gravitational settling of haze particles. we showthat global advection patterns produce strong vertical mixing that can keepcondensable species lofted as long as they are trapped in particles of sizes ofa few microns or less on the night side. we show that vertical mixing resultsnot from small-scale convection but from the large-scale circulation driven bythe day-night heating contrast. although this vertical mixing is not diffusivein any rigorous sense, a comparison of our results with idealized diffusionmodels allows a rough estimate of the vertical diffusion coefficient.kzz=5x10**4/sqrt(pbar) m2/s can be used in 1d models of hd 209458b. moreover,our models exhibit strong spatial and temporal variability in the tracerconcentration that could result in observable variations during transit orsecondary eclipse measurements. finally, we apply our model to the case of tioin hd209458b and show that the day-night cold trap would deplete tio if itcondenses into particles bigger than a few microns on the planet's night side,making it unable to create the observed stratosphere of the planet.

1301.6124	cloud features and zonal wind measurements of saturn's atmosphere as  observed by cassini/vims	we present an analysis of data about saturn's atmosphere from cassini'svisual and infrared mapping spectrometer (vims), focusing on the meteorology ofthe features seen in the 5-micron spectral window. we present vims mosaics anddiscuss the morphology and general characteristics of the features backlit bysaturn's thermal emission. we have also constructed a zonal wind profile fromvims feature tracking observation sequences using an automated cloud featuretracker. comparison with previously constructed profiles from voyager andcassini imaging data reveals broad similarities, suggesting minimal verticalshear of the zonal wind. however, areas of apparent wind shear are present inthe vims zonal wind profile at jet stream cores. in particular, our analysisshows that the equatorial jet reaches speeds exceeding 450 m/s, similar tospeeds obtained during the voyager era. this suggests that recent inferences ofrelatively slower jet speeds of ~275-375 m/s are confined to the uppertroposphere and that the deep (&gt;1 bar) jet has not experienced a significantslowdown. our measurements of the numerous dark, spotted features seen in thevims mosaics reveals that most of these features have diameters less than 1000km and reside in confined zonal bands between jet stream cores. we propose thatthese spot features are vortices and that vims and iss are sensing the samevortices at two different pressure levels. the local structure at the zonal jetstreams remains complex, as vims may be sensing cloud features that are deeperthan the nh3 cloud deck.

1301.6126	the evolving flow of jupiter's white ovals and adjacent cyclones	we present results regarding the dynamical meteorology of jupiter's whiteovals at different points in their evolution. starting from the era with threewhite ovals fa, bc, and de (galileo), continuing to the post-merger epoch withonly one oval ba (cassini), and finally to oval ba's current reddened state(new horizons), we demonstrate that the dynamics of their flow have similarlyevolved along with their appearance. the northern periphery of oval baincreased in speed by 20 m/s from cassini to new horizons, ending up at a speednearly identical to that of the northern periphery of oval de during galileo.however, the peak speeds along the southern rim of the newly formed oval bawere consistently faster than the corresponding speeds in oval de, and theyincreased still further between cassini and new horizons, ending up at ~140 to150 m/s. the modest strengthening of the winds in oval ba, the appearance ofred aerosols, and the appearance of a turbulent, cyclonic feature to oval ba'snorthwest create a strong resemblance with the great red spot from both adynamical and morphological perspective. in addition to the white ovals, wealso measure the winds within two compact cyclonic regions, one in the galileodata set and one in the cassini data set. in the images, these cyclonicfeatures appear turbulent and filamentary, but our wind field reveals that theflow manifests as a coherent high-speed collar surrounding relatively quiescentinteriors. although less studied than their anticyclonic cousins, thesecyclones may offer crucial insights into the planet's cloud-level energeticsand dynamical meteorology.

1301.6132	power spectral analysis of jupiter's clouds and kinetic energy from  cassini	we present suggestive evidence for an inverse energy cascade within jupiter'satmosphere through a calculation of the power spectrum of its kinetic energyand its cloud patterns. using cassini observations, we composedfull-longitudinal mosaics of jupiter's atmosphere at several wavelengths. wealso utilized image pairs derived from these observations to generatefull-longitudinal maps of wind vectors and atmospheric kinetic energy withinjupiter's troposphere. we computed power spectra of the image mosaics andkinetic energy maps using spherical harmonic analysis. power spectra ofjupiter's cloud patterns imaged at certain wavelengths resemble theoreticalspectra of two-dimensional turbulence, with power-law slopes near -5/3 and -3at low and high wavenumbers, respectively. the slopes of the kinetic energypower spectrum are also near -5/3 at low wavenumbers. at high wavenumbers,however, the spectral slopes are relatively flatter than the theoreticalprediction of -3. our results also show the importance of calculating spectralslopes from full 2d velocity maps rather than 1d zonal mean velocity profiles,since at large wavenumbers the spectra differ significantly, though at lowwavenumbers, the 1d zonal and full 2d kinetic energy spectra are practicallyindistinguishable. furthermore, the difference between the image and kineticenergy spectra suggests some caution in the interpretation of power spectrumresults solely from image mosaics and its significance for the underlyingdynamics. finally, we also report prominent variations in kinetic energy withinthe equatorial jet stream that appear to be associated with the 5 {\mu}mhotspots. other eddies are present within the flow collar of the great redspot, suggesting caution when interpreting snapshots of the flow inside thesefeatures as representative of a time-averaged state.

1302.1141	infrared transmission spectroscopy of the exoplanets hd209458b and xo-1b  using the wide field camera-3 on the hubble space telescope	exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared usinghubble/nicmos is currently ambiguous because different observational groupsclaim different results from the same data, depending on their analysismethodologies. spatial scanning with hubble/wfc3 provides an opportunity toresolve this ambiguity. we here report wfc3 spectroscopy of the giant planetshd209458b and xo-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximumphoton-collecting efficiency. we introduce an analysis technique that derivesthe exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitlydecorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limitedprecision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. ourerrors are within 6-percent (xo-1) and 26-percent (hd209458b) of thephoton-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than0.01-percent per spectral channel. both planets exhibit water absorption ofapproximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. our result for xo-1bcontradicts the much larger absorption derived from nicmos spectroscopy. theweak water absorption we measure for hd209458b is reminiscent of the weaknessof sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanetatmosphere by charbonneau et al. (2002). model atmospheres havinguniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram accountapproximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in thisplanet. our results for hd209458b support the picture advocated by pont et al.(2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmissionspectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.however, the extra opacity needed for hd209458b is grayer than for hd189733b,with a weaker rayleigh component.

1306.2418	atmospheric circulation of terrestrial exoplanets	the investigation of planets around other stars began with the study of gasgiants, but is now extending to the discovery and characterization ofsuper-earths and terrestrial planets. motivated by this observational tide, wesurvey the basic dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation ofterrestrial exoplanets, and discuss the interaction of their circulation withthe hydrological cycle and global-scale climate feedbacks. terrestrialexoplanets occupy a wide range of physical and dynamical conditions, only asmall fraction of which have yet been explored in detail. our approach is tolay out the fundamental dynamical principles governing the atmosphericcirculation on terrestrial planets--broadly defined--and show how they canprovide a foundation for understanding the atmospheric behavior of theseworlds. we first survey basic atmospheric dynamics, including the role ofgeostrophy, baroclinic instabilities, and jets in the strongly rotating regime(the "extratropics") and the role of the hadley circulation, wave adjustment ofthe thermal structure, and the tendency toward equatorial superrotation in theslowly rotating regime (the "tropics"). we then survey key elements of thehydrological cycle, including the factors that control precipitation, humidity,and cloudiness. next, we summarize key mechanisms by which the circulationaffects the global-mean climate, and hence planetary habitability. inparticular, we discuss the runaway greenhouse, transitions to snowball states,atmospheric collapse, and the links between atmospheric circulation and co2weathering rates. we finish by summarizing the key questions and challenges forthis emerging field in the future.

1306.4673	atmospheric heat redistribution on hot jupiters	infrared lightcurves of transiting hot jupiters present a trend in which theatmospheres of the hottest planets are less efficient at redistributing thestellar energy absorbed on their daysides---and thus have a larger day-nighttemperature contrast---than colder planets. no predictive atmospheric model hasbeen published that identifies which dynamical mechanisms determine theatmospheric heat redistribution efficiency on tidally locked exoplanets. herewe present a two-layer shallow water model of the atmospheric dynamics onsynchronously rotating planets that explains the observed trend. our modelshows that planets with weak friction and weak irradiation exhibit a bandedzonal flow with minimal day-night temperature differences, while models withstrong irradiation and/or strong friction exhibit a day-night flow pattern withorder-unity fractional day-night temperature differences. to interpret themodel, we develop a scaling theory that shows that the timescale for gravitywaves to propagate horizontally over planetary scales, t_wave, plays a dominantrole in controlling the transition from small to large temperature contrasts.this implies that heat redistribution is governed by a wave-like process,similar to the one responsible for the weak temperature gradients in theearth's tropics. when atmospheric drag can be neglected, the transition fromsmall to large day-night temperature contrasts occurs when t_wave ~sqrt(t_rad/omega), where t_rad is the radiative relaxation time and omega isthe planetary rotation frequency. alternatively, this transition criterion canbe expressed as t_rad ~ t_vert, where t_vert is the timescale for a fluidparcel to move vertically over the difference in day-night thickness. theseresults subsume the commonly used timescale comparison for estimating heatredistribution efficiency between t_rad and the global horizontal advectiontimescale, t_adv.

1310.7585	spitzer and z' secondary eclipse observations of the highly irradiated  transiting brown dwarf kelt-1b	we present secondary eclipse observations of the highly irradiated transitingbrown dwarf kelt-1b. these observations represent the first constraints on theatmospheric dynamics of a highly irradiated brown dwarf, and the atmospheres ofirradiated giant planets at high surface gravity. using the spitzer spacetelescope, we measure secondary eclipse depths of 0.195+/-0.010% at 3.6um and0.200+/-0.012% at 4.5um. we also find tentative evidence for the secondaryeclipse in the z' band with a depth of 0.049+/-0.023%. these measured eclipsedepths are most consistent with an atmosphere model in which there is a strongsubstellar hotspot, implying that heat redistribution in the atmosphere ofkelt-1b is low. while models with a more mild hotspot or even with dayside heatredistribution are only marginally disfavored, models with complete heatredistribution are strongly ruled out. the eclipse depths also prefer anatmosphere with no tio inversion layer, although a model with tio inversion ispermitted in the dayside heat redistribution case, and we consider thepossibility of a day-night tio cold trap in this object. for the first time, wecompare the irac colors of brown dwarfs and hot jupiters as a function ofeffective temperature. importantly, our measurements reveal that kelt-1b has a[3.6]-[4.5] color of 0.07+/-0.11, identical to that of isolated brown dwarfs ofsimilarly high temperature. in contrast, hot jupiters generally show redder[3.6]-[4.5] colors of ~0.4, with a very large range from ~0 to ~1. evidently,despite being more similar to hot jupiters than to isolated brown dwarfs interms of external forcing of the atmosphere by stellar insolation, kelt-1b hasan atmosphere most like that of other brown dwarfs. this suggests that surfacegravity is very important in controlling the atmospheric systems of substellarmass bodies.

0802.0327	atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters: three-dimensional circulation  models of hd 209458b and hd 189733b with simplified forcing	we present global, three-dimensional numerical simulations of the atmosphericcirculation on hd 209458b and hd 189733b and calculate the infrared spectra andlight curves predicted by these simulations, which we compare with availableobservations. radiative heating/cooling is parameterized with a simplifiednewtonian relaxation scheme. our simulations develop day-night temperaturecontrasts that vary strongly with pressure. at low pressure (&lt;10 mbar), airflows from the substellar point toward the antistellar point, both along theequator and over the poles. at deeper levels, the flow develops an eastwardequatorial jet with speeds of 3-4 km/sec, with weaker westward flows at highlatitudes. this basic flow pattern is robust to variations in model resolution,gravity, radiative time constant, and initial temperature structure. nightsidespectra show deep absorption bands of h2o, co, and/or ch4, whereas on thedayside these absorption bands flatten out or even flip into emission. thisresults from the strong effect of dynamics on the vertical temperature-pressurestructure; the temperature decreases strongly with altitude on the nightsidebut becomes almost isothermal on the dayside. in spitzer bandpasses, ourpredicted planet-to-star flux ratios vary by a factor of 2-10 with orbitalphase, depending on the wavelength and chemistry. for hd 189733b, where adetailed 8-micron light curve has been obtained, we correctly produce theobserved phase offset of the flux maximum, but we do not explain the fluxminimum and we overpredict the total flux variation. this discrepancy likelyresults from the simplifications inherent in the newtonian relaxation schemeand provides motivation for incorporating realistic radiative transfer infuture studies.

0705.0993	a map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet hd 189733b	"hot jupiter" extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked becausethey are close (&lt;0.05 astronomical units, where 1 au is the average sun-earthdistance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides andnightsides. by observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipseeach other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of thedaysides of these planets. a key question is whether the atmosphere is able totransport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which willdetermine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. here wereport observations of hd 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetarysystems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' ofthe distribution of temperatures. we detected the increase in brightness as thedayside of the planet rotated into view. we estimate a minimum brightnesstemperature of 973 +/- 33 k and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11k at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiateddayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast toa recent claim for another hot jupiter. our data indicate that the peakhemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16$\pm$6 degrees before opposition,corresponding to a hot spot shifted east of the substellar point. the secondaryeclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later thanpredicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.

0802.1705	multi-wavelength constraints on the day-night circulation patterns of hd  189733b	we present new spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot jupiterhd 189733b in the mips 24 micron bandpass, spanning the same part of theplanet's orbit as our previous observations in the irac 8 micron bandpass(knutson et al. 2007). we find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux fromthe planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this correspondsto minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-48 k and 1220 +/- 47 k, respectively. the planet reaches its maximum flux at anorbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30degrees east of the substellar point. because tidally locked hot jupiters wouldhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, thesmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet'satmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the nightside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperaturedifferences. the similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for hd189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in afundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these twowavelengths. one-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8micron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron,although the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. ifthese two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that thetemperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence thatthe atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes.

1401.1898	the atmospheric circulation of the super earth gj 1214b: dependence on  composition and metallicity	we present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of gj 1214b, a2.7 earth-radius, 6.5 earth-mass super earth detected by the mearth survey.here we explore the planet's circulation as a function of atmosphericmetallicity and atmospheric composition, modeling atmospheres with a lowmean-molecular weight (i.e., h2-dominated) and a high mean-molecular weight(i.e. water- and co2-dominated). we find that atmospheres with a lowmean-molecular weight have strong day-night temperature variations at pressuresabove the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superrotation. for theseatmospheres, the enhancement of atmospheric opacities with increasingmetallicity lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperaturevariations and hence stronger superrotation. in comparison, atmospheres with ahigh mean-molecular weight have larger day-night and equator-to-poletemperature variations than low mean-molecular weight atmospheres, butdifferences in opacity structure and energy budget lead to differences in jetstructure. the circulation of a water-dominated atmosphere is dominated byequatorial superrotation, while the circulation of a co2-dominated atmosphereis instead dominated by high-latitude jets. by comparing emergent flux spectraand lightcurves for 50x solar and water-dominated compositions, we show thatobservations in emission can break the degeneracy in determining theatmospheric composition of gj 1214b. the variation in opacity with wavelengthfor the water-dominated atmosphere leads to large phase variations within waterbands and small phase variations outside of water bands. the 50x solaratmosphere, however, yields small variations within water bands and large phasevariations at other characteristic wavelengths. these observations would bemuch less sensitive to clouds, condensates, and hazes than transitobservations.

1403.2143	atmospheric circulation of brown dwarfs: jets, vortices, and time  variability	a variety of observational evidence demonstrates that brown dwarfs exhibitactive atmospheric circulations. in this study we use a shallow-water model toinvestigate the global atmospheric dynamics in the stratified layer overlyingthe convective zone on these rapidly rotating objects. we show that theexistence and properties of the atmospheric circulation crucially depend on keyparameters including the energy injection rate and radiative timescale. underconditions of strong internal heat flux and weak radiative dissipation, abanded flow pattern comprising east-west jet streams spontaneously emerges fromthe interaction of atmospheric turbulence with the planetary rotation. incontrast, when the internal heat flux is weak and/or radiative dissipation isstrong, turbulence injected into the atmosphere damps before it canself-organize into jets, leading to a flow dominated by transient eddies andisotropic turbulence instead. the simulation results are not very sensitive tothe form of the forcing. based on the location of the transition betweenjet-dominated and eddy-dominated regimes, we suggest that many brown dwarfs mayexhibit atmospheric circulations dominated by eddies and turbulence (ratherthan jets) due to the strong radiative damping on these worlds, but a jetstructure is also possible under some realistic conditions. our simulated lightcurves capture important features from observed infrared lightcurves of browndwarfs, including amplitude variations of a few percent and shapes thatfluctuate between single-peak and multi-peak structures. more broadly, our workshows that the shallow-water system provides a useful tool to illuminatefundamental aspects of the dynamics on these worlds.

1407.1313	constraints on the atmospheric circulation and variability of the  eccentric hot jupiter xo-3b	we report secondary eclipse photometry of the hot jupiter xo-3b in the4.5~$\mu$m band taken with the infrared array camera (irac) on the spitzerspace telescope. we measure individual eclipse depths and center of eclipsetimes for a total of twelve secondary eclipses. we fit these datasimultaneously with two transits observed in the same band in order to obtain aglobal best-fit secondary eclipse depth of $0.1580\pm 0.0036\%$ and a center ofeclipse phase of $0.67004\pm 0.00013 $. we assess the relative magnitude ofvariations in the dayside brightness of the planet by measuring the size of theresiduals during ingress and egress from fitting the combined eclipse lightcurve with a uniform disk model and place an upper limit of 0.05$\%$. the newsecondary eclipse observations extend the total baseline from one and a halfyears to nearly three years, allowing us to place an upper limit on theperiastron precession rate of $2.9\times 10^{-3}$ degrees/day the tightestconstraint to date on the periastron precession rate of a hot jupiter. we usethe new transit observations to calculate improved estimates for the systemproperties, including an updated orbital ephemeris. we also use the largenumber of secondary eclipses to obtain the most stringent limits to date on theorbit-to-orbit variability of an eccentric hot jupiter and demonstrate theconsistency of multiple-epoch spitzer observations.

1407.4150	atmospheric dynamics of hot exoplanets	the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres has come of age in the lastdecade, as astronomical techniques now allow for albedos, chemical abundances,temperature profiles and maps, rotation periods and even wind speeds to bemeasured. atmospheric dynamics sets the background state of density,temperature and velocity that determines or influences the spectral andtemporal appearance of an exoplanetary atmosphere. hot exoplanets are mostamenable to these characterization techniques; in the present review, we focuson highly-irradiated, large exoplanets (the "hot jupiters"), as astronomicaldata begin to confront theoretical questions. we summarize the basicatmospheric quantities inferred from the astronomical observations. we reviewthe state of the art by addressing a series of current questions and looktowards the future by considering a separate set of exploratory questions.attaining the next level of understanding will require a concerted effort ofconstructing multi-faceted, multi-wavelength datasets for benchmark objects.understanding clouds presents a formidable obstacle, as they introducedegeneracies into the interpretation of spectra, yet their properties andexistence are directly influenced by atmospheric dynamics. confronting generalcirculation models with these multi-faceted, multi-wavelength datasets willhelp us understand these and other degeneracies. the coming decade will witnessa decisive confrontation of theory and simulation by the next generation ofastronomical data.

1407.6349	atmospheric dynamics of terrestrial exoplanets over a wide range of  orbital and atmospheric parameters	the recent discoveries of terrestrial exoplanets and super-earths extendingover a broad range of orbital and physical parameters suggest that theseplanets will span a wide range of climatic regimes. characterization of theatmospheres of warm super-earths has already begun and will be extended tosmaller and more distant planets over the coming decade. the habitability ofthese worlds may be strongly affected by their three-dimensional atmosphericcirculation regimes, since the global climate feedbacks that control the innerand outer edges of the habitable zone including transitions to snowball-likestates and runaway-greenhouse feedbacks depend on the equator-to-poletemperature differences, patterns of relative humidity, and other aspects ofthe dynamics. here, using an idealized moist atmospheric general circulationmodel including a hydrological cycle, we study the dynamical principlesgoverning the atmospheric dynamics on such planets. we show how the planetaryrotation rate, stellar flux, atmospheric mass, surface gravity, opticalthickness, and planetary radius affect the atmospheric circulation andtemperature distribution on such planets. our simulations demonstrate thatequator-to-pole temperature differences, meridional heat transport rates,structure and strength of the winds, and the hydrological cycle vary stronglywith these parameters, implying that the sensitivity of the planet to globalclimate feedbacks will depend significantly on the atmospheric circulation. weelucidate the possible climatic regimes and diagnose the mechanisms controllingthe formation of atmospheric jet streams, hadley and ferrel cells, andlatitudinal temperature differences. finally, we discuss the implications forunderstanding how the atmospheric circulation influences the global climate.

1409.5108	atmospheric circulation of eccentric hot jupiter hat-p-2b	the hot-jupiter hat-p-2b has become a prime target for spitzer spacetelescope observations aimed at understanding the atmospheric response ofexoplanets on highly eccentric orbits. here we present a suite ofthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models for hat-p-2b that investigatethe effects of assumed atmospheric composition and rotation rate on globalscale winds and thermal patterns. we compare and contrast atmospheric modelsfor hat-p-2b, which assume one and five times solar metallicity, both with andwithout tio/vo as atmospheric constituents. additionally we compare models thatassume a rotation period of half, one, and two times the nominalpseudo-synchronous rotation period. we find that changes in assumed atmosphericmetallicity and rotation rate do not significantly affect model predictions ofthe planetary flux as a function of orbital phase. however, models in whichtio/vo are present in the atmosphere develop a transient temperature inversionbetween the transit and secondary eclipse events that results in significantvariations in the timing and magnitude of the peak of the planetary fluxcompared with models in which tio/vo are omitted from the opacity tables. wefind that no one single atmospheric model can reproduce the recently observedfull orbit phase curves at 3.6, 4.5 and 8.0 microns, which is likely due to achemical process not captured by our current atmospheric models for hat-p-2b.further modeling and observational efforts focused on understanding thechemistry of hat-p-2b's atmosphere are needed and could provide key insightsinto the interplay between radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes in awide range of exoplanet atmospheres.

1410.2255	a precise water abundance measurement for the hot jupiter wasp-43b	the water abundance in a planetary atmosphere provides a key constraint onthe planet's primordial origins because water ice is expected to play animportant role in the core accretion model of planet formation. however, thewater content of the solar system giant planets is not well known because wateris sequestered in clouds deep in their atmospheres. by contrast, short-periodexoplanets have such high temperatures that their atmospheres have water in thegas phase, making it possible to measure the water abundance for these objects.we present a precise determination of the water abundance in the atmosphere ofthe 2 $m_\mathrm{jup}$ short-period exoplanet wasp-43b based on thermalemission and transmission spectroscopy measurements obtained with the hubblespace telescope. we find the water content is consistent with the valueexpected in a solar composition gas at planetary temperatures (0.4-3.5x solarat 1 $\sigma$ confidence). the metallicity of wasp-43b's atmosphere suggestedby this result extends the trend observed in the solar system of lower metalenrichment for higher planet masses.

1410.2382	the atmospheric circulation of the hot jupiter wasp-43b: comparing  three-dimensional models to spectrophotometric data	the hot jupiter wasp-43b has now joined the ranks of transiting hot jupitershd 189733b and hd 209458b as an exoplanet with a large array of observationalconstraints on its atmospheric properties. because wasp-43b receives a similarstellar flux as hd 209458b but has a rotation rate 4 times faster and a muchhigher gravity, studying wasp-43b serves as a test of the effect of rotationrate and gravity on the circulation when stellar irradiation is heldapproximately constant. here we present 3d atmospheric circulation models ofwasp-43b using the sparc/mitgcm, a coupled radiation and circulation model,exploring the effects of composition, metallicity, and frictional drag. we findthat the circulation regime of wasp-43b is not unlike other hot jupiters, withequatorial superrotation that yields an eastward-shifted hotspot and largeday-night temperature variations (~600 k at photospheric pressures). we thencompare our model results to observations from stevenson et al. which utilizehst/wfc3 to collect spectrophotometric phase curve measurements of wasp-43bfrom 1.12-1.65 microns. our results show the 5x solar model lightcurve providesa good match to the data, with a phase offset of peak flux and planet/star fluxratio that is similar to observations; however, the model nightside appears tobe brighter. nevertheless, our 5x solar model provides an excellent match tothe wfc3 dayside emission spectrum. this is a major success, as the result is anatural outcome of the 3d dynamics with no model tuning, and differssignificantly from 1d models that can generally only match observations whenappropriately tuned. in sum, these results demonstrate that 3d circulationmodels can provide important insights in interpreting exoplanet atmosphericobservations, even at high spectral resolution, and highlight the potential forfuture observations with hst, jwst and other next-generation telescopes.

1411.2911	hst rotational spectral mapping of two l-type brown dwarfs: variability  in and out of water bands indicates high-altitude haze layers	we present time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of two l5 dwarfs, 2massj18212815+1414010 and 2mass j15074759-1627386, observed with the wide fieldcamera 3 instrument on the hubble space telescope (hst). we study thewavelength dependence of rotation-modulated flux variations between 1.1 $\mu$mand 1.7 $\mu$m. we find that the water absorption bands of the two l5 dwarfs at1.15 $\mu$m and 1.4 $\mu$m vary at similar amplitudes as the adjacentcontinuum. this differs from the results of previous hst observations of l/ttransition dwarfs, in which the water absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m displaysvariations of about half of the amplitude at other wavelengths. we find thatthe relative amplitude of flux variability out of the water band with respectto that in the water band shows a increasing trend from the l5 dwarfs towardthe early t dwarfs. we utilize the models of saumon &amp; marley (2008) and findthat the observed variability of the l5 dwarfs can be explained by the presenceof spatially varying high-altitude haze layers above the condensate clouds.therefore, our observations show that the heterogeneity of haze layers - thedriver of the variability - must be located at very low pressures, where eventhe water opacity is negligible. in the near future, the rotational spectralmapping technique could be utilized for other atomic and molecular species toprobe different pressure levels in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs andexoplanets and uncover both horizontal and vertical cloud structures.

1411.4731	three-dimensional atmospheric circulation of warm and hot jupiters:  effects of orbital distance, rotation period, and non-synchronous rotation	efforts to characterize extrasolar giant planet (egp) atmospheres have so faremphasized planets within 0.05 au of their stars. despite this focus, knownegps populate a continuum of orbital separations from canonical hot jupitervalues (0.03-0.05 au) out to 1 au and beyond. unlike typical hot jupiters,these more distant egps will not in general be synchronously rotating. inanticipation of observations of this population, we here presentthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models exploring the dynamics thatemerge over a broad range of rotation rates and incident stellar fluxesappropriate for warm and hot jupiters. we find that the circulation resides inone of two basic regimes. on typical hot jupiters, the strong day-night heatingcontrast leads to a broad, fast superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet andlarge day-night temperature differences. at faster rotation rates and lowerincident fluxes, however, the day-night heating gradient becomes lessimportant, and baroclinic instabilities emerge as a dominant player, leading toeastward jets in the midlatitudes, minimal temperature variations in longitude,and, in many cases, weak winds at the equator. our most rapidly rotating andleast irradiated models exhibit multiple eastward jets in eachhemisphere--similar to the jets on jupiter and saturn--and illuminate thedynamical continuum between highly irradiated egps and the weakly irradiatedgiant planets of our own solar system. we present infrared (ir) light curvesand spectra of these models, which show that the amplitude and offset of the irphase variation, as well as the shape of the spectra, depend significantly onincident flux and rotation rate. this provides a way to identify the regimetransition in future observations and suggests that, in some cases, ir lightcurves can provide constraints on the rotation rate of non-synchronouslyrotating planets.

1411.7404	spitzer secondary eclipses of the dense, modestly-irradiated, giant  exoplanet hat-p-20b using pixel-level decorrelation	hat-p-20b is a giant exoplanet that orbits a metal-rich star. the planetitself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a highmetallicity in its atmosphere. we analyze two eclipses of the planet in each ofthe 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of warm spitzer. these data exhibit intra-pixeldetector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditionaldecorrelation methods. we have developed a simple, powerful, and radicallydifferent method to correct the intra-pixel effect for warm spitzer data, whichwe call pixel-level decorrelation (pld). pld corrects the intra-pixel effectvery effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - thefluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. we illustrate andvalidate pld using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results toprevious analyses. pld can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise inspitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to beintractable using other methods. our successful pld analysis of four hat-p-20beclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29k, indicatinginefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strongmolecular absorption. we find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength byspitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for jwst spectroscopy. allfour eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating aslightly eccentric orbit. a joint fit of the eclipse and transit times withextant rv data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), andestablishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence.given the existence of a bound stellar companion, hat-p-20b is anotherexcellent candidate for orbital evolution via kozai migration or otherthree-body mechanism.

1504.05586	a detection of water in the transmission spectrum of the hot jupiter  wasp-12b and implications for its atmospheric composition	detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements oftheir atmospheric properties that constrain the planets' origins and evolution.for example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hotjupiter wasp-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygenratio (c/o $&gt;$ 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than iscommonly assumed for giant planets. here we report a precise near-infraredtransmission spectrum for wasp-12b based on six transit observations with thehubble space telescope/wide field camera 3. we bin the data in 13spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 - 1.67 $\mu$m and measure the transitdepths to a median precision of 51 ppm. we retrieve the atmospheric propertiesusing the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption(7$\sigma$ confidence). this detection marks the first high-confidence,spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of wasp-12b. theretrieved 1$\sigma$ water volume mixing ratio is between $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$,which is consistent with c/o $&gt;$ 1 to within 2$\sigma$. however, we alsointroduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for c/o and metallicityunder the assumption of chemical equilibrium. with this approach, we constrainc/o to $0.5^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ at $1\,\sigma$ and rule out a carbon-rich atmospherecomposition (c/o$&gt;1$) at $&gt;3\sigma$ confidence. further observations andmodeling of the planet's global thermal structure and dynamics would aid inresolving the tension between our inferred c/o and previous constraints. ourfindings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data withmultiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on thechemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.

1508.00902	spitzer secondary eclipse observations of five cool gas giant planets  and empirical trends in cool planet emission spectra	in this work we present spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron secondary eclipseobservations of five new cool (&lt;1200 k) transiting gas giant planets:hat-p-19b, wasp-6b, wasp-10b, wasp-39b, and wasp-67b. we compare our measuredeclipse depths to the predictions of a suite of atmosphere models and toeclipse depths for planets with previously published observations in order toconstrain the temperature- and mass-dependent properties of gas giant planetatmospheres. we find that the dayside emission spectra of planets less massivethan jupiter require models with efficient circulation of energy to the nightside and/or increased albedos, while those with masses greater than that ofjupiter are consistently best-matched by models with inefficient circulationand low albedos. at these relatively low temperatures we expect the atmosphericmethane to co ratio to vary as a function of metallicity, and we therefore useour observations of these planets to constrain their atmospheric metallicities.we find that the most massive planets have dayside emission spectra that arebest-matched by solar metallicity atmosphere models, but we are not able toplace strong constraints on metallicities of the smaller planets in our sample.interestingly, we find that the ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron brightnesstemperatures for these cool transiting planets is independent of planettemperature, and instead exhibits a tentative correlation with planet mass. ifthis trend can be confirmed, it would suggest that the shape of these planets'emission spectra depends primarily on their masses, consistent with thehypothesis that lower-mass planets are more likely to have metal-richatmospheres.

1512.04341	a continuum from clear to cloudy hot-jupiter exoplanets without  primordial water depletion	thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectralanalysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number ofexoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1to 1.7 {\mu}m). recent studies show that some hot-jupiter exoplanets have muchweaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted.the low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low waterabundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetarydisk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this levelof depletion can actually occur. alternatively, these weak signals could be theresult of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra.here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot jupiters coveringthe wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both theoptical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. ourresults reveal a diverse group of hot jupiters that exhibit a continuum fromclear to cloudy atmospheres. we find that the difference between the planetaryradius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric fordistinguishing different atmosphere types. the difference correlates with thespectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen inclear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with cloudsand hazes. this result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion duringformation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weakerspectral signatures.

astro-ph;0202234	evolution of "51peg b-like" planets	about one-quarter of the extrasolar giant planets discovered so far haveorbital distances smaller than 0.1 au. these ``51peg b-like'' planets can nowbe directly characterized, as shown by the planet transiting in front the starhd209458. we review the processes that affect their evolution.  we apply our work to the case of hd209458b, whose radius has been recentlymeasured. we argue that its radius can be reproduced only when the deepatmosphere is assumed to be unrealistically hot. when using more realisticatmospheric temperatures, an energy source appears to be missing in order toexplain hd209458b's large size. the most likely source of energy available isnot in the planet's spin or orbit, but in the intense radiation received fromthe parent star. we show that the radius of hd209458b can be reproduced if asmall fraction (~1%) of the stellar flux is transformed into kinetic energy inthe planetary atmosphere and subsequently converted to thermal energy bydynamical processes at pressures of tens of bars.

astro-ph;0202236	atmospheric circulation and tides of "51peg b-like" planets	we examine the properties of the atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets atorbital distances smaller than 0.1 au from their stars. we show that these``51peg b-like'' planets are rapidly synchronized by tidal interactions, butthat small departures from synchronous rotation can occur because offluid-dynamical torques within these planets. previous radiative-transfer andevolution models of such planets assume a homogeneous atmosphere. nevertheless,we show using simple arguments that, at the photosphere, the day-nighttemperature difference and characteristic wind speeds may reach ~500 k and ~2km/s, respectively. substantial departures from chemical equilibrium areexpected. the cloud coverage depends sensitively on the dynamics; clouds couldexist predominantly either on the dayside or nightside, depending on thecirculation regime. radiative-transfer models that assume homogeneousconditions are therefore inadequate in describing the atmospheric properties of51peg b-like planets. we present preliminary three-dimensional, nonlinearsimulations of the atmospheric circulation of hd209458b that indicate plausiblepatterns for the circulation and generally agree with our simpler estimates.furthermore, we show that kinetic energy production in the atmosphere can leadto the deposition of substantial energy in the interior, with crucialconsequences for the evolution of these planets. future measurements ofreflected and thermally-emitted radiation from these planets will help test ourideas.

astro-ph;0601092	resolving the surfaces of extrasolar planets with secondary eclipse  light curves	we present a method that employs the secondary eclipse light curves oftransiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their thermalemission. this technique permits an observer to resolve the surface of theplanet without the need to spatially resolve its central star. we evaluate thefeasibility of this technique for the hd 209458 system [..]. we consider tworepresentations of the planetary thermal emission; a simple model parameterizedby a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, as well as the results ofa three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary atmosphere previouslypublished by cooper &amp; showman. we find that observations of the secondaryeclipse light curve are most sensitive to a longitudinal offset in thegeometric and photometric centroids of the hemisphere of the planet visiblenear opposition. to quantify this signal, we define a new parameter, the``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observedsecondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with a uniform surface fluxdistribution. we compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for hd209458 with the precision with which it could be measured with irac. we findthat irac observations at 3.6um a single secondary eclipse should permitsufficient precision to confirm or reject the cooper &amp; showman model of thesurface flux distribution for this planet. we quantify the signal-to-noiseratio for this offset in the remaining irac bands (4.5um, 5.8um, and 8.0um),and find that a modest improvement in photometric precision (as might berealized through observations of several eclipse events) should permit asimilarly robust detection.

astro-ph;0602477	dynamics and disequilibrium carbon chemistry in hot jupiter atmospheres,  with application to hd 209458b	chemical equilibrium considerations suggest that, assuming solar elementalabundances, carbon on hd 209458b is sequestered primarily as carbon monoxide(co) and methane (ch4). the relative mole fractions of co(g) and ch4(g) inchemical equilibrium are expected to vary greatly according to variations inlocal temperature and pressure. we show, however, that in the p = 1--1000 mbarrange, chemical equilibrium does not hold. to explore disequilibrium effects,we couple the chemical kinetics of co and ch4 to a three-dimensional numericalmodel of hd 209458b's atmospheric circulation. these simulations show thatvigorous dynamics caused by uneven heating of this tidally locked planethomogenize the co and ch4 concentrations at p &lt; 1 bar, even in the presence oflateral temperature variations of ~500--1000 k. in the 1--1000 mbar pressurerange, we find that over 98% of the carbon is in co. this is true even in coolregions where ch4 is much more stable thermodynamically. our work showsfurthermore that planets 300--500 k cooler than hd 209458b can also haveabundant co in their upper layers due to disequilibrium effects. we demonstrateseveral interesting observational consequences of these results.

0809.2089	atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters: coupled radiative-dynamical  general circulation model simulations of hd 189733b and hd 209458b	we present global, three-dimensional numerical simulations of hd 189733b andhd 209458b that couple the atmospheric dynamics to a realistic representationof non-gray cloud-free radiative transfer. the model, which we call thesubstellar and planetary atmospheric radiation and circulation (sparc) model,adopts the mitgcm for the dynamics and uses the radiative model of mckay,marley, fortney, and collaborators for the radiation. like earlier work withsimplified forcing, our simulations develop a broad eastward equatorial jet,mean westward flow at higher latitudes, and substantial flow over the poles atlow pressure. for hd 189733b, our simulations without tio and vo opacity canexplain the broad features of the observed 8 and 24-micron light curves,including the modest day-night flux variation and the fact that the planet/starflux ratio peaks before the secondary eclipse. our simulations also providereasonable matches to the spitzer secondary-eclipse depths at 4.5, 5.8, 8, 16,and 24 microns and the groundbased upper limit at 2.2 microns. however, wesubstantially underpredict the 3.6-micron secondary-eclipse depth, suggestingthat our simulations are too cold in the 0.1-1 bar region. predicted temporalvariability in secondary-eclipse depths is ~1% at spitzer bandpasses,consistent with recent observational upper limits at 8 microns. we also showthat nonsynchronous rotation can significantly alter the jet structure. for hd209458b, we include tio and vo opacity; these simulations develop a hot (&gt;2000k) dayside stratosphere. despite this stratosphere, we do not reproduce currentspitzer photometry of this planet. light curves in spitzer bandpasses showmodest phase variation and satisfy the observational upper limit on day-nightphase variation at 8 microns.
