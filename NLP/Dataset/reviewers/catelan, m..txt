0901.4476	radial extent of the sgb in ngc 1851	recent hst-acs observations revealed the presence of a double subgiant branch(sgb) in the core of the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851. this peculiaritywas tentatively explained by the presence of a second population with either anage difference of about 1 gyr, or a higher c+n+o abundance, probably due topollution by the first generation of stars.  in the present letter, we analyze vlt-fors v,i images, covering 12.7x12.7arcmin, in the southwest quadrant of the cluster, allowing us to probe theextent of the double sgb from ~1.4 to ~13 arcmin from the cluster center. ourstudy reveals, for the first time, that the "peculiar" population is the oneassociated to the fainter sgb. indeed, while the percentage of stars in thissequence is about 45% in the cluster core (as previously found on the basis ofhst-acs data), we find that it drops sharply, to a level consistent with zeroin our data, at ~2.4 arcmin from the cluster center, where the brighter sgb, inour sample, still contains ~100 stars. implications for the proposed scenariosare discussed.

0906.0700	the leo iv dwarf spheroidal galaxy: color-magnitude diagram and  pulsating stars	we present the first v, b-v color-magnitude diagram of the leo iv dwarfspheroidal galaxy, a faint milky way satellite recently discovered by the sloandigital sky survey. we have obtained b,v time-series photometry reaching abouthalf a magnitude below the leo iv turnoff, which we detect at v= 24.7 mag, andhave performed the first study of the variable star population. we haveidentified three rr lyrae stars (all fundamental-mode pulsators, rrab) and onesx phoenicis variable in the galaxy. in the period-amplitude diagram the leo ivrr lyrae stars are located close to the loci of oosterhoff type i systems andthe evolved fundamental-mode rr lyrae stars in the galactic globular clusterm3. however, their mean pulsation period, $&lt;p{\rm ab}&gt;$=0.655 days, wouldsuggest an oosterhoff type ii classification for this galaxy. the rr lyraestars trace very well the galaxy's horizontal branch, setting its averagemagnitude at $&lt;v_{\rm rr}&gt;= 21.48 \pm 0.03$ mag (standard deviation of themean). this leads to a distance modulus of $\mu_{0}=20.94 \pm 0.07$ mag,corresponding to a distance of $154 \pm 5$ kpc, by adopting for the leo iv dspha reddening $e(b-v) = 0.04 \pm 0.01$ mag and a metallicity of [fe/h] = -2.31$\pm$ 0.10.

0908.1990	discovery of the extremely energetic supernova 2008fz	we report on the discovery and initial observations of the energetic type iinsupernova (sn), 2008fz. the optical energy emitted by sn 2008fz (based on thelight curve over a 88 day period), is possibly the most ever observed for asupernova (1.4 x 10^51 erg). the event was more luminous than the type iin sn2006gy, but exhibited same smooth, slowly evolving light curve. as ischaracteristic of type iin sn, the early spectra of 2008fz initially exhibitednarrow balmer lines which were replaced by a broader component at later times.the spectra also show a blue continuum with no signs of ca or na absorption,suggesting that there is little extinction due to intragalatic dust in the hostor circumstellar material. no host galaxy is identified in prior coadded imagesreaching r ~ 22. from the supernova's redshift, z=0.133, we place an upperlimit on the host of m_r=-17. the presence of the sn within such a faint hostfollows the majority of recently discovered highly luminous sn. a possiblereason for this occurrence is the very high star formation rate occurring inlow-mass galaxies in combination with the low metallicity environment, whichmakes the production of very massive stars possible. we determine the peakabsolute magnitude of the event to be m_v = -22.3 from the initial photometryand the redshift distance, placing it among the most luminous supernovaediscovered.

0910.2543	a new lower main sequence eclipsing binary with detached components	we present an analysis of ngc2204-s892 -- a new detached eclipsing binarycomposed of two late k dwarfs. based on three photometric campaigns launched in2008 we obtained 5 light curves (3 in v, 1 in b and 1 in i), and derived anorbital period of 0.451780+-0.000001 d. we also obtained 20 vlt/uves spectra,enabling accurate radial velocity measurements. the derived masses and radii ofthe components (m1 = 0.733 +-0.005 msun and r1 = 0.72 +-0.01 rsun; m2 = 0.662+-0.005 msun and r2 = 0.68 \+-0.02 rsun) are consistent with the empiricalmass-radius relationship established recently for lower main sequence stars inbinary systems; in particular we find that both stars are oversized compared totheoretical models. ngc2204-s892 is very active: both components show variableemission in halpha and hbeta and are heavily spotted, causing the light curveto show appreciable changes on a timescale of weeks. our results add to theincreasing evidence that the observed inflation of the radii of k and m starsis related to high levels of magnetic activity.

0911.1686	the globular cluster ngc 5286. ii. variable stars	we present the results of a search for variable stars in the globular clusterngc 5286, which has recently been suggested to be associated with the canismajor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. 57 variable stars were detected, only 19 ofwhich had previously been known. among our detections one finds 52 rr lyrae (22rrc and 30 rrab), 4 lpv's, and 1 type ii cepheid of the bl herculis type.periods are derived for all of the rr lyrae as well as the cepheid, and bvlight curves are provided for all the variables.  the mean period of the rrab variables is &lt;pab&gt; = 0.656 days, and the numberfraction of rrc stars is n(c)/n(rr) = 0.42, both consistent with an oosterhoffii (ooii) type -- thus making ngc 5286 one of the most metal-rich ([fe/h] =-1.67; harris 1996) ooii globulars known to date. the minimum period of the\rrab's, namely pab,min = 0.513 d, while still consistent with an ooiiclassification, falls towards the short end of the observed pab,mindistribution for ooii globular clusters. as was recently found in the case ofthe prototypical ooii globular cluster m15 (ngc 7078), the distribution ofstars in the bailey diagram does not strictly conform to the previouslyreported locus for ooii stars.  we provide fourier decomposition parameters for all of the rr lyrae starsdetected in our survey, and discuss the physical parameters derived therefrom.the values derived for the rrc's are not consistent with those typically foundfor ooii clusters, which may be due to the cluster's relatively highmetallicity -- the latter being confirmed by our fourier analysis of theab-type rr lyrae light curves. we derive for the cluster a revised distancemodulus of (m-m)v = 16.04 mag.

0912.1056	vista variables in the via lactea (vvv): the public eso near-ir  variability survey of the milky way	we describe the public eso near-ir variability survey (vvv) scanning themilky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane where star formationactivity is high. the survey will take 1929 hours of observations with the4-metre vista telescope during five years (2010-2014), covering ~10^9 pointsources across an area of 520 deg^2, including 33 known globular clusters and~350 open clusters. the final product will be a deep near-ir atlas in fivepassbands (0.9-2.5 microns) and a catalogue of more than 10^6 variable pointsources. unlike single-epoch surveys that, in most cases, only produce 2-dmaps, the vvv variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-d map ofthe surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as rr lyraestars, and cepheids. it will yield important information on the ages of thepopulations. the observations will be combined with data from macho, ogle,eros, vst, spitzer, hst, chandra, integral, wise, fermi lat, xmm-newton, gaiaand alma for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the innermilky way. this public survey will provide data available to the wholecommunity and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the milkyway, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the galacticbulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions inthe disk. the combined variable star catalogues will have importantimplications for theoretical investigations of pulsation properties of stars.

0912.1501	pulsation period changes as a tool to identify pre-zero age horizontal  branch stars	one of the most dramatic events in the life of a low-mass star is the heflash, which takes place at the tip of the red giant branch (rgb) and isfollowed by a series of secondary flashes before the star settles into thezero-age horizontal branch (zahb). yet, no stars have been positivelyidentified in this key evolutionary phase, mainly for two reasons: first, thispre-zahb phase is very short compared to other major evolutionary phases in thelife of a star; and second, these pre-zahb stars are expected to overlap theloci occupied by asymptotic giant branch (agb), hb and rgb stars observed inthe color-magnitude diagram (cmd). we investigate the possibility of detectingthese stars through stellar pulsations, since some of them are expected torapidly cross the cepheid/rr lyrae instability strip in their route from thergb tip to the zahb, thus becoming pulsating stars along the way. as aconsequence of their very high evolutionary speed, some of these stars maypresent anomalously large period change rates. we constructed an extensive gridof stellar models and produced pre-zahb monte carlo simulations appropriate forthe case of the galactic globular cluster m3 (ngc 5272), where a number of rrlyrae stars with high period change rates are found. our results suggest thatsome -- but certainly not all -- of the rr lyrae stars in m3 with large periodchange rates are in fact pre-zahb pulsators.

0708.0405	variable stars in the fornax dsph galaxy. i. the globular cluster fornax  4	variable stars have been identified for the first time in fornax 4, theglobular cluster located near the center of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy.by applying the image subtraction technique to b,v time series photometryobtained with the magic camera of the 6.5-m magellan/clay telescope and withthe wide field imager of the 4-m blanco/ctio telescope, we detected 27 rr lyraestars (22 fundamental mode, 3 first overtone, and 2 double-mode pulsators) in a2.4'x2.4' area centered on fornax 4. the average and minimum periods of theab-type rr lyrae stars, &lt;pab&gt;= 0.594 d and p(ab,min)=0.5191 d, respectively, aswell as the revised position of the cluster in the horizontal branchtype--metallicity plane, all consistently point to an oosterhoff-intermediatestatus for the cluster, unlike what is seen for the vast majority of galacticglobular clusters, but in agreement with previous indications for the otherglobular clusters in fornax.  the average apparent magnitude of the rr lyrae stars located within 30 arcsecfrom the cluster center is &lt;v(rr)&gt;=21.43 +/- 0.03 mag (sigma=0.10 mag, averageon 12 stars), leading to a true distance modulus of (m-m)o=20.64 +/- 0.09 magor (m-m)o=20.53 +/- 0.09 mag, depending on whether a low ([fe/h]=-2.0) or amoderately high ([fe/h]=-1.5) metallicity is adopted.

0708.1736	the peculiar horizontal branch morphology of the galactic globular  clusters ngc 6388 and ngc 6441: new insights from uv observations	in this paper we present multiband optical and uv hubble space telescopephotometry of the two galactic globular clusters ngc 6388 and ngc 6441. we haveobtained the first uv color-magnitude diagrams for ngc 6388 and ngc 6441. thesediagrams confirm previous results, obtained in optical bands, about thepresence of a sizeable stellar population of extremely hot horizontal branchstars. at least in ngc 6388, we find a clear indication that at the hot end ofthe horizontal branch the distribution of stars forms a hook-like feature,closely resembling those observed in ngc 2808 and omega centauri. we brieflyreview the theoretical scenarios that have been suggested for interpreting thisobservational feature. we also investigate the tilted horizontal branchmorphology and provide further evidence that supports early suggestions thatthis feature cannot be interpreted as an effect of differential reddening. weshow that a possible solution of the puzzle is to assume that a small fraction- ranging between 10-20% - of the stellar population in the two clusters isstrongly helium enriched (y=0.40 in ngc 6388 and y=0.35 in ngc 6441). theoccurrence of a spread in the he abundance between the canonical value (y=0.26)and the quoted upper limits can significantly help in explaining the wholemorphology of the horizontal branch and the pulsational properties of thevariable stars in the target clusters.

0708.2445	horizontal branch stars and the ultraviolet universe	extremely hot horizontal branch (hb) stars and their progeny are widelyconsidered to be responsible for the "ultraviolet upturn" (or uvx) phenomenonobserved in elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spirals. yet, the preciseevolutionary channels that lead to the production of these stars remain thesource of much debate. in this review, we discuss two key physical ingredientsthat are required in order for reliable quantitative models of the uv output ofstellar populations to be computed, namely, the mass loss rates of red giantbranch stars and the helium enrichment "law" at high metallicities. inparticular, the recent evidence pointing towards a strong enhancement in theabundances of the alpha-elements in the galactic bulge (compared to the disk),and also the available indications of a similar overabundance in (massive)elliptical galaxies, strongly suggest that the helium abundance y may be higherin ellipticals and bulges than it is in spiral disks by an amount that mayreach up to 0.15 at [fe/h] ~ +0.5. if so, this would strongly favor theproduction of hot hb stars at high metallicity in galactic spheroids. we alsodiscuss the existence of mass loss recipes beyond the commonly adopted reimers"law" that are not only more consistent with the available empirical data, butalso much more favorable to the production of extended hb stars at highmetallicity. finally, we discuss new empirical evidence that suggests thatdifferent evolutionary channels may be responsible for the production of ehbstars in the field and in clusters.

1009.3048	discovery of eclipsing white dwarf systems in a search for earth-size  companions	although white dwarfs are believed to be the end point of most stellarevolution, unlike main sequence stars, they have not yet been the subject ofdedicated time-domain surveys for exoplanets. we discuss how their size anddistinctive colour make them excellent targets for wide-field searches forexoplanets. in particular, we note that planets of earth-size can give rise tomulti-magnitude eclipses of massive white dwarfs. such a large signal is almostunmistakable and would be detectable even with very low-precision photometry.for objects of smaller size, the high accuracy photometry currently being usedto detect super-earth and smaller planets transiting sun-sized stars, iscapable of revealing minor planets down to r~100km as they transit whitedwarfs. such observations can be used to test current evidence forasteroid-size objects being the cause for dust rings which have recently beenobserved for a number of white dwarfs. no other current exoplanet search methodis capable of detecting such exo-asteroids. as an initial test of this searchstrategy, we combine synoptic data from the catalina sky survey withmulti-colour photometry and spectra from the sloan digital sky survey to search~12,000 white dwarf lightcurves for eclipsing events. we find 20 new eclipsingwhite dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions. this doubles the number ofknown eclipsing white dwarfs and is expected to enable the determination ofaccurate white dwarf radii. three of the discoveries have radii consistent withsubstellar systems and show no evidence of flux from the eclipsing object intheir sdss optical spectra, or near-ir data.

1009.4951	an overview of the rotational behavior of metal--poor stars	the present paper describes the behavior of the rotational velocity inmetal--poor stars ([fe/h]&lt;-0.5 dex) in different evolutionary stages, based onvsini values from the literature. our sample is comprised of stars in the fieldand some galactic globular clusters, including stars on the main sequence, thered giant branch (rgb), and the horizontal branch (hb). the metal--poor starsare, mainly, slow rotators, and their vsini distribution along the hr diagramis quite homogeneous. nevertheless, a few moderate to high values of vsini arefound in stars located on the main sequence and on the hb. we show that theoverall distribution of vsini values is basically independent of metallicityfor the stars in our sample. in particular, the fast-rotating main sequencestars in our sample present similar rotation rates as their metal-richcounterparts, suggesting that some of them may actually be fairly young, inspite of their low metallicity, or else that at least some of them would bebetter classified as blue straggler stars. we do not find significant evidenceof evolution in vsini values as a function of position on the rgb; inparticular, we do not confirm previous suggestions that stars close to the rgbtip rotate faster than their less evolved counterparts. while the presence offast rotators among moderately cool blue hb stars has been suggested to be dueto angular momentum transport from a stellar core that has retained significantangular momentum during its prior evolution, we find that any such transportmechanisms must likely operate very fast as the star arrives on the zero-age hb(zahb), since we do not find a link between evolution off the zahb and vsinivalues.  we present an extensive tabulation of all quantities discussed in this paper,including rotation velocities, temperatures, gravitie

1106.6082	formation of multiple populations in globular clusters: another possible  scenario	while chemical composition spreads are now believed to be a universalcharacteristic of globular clusters (gcs), not all of them present multiplepopulations in their color-magnitude diagrams (cmds). here we present a newscenario for the formation of gcs, in an attempt to qualitatively explain thisotherwise intriguing observational framework. our scenario divides gcs intothree groups, depending on the initial mass (m_i) of the progenitor structure(ps), as follows. i) massive pss can retain the gas ejected by massive stars,including the ejecta of core-collapse sne. ii) intermediate-mass pss can retainat least a fraction of the fast winds of massive stars, but none of thecore-collapse sne ejecta. iii) low-mass pss can only retain the slow winds ofintermediate-mass stars. members of the first group would include omegacentauri (ngc 5139), m54 (ngc 6715), m22 (ngc 6656), and terzan 5, whereas ngc2808 (and possibly ngc 2419) would be members of the second group. theremaining gcs which only present a spread in light elements, such as o and na,would be members of the third group. according to our scenario, the differentcomponents in omega cen should not display a sizeable spread in age. we arguethat this is consistent with the available observations. we give other simplearguments in favor of our scenario, which can be described in terms of two mainanalytical relations: i) between the actual observed ratio between first andsecond generation stars (r_sg^fg) and the fraction of first generation starsthat have been lost by the gc (s_l); and ii) between s_l and m_i. we alsosuggest a series of future improvements and empirical tests that may helpdecide whether the proposed scenario properly describes the chemical evolutionof gcs.

1109.1854	three galactic globular cluster candidates	the census of galactic globular clusters (gcs) is still incomplete, and aboutten new objects are supposed to await discovery, hidden behind the crowded andreddened regions of the galactic bulge and disk. we investigated the nature ofthree new gc candidates, discovered in the frames collected by the vistavariables in the via lactea (vvv) near-infrared survey. they will be called vvvcl002, vvv cl003, and vvv cl004. we studied the results ofpoint-spread-function near-infrared photometry from vvv data for the threeobjects and their surrounding fields, the proper motion information availablein the literature and, when possible, we derived the cluster parameters bymeans of calibrated indices measured on the color-magnitude diagrams. theevidence shows that vvv cl002 is a newly discovered, small, moderatelymetal-rich (fe/h -0.4) galactic gc. it is located at a galactocentric distanceof 0.7+-0.9 kpc, and it could be one of the nearest gc to the galactic center.its characteristics are more similar to those of low-mass, palomar-like gcsthan to more classical, old, and massive bulge gcs. vvv cl003 is the first starcluster discovered in the galactic disk on the opposite side of the center withrespect to the sun, at a galactocentric distance of ~5 kpc. its highmetallicity (fe/h -0.1) and location point to an open cluster, but a gc cannotbe excluded. vvv cl004, on the contrary, is most probably only a random clumpof field stars, as indicated by both its low statistical significance and bythe impossibility to distinguish its stars from the surrounding fieldpopulation. we claim the detection of i) a new galactic gc, deriving anestimate of its basic parameters; ii) a stellar aggregate, probably an opencluster, in the disk directly beyond the galactic center; and iii) anoverdensity of stars, most probably an asterism.

0711.0506	binaries among extreme horizontal branch stars in globular clusters	following a review of our present knowledge about blue subdwarf stars inglobular clusters, we present an overview of the results of searches for closebinaries among these stars, including results previously published in theliterature and reporting recent and preliminary results of new data. previousinvestigations revealed a lack of close systems in ngc 6752, which we confirmwith new, more extensive observations. our estimate of the close binaryfraction in this cluster is only 4%. from a review of the relevant literature,there are indications that a low close binary fraction among extreme horizontalbranch (ehb) stars is a common feature in globular star clusters. on the otherhand, the field ehb population shows evidence of a remarkably high binaryfraction. such a difference among globular cluster and field populations,although not yet explained in detail on the basis of theoretical models, mustnecessarily be related to different formation histories for ehb stars in thefield and in clusters. in this framework, preliminary results indicate thatclose systems could be relatively common in the peculiar globular cluster ngc2808, although the sample of studied stars is still small. this would implythat not all clusters share the same behavior, as far as ehb star formation isconcerned. we briefly explore possible explanations for these results.

1205.1344	the complex case of v445 lyr observed with kepler: two blazhko  modulations, a non-radial mode, possible triple mode rr lyrae pulsation, and  more	rapid and strong changes in the blazhko modulation of rr lyrae stars, as theyhave recently been detected in high precision satellite data, have become acrucial topic in finding an explanation of the long-standing mystery of theblazhko effect. we present here an analysis of the most extreme case detectedso far, the rrab star v445 lyr (kic 6186029) which was observed with the keplerspace mission. v445 lyr shows very strong cycle-to-cycle changes in its blazhkomodulation, which are caused both by a secondary long-term modulation period aswell as irregular variations. in addition to the complex blazhko modulation,v445 lyr also shows a rich spectrum of additional peaks in the frequency rangebetween the fundamental pulsation and the first harmonic. among those peaks,the second radial overtone could be identified, which, combined with ametallicity estimate of [fe/h]=-2.0 dex from spectroscopy, allowed to constrainthe mass (0.55-0.65 m_sun) and luminosity (40-50 l_sun) of v445 lyr throughtheoretical petersen diagrams. a non-radial mode as well as possibly the firstovertone are also excited. furthermore, v445 lyr shows signs of the perioddoubling phenomenon and a long term period change. a detailed fourier analysisalong with a study of the o-c variation of v445 lyr is presented, and theorigin of the additional peaks and possible causes of the changes in theblazhko modulation are discussed. the results are then put into context withthose of the only other star with a variable blazhko effect for which a longenough set of high precision continuous satellite data has been published sofar, the corot star 105288363.

1206.4565	variable stars in the globular cluster m28 (ngc 6626)	we present a new search for variable stars in the galactic globular clusterm28 (ngc 6626). the search is based on a series of bvi images obtained with thesmarts consortium's 1.3m telescope at cerro tololo inter-american observatory,chile. the search was carried out using the isis v2.2 image subtractionpackage. we find a total of 25 variable stars in the field of the cluster, 9being new discoveries. of the newly found variables, 1 is an ab-type rr lyraestar, 6 are c-type rr lyrae, and 2 are long-period/semi-regular variables. v22,previously classified as a type ii cepheid, appears as a bona-fide rrc in ourdata. in turn, v20, previously classified as an ab-type rr lyrae, could not beproperly phased with any reasonable period. the properties of the ab-type rrlyrae stars in m28 appear most consistent with an oosterhoff-intermediateclassification, which is unusual for bona-fide galactic globulars clusters.however, the cluster's c-type variables do not clearly support such anoosterhoff type, and a hybrid oosterhoff i/ii system is accordingly anotherpossibility, thus raising the intriguing possibility of multiple populationsbeing present in m28. coordinates, periods, and light curves in differentialfluxes are provided for all the detected variables.

1208.5127	effects of helium enrichment in globular clusters i.theoretical plane  with pgpuc stellar evolution code	recently, the study of globular cluster (gc) cmds has shown that some of themharbor multiple populations with different chemical compositions and/or ages.in the first case, the most common candidate is a spread in the initial heliumabundance, but this quantity is difficult to determine spectroscopically due tothe fact that helium absorption lines are not present in cooler stars, whereasfor hotter gc stars gravitational settling of helium becomes important. as aconsequence, indirect methods to determine the initial y among populations arenecessary. for that reason, in this series of papers, we investigate theeffects of a y enrichment in populations covering the range of gcmetallicities. in this first paper, we present the theoretical evolutionarytracks, isochrones, and zahb loci calculated with the princeton-goddard-puc(pgpuc) stellar evolutionary code, which has been updated with the most recentinput physics and compared with other theoretical databases. the chemicalcomposition grid covers 9 z ranging from z=1.60x10^-4 to 1.57x10^-2, 7 y fromy=0.230 to 0.370, and an alpha-element enhancement of [alpha/fe]=0.3. theeffects of different helium abundances that can be observed in isochrones are:splits in the ms, differences in the l and teff of the turn off point, splitsin the sgb being more prominent for lower ages or higher metallicities, splitsin the lower red giant branch being more prominent for higher ages or highermetallicities, differences in l of the rgb bump (with small changes in teff),and differences in l at the rgb tip. at the zahb, when y is increased there isan increase of l for low teff, which is affected in different degrees dependingon the age of the gc being studied. finally, the zahb morphology distributiondepending on the age explains how for higher gc metallicities a population withhigher helium abundance could be hidden at the red zahb locus.

1301.6168	evidence for a milky way tidal stream reaching beyond 100 kpc	we present the analysis of 1,207 rr lyrae found in photometry taken by thecatalina survey's mount lemmon telescope. by combining accurate distances forthese stars with measurements for ~14,000 type-ab rr lyrae from the catalinaschmid telescope, we reveal an extended association that reaches galactocentricdistances beyond 100 kpc and overlaps the sagittarius streams system. thisresult confirms earlier evidence for the existence of an outer halo tidalstream resulting from a disrupted stellar system. by comparing the rr lyraesource density with that expected based on halo models, we find the detectionhas ~8 sigma significance. we investigate the distances, radial velocities,metallicities, and period-amplitude distribution of the rr lyrae. we find thatboth radial velocities and distances are inconsistent with current models ofthe sagittarius stream. we also find tentative evidence for a division insource metallicities for the most distant sources. following prior analyses, wecompare the locations and distances of the rr lyrae with photometricallyselected candidate horizontal branch stars and find supporting evidence thatthis structure spans at least 60 deg of the sky. we investigate the prospectsof an association between the stream and unusual globular cluster ngc 2419.

1306.4180	new suns in the cosmos?	the present work reports on the discovery of three stars that we haveidentified to be rotating sun-like stars, based on rotational modulationsignatures inferred from light curves from the corot mission's public archives.in our analysis, we performed an initial selection based on rotation period andposition in the period--$t_{\rm eff}$ diagram. this revealed that the starscorot ids 100746852, 102709980, and 105693572 provide potentially good matchesto the sun with similar rotation period. to refine our analysis, we applied anovel procedure, taking into account the fluctuations of the featuresassociated to photometric modulation at different time intervals and thefractality traces that are present in the light curves of the sun and of these"new sun" candidates alike. in this sense, we computed the so-called hurstexponent for the referred stars, for a sample of fourteen corot stars with sub-and super-solar rotational periods, and for the sun, itself, in its active andquiet phases. we found that the hurst exponent can provide a strongdiscriminant of sun-like behavior, going beyond what can be achieved withsolely the rotation period itself. in particular, we find that corot id105693572 is the star that most closely matches the solar rotation properties,as far as the latter's imprints on light curve behavior is concerned. the starscorot ids 100746852 and 102709980 have significant smaller hurst exponents thanthe sun, notwithstanding their similarity in rotation periods.

(correctedaccording to bonifacio et al.) interstellar dust maps. differential reddeningacross the face of the cluster, which we find to be present at the level ofdelta e(b-v) ~ 0.17 mag, is taken into account in our analysis. we measureseveral metallicity indicators based on the position of the red giant branch(rgb) in the cluster cmd. these give a metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.38 +/- 0.07in the zinn &amp; west scale and [fe/h] = -1.28 +/- 0.08 in the new carretta et al.(uves) scale. we also provide measurements of other important photometricparameters for this cluster, including the position of the rgb luminosityfunction "bump" and the horizontal branch (hb) morphology. we compare the ngc6402 ridgeline with the one for ngc 5904 (m5) derived by sandquist et al., andfind evidence that ngc 6402 and m5 have approximately the same age, to withinthe uncertainties -- although the possibility that m14 may be slighlty oldercannot be ruled out.

0801.4795	is a binary fraction-age relation responsible for the lack of ehb  binaries in globular clusters?	the recently-discovered lack of close binaries, among extreme horizontalbranch (ehb) stars in galactic globular clusters, has thus far constituted amajor puzzle, in view of the fact that blue subdwarf stars - the fieldcounterparts of cluster ehb stars - are well-known to present a high binaryfraction. in this letter, we provide new results that confirm the lack of closeehb binaries in globular clusters, and present a first scenario to explain thedifference between field and cluster ehb stars. first, in order to confirm thatthe lack of ehb binaries in globular clusters is a statistically robust result,we undertook a new analysis of 145 horizontal branch stars in ngc6752, out ofwhich forty-one belong to the ehb. to search for radial-velocity variations asa function of time, we repeated high-resolution (r=18500) spectroscopy of allstars, four times during a single night of observations. we detected a single,hot (25000 k), radial-velocity variable star as a close-binary candidate. fromthese results, we estimate an upper-limit for the close (period p &lt; 5 day)binary fraction f among ngc6752 ehb stars of 16% (95% confidence level), withthe most probable value being f=4%. thus our results clearly confirm the lackof close binaries among the hot hb stars in this cluster. we suggest that theconfirmed discrepancy between the binary fractions for field and cluster ehbstars is the consequence of an f-age relation, with close binaries being morelikely in the case of younger systems. we analyze theoretical and observationalresults available in the literature, which support this scenario. if so, an agedifference between the ehb progenitors in the field and in clusters, the formerbeing younger (on average) by up to several gyr, would naturally account forthe startling differences in binary fraction between the two populations.

1312.1513	constraints on helium enhancement in the globular cluster m4 (ngc 6121):  the horizontal branch test	recent pieces of evidence have revealed that most, and possibly all, globularstar clusters are composed of groups of stars that formed in multiple episodeswith different chemical compositions. in this sense, it has also been arguedthat variations in the initial helium abundance ($y$) from one population tothe next are also the rule, rather than the exception. in the case of themetal-intermediate globular cluster m4 (ngc 6121), recent high-resolutionspectroscopic observations of blue horizontal branch (hb) stars (i.e., hb starshotter than the rr lyrae instability strip) suggest that a large fraction ofblue hb stars are second-generation stars formed with high helium abundances.in this paper, we test this scenario by using recent photometric andspectroscopic data together with theoretical evolutionary computations fordifferent $y$ values. comparing the photometric data with thetheoretically-derived color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the bulk of theblue hb stars in m4 have $\delta y \lesssim 0.01$ with respect to the cluster'sred hb stars (i.e., hb stars cooler than the rr lyrae strip)-- a result whichis corroborated by comparison with spectroscopically derived gravities andtemperatures, which also favor little he enhancement. however, the possibleexistence of a minority population on the blue hb of the cluster with asignificant he enhancement level is also discussed.

0802.2309	the rr lyrae period-luminosity-(pseudo-)color and  period-color-(pseudo-)color relations in the str\"omgren photometric system:  theoretical calibration	we present a theoretical calibration of the rr lyrae period-luminosity-colorand period-color-color relations in the multiband uvby stroemgren photometricsystem. our theoretical work is based on calculations of synthetic horizontalbranches (hbs) for four different metallicities, fully taking into accountevolutionary effects for a wide range in metallicities and hb morphologies.while our results show that "pure" period-luminosity and period-color relationsdo not exist in the stroemgren system, which is due to the large scatter thatis brought about by evolutionary effects when the uvby bandpasses are used,they also reveal that such scatter can be almost completely taken into accountby incorporating stroemgren pseudo-color [c_0 = (u-v)_0 - (v-b)_0] terms intothose equations, thus leading to tight period-luminosity-{\em pseudo}-color(plpsc) and period-color-{\em pseudo}-color (pcpsc) relations. we provide thelatter in the form of analytical fits, so that they can be applied with highprecision even in the case of field stars. in view of the very smallsensitivity of c_0 to interstellar reddening, our plpsc and pcpsc relationsshould be especially useful for the derivation of high-precision distance andreddening values. in this sense, we carry out a first application of ourrelations to field rr lyrae stars, finding evidence that the stars rr lyr, sudra, and ss leo -- but not sv hya -- are somewhat overluminous (by amountsranging from ~0.05 to 0.20 mag in y, and thus v) with respect to the averagefor other rr lyrae stars of similar metallicity.

1410.7653	discovery of $\sim$ 9,000 new rr lyrae in the southern catalina surveys	we present the results of a deep, wide-area variability survey in thesouthern hemisphere, the first of its kind. as part of the catalina skysurveys, the siding spring survey (sss) has covered $14,800$ square degrees inthe declination range of $-75^{\circ}\leq\delta\leq-15^{\circ}$. to mine theenormous sss dataset efficiently we have developed two algorithms: automaticperiod selection (aps) and automatic fourier decomposition (afd), which aim tosharpen the period estimation and produce robust lightcurve models. armed withthe aps and afd outputs we classify $10,540$ ab-type rr lyrae (rrab) stars($\sim$90% of which are new) across the southern sky. as well as the positionalinformation we supply photometric metallicities, and unreddened distances.  for the rrab stars in the halo, a study of the photometric metallicitydistribution reveals a nearly gaussian shape with a mean metallicity of ${\rm[fe/h]}=-1.4$ dex and a dispersion of $0.3$ dex. a spatial study of the rrabmetallicities shows no significant radial gradient in the first $\sim7$ kpcfrom the galaxy center. however, further out, a small negative gradient isclearly present. this is complemented by a very obvious correlation of the meanrr lyrae metallicity with distance above the galactic plane, $z$. we have alsocarried out an initial substructure search using the discovered rrab, andpresent the properties of the candidates with significance greater than $2\sigma$. most prominent among these is a southern extension of the sagittariusdwarf galaxy's stream system, reaching down to declinations $\sim -40\deg$.

1508.06194	stellar cycles from photometric data: corot stars	until a few years ago, the amplitude variation in the photometric data hadbeen limitedly explored mainly because of time resolution and photometricsensitivity limitations. this investigation is now possible thanks to thekepler and corot databases which provided a unique set of data for studying ofthe nature of stellar variability cycles. the present study characterizes theamplitude variation in a sample of main--sequence stars with light curvescollected using corot exo--field ccds. we analyze potential stellar activitycycles by studying the variability amplitude over small boxes. the cycleperiods and amplitudes were computed based on the lomb-scargle periodogram,harmonic fits, and visual inspection. as a first application of our approach wehave considered the photometric data for 16 corot fgk main sequence stars,revisited during the ira01, lra01 and lra06 corot runs. the 16 corot starsappear to follow the empirical relations between activity cycle periods($p_{cyc}$) and the rotation period ($p_{rot}$) found by previous works. inaddition to the so-called a (active) and i (inactive) sequences previouslyidentified, there is a possible third sequence, here named s (short-cycles)sequence. however, recovery fractions estimated from simulations suggest thatonly a half of our sample has confident cycle measurements. therefore, morestudy is needed to verify our results and kepler data shall be notably usefulfor such a study. overall, our procedure provides a key tool for exploring thecorot and kepler databases to identify and characterize stellar cyclevariability.

(1996) which is a modifiedversion of the more general case due to refsdal. in that case, the lens wouldbe a massive stellar remnant, with m = 1.5-3.5 msun. if the blending fractionof the microlensing event appears to be small, and this lens would represent agood isolated black hole (bh) candidate, that would be the oldest bh known.alternative explanations (with a larger blending fraction) also point to amassive stellar remnant if the lens is located in the galactic disk and doesnot belong to the globular cluster.

0807.3017	stellar evolution and variability in the pre-zahb phase	one of the most dramatic events in the life of a low-mass star is the heflash, which takes place at the tip of the rgb and is followed by a series ofsecondary flashes before the star settles on the zero-age hb (zahb). yet, nostars have ever been positively identified in this key phase in the life of alow-mass star (hereafter the "pre-zahb" phase). we investigate the possibilitythat some pre-zahb stars may cross the instability strip (is), thus becomingvariable. in particular, it has been suggested that some rr lyrae stars (rrl)with high period change rates (p-dot) may in fact be pre-zahb stars. we presentthe first theoretical effort devoted to interpreting some of the high-p-dotstars as pre-zahb pulsators. we constructed a grid of evolutionary tracks usingthe garching stellar evolution code for a chemical composition appropriate tothe case of the globular cluster m3, where a number of stars with high p-dotvalues are found. we follow each star's pre-zahb evolution in detail, computeperiods and p-dot values for the stars lying inside the is, and producepre-zahb monte carlo simulations for the case of m3. our results indicate thatone should expect of order 1 pre-zahb star for every 60 or so bona-fide hbstars in m3. among the pre-zahb stars, ~22% are expected to fall within the isboundaries, presenting rrl-like pulsations. on average, the pre-zahb pulsatorsare expected to have longer periods than the bona-fide hb pulsators, and 76% ofthem are predicted to show negative p-dot values. the most likely p-dot valuefor the pre-zahb variables is ~-0.3 d/myr, but more extreme p-dot values arealso possible: 38% of the variables are predicted to have p-dot &lt; -0.8 d/myr.it appears likely, therefore, that some rrl stars in m3 with high (absolute)p-dot values are pre-zahb pulsators in disguise.

(1997) candidate list locatedvery close to the cluster center. two variable stars suspected by carney,fullton, &amp; trammell (1991) are first-overtone rr lyrae (rrc) stars, whereasseven of the 12 candidates from borissova et al. (1997) are confirmed variables-- three of them being fundamental rr lyrae (rrab) pulsators, twofirst-overtone pulsators, one eclipsing binary (most likely an algol system)and one bright star whose variability status could not be satisfactorilydetermined. a new image subtraction method (ism) suggested by alard (1999) hasbeen employed which, together with the welch &amp; stetson (1993) technique, hasallowed us to discover twelve new rr lyrae variables in the cluster, for whichephemerides are provided. ten of these are rrab's, whereas the other two arerrc's. as originally suggested by mayer (1961), ngc 6229 is clearly anoosterhoff type i globular cluster. we also confirm that v8 is a population iicepheid of the w virginis type, and suspect that this is the case for v22 aswell.  the physical properties of the ngc 6229 rr lyrae population are comparedagainst those of m3 (ngc 5272) using several different methods, including astandard period-shift analysis. possible differences between these two clustersare discussed.

astro-ph;0106554	horizontal-branch models and the second-parameter effect. iv. the case  of m3 and palomar 3	we present a detailed analysis of the "second-parameter pair" of globularclusters m3 (ngc 5272) and palomar 3. our main results can be summarized asfollows: i) the horizontal-branch (hb) morphology of m3 is significantly bluerin its inner regions (observed with the hubble space telescope) than in thecluster outskirts (observed from the ground), i.e., m3 has an internal secondparameter. most plausibly the mass loss on the red giant branch (rgb) has beenmore efficient in the inner than in the outer regions of the cluster. ii) thedispersion in mass of the pal 3 hb is found to be very small -- consistent withzero -- and we argue that this is unlikely to be due to a statisticalfluctuation. it is this small mass dispersion that leads to the most apparentdifference in the hb morphologies of m3 and pal 3. iii) the relative hb typesof m3 and pal 3, as measured by mean colors or parameters involving the numberof blue, variable, and red hb stars, can easily be accounted for by a fairlysmall difference in age between these clusters, of order 0.5-1 gyr -- which isin good agreement with the relative age measurement, based on the clusters'turnoffs, by vandenberg (2000).

astro-ph;0109073	age as the second parameter in ngc 288/ngc 362? ii. the horizontal  branch revisited	we revisit the "second parameter" pair of globular clusters ngc 288/ngc 362on the basis of theoretical models for red giant branch (rgb) and horizontalbranch (hb) stars. the results of the most extensive set of rgb/hb simulationscomputed so far for these clusters are presented for two differentmetallicities. using several different analytical mass loss formulae for rgbstars, we derive relative "hb morphology ages." we compare them with therelative main-sequence turnoff ages derived by application of the "bridge test"by bellazzini et al. (2001), who found that ngc 288 is 2+/-1 gyr older than ngc362. we find that adoption of a higher metallicity ([fe/h] ~ -1.2), as favoredby the carretta &amp; gratton metallicity scale, makes age a much more plausiblesecond parameter candidate for this pair than is the case when a lowermetallicity ([fe/h] ~ -1.5), closer to the zinn &amp; west scale, is adopted.however, while the different hb morphology of these two clusters can bereproduced by canonical hb models with [fe/h] ~ -1.2 and an age difference of 2gyr, this explanation is not without difficulty. in particular, we confirmprevious suggestions that canonical models are unable to reproduce the detailedhb morphology of ngc 288 at its red end, for as yet unknown reasons. finally,we show that the mass dispersion on the hb of ngc 362 is substantially largerthan for ngc 288, and suggest that there is a correlation between the massdispersion on the hb phase and the central density of globular clusters. thisis presumably related to the way environmental effects affect rgb mass loss.[abridged]

astro-ph;0203393	m75, a globular cluster with a trimodal horizontal branch. i.  color-magnitude diagram	deep ubvi photometry for a large field covering the distant globular clusterm75 (ngc 6864) is presented. we confirm a previous suggestion (catelan et al.1998a) that m75 possesses a bimodal horizontal branch (hb) bearing strikingresemblance to the well-known case of ngc 1851. in addition, we detect a third,smaller grouping of stars on the m75 blue tail, separated from the bulk of theblue hb stars by a gap spanning about 0.5 mag in v. such a group of stars maycorrespond to the upper part of a very extended, though thinly populated, bluetail. thus m75 appears to have a trimodal hb. the presence of the "grundahljump" is verified using the broadband u filter. we explore the color-magnitudediagram of m75 with the purpose of deriving the cluster's fundamentalparameters, and find a metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.03 +/- 0.17 dex and -1.24 +/-0.21 dex in the carretta &amp; gratton (1997) and zinn &amp; west (1984) scales,respectively. we discuss earlier suggestions that the cluster has ananomalously low ratio of bright red giants to hb stars. a differential ageanalysis with respect to ngc 1851 suggests that the two clusters areessentially coeval.

astro-ph;0309188	the evolutionary status of m3 rr lyrae variables: breakdown of the  canonical framework?	in order to test the prevailing paradigm of horizontal-branch (hb) stellarevolution, we use the large databases of measured rr lyrae parameters for theglobular cluster m3 (ngc 5272) recently provided by bakos et al. and corwin &amp;carney. we compare the observed distribution of fundamentalized periods againstthe predictions of synthetic hbs. the observed distribution shows a sharp peakat p_f ~ 0.55 d, which is primarily due to the rrab variables, whereas themodel predictions instead indicate that the distribution should be more uniformin p_f, with a buildup of variables with shorter periods (p_f &lt; 0.5 d).detailed statistical tests show, for the first time, that the observed andpredicted distributions are incompatible with one another at a highsignificance level. we show that the sharp peak in the m3 period distributionreceives a significant contribution from the blazhko variables in the cluster.we also show that m15 (ngc 7078) and m68 (ngc 4590) show similar peaks in theirp_f distributions, which in spite of being located at a similar p_f value asm3's, can be primarily ascribed to the rrc variables. again similar to m3, ademise of rrc variables towards the blue edge of the instability strip ispresent in these two globulars. this is again in sharp contrast with theevolutionary scenario, which also foresees a strong buildup of rrc variableswith short periods in ooii globulars. we speculate that, in ooi systems, rrabvariables may get "trapped" close to the transition line between rrab and rrcpulsators as they evolve to the blue, whereas in ooii systems it is the rrcvariables that may get "trapped" instead, as they evolve to the red, beforechanging their pulsation mode to rrab. such a scenario is supported by theavailable cmds and bailey diagrams for m3, m15, and m68.

astro-ph;0503263	discovery of &gt; 200 rr lyrae variables in m62: an oosterhoff i globular  cluster with a predominantly blue hb	we report on the discovery of a large number of rr lyrae variable stars inthe moderately metal-rich galactic globular cluster m62 (ngc 6266), whichplaces it among the top three most rr lyrae-rich globular clusters known.likely members of the cluster in our studied field, from our preliminary numbercounts, include about 130 fundamental-mode (rrab) pulsators, with &lt;p(ab)&gt; =0.548 d, and about 75 first-overtone (rrc) pulsators, with &lt;p(c)&gt; = 0.300 d.the average periods and the position of the rrab variables with well-definedlight curves in the bailey diagram both suggest that the cluster is ofoosterhoff type i. however, the morphology of the cluster's horizontal branch(hb) is strikingly similar to that of the oosterhoff type ii globular clusterm15 (ngc 7078), with a dominant blue hb component and a very extended bluetail. since m15 and m62 differ in metallicity by about one dex, we concludethat metallicity, at a fixed hb type, is a key parameter determining theoosterhoff status of a globular cluster and the position of its variables inthe bailey diagram.

(1991, aj,101, 1699) for the outer and less crowded fields of the cluster, and confirmsthat ngc 6229 has a peculiar color-magnitude diagram for its position in thegalaxy. in particular, ngc 6229's horizontal branch (hb) presents severalinteresting features, among which stand out: a well populated and very extendedblue tail; a rather blue overall morphology, with (b-r)/(b+v+r) = 0.24+/-0.02;a bimodal color distribution, resembling those found for ngc 1851 and ngc 2808;and gaps on the blue hb. ngc 6229 is the first bimodal-hb cluster to beidentified in the galactic outer halo. a low value of the r parameter isconfirmed, suggestive of a low helium abundance or of the presence of a quitesubstantial population of extreme hb stars fainter than our photometric limit(~ 2.5 mag below the rr lyrae level in v). twelve new possible variable starswere found in the central part of the cluster. the morphology of the red giantbranch (rgb) also seems to be peculiar. in particular, the rgb luminosityfunction ``bump'' is not a prominent feature and has only been tentativelyidentified, on the basis of a comparison with a previously reported detectionfor m3 (ngc 5272). finally, we compare the properties of ngc 6229 with thosefor other outer-halo globular clusters, and call attention to what appears tobe a bimodal hb distribution for the outer-halo cluster population, whereobjects with very red or very blue hb types are much more frequently found thanclusters with intermediate hb types.

astro-ph;9708096	bimodality and gaps on globular cluster horizontal branches. ii. the  cases of ngc 6229, ngc 1851 and ngc 2808	the outer-halo globular cluster ngc 6229 has a peculiar horizontal-branch(hb) morphology, with clear indications of a bimodal hb and a ``gap" on theblue hb. in this paper, we present extensive synthetic hb simulations todetermine whether peculiar distributions in the underlying physical parametersare needed to explain the observed hb morphology. we find that a unimodal massdistribution along the hb can satisfactorily account for the observed hbbimodality, *provided* the mass dispersion is substantially larger than usuallyinferred for the galactic globular clusters. in this case, ngc 6229 should havea well-populated, extended blue tail. a truly bimodal distribution in hb massescan also satisfactorily account for the observed hb morphology, although inthis case the existence of an extended blue tail is not necessarily implied.the other two well-known bimodal-hb clusters, ngc 1851 and ngc 2808, arebriefly analyzed. while the hb morphology of ngc 1851 can also be reproducedwith a unimodal mass distribution assuming a large mass dispersion, the same isnot true of ngc 2808, for which a bimodal, and possibly multimodal, massdistribution seems definitely required.  the problem of gaps on the blue hb is also discussed. applying the standardhawarden (1971) and newell (1973) chi-squared test, we find that the ngc 6229gap is significant at the 99.7% level. however, in a set of 1,000 simulations,blue-hb gaps comparable to the observed one are present in ~ 6 - 9% of allcases. we employ a new and simple formalism, based on the binomialdistribution, to explain the origin of this discrepancy, and conclude thathawarden's method, in general, substantially overestimates the statisticalsignificance of gaps.

astro-ph;9910334	horizontal-branch models and the second-parameter effect. iii. the  impact of mass loss on the red giant branch, and the case of m5 and palomar  4/eridanus	deep hst photometry has recently been presented for the outer-halo globularclusters palomar 4 and eridanus. the new high-precision color-magnitudediagrams obtained for these globulars have allowed a measurement of their agesrelative to m5 (ngc 5904), which is a well-observed, much closer cluster.assuming that the globular clusters share the same chemical composition, pal4/eridanus have been reported to be younger than m5 by ~1-2 gyr, based on boththe magnitude difference between the horizontal branch (hb) and the turnoff andthe difference in color between the turnoff and the lower subgiant branch. inthe present article, we address the following question: what age differencewould be required to account for the difference in hb types between m5 and pal4/eridanus, assuming age to be the "second parameter"? we find that, unless allthese clusters (including m5) are younger than 10 gyr, such an age differenceis substantially larger than that based on an analysis of the cluster turnoffs.to reach such a conclusion, six different analytical mass loss rate formulae(reported in an appendix), all implying a dependence of mass loss on the redgiant branch on age, were employed. our results appear to be in conflict withclaims that age can be the only second parameter in the galactic globularcluster system.

0810.0682	the globular cluster ngc 5286. i. a new ccd bv color-magnitude diagram	we present bv photometry of the galactic globular cluster ngc 5286, based on128 v frames and 133 b frames, and covering the entire face of the cluster. ourphotometry reaches almost two magnitudes below the turn-off level, and isaccordingly suitable for an age analysis. field stars were removedstatistically from the cluster's color-magnitude diagram (cmd), and adifferential reddening correction applied, thus allowing a precise ridgeline tobe calculated.  using the latter, a metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.70 +/- 0.10 in the zinn &amp; westscale, and [fe/h] = -1.47 +/- 0.02 in the carretta &amp; gratton scale, was derivedon the basis of several parameters measured from the red giant branch, in goodagreement with the value provided in the harris catalog.  comparing the ngc 5286 cmd with the latest photometry for m3 by p. b. stetson(2008, priv. comm.), and using vandenberg isochrones for a suitable chemicalcomposition, we find evidence that ngc 5286 is around 1.7 +/- 0.9 gyr olderthan m3. this goes in the right sense to help account for the blue horizontalbranch of ngc 5286, for which we provide a measurement of several morphologicalindicators. if ngc 5286 is a bona fide member of the canis major dwarfspheroidal galaxy, as previously suggested, our results imply that the latter'soldest components may be at least as old as the oldest milky way globularclusters.
