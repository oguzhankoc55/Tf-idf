0901.3390	internal dynamics of the galaxy cluster abell 959	the connection of cluster mergers with the presence of extended, diffuseradio sources in galaxy clusters is still being debated. in this paper we aimto obtain new insights into the internal dynamics of abell 959, showingevidence of a diffuse radio source, analyzing velocities and positions ofmember galaxies. our analysis is based on redshift data for 107 galaxies in thecluster field acquired at the telescopio nazionale galileo. we also usephotometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (data release 6). we combinegalaxy velocities and positions to select 81 galaxies recognized as clustermembers and determine global dynamical properties. we analyze the clustersearching for substructures by using several statistical methods. we also studythe 2d galaxy distribution in the field of the cluster. we compare our resultswith those from x-ray and gravitational lensing analyses. we estimate a clusterredshift of z=0.2883 +/- 0.0004. we detect an ne high velocity group at 5' fromthe cluster center with a relative line--of--sight (los) velocity of ~ +1900km/s with respect to the main system. we also detect a central, dense structureelongated along the se--nw direction likely connected with the two dominantgalaxies and their surrounding cores. this elongated central structure isprobably the trace of an old cluster merger. the los velocity dispersion ofgalaxies is very high (1025 (-75/+104) km/s). the virial mass is m(&lt;r=1.48mpc)= 1.15 (-0.19/+0.25) msun. our results suggest that this cluster is formingalong two main directions of mass accretion and show the typicalcharacteristics of radio clusters; i.e., it is very massive and shows a youngdynamical state. however, deeper radio observations are needed to clarify thenature of the diffuse radio emission in abell 959.

0905.3011	internal dynamics of abell 1240: a galaxy cluster with symmetric double  radio relics	we aim to obtain new insights into the internal dynamics of the cluster abell1240, showing the presence of two roughly symmetric radio relics, separated by~2 h_70^-1 mpc. our analysis is mainly based on redshift data for 145 galaxiesand on new photometric data. we also use x-ray data from the chandra archiveand photometric data from the sdss (dr7). we combine galaxy velocities andpositions to select 89 cluster galaxies and analyze the internal dynamics ofthe abell 1237 + abell 1240 cluster complex. we estimate similar redshifts forabell 1237 and abell 1240, &lt;z&gt;=0.1935 and &lt;z&gt;=0.1948, respectively. for abell1237 we estimate velocity dispersion sigma_v~740 km/s and a mass m~6 10^14h_70^-1 m_sun. for abell 1240 we estimate a los sigma_v~870 km/s and a massrange m~0.9-1.9 10^15 h_70^-1 m_sun, which takes into account its complexdynamics. abell 1240 is shown to have a bimodal structure with two galaxyclumps roughly defining the n-s direction, the same one defined by theelongation of its x-ray surface brightness and by the axis of symmetry of therelics. the two--body model agrees with the hypothesis that we are looking at acluster merger occurred largely in the plane of the sky, with the two galaxyclumps separated by a rest-frame velocity difference v_rf~2000 km/s at a timeof 0.3 gyrs after the crossing core, while abell 1237 is still infalling ontoabell 1240. chandra archive data confirm the complex structure of abell 1240and allow us to estimate a global x-ray temperature t_x=6.0+-0.5 kev. inagreement with the findings from radio data, our results for abell 1240strongly support the "outgoing merger shocks" model to explain the presence ofthe relics.

1004.4122	internal dynamics of abell 2294: a massive, likely merging cluster	the mechanisms giving rise to diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters, andin particular their connection with cluster mergers, are still debated. we aimto obtain new insights into the internal dynamics of the cluster abell 2294,recently shown to host a radio halo. our analysis is mainly based on redshiftdata for 88 galaxies acquired at the telescopio nazionale galileo. we also usenew photometric data acquired at the isaac newton telescope and x-ray data fromthe chandra archive. we re-estimate the redshift of the large, brightestcluster galaxy (bcg) obtaining &lt;z&gt;=0.1690. we estimate a quite large losvelocity dispersion sigma_v about 1400 km/s and x-ray temperature t_x about 10kev. our optical and x-ray analysis detects evidence for substructure. ourresults are consistent with the presence of two massive subclusters separatedby a los rest frame velocity difference v_rf about 2000 km/s, very closelyprojected in the plane of sky along the se-nw direction. the observationalpicture, interpreted through the analytical two-body model, suggests that abell2294 is a cluster merger elongated mainly in the los direction and catchedduring the bound outgoing phase, a few fractions of gyr after the corecrossing. we find abell 2294 is a very massive cluster with a range of m=2-410e15 m_sun. moreover, contradicting previous findings, our new data do excludethe presence of the h$\alpha$ emission in the spectrum of the bcg galaxy. theoutcoming picture of abell 2294 is that of a massive, quite "normal" mergingcluster, as found for many clusters showing diffuse radio sources.

1011.3018	hiflugcs: galaxy cluster scaling relations between x-ray luminosity, gas  mass, cluster radius, and velocity dispersion	we present relations between x-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion(l-sigma), x-ray luminosity and gas mass (l-mgas), and cluster radius andvelocity dispersion (r500-sigma) for 62 galaxy clusters in the hiflugcs, anx-ray flux-limited sample minimizing bias toward any cluster morphology. ouranalysis in total is based on ~1.3ms of clean x-ray xmm-newton data and 13439cluster member galaxies with redshifts. cool cores are among the majorcontributors to the scatter in the l-sigma relation. when thecool-core-corrected x-ray luminosity is used the intrinsic scatter decreases to0.27 dex. even after the x-ray luminosity is corrected for the cool core, thescatter caused by the presence of cool cores dominates for the low-masssystems. the scatter caused by the non-cool-core clusters does not stronglydepend on the mass range, and becomes dominant in the high-mass regime. theobserved l-sigma relation agrees with the self-similar prediction, matches thatof a simulated sample with agn feedback disregarding six clusters with &lt;45cluster members with spectroscopic redshifts, and shows a common trend ofincreasing scatter toward the low-mass end, i.e., systems with sigma&lt;500km/s. acomparison of observations with simulations indicates an agn-feedback-drivenimpact in the low-mass regime. the best fits to the $l-m_{\rm gas}$ relationsfor the disturbed clusters and undisturbed clusters in the observational sampleclosely match those of the simulated samples with and without agn feedback,respectively. this suggests that one main cause of the scatter is agn activityproviding feedback in different phases, e.g., during a feedback cycle. theslope and scatter in the observed r500-sigma relation is similar to that of thesimulated sample with agn feedback except for a small offset but still withinthe scatter.

1101.2447	fossil groups origins: i. rx j105453.3+552102 a very massive and relaxed  system at z~0.5	the most accepted scenario for the origin of fossil groups (fgs) is that theyare galaxy associations in which the merging rate was fast and efficient. thesesystems have assembled half of their mass at early epoch of the universe,subsequently growing by minor mergers. they could contain a fossil record ofthe galaxy structure formation. we have started a project in order tocharacterize a large sample of fgs. in this paper we present the analysis ofthe fossil system rx j105453.3+552102. optical deep images were used forstudying the properties of the brightest group galaxy and for computing thephotometric luminosity function of the group. we have also performed a detaildynamical analysis of the system based on redshift data for 116 galaxies. thisgalaxy system is located at z=0.47, and shows a quite large line-of-sightvelocity dispersion \sigma_{v}~1000 km/s. assuming the dynamical equilibrium,we estimated a virial mass of m ~ 10^{15} h_{70} m_{\odot}. no evidence ofsubstructure was found within 1.4 mpc radius. we found a statisticallysignificant departure from gaussianity of the group members velocities in themost external regions of the group. this could indicate the presence ofgalaxies in radial orbits in the external region of the group. we also foundthat the photometrical luminosity function is bimodal, showing a lack of m_{r}~ -19.5 galaxies. the brightest group galaxy shows low sersic parameter (n~2)and a small peculiar velocity. indeed, our accurate photometry shows that thedifference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxies is 1.9 magin the r-band, while the classical definition of fgs is based on a magnitudegap of 2. we conclude that this fossil system does not follow the empiricaldefinition of fgs. nevertheless, it is a massive, old and undisturbed galaxysystem with little infall of l^{*} galaxies since its initial collapse.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1104.3711	a giant radio halo in the low luminosity x-ray cluster abell 523	radio halos are extended and diffuse non-thermal radio sources present at thecluster center, not obviously associated with any individual galaxy. a strongcorrelation has been found between the cluster x-ray luminosity and the haloradio power. we observe and analyze the diffuse radio emission present in thecomplex merging structure abell 523, classified as a low luminosity x-raycluster, to discuss its properties in the context of the halo total radio powerversus x-ray luminosity correlation. we reduced vla archive observations at 1.4ghz to derive a deep radio image of the diffuse emission, and compared radio,optical, and x-ray data. low-resolution vla images detect a giant radio haloassociated with a complex merging region. the properties of this new halo agreewith those of radio halos in general discussed in the literature, but its radiopower is about a factor of ten higher than expected on the basis of the clusterx-ray luminosity. our study of this giant radio source demonstrates that radiohalos can also be present in clusters with a low x-ray luminosity. only a fewsimilar cases have so far been found . this result suggests that this sourcerepresent a new class of objects, that cannot be explained by classical radiohalo models. we suggest that the particle reacceleration related to mergingprocesses is very efficient and/or the x-ray luminosity is not a good indicatorof the past merging activity of a cluster.

1110.0465	fossil groups origins ii. unveiling the formation of the brightest group  galaxies through their scaling relations	(abridged) fossil systems are galaxy associations dominated by a relativelyisolated, bright elliptical galaxy, surrounded by a group of smaller galaxieslacking l* objects. we analyzed the near-infrared photometric and structuralproperties of a sample of 20 bggs present in fgs in order to better understandtheir formation mechanisms. their surface-brightness distribution was fitted toa sersic profile using the gasp2d algorithm. then, the standard scalingrelations were derived for the first time for these galaxies and compared withthose of normal ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies in non-fossilsystems. the bggs presented in this study represent a subset of the mostmassive galaxies in the universe. we found that their ellipticity profiles arecontinuously increasing with the galactocentric radius. our fossil bcgs followclosely the fundamental plane described by normal ellipticals. however, theydepart from both the log \sigma_0 vs. log l_{k_{s}} and log r_{\rm e} vs. logl_{k_{s}} relations described by intermediate mass ellipticals. this occurs inthe sense that our bggs have larger effective radii and smaller velocitydispersions than those predicted by these relations. we also found that moreelliptical galaxies systematically deviate from the previous relations whilemore rounder object do not. no similar correlation was found with the sersicindex. the derived scaling relations can be interpreted in terms of theformation scenario of the bggs. because our bggs follow the fundamental planetilt but they have larger effective radii than expected for intermediate massellipticals, we suggest that they only went through dissipational mergers in aearly stage of their evolution and then assembled the bulk of their massthrough subsequent dry mergers, contrary to previous claims that bggs in fgswere formed mainly by the merging of gas-rich galaxies.

1301.5200	the puzzling merging cluster abell 1914: new insights from the  kinematics of member galaxies	we analyze the dynamical state of abell 1914, a merging cluster hosting aradio halo, quite unusual for its structure. our study considers spectroscopicdata for 119 galaxies obtained with the italian telescopio nazionale galileo.we select 89 cluster members from spatial and velocity distributions. we alsouse photometry canada-france-hawaii telescope archives. we compute the meancluster redshift, &lt;z&gt;=0.168, and the velocity dispersion which shows a highvalue, sigma_v=1210_{-110}^{+125} km/s. from the 2d analysis we find that abell1914 has a ne-sw elongated structure with two galaxy clumps, that mostly mergein the plane of the sky. our best, but very uncertain estimate of the velocitydispersion of the main system is sigma_v~1000 km/s. we estimate a virial massm_sys=1.4--2.6 10^{15} h_{70}^{-1} msun for the whole system. we study themerger through a simple two-body model and find that data are consistent with abound, outgoing substructure observed just after the core crossing. by studyingthe 2d distribution of the red galaxies, photometrically selected, we show thatabell 1914 is contained in a rich large scale structure, with two closecompanion galaxy systems, known to be at z~0.17. the system at sw supports theidea that the cluster is accreting groups from a filament aligned in the ne-swdirection, while that at nw suggests a second direction of the accretion nw-se.we conclude that abell 1914 well fits among typical clusters with radio halos.we argue that the unusual radio emission is connected to the complex clusteraccretion and suggest that abell 1914 resembles the well-known nearby mergingcluster abell 754 for its particular observed phenomenology.

1403.0588	fossil groups origins iii. characterization of the sample and  observational properties of fossil systems	(abridged) fossil systems are group- or cluster-sized objects whoseluminosity is dominated by a very massive central galaxy. in the current colddark matter scenario, these objects formed hierarchically at an early epoch ofthe universe and then slowly evolved until present day. that is the reason whythey are called {\it fossils}. we started an extensive observational program tocharacterize a sample of 34 fossil group candidates spanning a broad range ofphysical properties. deep $r-$band images were taken for each candidate andoptical spectroscopic observations were obtained for $\sim$ 1200 galaxies. thisnew dataset was completed with sdss dr7 archival data to obtain robust clustermembership and global properties of each fossil group candidate. for eachsystem, we recomputed the magnitude gaps between the two brightest galaxies($\delta m_{12}$) and the first and fourth ranked galaxies ($\delta m_{14}$)within 0.5 $r_{{\rm 200}}$. we consider fossil systems those with $\deltam_{12} \ge 2$ mag or $\delta m_{14} \ge 2.5$ mag within the errors. we findthat 15 candidates turned out to be fossil systems. their observationalproperties agree with those of non-fossil systems. both follow the samecorrelations, but fossils are always extreme cases. in particular, they hostthe brightest central galaxies and the fraction of total galaxy light enclosedin the central galaxy is larger in fossil than in non-fossil systems. finally,we confirm the existence of genuine fossil clusters. combining our results withothers in the literature, we favor the merging scenario in which fossil systemsformed due to mergers of $l^\ast$ galaxies. the large magnitude gap is aconsequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore itis an evolutionary effect. moreover, we suggest that at least one candidate inour sample could represent a transitional fossil stage.

1403.0590	fossil groups origins iii. the relation between optical and x-ray  luminosities	this study is part of the fossil groups origin (fogo) project which aims atcarrying out a systematic and multiwavelength study of a large sample of fossilsystems. here we focus on the relation between the optical luminosity (lopt)and x-ray luminosity (lx). out of a sample of 28 candidate fossil systems, weconsider a sample of 12 systems whose fossil classification has been confirmedby a companion study. they are compared with the complementary sample of 16systems whose fossil nature is not confirmed and with a subsample of 102 galaxysystems from the rass-sdss galaxy cluster survey. fossil and normal systemsspan the same redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 and have the same lx distribution. foreach fossil system, the lx in the 0.1-2.4 kev band is computed using data fromthe rosat all sky survey. for each fossil and normal system we homogeneouslycompute lopt in the r-band within the characteristic cluster radius, using datafrom the sdss dr7. we sample the lx-lopt relation over two orders of magnitudein lx. our analysis shows that fossil systems are not statisticallydistinguishable from the normal systems both through the 2d ks test and the fitof the lx-lopt relation. the optical luminosity of the galaxy system doesstrongly correlate with the x-ray luminosity of the hot gas component,independently of whether the system is fossil or not. we conclude that ourresults are consistent with the classical "merging scenario" of the brightestgalaxy formed via merger/cannibalism of other group galaxies, with conservationof the optical light. we find no evidence for a peculiar state of the hotintracluster medium.

1403.4979	intra cluster light properties in the clash-vlt cluster macs  j1206.2-0847	we aim at constraining the assembly history of clusters by studying the intracluster light (icl) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction ofbaryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias usingdifferent icl detection techniques. we developed an automated method, galtoicl,based on the software galapagos to obtain a refined version of typical bcg+iclmaps. we applied this method to our test case macs j1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the clash sample. using deepmulti-band subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (sb) profile ofthe bcg+icl and we studied the icl morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to r500. we repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theicl, sblimit method, i.e. a sb cut-off level, to compare the results. the mostpeculiar feature of the icl in macs1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the se direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a post starburst galaxy. this suggests an interactionbetween the bcg and this galaxy that dates back to t &lt;= 1.5 gyr. the bcg+iclstellar content is 8% of m_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. thesblimit method provides systematically higher icl fractions and this effect islarger at lower sb limits. this is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the icl. though more time consuming, thegaltoicl method provides safer icl detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. this is one of the few icl study at redshift z &gt; 0.3. atcompletion, the clash/vlt program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6.

1506.03076	fossil group origins v. the dependence of the luminosity function on the  magnitude gap	in nature we observe galaxy aggregations that span a wide range of magnitudegaps between the two first-ranked galaxies of a system ($\delta m_{12}$). thereare systems with gaps close to zero (e.g., the coma cluster), and at the otherextreme of the distribution, the largest gaps are found among the so-calledfossil systems. fossil and non-fossil systems could have different galaxypopulations that should be reflected in their luminosity functions. in thiswork we study, for the first time, the dependence of the luminosity functionparameters on $\delta m_{12}$ using data obtained by the fossil group origins(fogo) project. we constructed a hybrid luminosity function for 102 groups andclusters at $z \le 0.25$. we stacked all the individual luminosity functions,dividing them into bins of $\delta m_{12}$, and studied their best-fitschechter parameters. we additionally computed a relative luminosity function,expressed as a function of the central galaxy luminosity, which boosts ourcapacity to detect differences, especially at the bright end. we find trends asa function of $\delta m_{12}$ at both the bright and faint ends of theluminosity function. in particular, at the bright end, the larger the magnitudegap, the fainter the characteristic magnitude $m^\ast$. we also finddifferences at the faint end. in this region, the larger the gap, the flatterthe faint-end slope $\alpha$. the differences found at the bright end support adissipationless, dynamical friction-driven merging model for the growth of thecentral galaxy in group- and cluster-sized halos. the differences in the faintend cannot be explained by this mechanism. other processes, such as enhancedtidal disruption due to early infall and/or prevalence of eccentric orbits, mayplay a role. however, a larger sample of systems with $\delta m_{12} &gt; 1.5$ isneeded to establish the differences at the faint end.

1511.02854	fossil group origins vii. galaxy substructures in fossil systems	fossil groups are expected to be the final product of galaxy merging withingalaxy groups. in simulations, they are predicted to assemble their mass athigh redshift. this early formation allows for the innermost $m^\ast$ galaxiesto merge into a massive central galaxy. then, they are expected to maintaintheir fossil status because of the few interactions with the large-scalestructure. in this context, the magnitude gap between the two brightestgalaxies of the system is considered a good indicator of its dynamical status.as a consequence, the systems with the largest gaps should be dynamicallyrelaxed. in order to examine the dynamical status of these systems, wesystematically analyze, for the first time, the presence of galaxysubstructures in a sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil systems withredshift $z \le 0.25$. we apply a number of tests in order to investigate thesubstructure in fossil systems in the two-dimensional space of projectedpositions out to $r_{200}$. moreover, for a subsample of 5 systems with atleast 30 spectroscopically-confirmed members we also analyze the substructurein the velocity and in the three-dimensional velocity-position spaces.additionally, we look for signs of recent mergers in the regions around thecentral galaxies. we find that an important fraction of fossil systems showsubstructure. the fraction depends critically on the adopted test, since eachtest is more sensible to a particular type of substructure. our interpretationof the results is that fossil systems are not, in general, as relaxed asexpected from simulations. our sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossilsystems need to be extended in order to compute an accurate fraction, but ourconclusion is that it is similar to the fraction of substructure detected innon-fossil clusters. this abstract is truncated.

astro-ph;0004149	the observational mass function of loose galaxy groups	we analyze the three catalogs of nearby loose groups identified by garcia(1993). she used a percolation and a hierarchical method, and proposed a thirdgroup catalog defined as a combination of the two. each catalog contains almost500 groups. in agreement with previous works on earlier catalogs, we find thatgroups can be described as collapsing systems. their sampled size is muchlarger than their expected virialized region. we compute the virial masses andcorrect them by taking into account the young dynamical status. we estimategroup masses, m, for two cosmological models, a flat one with omega_0=1 and anopen one with omega_0=0.2. for each of the three catalogs we calculate the massfunction, mf. the number density of groups with m&gt;9x10^{12}\msun, which is theadopted limit of sample completeness, ranges within 1.3-1.9x10^{-3}h^3/mpc^3for omega_0=1, and it is about a factor of 15% lower for omega_0=0.2. the mfsof the hierarchical and combined catalogs have essentially the same shape,while the mf of the percolation catalog shows a flattening towards largemasses. however, the difference decreases if we do not consider the mostmassive groups, for which reliable results come from galaxy cluster studies.after having estimated the mass contained within the central, presumablyvirialized, regions of groups by adopting a reduction in mass of 30-40%, we doa comparison with the results coming from the virial analysis of nearby richclusters (girardi et al. 1998). all three group mfs turn out to be a smoothextrapolation of the cluster mf at m&lt;4x10^{14}\msun, which is the completenesslimit of the cluster sample. the resulting optical virial mf of galaxy systems,which extends over two orders of magnitude, is fitted to a schechter expressionwith a slope of about -1.5 and a characteristic mass of about 3x10^{14}\msun.

astro-ph;0010002	weak lensing mass reconstruction of ms1008.1-1224	we present an in-depth weak lensing analysis of the cluster ms1008 based ondeep multicolor imaging obtained during the science verification of fors1 atthe vlt. the image quality (half arcsec seeing) and depth of the vlt imagesallow the shear signal to be mapped with high signal-to-noise and to be tracedout to 1.2 h_50^-1 mpc, near the edge of the 6'.8x6'.8 field of view. usingbvri color information, as well as 81 redshifts in the field from the cnocsurvey, background galaxies can be effectively separated from cluster andforeground objects. psf distorsions are found to be moderate across the forsimages and thus easily removed. due to the small statistical errors in the massreconstruction, this dataset provides a testing ground where several systematiceffects (e.g. mass-sheet degeneracy, redshift distribution of the backgroundsources, cluster galaxy contamination) can be quantified. several methods areused to remove the mass-sheet degeneracy which is found to dominate thesystematic error budget. we measure a lower limit to the mass of 2.6 10^14h_50^-1 m_sun within 1 h_50^-1 mpc and a ``total'' mass of 5.3 10^14 h_50^-1m_sun by fitting a softened isothermal sphere. the availability of the cnocredshift data and x-ray observations on this cluster allow a comparison ofdifferent determinations of the mass radial profile. we find the lensing andx-ray measurements in excellent agreement, while the mass derived from thevirial analysis is marginally (1-2 sigma) in agreement at radii where bothmethods are reliable.

astro-ph;0411386	a vlt spectroscopic survey of rx j0152.7-1357, a forming cluster of  galaxies at z=0.837	we present the results of an extensive spectroscopic survey of rxj0152.7-1357, one of the most massive distant clusters of galaxies known.multi-object spectroscopy, carried out with fors1 and fors2 on the eso verylarge telescope (vlt), has allowed us to measure more than 200 redshifts in thecluster field and to confirm 102 galaxies as cluster members. the mean redshiftof the cluster is $z=0.837 \pm 0.001$ and we estimate the velocity dispersionof the overall cluster galaxy distribution to be $\sim 1600 \mathrm{km \s^{-1}}$. the distribution of cluster members is clearly irregular, with twomain clumps that follow the x-ray cluster emission mapped by chandra. a thirdclump of galaxies to the east of the central structure and at the clusterredshift has also been identified. the two main clumps have velocitydispersions of $\sim919$ and $\sim737 \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$ respectively, and thepeculiar velocity of the two clumps suggests that they will merge into a singlemore massive cluster. a segregation in the star formation activity of themember galaxies is observed. all star forming galaxies are located outside thehigh-density peaks, which are populated only by passive galaxies. a populationof red galaxies (belonging to the cluster red sequence) with clearpost-starburst spectral features and [oii] ($\lambda$3727) emission lines isobserved in the outskirts of the cluster. two agns, which were previouslyconfused with the diffuse x-ray emission from the intracluster medium in rosatand bepposax observations, are found to be cluster members.

astro-ph;0605151	on the efficiency and reliability of cluster mass estimates based on  member galaxies	we study the efficiency and reliability of cluster mass estimators that arebased on the projected phase-space distribution of galaxies in a clusterregion. to this aim, we analyse a data-set of 62 clusters extracted from aconcordance lcdm cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. galaxies (or darkmatter particles) are first selected in cylinders of given radius (from 0.5 to1.5 mpc/h) and ~200 mpc/h length. cluster members are then identified byapplying a suitable interloper removal algorithm.  two cluster mass estimators are considered: the virial mass estimator (mvir),and a mass estimator (msigma) based entirely on the cluster velocity dispersionestimate. mvir overestimates the true mass by ~10%, and msigma underestimatesthe true mass by ~15%, on average, for sample sizes of &gt; 60 cluster members.for smaller sample sizes, the bias of the virial mass estimator substantiallyincreases, while the msigma estimator becomes essentially unbiased. thedispersion of both mass estimates increases by a factor ~2 as the number ofcluster members decreases from ~400 to ~20. the bias in the mvir estimates isreduced in clusters without significant evidence for subclustering, and whenonly early-type galaxies are selected.  radially-dependent incompleteness can drastically affect mvir estimates, butleaves the msigma estimates almost unaffected. other observational effects,like centering and velocity errors, and different observational apertures, havelittle effect on the mass estimates.

(1997) on the edinburgh/durham southern galaxy catalogue. weanalyze the effect of several uncertainties connected to photometric data,fore/background removal, and extrapolation below the completeness limit of thephotometry, in order to assess the robustness of our cluster luminosityestimates. we draw our results on the relations between luminosity anddynamical quantities from the cosmos sample by considering mass andluminosities determined within the virialization radius. we find a very goodcorrelation between cluster luminosity, l_{b_j}, and galaxy velocitydispersion, sigma_v, with l_{b_j} proportional to sigma_v^{2.1--2.3}. ourestimate of typical value for the mass-to-light ratio is m/l_{b_j} about 250(in solar units). we do not find any correlation of m/l_{b_j} with clustermorphologies, i.e. rood--sastry and bautz--morgan types, and only a weaksignificant correlation with cluster richness. we find that mass has a slight,but significant, tendency to increase faster than the luminosity does, mproportional to l_{b_j}^{1.2--1.3}. we verify the robustness of this relationagainst a number of possible systematics.

astro-ph;9910470	confirming eis clusters. multi-object spectroscopy	using efosc2 at the 3.6m eso telescope, we obtained redshifts for 68 galaxiesin the field of six cluster candidates from the eso imaging survey (eis). thecluster candidates were selected in the eis patches c and d and have estimatedmean redshifts between z=0.5 and z=0.7.  in the six candidate cluster fields, we identify possible systems of galaxiesin the redshift space. the likelihoods of these systems are established bycomparison with random resamplings of the canada-france redshift surveys, andusing the redshift distribution expected from postman et al.'s luminosityfunction, with poggianti's k- and evolutionary-corrections.  four of the six candidate eis clusters are found to correspond to a realsystem in the redshift space, with &gt; 95 % probability. two of them have a meanredshift in agreement with the estimate from the matched filter algorithm,while the other two have a significantly smaller redshift.  the independent analysis of the v-i vs. i color-magnitude diagrams for fiveof our six cluster fields, supports our conclusions based on the spectroscopicdata.
