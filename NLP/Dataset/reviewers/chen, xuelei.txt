0901.1215	couplings between holographic dark energy and dark matter	we consider the interaction between dark matter and dark energy in theframework of holographic dark energy, and propose a natural and physicallyplausible form of interaction, in which the interacting term is proportional tothe product of the powers of the dark matter and dark energy densities. weinvestigate the cosmic evolution in such models. the impact of the coupling onthe dark matter and dark energy components may be asymmetric. while the darkenergy decouples from the dark matter at late time, just as other components ofthe cosmic fluid become decoupled as the universe expands, interestingly, thedark matter may actually become coupled to the dark energy at late time. weshall name such a phenomenon as "incoupling". we use the latest type iasupernovae data from the scp team, baryon acoustics oscillation data from sdssand 2df surveys, and the position of the first peak of the cmb angular powerspectrum to constrain the model. we find that the interaction term which isproportional to the the first power product of the dark energy and dark matterdensities gives excellent fit to the current data.

0902.4294	dark matter annihilation and non-thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect: i.  galaxy cluster	in this work we calculate the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect due to the$e^+e^-$ from dark matter (dm) annihilation in galaxy clusters. two candidatesof dm particle, (1) the weakly-interacting massive particle (wimp) and (2) thelight dark matter (ldm) are investigated. for each case, we also considerseveral dm profiles with and without central cusp. we generally find smallersignals than previously reported. moreover, the diffusion of electrons andpositrons in the galaxy clusters, which was generally thought to be negligible,is considered and found to have significant effect on the centralelectron/positron distribution for dm profile with large spatial gradient. wefind that the sz effect from wimp is almost always non-observable, even for thehighly cuspy dm profile, and using the next generation sz interferometer suchas alma. although the signal of the ldm is much larger than that of the wimp,the final sz effect is still very small due to the smoothing effect ofdiffusion. only for the configuration with large central cusp and extremelysmall diffusion effect, the ldm induced sz effect might have a bit chance ofbeing detected.

0904.4254	the 21 cm forest as a probe of the reionization and the temperature of  the intergalactic medium	using high redshift radio sources as background, the 21cm forest observationsprobe the neutral hydrogen absorption signatures of early structures along thelines of sight. directly sensitive to the spin temperature, it complements the21cm tomography observations, and provides information on the temperature aswell as the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (igm). we use aradiative transfer simulation to investigate the 21cm forest signals during theepoch of reionization. we first confirmed that the optical depth and equivalentwidth (ew) are good representations of the ionization and thermal state of theigm. the features selected by their relative optical depth are excellenttracers of ionization fields, while those selected by absolute optical depthare very sensitive to the igm temperature, so the igm temperature informationcould potentially be extracted, thus breaking a degeneracy in 21cm tomographicobservation. from the distributions of ews and the number evolution ofabsorbers and leakers with different ews, we see clearly the cosmologicalevolution of ionization state of the igm. the number density of potentiallyobservable features decreases rapidly with increasing gas temperature. thesensitivity of the proposed ew statistic to the igm temperature makes it aunique and potentially powerful probe of reionization. missing small-scalestructures, such as small filaments and minihalos that are unresolved in ourcurrent simulation, and lack of an accurate calculation of the igm temperature,however, likely have rendered the presented signals quantitatively inaccurate.finally we discuss the requirements of the background radio sources for suchobservations, and find that signals with equivalent widths larger than 1khz arehopeful to be detected.(abridged)

0904.4257	primordial non-gaussianity from lamost surveys	the primordial non-gaussianity (png) in matter density perturbation is a verypowerful probe of the physics of the very early universe. the local png caninduce a distinct scale-dependent bias on the large scale structuredistribution of galaxies and quasars, which could be used for constraining it.we study the detection limits on png from the surveys of the lamost telescope.the cases of the main galaxy survey, the luminous red galaxy (lrg) survey, andthe quasar survey of different magnitude limits are considered. we find thatthe main1 sample (i.e. the main galaxy survey with one magnitude deeper thanthe sdss main galaxy survey, or r&lt;18.8) could only provide very weak constrainton png. for the main2 sample (r&lt;19.8) and the lrg survey, the 2\sigma (95.5%)limit on the png parameter f_{nl} are |f_{nl}|&lt;145 and |f_{nl}|&lt;114respectively, comparable to the current limit from cosmic microwave background(cmb) data. the quasar survey could provide much more stringent constraint, andwe find that the 2\sigma limit for |f_{nl}| is between 50 and 103, depending onthe magnitude limit of the survey. with planck-like priors on cosmologicalparameters, the quasar survey with g&lt;21.65 would improve the constraints to|f_{nl}|&lt;43 (2\sigma). we also discuss the possibility of further tighteningthe constraint by using the relative bias method proposed by seljak(2008).

0909.2692	cosmology with photometric surveys of type ia supernovae	we discuss the extent to which photometric measurements alone can be used toidentify type ia supernovae (snia) and to determine redshift and otherparameters of interest for cosmological studies. we fit the light curve data ofthe type expected from a survey such as the one planned with large synopticsurvey telescope (lsst) and also to remove the contamination from thecore-collapse supernovae to snia samples. we generate 1000 snia mock flux datafor each of the lsst filters based on existing design parameters, then use amarkov chain monte-carlo (mcmc) analysis to fit for the redshift, apparentmagnitude, stretch factor and the phase of the snia. we find that the modelfitting works adequately well when the true sne redshift is below 0.5, while at$z &lt; 0.2$ the accuracy of the photometric data is almost comparable withspectroscopic measurements of the same sample. we discuss the contamination oftype ib/c (snib/c) and type ii supernova (snii) on the snia data set. we findit is easy to distinguish the snii through the large $\chi^2$ mismatch whenfitting to photometric data with ia light curves. this is not the case forsnib/c. we implement a statistical method based on the bayesian estimation inorder to statistically reduce the contamination from snib/c for cosmologicalparameter measurements from the whole sne sample. the proposed statisticalmethod also evaluate the fraction of the snia in the total sne data set, whichprovides a valuable guide to establish the degree of contamination.

0912.2504	leptonic dark matter annihilation in the evolving universe: constraints  and implications	the cosmic electron and positron excesses have been explained as possibledark matter (dm) annihilation products. in this work we investigate thepossible effects of such a dm annihilation scenario during the evolutionhistory of the universe. we first calculate the extragalactic $\gamma$-raybackground (egrb), which is produced through the final state radiation of dmannihilation to charged leptons and the inverse compton scattering betweenelectrons/positrons and the cosmic microwave background. the dm halo profileand the minimal halo mass, which are not yet well determined from the currentn-body simulations, are constrained by the egrb data from egret and fermitelescopes. then we discuss the impact of such leptonic dm models on cosmicevolution, such as the reionization and heating of intergalactic medium,neutral hydrogen 21 cm signal and suppression of structure formation. we showthat the impact on the hydrogen 21 cm signal might show interesting signaturesof dm annihilation, but the influence on star formation is not remarkable.future observations of the 21 cm signals could be used to place new constraintson the properties of dm.

1003.6056	cosmological models with lagrange multiplier field	we first consider the einstein-aether theory with a gravitational couplingand a lagrange multiplier field, and then consider the non-minimally coupledquintessence field theory with lagrange multiplier field. we study theinfluence of the lagrange multiplier field on these models. we show that theenergy density evolution of the einstein-aether field and the quintessencefield are significantly modified. the energy density of the einstein-aether isnearly a constant during the entire history of the universe. the energy densityof the quintessence field can also be kept nearly constant in the matterdominated universe, or even exhibit a phantom-like behavior for some models.this suggests a possible dynamical origin of the cosmological constant or darkenergy. further more, for the canonical quintessence in the absence ofgravitational coupling, we find that the quintessence scalar field can play therole of cold dark matter with the introduction of a lagrange multiplier field.we conclude that the lagrange multiplier field could play a very interestingand important role in the construction of cosmological models.

1005.2325	dark matter annihilation and non-thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect: ii.  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we calculate the cmb temperature distortion due to the energetic electronsand positrons produced by dark matter annihilation (sunyaev-zel'dovich effect),in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). in the calculation we have included twoimportant effects which were previously ignored. first we show that theelectron-positron pairs with energy less than gev, which were neglected inprevious calculation, could contribute a significant fraction of the totalsignal. secondly we also consider the full effects of diffusion loss, whichcould significantly reduce the density of electron-positron pairs at the centerof cuspy halos. for neutralinos, we confirm that detecting such kind of szeffect is beyond the capability of the current or even the next generationexperiments. in the case of light dark matter (ldm) the signal is much larger,but even in this case it is only marginally detectable with the next generationof experiment such as alma. we conclude that similar to the case of galaxyclusters, in the dwarf galaxies the $sz_2dm}$ effect is not a strong probe ofdm annihilations.

1009.1149	the earliest galaxies seen in 21 cm line absorption	we investigate the 21 cm absorption lines produced by non-linear structuresduring the early stage of reionization, i.e. the starless minihalos and thedwarf galaxies. after a detailed modelling of their properties, with particularattention to the coupling physics, we determine their 21 cm absorption lineprofiles. the infalling gas velocity around minihalos/dwarf galaxies stronglyaffects the line shape, and with the low spin temperatures outside the virialradii of the systems, gives rise to horn-like line profiles. the optical depthof a dwarf galaxy is reduced for lines of sight penetrating through its hiiregion, and especially, a large hii region created by a dwarf galaxy withhigher stellar mass and/or a top-heavy initial mass function results in anoptical depth trough rather than an absorption line. we compute syntheticspectra of 21 cm forest for both high redshift quasars and radio afterglows ofgamma ray bursts (grbs). even with the planned ska, radio afterglows of most ifnot all grbs would still be too dim to be the background sources for highresolution (1 khz) observations, but absorption lines can be easily detectedtowards a high-z quasar. broadband observation against grb afterglows can alsobe used to reveal the evolving 21 cm signal from both minihalos and dwarfgalaxies if there was no x-ray background or it was extremely weak, but itbecomes difficult if an early x-ray background existed. hence the 21 cmabsorption could be a powerful probe of the presence/intensity of the x-raybackground and the thermal history of the early universe.

1010.3035	topology of large scale structure as test of modified gravity	the genus of the iso-density contours is a robust measure of the topology oflarge scale structure, and it is relatively insensitive to nonlineargravitational evolution, galaxy bias and redshift-space distortion. we showthat the growth of density fluctuations is scale-dependent even in the linearregime in some modified gravity theories, which opens a new possibility oftesting the theories observationally. we propose to use the genus of theiso-density contours, an intrinsic measure of the topology of large scalestructure, as a statistic to be used in such tests. in einstein's generaltheory of relativity, density fluctuations are growing at the same rate on allscales in the linear regime, and the genus per comoving volume is almostconserved as structures are growing homologously, so we expect that thegenus-smoothing scale relation is basically time-independent. however, in somemodified gravity models where structures grow with different rates on differentscales, the genus-smoothing scale relation should change over time. this can beused to test the gravity models with large scale structure observations. westudied the case of the f(r) theory, dgp braneworld theory as well as theparameterized post-friedmann (ppf) models. we also forecast how the modifiedgravity models can be constrained with optical/ir or redshifted 21cm radiosurveys in the near future.

1104.1233	constraint on dark matter annihilation with dark star formation using  fermi extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background data	it has been proposed that during the formation of the first generation starsthere might be a "dark star" phase in which the power of the star comes fromdark matter annihilation. the adiabatic contraction process to form the darkstar would result in a highly concentrated density profile of the host halo atthe same time, which may give enhanced indirect detection signals of darkmatter. in this work we investigate the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray backgroundfrom dark matter annihilation with such a dark star formation scenario, andemploy the isotropic $\gamma$-ray data from fermi-lat to constrain the modelparameters of dark matter. the results suffer from large uncertainties of boththe formation rate of the first generation stars and the subsequent evolutioneffects of the host halos of the dark stars. we find, in the most optimisticcase for $\gamma$-ray production via dark matter annihilation, the expectedextragalactic $\gamma$-ray flux will be enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude. insuch a case, the annihilation cross section of the supersymmetric dark mattercan be constrained to the thermal production level, and the leptonic darkmatter model which is proposed to explain the positron/electron excesses can bewell excluded. conversely, if the positron/electron excesses are of a darkmatter annihilation origin, then the early universe environment is such that nodark star can form.

1108.0947	the oh line contamination of 21 cm intensity fluctuation measurements  for z=1~4	the large-scale structure of the universe can be mapped with unresolvedintensity fluctuations of the 21 cm line. the power spectrum of the intensityfluctuations has been proposed as a probe of the baryon acoustic oscillationsat low to moderate redshifts with interferometric experiments now underconsideration. we discuss the contamination to the low-redshift 21 cm intensitypower spectrum generated by the 18 cm oh line since the intensity fluctuationsof the oh line generated at a slightly higher redshift contribute to theintensity fluctuations observed in an experiment. we assume the oh megamaserluminosity is correlated with the star formation rate, and use the simulationto estimate the oh signal and the spatial anisotropies. we also use asemi-analytic simulation to predict the 21 cm power spectrum. at z=1 to 3, wefind that the oh contamination could reach 0.1% to 1% of the 21 cm rmsfluctuations at the scale of the first peak of the baryon acoustic oscillation.when z&gt;3 the oh signal declines quickly, so that the contamination on the 21-cmbecomes negligible at high redshifts.

0710.2618	probing the intrinsic shape and alignment of dark matter haloes using  sdss galaxy groups	we study the three-dimensional and projected shapes of galaxy groups in thesloan digital sky survey data release 4, and examine the alignment between theorientation of the central galaxy and the spatial distribution of satellitegalaxies. the projected ellipticity of a group is measured using the moments ofthe discrete distribution of its member galaxies. we infer thethree-dimensional and projected axis ratios of their dark matter haloes bycomparing the measured ellipticity distributions with those obtained from montecarlo simulations of projected, triaxial dark matter haloes with different axisratios. we find that the halo shape has a strong dependence on the halo mass.while the haloes of low-mass groups are nearly spherical, those of massivegroups tend to be prolate. for groups containing at least four members, thestatistical distribution of their measured ellipticities does not have a strongdependence on the colors of their central galaxies. our analysis further showsthat the average three-dimensional axis ratio for haloes with $12&lt;{\rmlog}[m/(h^{-1}m_{\odot})]\leq15$ is about $1:0.46:0.46$, resulting in aprojected axis ratio of $\sim 0.77$. our results for the alignment between theorientation of the central galaxy of a group and the distribution of theirsatellite galaxies are in broad agreement with those obtained by yang et al.the distribution of satellite galaxies preferentially aligns with the majoraxis of the central galaxy, with a clear dependence on both halo mass andgalaxy colors.

1201.3686	reionization in the warm dark matter model	compared with the cold dark matter (cdm) model, in the warm dark matter (wdm)model formation of small scale structure is suppressed. it is often thoughtthat this would delay the reionization of the intergalactic medium (igm), asthe star formation rate during the epoch of reionization (eor) would belowered. however, during the later stage of the eor, a large portion of theionizing photons are consumed by recombination inside the minihalos, where thegas has higher density and recombination rates than the gas in the igm. thesuppression of small scale structure would therefore reduce the recombinationrate, and could potentially shorten the reionization process. this effect isinvestigated here by using the analytical "bubble model" of reionization. wefind that in some cases, though the initiation of the eor is delayed in the wdmmodel, its completion could be even earlier than the cdm case, but the effectis generally small. we obtain limits on the wdm particles mass for differentreionization redshifts.

0711.1641	features of holographic dark energy under the combined cosmological  constraints	we investigate the observational signatures of the holographic dark energymodels in this paper, including both the original model and a model with aninteraction term between the dark energy and dark matter. we first delineatethe dynamical behavior of such models, especially whether they would have "bigrip" for different parameters, then we use several recent observations,including 182 high-quality type ia supernovae data observed with the hubblespace telescope, the snls and essence surveys, 42 latest chandra x-ray clustergas mass fraction, 27 high-redshift gamma-ray burst samples, the baryonacoustic oscillation measurement from the sloan digital sky survey, and the cmbshift parameter from wmap three years result to give more reliable and tighterconstraints on the holographic dark energy models. the results of ourconstraints for the holographic dark energy model without interaction is$c=0.748^{+0.108}_{-0.009}$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m0}}=0.276^{+0.017}_{-0.016}$,and for model with interaction ($c=0.692^{+0.135}_{-0.107}$,$\omega_{\mathrm{m0}}=0.281^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ ,$\alpha=-0.006^{+0.021}_{-0.024}$, where $\alpha$ is an interacting parameter). as thesemodels have more parameters than the $\lambda$cdm model, we use the bayesianevidence as a model selection criterion to make comparison. we found that theholographic dark energy models are mildly favored by the observations comparedwith the $\mathrm{\lambda cdm}$ model.

1206.3750	the contribution of ultracompact dark matter minihalos to the isotropic  radio background	the ultracompact minihalos could be formed during the earlier epoch of theuniverse. the dark matter annihilation within them is very strong due to thesteep density profile, $\rho \sim r^{-2.25}$. the high energy electrons andpositrons from the dark matter annihilation can inverse compton scatter (ics)with the background photons, such as cmb photons, to acquire higher energy. onthe other hand, the synchrotron radiation can also be produced when they meetthe magnetic field. in this paper, we study the signals from the ucmhs due tothe dark matter annihilation for the radio, x-ray and $\gamma$-ray band. wefound that for the radio emission the ucmhs can provide one kind of source forthe radio excess observed by arcade 2.  but the x-ray signals due to the ics effect or the $\gamma$-ray signalsmainly due to the prompt emission from dark matter would exceed the presentobservations, such as fermi, comptel and chandra. we found that the strongestlimits on the fraction of ucmhs come from the x-ray observations and theconstraints from the radio data are the weakest.

1208.6234	the contribution of high redshift galaxies to the near-infrared  background	several independent measurements have confirmed the existence of fluctuations($\delta f_{\rm obs}\approx 0.1 \rm nw/m^{2}/sr$ at $3.6 \rm \mu m$) up todegree angular scales in the source-subtracted near infrared background (nirb)whose origin is unknown. by combining high resolution cosmologicaln-body/hydrodynamical simulations with an analytical model, and by matchinggalaxy luminosity functions (lfs) and the constraints on reionizationsimultaneously, we predict the nirb absolute flux and fluctuation amplitudeproduced by high-$z$ ($z &gt; 5$) galaxies (some of which harboring pop iii stars,shown to provide a negligible contribution). this strategy also allows us tomake an empirical determination of the evolution of ionizing photon escapefraction: we find $f_{\rm esc} = 1$ at $z \ge 11$, decreasing to $\approx 0.05$at $z = 5$. in the wavelength range $1.0-4.5 \rm \mu m$, the predictedcumulative flux is $f =0.2-0.04 \rm nw/m^2/sr$. however, we find that theradiation from high-$z$ galaxies (including those undetected by currentsurveys) is insufficient to explain the amplitude of the observed fluctuations:at $l=2000$, the fluctuation level due to $z &gt; 5$ galaxies is $\delta f =0.01-0.002 \rm nw/m^2/sr$, with a relative wavelength-independent amplitude$\delta f/f = 4$%. the source of the missing power remains unknown. this mightindicate that an unknown component/foreground, with a clustering signal verysimilar to that of high-$z$ galaxies, dominates the source-subtracted nirbfluctuation signal.

1208.6502	the age-redshift relation for luminous red galaxies obtained from the  full spectrum fitting and its cosmological implications	the relative age of galaxies at different redshifts can be used to infer thehubble parameter and put constraints on cosmological models. we select 23,883quiescent luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sdss dr7 and divide them intofour sub-samples according to their velocity dispersions and each sub-sample isfurther divided into 12 redshift bins. the spectra of the lrgs in each redshiftand velocity bin are co-added in order to obtain a combined spectrum withrelatively high $s/n$. adopting the galexev/stelib model, we estimate the meanages of the lrgs from these combined spectra by the full-spectrum fittingmethod. we check the reliability of the estimated age by using monte-carlosimulations and find that the estimates are robust and reliable. assuming thatthe lrgs in each sub-sample and each redshift bin were on average formed at thesame time, the hubble parameter at the present time $h_0$ is estimated from theage--redshift relation obtained for each sub-sample, which is compatible withthe $h_0$ value measured by other methods. we demonstrate that a systematicbias (up to $\sim 20%$) may be introduced to the $h_0$ estimation because ofrecent star formation in the lrgs due to the later major mergers at $z\la 0.4$,but this bias may be negligible for those sub-samples with large velocitydispersions. using the age--redshift relations obtained from the sub-samplewith the largest velocity dispersion or the two sub-samples with high velocitydispersions, we find $h_0= 65^{+7}_{-3}\kmsmpc$ or $h_0= 74^{+5}_{-4}\kmsmpc$by assuming a spatially flat $\lambda$cdm cosmology. with upcoming surveys,such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), even larger samplesof quiescent massive lrgs may be obtained, and thus the hubble parameter can bemeasured with high accuracy through the age--redshift relation.

1210.2136	observational constraints on cosmic neutrinos and dark energy revisited	using several cosmological observations, i.e. the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies (wmap), the weak gravitational lensing (cfhtls), the measurementsof baryon acoustic oscillations (sdss+wigglez), the most recent observationalhubble parameter data, the union2.1 compilation of type ia supernovae, and thehst prior, we impose constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\mnu$), theeffective number of neutrino species ($\neff$) and dark energy equation ofstate ($w$), individually and collectively. we find that a tight upper limit on$\mnu$ can be extracted from the full data combination, if $\neff$ and $w$ arefixed. however this upper bound is severely weakened if $\neff$ and $w$ areallowed to vary. this result naturally raises questions on the robustness ofprevious strict upper bounds on $\mnu$, ever reported in the literature. thebest-fit values from our most generalized constraint read$\mnu=0.556^{+0.231}_{-0.288}\rm ev$, $\neff=3.839\pm0.452$, and$w=-1.058\pm0.088$ at 68% confidence level, which shows a firm lower limit ontotal neutrino mass, favors an extra light degree of freedom, and supports thecosmological constant model. the current weak lensing data are already helpfulin constraining cosmological model parameters for fixed $w$. the dataset ofhubble parameter gains numerous advantages over supernovae when $w=-1$,particularly its illuminating power in constraining $\neff$. as long as $w$ isincluded as a free parameter, it is still the standardizable candles of type iasupernovae that play the most dominant role in the parameter constraints.

1212.6099	semi-numerical simulation of reionization with semi-analytical modeling  of galaxy formation	in a semi-numerical model of reionization, the evolution of ionizationfraction is simulated approximately by the ionizing photon to baryon ratiocriterion. in this paper we incorporate a semi-analytical model of galaxyformation based on the millennium ii n-body simulation into the semi-numericalmodeling of reionization. the semi-analytical model is used to predict theproduction of ionizing photons, then we use the semi-numerical method to modelthe reionization process. such an approach allows more detailed modeling of thereionization, and also connects observations of galaxies at low and highredshifts to the reionization history. the galaxy formation model we use wasdesigned to match the low-$z$ observations, and it also fits the high redshiftluminosity function reasonably well, but its prediction on the star formationfalls below the observed value, and we find that it also underpredicts thestellar ionizing photon production rate, hence the reionization can not becompleted at $z \sim 6$ without taking into account some other potentialsources of ionization photons. we also considered simple modifications of themodel with more top heavy initial mass functions (imf), with which thereionization can occur at earlier epochs. the incorporation of thesemi-analytical model may also affect the topology of the hi regions during theeor, and the neutral regions produced by our simulations with thesemi-analytical model appeared less poriferous than the simple halo-basedmodels.

1303.2746	bsg alignment of sdss galaxy groups	we study the alignment signal between the distribution of brightest satellitegalaxies (bsgs) and the major axis of their host groups using sdss groupcatalog constructed by yang et al. (2007). after correcting for the effect ofgroup ellipticity, a statistically significant (~ 5\sigma) major-axis alignmentis detected and the alignment angle is found to be 43.0 \pm 0.4 degrees. moremassive and richer groups show stronger bsg alignment. the bsg alignment aroundblue bcgs is slightly stronger than that around red bcgs. and red bsgs havemuch stronger major-axis alignment than blue bsgs. unlike bsgs, othersatellites do not show very significant alignment with group major axis. wefurther explore the bsg alignment in semi-analytic model (sam) constructed byguo et al. (2011). we found general good agreement with observations: bsgs insam show strong major-axis alignment which depends on group mass and richnessin the same way as observations; and none of other satellites exhibit prominentalignment. however, discrepancy also exists in that the sam shows opposite bsgcolor dependence, which is most probably induced by the missing of large scaleenvironment ingredient in sam. the combination of two popular scenarios canexplain the detected bsg alignment. the first one: satellites merged into thegroup preferentially along the surrounding filaments, which is strongly alignedwith the major axis of the group. the second one: bsgs enter their host groupmore recently than other satellites, then will preserve more information aboutthe assembling history and so the major-axis alignment. in sam, we foundpositive evidence for the second scenario by the fact that bsgs merged intogroups statistically more recently than other satellites. on the other hand,although is opposite in sam, the bsg color dependence in observation mightindicate the first scenario as well.

1305.2984	on the full spectrum fitting of luminous red galaxies by using ulyss and  starlight	in this paper, we select a sample of quiescent luminous red galaxies (lrgs)from sloan digital sky survey data release 7 (sdss dr7) with signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) substantially high to study the consistency of the full spectrumfitting method by using different packages, mainly, ulyss and starlight. thespectrum of each galaxy in the sample is fitted by the full spectrum fittingpackages ulyss and starlight, respectively. we find: (1) for spectra withhigher s/ns, the ages of stellar populations obtained from ulyss are slightlyolder than that from starlight, and metallicities derived from ulyss areslightly richer than that from starlight. in general, both packages can giveroughly consistent fitting results. (2) for low s/n spectra, it is possiblethat the fitting by ulyss can be trapped some local minimum parametric regionsduring execution and thus may give unreliable results, while starlight canstill give reliable results. based on the fitting results of lrgs, we furtheranalyse their star formation history (sfh) and the relation between their ageand velocity dispersion, and find that those highly agrees with conclusionsfrom others' previous work.

1305.5177	infrared background signatures of the first black holes	angular fluctuations of the near infrared background (nirb) intensity areobserved up to scales $\simlt 1^{\ensuremath{^{\circ}}}$. their interpretationis challenging as even after removing the contribution from detected sources,the residual signal is $&gt;10$ times higher than expected from distant galaxiesbelow the detection limit and first stars. we propose here a novelinterpretation in which early, intermediate mass, accreting direct collapseblack holes (dcbh), which are too faint to be detected individually in currentsurveys, could explain the observed fluctuations. we find that a population ofhighly obscured ($n_{\rm h}\simgt 10^{25} \rm cm^{-2}$) dcbhs formed inmetal-free halos with virial temperature $10^4$ k at $z\simgt 12$, can explainthe observed level $\approx 10^{-3}$ (nw m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1})^2$ of the 3.6 and4.5 $\mu$m fluctuations on scales $&gt;100''$. the signal on smaller scales isinstead produced by undetected galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts.albeit compton-thick, at scales $\theta&gt; 100''$ dcbhs produce a cxb (0.5-2kev)-nirb ($4.5 \rm \mu m$) cross-correlation signal of $\simeq 10^{-11}$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ nw m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ slightly dependent on the specificvalue of the absorbing gas column ($n_{\rm h} \approx 10^{25} \rm cm^{-2}$)adopted and in agreement with the recent measurements by\cite{2012arxiv1210.5302c}. at smaller scales the cross-correlation isdominated by the emission of high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxb) hosted by the samelow-$z$, undetected galaxies accounting for small scale nirb fluctuations.these results outline the great potential of the nirb as a tool to investigatethe nature of the first galaxies and black holes.

1312.4960	an analytical model of the large neutral regions during the late stage  of reionization	in this paper we investigate the nature and distribution of large neutralregions during the late epoch of reionization. in the "bubble model" ofreionization, the mass distribution of large ionized regions ("bubbles") duringthe early stage of reionization is obtained by using the excursion set model,where the ionization of a region corresponds to the first up-crossing of abarrier by random trajectories. we generalize this idea, and develop a methodto predict the distribution of large scale neutral regions during the latestage of reionization, taking into account the ionizing background after thepercolation of hii regions. the large scale neutral regions which we call"neutral islands" are not individual galaxies or minihalos, but larger regionswhere fewer galaxies formed and hence ionized later, and they are identified inthe excursion set model with the first down-crossings of the island barrier.assuming that the consumption rate of ionizing background photons isproportional to the surface area of the neutral islands, we obtained the sizedistribution of the neutral islands. we also take the "bubbles-in-island"effect into account by considering the conditional probability of up-crossing abubble barrier after down-crossing the island barrier. we find that this effectis very important. an additional barrier is set to avoid islands beingpercolated through. we find that there is a characteristic scale for theneutral islands, while the small islands are rapidly swallowed up by theionizing background, this characteristic scale does not change much as thereionization proceeds.

1402.5675	the brief era of direct collapse black hole formation	it has been proposed that the first, intermediate-mass ($\approx10^{5-6}~m_\odot$) black holes might form through direct collapse of unpollutedgas in atomic-cooling halos exposed to a strong lyman-werner (lw) ornear-infrared (nir) radiation. as these systems are expected to becompton-thick, photons above 13.6 ev are largely absorbed and re-processed intolower energy bands. it follows that direct collapse black holes (dcbhs) arevery bright in the lw/nir bands, typically outshining small high-redshiftgalaxies by more than 10 times. once the first dcbhs form, they then trigger arunaway process of further dcbh formation, producing a sudden rise in theircosmic mass density. the universe enters the "dcbh era" at $z \approx 20$ whena large fraction of atomic-cooling halos are experiencing dcbh formation. bycombining the clustering properties of the radiation sources with monte carlosimulations we show that in this scenario the dcbh mass density rises from$\sim 5$~$m_\odot$ mpc$^{-3}$ at $z\sim 30$ to the peak value $\sim5\times10^5m_\odot$ mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 14$ in our fiducial model. however, theabundance of \textit{active} (accreting) dcbhs drops after $z \sim 14$, as gasin the potential formation sites (unpolluted halos with virial temperatureslightly above $10^4$~k) is photoevaporated. this effect almost completelysuppresses dcbh formation after $z\sim 13$. the dcbh formation era lasts only$\approx 150$ myr, but it might crucially provide the seeds of the supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) powering $z\sim6$ quasars.

1405.2835	tev cosmic-ray proton and helium spectra in the myriad model ii	recent observations show that the cosmic ray nuclei spectra start to hardenabove 100 gev, in contradiction with the conventional steady-state cosmic raymodel. we had suggested that this anomaly is due to the propagation effect ofcosmic rays released from local young cosmic ray sources, the total flux of thecosmic ray should be computed with the myriad model, where contribution fromsources in local catalog is added to the background. however, while thehardening could be elegantly explained in this model, the model parametersobtained from the fit skew toward a region with fast diffusion and lowsupernova rate in the galaxy, in tension with other observations. in thispaper, we further explore this model in order to set up a concordant picture.two possible improvements related to the cosmic ray sources have beenconsidered. firstly, instead of the usual axisymmetric disk model, weconsidered a spiral model of source distribution. secondly, for the nearby andyoung sources which are paramount to the hardening, we allow for anenergy-dependent escape time. we find that major improvement comes from theenergy-dependent escape time of the local sources, and with both modifications,not only the cosmic ray proton and helium anomalies are solved, but also theparameters attain reasonable range values compatible with other analysis.

1406.3868	interactions of galaxies outside clusters and massive groups	we investigate the dependence of physical properties on small and large scaledensity environment. the galaxy population consists of mainly passivelyevolving galaxies in comparatively low density regions of sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). the environment is defined by (i) local density using adaptivesmoothing kernel, (ii)projected distance, $r_p$, to the nearest neighbor and(iii) the morphology of the nearest neighbor. in order to detect long-rangeinteraction effects we divide galaxy interactions into four cases depending onmorphology of target and neighbor galaxies. we report that the impact ofinteraction on galaxy properties is detectable at least out to the pairseparation corresponding to the virial radius of (the neighbor) galaxies in oursample, which is mostly between 210 and 360 $h^{-1}$kpc. we show that earlytype fraction, for isolated galaxies with $r_p &gt; r_{vir,nei}$ are almostignorant of the background density and, has a very weak density dependence forclosed pairs. star formation activity of a a galaxy is found to be cruciallydependent on neighbor galaxy morphology. we find star formation activityparameters and structure parameters of galaxies to be independent of the largescale background density. we also exhibit that changing the absolute magnitudeof the neighbor galaxies does not affect significantly the star formationactivity of those target galaxies whose morphology and luminosities are fixed.

0805.0842	effects of correlation between merging steps on the global halo  formation	the excursion set theory of halo formation is modified by adopting thefractional brownian motion, to account for possible correlation between mergingsteps. we worked out analytically the conditional mass function, halo mergingrate and formation time distribution in the spherical collapse model. we alsodeveloped an approximation for the ellipsoidal collapse model and applied it tothe calculation of the conditional mass function and the halo formation timedistribution. for models in which the steps are positively correlated, the halomerger rate is enhanced when the accreted mass is less than $\sim 25m^*$, whilefor the negatively correlated case this rate is reduced. compared with thestandard model in which the steps are uncorrelated, the models with positivelycorrelated steps produce more aged population in small mass halos and moreyounger population in large mass halos, while for the models with negativelycorrelated steps the opposite is true. an examination of simulation resultsshows that a weakly positive correlation between successive merging stepsappears to fit best. we have also found a systematic effect in the measuredmass function due to the finite volume of simulations. in future work, thiswill be included in the halo model to accurately predict the three pointcorrelation function estimated from simulations.

astro-ph;0107544	kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from halo rotation	we discuss the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) contribution to cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations due to coherent rotationalvelocity component of electrons within halos. this effect produces a distinctdipole-like temperature distribution across the the cluster, and provides apromising way to measure the angular momentum distribution of gas insideclusters. information obtained from such a measurement may provide new insightsto the origin and evolution of angular momentum in hierarchical structureformation theory. for typical, well relaxed, clusters of mass a few times10$^{14}$ m$_{\sun}$, the peak fluctuation is of the order a few $\mu$k,depending on the rotational velocity and the inclination angle of therotational axis. for clusters which had underwent a recent merger, thecontribution to temperature fluctuations could be even larger. this dipolesignature is similar to the one produced by lensed cmb towards galaxy clusters,though the lensing contribution spans a larger angular extent than the one dueto rotational scattering as the former depends on the gradient of the clusterpotential. since the lensing contribution towards clusters are aligned with thelarge scale cmb gradient, when higher resolution observations towards clustersare combined with a wide field cmb map, these two effects can be separated. anadditional, but less important, source of confusion is the dipolar patternproduced by the moving-lens effect involving, again, the gradient of thecluster potential and the transverse velocity. the angular power spectrum oftemperature anisotropies produced by the halo rotation is expected to besmaller than those due to the thermal sz and peculiar velocity kinetic szeffects.

astro-ph;0207180	detecting the baryons in matter power spectra	we examine power spectra from the abell/aco rich cluster survey and the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) for observational evidence of features producedby the baryons. a non-negligible baryon fraction produces relatively sharposcillatory features at specific wavenumbers in the matter power spectrum.however, the mere existence of baryons will also produce a global suppressionof the power spectrum. we look for both of these features using the falsediscovery rate (fdr) statistic. we show that the window effects on theabell/aco power spectrum are minimal, which has allowed for the discovery ofdiscrete oscillatory features in the power spectrum. on the other hand, thereare no statistically significant oscillatory features in the 2dfgrs powerspectrum, which is expected from the survey's broad window function. afteraccounting for window effects, we apply a scale-independent bias to the 2dfgrspower spectrum, p_{abell}(k) = b^2p_{2df}(k) and b = 3.2. we find that theoverall shapes of the abell/aco and the biased 2dfgrs power spectra areentirely consistent over the range 0.02 &lt;= k &lt;= 0.15hmpc^-1. we examine therange of omega_{matter} and baryon fraction for which these surveys coulddetect significant suppression in power. the reported baryon fractions for boththe abell/aco and 2dfgrs surveys are high enough to cause a detectablesuppression in power (after accounting for errors, windows and k-spacesampling). using the same technique, we also examine, given the best fit baryondensity obtained from bbn, whether it is possible to detect additionalsuppression due to dark matter-baryon interaction. we find that the limit ondark matter cross section/mass derived from these surveys are the same as thoseruled out in a recent study by chen, hannestad and scherrer.

astro-ph;0303395	the spin-kinetic temperature coupling and the heating rate due to lyman  alpha scattering before reionization: predictions for 21cm emission and  absorption	we investigate the interaction of lyman alpha photons produced by the firststars in the universe with the intergalactic medium (igm) prior toreionization. the background lyman alpha spectral profile is obtained bysolving a fokker-planck equation. accurate values of the heating and scatteringrates, and the spin-kinetic temperature coupling coefficient, are presented. weshow that the heating rate induced by the lyman alpha scatterings is much lowerthan found previously, and is basically negligible. the dominant heating sourceis most likely the x-rays from the first ionizing sources, which are able topenetrate into the atomic medium. the scattering of lyman alpha photons couplesthe hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic temperature. if the first ionizingsources in the universe did not emit significant x-rays, the spin temperaturewould be rapidly brought down to the very low gas kinetic temperature, and a21cm absorption signal against the cmb larger than 100 mk would be predicted.however, we argue that sufficient x-rays are likely to have been emitted by thefirst stellar population, implying that the gas kinetic temperature shouldrapidly increase, turning a reduced and brief absorption signal into emission,with a smaller amplitude of about 10 mk. the detection of the 21cm absorptionand emission feature would be a hallmark in unravelling the history of the``dark age'' before reionization.

astro-ph;0309116	can non-gaussian cosmological models explain the wmap's high optical  depth for reionization?	the first-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data suggest a highoptical depth for thomson scattering of 0.17 +/- 0.04, implying that theuniverse was reionized at an early epoch, z ~ 20. such early reionization islikely to be caused by uv photons from first stars, but it appears that theobserved high optical depth can be reconciled within the standard structureformation model only if star-formation in the early universe was extremelyefficient. with normal star-formation efficiencies, cosmological models withnon-gaussian density fluctuations may circumvent this conflict as high densitypeaks collapse at an earlier epoch than in models with gaussian fluctuations.we study cosmic reionization in non-gaussian models and explore to what extent,within available constraints, non-gaussianities affect the reionizationhistory. for mild non-gaussian fluctuations at redshifts of 30 to 50, theincrease in optical depth remains at a level of a few percent and appearsunlikely to aid significantly in explaining the measured high optical depth. onthe other hand, within available observational constraints, increasing thenon-gaussian nature of density fluctuations can easily reproduce the opticaldepth and may remain viable in underlying models of non-gaussianity with ascale-dependence.

astro-ph;0310473	particle decays during the cosmic dark ages	we consider particle decays during the cosmic dark ages with two aims: (1) toexplain the high optical depth reported by wmap, and (2) to provide newconstraints to the parameter space for decaying particles. we delineate thedecay channels in which most of the decay energy ionizes and heats the igm gas(and thus affects the cmb), and those in which most of the energy is carriedaway -- e.g. photons with energies 100 kev &lt; e &lt; 1 tev -- and thus appears as acontribution to diffuse x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. the new constraints tothe decay-particle parameters from the cmb power spectrum thus complement thosefrom the cosmic x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. although decaying particlescan indeed produce an optical depth consistent with that reported by wmap, inso doing they produce new fluctuations in the cmb temperature/polarizationpower spectra. for decay lifetimes less than the age of the universe, theinduced power spectra generally violate current constraints, while the powerspectra are usually consistent if the lifetime is longer than the age of theuniverse.

astro-ph;0603425	the impacts of dark matter particle annihilation on recombination and  the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background	the recombination history of the universe provides a useful tool forconstraining the annihilation of dark matter particles. even a small fractionof dark matter particles annihilated during the cosmic dark age can providesufficient energy to affect the ionization state of the baryonic gas. althoughthis effect is too small for neutralinos, lighter dark matter particlecandidates, e.g. with mass of 1-100 mev, which was proposed recently to explainthe observed excess of positrons in the galactic center, may generateobservable differences in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature andpolarization anisotropies. the annihilations at the era of recombinationaffects mainly the cmb anisotropy at small angular scales (large $\ell$), andis distinctively different from the effect of early reionization. we perform amulti-parameter analysis of the cmb data, including the both the wmap firstyear and three year data, and the acbar, boomerang, cbi, and vsa data. assumingthat the observed excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs in the galactic center region isproduced by dark matter annihilation, and that a sizable fraction of the energyproduced in the annihilation is deposited in the baryonic gas duringrecombination, we obtain a %95 dark matter mass limit of $m&lt;8 \mev$ with thecurrent data set.

astro-ph;0605439	the 21cm signature of the first stars	we predict the 21-cm signature of the first metal-free stars. the soft x-raysemitted by these stars penetrate the atomic medium around their host halos,generating lyman alpha photons that couple the spin and kinetic temperatures.these creates a region we call the lyman alpha sphere, visible in 21-cm againstthe cmb, which is much larger than the hii region produced by the same star.the spin and kinetic temperatures are strongly coupled before the x-rays cansubstantially heat the medium, implying that a strong 21-cm absorption signalfrom the adiabatically cooled gas in hubble expansion around the star isexpected when the medium has not been heated previously. a central region ofemission from the gas heated by the soft x-rays is also present although with aweaker signal than the absorption. the lyman alpha sphere is a universalsignature that should be observed around any first star illuminating itsvicinity for the first time. the 21-cm radial profile of the lyman alpha spherecan be calculated as a function of the luminosity, spectrum and age of thestar. for a star of a few hundred solar masses and zero metallicity (asexpected for the first stars), the physical radius of the lyman alpha spherecan reach tens of kiloparsecs. the first metal-free stars should be stronglyclustered because of high cosmic biasing; this implies that the regionsproducing a 21-cm absorption signal may contain more than one star and willgenerally be irregular and not spherical, because of the complex distributionof the gas. we discuss the feasiblity of detecting these lyman alpha spheres,which would be present at redshifts $z\sim 30$ in the cold dark matter model.their observation would represent a direct proof of the detection of a firststar.

astro-ph;0701492	detecting first star lyman-$\alpha$ spheres through gravitational  telescopes	lyman-$\alpha$ spheres, i.e. regions around the first stars which areilluminated by lyman-$\alpha$ photons and show 21cm absorption feature againstthe cmb, are smoking guns at the dawn of the reionization epoch. thoughoverwhelming radio foreground makes their detections extremely difficult, wepointed out that, strong gravitational lensing can significantly improve theirobservational feasibility. since lyman-$\alpha$ spheres have ~10" sizes,comparable to the caustic size of galaxy clusters, individual images of eachstrongly lensed lyman-$\alpha$ sphere often merge together and form singlestructures in the 21cm sky with irregular shapes. using high-resolution n-bodylcdm simulations, we found that the lensing probability to have magnificationbigger than 10 is ~10^{-5}. this results in $\ga 10^6$ strongly lensedlyman-$\alpha$ spheres across the sky, which should be the primary targets forfirst detections of lyman-$\alpha$ spheres. although the required total radioarray collecting area for their detection is large (~100 km^2), the design oflong fixed cylindrical reflectors can significantly reduce the total cost ofsuch array to the level of the square kilometer array (ska) and makes thedetection of these very first objects feasible.

0809.3002	forecasting the dark energy measurement with baryon acoustic  oscillations: prospects for the lamost surveys	the large area multi-object spectroscopic telescope (lamost) is a dedicatedspectroscopic survey telescope being built in china, with an effective apertureof 4 meters and equiped with 4000 fibers. using the lamost telescope, one couldmake redshift survey of the large scale structure (lss). the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) features in the lss power spectrum provide standard rulersfor measuring dark energy and other cosmological parameters. in this paper weinvestigate the meaurement precision achievable for a few possible surveys: (1)a magnitude limited survey of all galaxies, (2) a survey of color selected redluminous galaxies (lrg), and (3) a magnitude limited, high density survey ofz&lt;2 quasars. for each survey, we use the halo model to estimate the bias of thesample, and calculate the effective volume. we then use the fisher matrixmethod to forecast the error on the dark energy equation of state and othercosmological parameters for different survey parameters. in a few cases we alsouse the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method to make the same forecast as acomparison. the fiber time required for each of these surveys is alsoestimated. these results would be useful in designing the surveys for lamost.

astro-ph;9905368	cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropy in  brans-dicke cosmology	we develop a formalism for calculating cosmic microwave background (cmb)temperature and polarization anisotropies in cosmological models withbrans-dicke gravity. we then modify publicly available boltzmann codes tocalculate numerically the temperature and polarization power spectra. resultsare illustrated with a few representative models. comparing with thegeneral-relativistic model with the same cosmological parameters, both theamplitude and the width of the acoustic peaks are different in the brans-dickemodels. we use a covariance-matrix calculation to investigate whether theeffects of brans-dicke gravity are degenerate with those of variation in othercosmological parameters and to simultaneously determine whether forthcoming cmbmaps might be able to distinguish brans-dicke and general-relativisticcosmology. although the predicted power spectra for plausible brans-dickemodels differ from those in general relativity only slightly, we find that mapand/or the planck surveyor may in principle provide a test of brans-dicketheory that is competitive to solar-system tests. for example, if all otherparameters except for the cmb normalization are fixed, a value of thebrans-dicke parameter omega as large as 500 could be identified with map, andfor planck, values as large as omega \simeq3000 could be identified; thesesensitivities are decreased roughly by a factor of 3 if we marginalize over thebaryon density, hubble constant, spectral index, and reionization opticaldepth. in more general scalar-tensor theories, omega may evolve with time, andin this case, the cmb probe would be complementary to that from solar-systemtests.

0810.3359	alignments of group galaxies with neighboring groups	using a sample of galaxy groups found in the sloan digital  sky survey data release 4, we measure the following four types of alignmentsignals: (1) the alignment between the distributions of the satellites of eachgroup relative to the direction of the nearest neighbor group (nng); (2) thealignment between the major axis direction of the central galaxy of the hostgroup (hg) and the direction of the nng; (3) the alignment between the majoraxes of the central galaxies of the hg and the nng; and (4) the alignmentbetween the major axes of the satellites of the hg and the direction of thenng. we find strong signal of alignment between the satellite distribution andthe orientation of central galaxy relative to the direction of the nng, evenwhen the nng is located beyond $3r_{\rm vir}$ of the host group. the major axisof the central galaxy of the hg is aligned with the direction of the nng. thealignment signals are more prominent for groups that are more massive and withearly type central galaxies. we also find that there is a preference for thetwo major axis of the central galaxies of the hg and nng to be parallel for thesystem with both early central galaxies, however not for the systems with bothlate type central galaxies. for the orientation of satellite galaxies, we donot find any significant alignment signals relative to the direction of thenng. from these four types of alignment measurements, we conclude that thelarge scale environment traced by the nearby group affects primarily the shapeof the host dark matter halo, and hence also affects the distribution ofsatellite galaxies and the orientation of central galaxies.

gr-qc;0402026	testing non-standard cosmological models with supernovae	in this work we study the magnitude-redshift relation of a non-standardcosmological model. the model under consideration was firstly investigatedwithin a special case of metric-affine gravity (mag) and was recently recoveredvia different approaches by two other groups. apart from the usual cosmologicalparameters for pressure-less matter $\omega_{\rm m}$, cosmologicalconstant/dark energy $\omega_{\lambda}$, and radiation $\omega_{\rm r}$ a newdensity parameter $\omega_\psi$ emerges. the field equations of the modelreduce to a system which is effectively given by the usual friedmann equationsof general relativity, supplied by a correction to the energy density andpressure in form of $\omega_\psi$, which is related to the non-riemannianstructure of the underlying spacetime. we search for the best-fit parameters byusing recent sn ia data sets and constrain the possible contribution of a newdark-energy like component at low redshifts, thereby we put an upper limit onthe presence of non-riemannian quantities in the late stages of the universe.in addition the impact of placing the data in redshift bins of variable size isstudied. the numerical results of this work also apply to several anisotropiccosmological models which, on the level of the field equations, exhibit asimilar scaling behavior of the density parameters like our non-riemannianmodel.
