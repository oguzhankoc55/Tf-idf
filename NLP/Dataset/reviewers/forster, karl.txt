0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0904.1596	luminous thermal flares from quiescent supermassive black holes	a dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will berevealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, anda flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of thestellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. here we presentthe third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the galex deep imagingsurvey: a 1.6x10^{43} erg s^{-1} uv/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy atz=0.1855. the uv/optical sed during the peak of the flare measured by galex andpalomar lfc imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody witht_{bb}=1.7x10^{5} k and a bolometric luminosity of 3x10^{45} erg s^{-1},assuming an internal extinction with e(b-v)_{gas}=0.3. the chandra upper limiton the x-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, l_{x}(2-10 kev)&lt; 10^{41}erg s^{-1}, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios ofuv to x-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. we compare the lightcurves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidatesdiscovered by galex, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by thepower-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disruptedsolar-type star, and (2) the uv/optical seds can be attributed to thermalemission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidaldisruption radius of a ~10^{7} m_sun central black hole. we use the observedpeak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5 &gt; m_{g} &gt; -18.9) topredict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.(abridged)

0706.3424	keck/deimos spectroscopy of a galex uv selecte sample from the medium  imaging survey	we report results from a pilot program to obtain spectroscopy for objectsdetected in the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium imaging survey (mis).our study examines the properties of galaxies detected by galex fainter thanthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic survey. this is the firststudy to extend the techinques of salim et al. 2005 to estimate stellar masses,star formation rates (sfr) and the b (star formation history) parameter forstar-forming galaxies out to z~0.7. we obtain redshifts for 50 galex missources reaching nuv=23.9 (ab mag), having counterparts in the sdss datarelease 4 (dr4). of our sample, 43 are starforming galaxies with z&lt;0.7, 3 haveemission line ratios indicative of agn with z&lt;0.7, and 4 objects with z~1 areqsos, 3 of which are not previously cataloged. we compare our sample to a muchlarger sample of ~50,000 matched galex/sdss galaxies with sdss spectroscopy;while our survey is shallow, the optical counterparts to our sources reach ~3magnitudes fainter in sdss r magnitude than the sdss spectroscopic sample. weuse emission line diagnostics for the galaxies to determine that the samplecontains mostly star-forming galaxies. the galaxies in the sample populate theblue sequence in the nuv-r vs m_r color-magnitude diagram. our sample has sfrs,luminosities, and velocity dispersions that are similar to the samples of faintcompact blue galaxies studied previously in the same redshift range by koo et.al 1995, guzman et. al 1996 &amp; phillips et. al 1997. however, our sample is ~2mag fainter in surface brightness than the compact blue galaxies. we find thatthe star-formation histories for a majority of the galaxies are consistent witha recent starburst within the last 100 myr.

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0911.5347	the wigglez dark energy survey: direct constraints on blue galaxy  intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts	correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxy pairs, and between theintrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale density field, may be inducedby tidal fields. these correlations, which have been detected at low redshifts(z&lt;0.35) for bright red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), andfor which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z~0.1, provide a window intogalaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant forcurrent and future weak lensing surveys. measurements of these alignments atintermediate redshifts (z~0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shearobservations are very important for understanding the origin and redshiftevolution of these alignments, and for minimising their impact on weak lensingmeasurements. we present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement forblue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from sdss and spectroscopicredshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. our null detection allows us toplace upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by bluegalaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not requiresignificant model-dependent extrapolation from the z~0.1 sdss observations.also, combining the sdss and wigglez constraints gives us a long redshiftbaseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contaminationof the cosmic shear power spectrum. assuming that the alignments can beexplained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we findthat a measurement of \sigma_8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, cfhtls-like surveywould be contaminated by at most +/-0.02 (95% confidence level, sdss andwigglez) or +/-0.03 (wigglez alone) due to intrinsic alignments.

1003.4985	ngc 404, a rejuvenated lenticular galaxy on a merger-induced, blueward  excursion into the green valley	we have discovered recent star formation in the outermost portion (1-4x r_25)of the nearby lenticular (s0) galaxy ngc 404 using galex uv imaging. fuv-brightsources are strongly concentrated within the galaxy's hi ring (formed by amerger event according to del rio et al.), even though the average gas densityis dynamically subcritical. archival hst imaging reveals resolved upper mainsequence stars and conclusively demonstrates that the uv light originates fromrecent star formation activity. we present fuv, nuv radial surface brightnessprofiles and integrated magnitudes for ngc 404. within the ring, the averagestar formation rate surface density (sigma_{sfr}) is 2.2x10^-5 msun/yr/kpc^2.of the total fuv flux, 70% comes from the hi ring which is forming stars at arate of 2.5x10^-3 msun/yr. the gas consumption timescale, assuming a constantsfr and no gas recycling, is several times the age of the universe. in thecontext of the uv-optical galaxy cmd, the presence of the sf hi ring places ngc404 in the green valley separating the red and blue sequences. the rejuvenatedlenticular galaxy has experienced a merger-induced, disk-building excursionaway from the red sequence toward bluer colors, where it may evolve quiescentlyor (if appropriately triggered) experience a burst capable of placing it on theblue/star-forming sequence for up to ~1 gyr. the green valley galaxy populationis heterogeneous, with most systems transitioning from blue to red but othersevolving in the opposite sense due to acquisition of fresh gas through variouschannels.

1003.5721	the wigglez dark energy survey: the selection function and z=0.6 galaxy  power spectrum	we report one of the most accurate measurements of the three-dimensionallarge-scale galaxy power spectrum achieved to date, using 56,159 redshifts ofbright emission-line galaxies at effective redshift z=0.6 from the wigglez darkenergy survey at the anglo-australian telescope. we describe in detail how weconstruct the survey selection function allowing for the varying targetcompleteness and redshift completeness. we measure the total power with anaccuracy of approximately 5% in wavenumber bands of dk=0.01 h/mpc. a modelpower spectrum including non-linear corrections, combined with a linear galaxybias factor and a simple model for redshift-space distortions, provides a goodfit to our data for scales k &lt; 0.4 h/mpc. the large-scale shape of the powerspectrum is consistent with the best-fitting matter and baryon densitiesdetermined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. bysplitting the power spectrum measurement as a function of tangential and radialwavenumbers we delineate the characteristic imprint of peculiar velocities. weuse these to determine the growth rate of structure as a function of redshiftin the range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8, including a data point at z=0.78 with an accuracyof 20%. our growth rate measurements are a close match to the self-consistentprediction of the lcdm model. the wigglez survey data will allow a wide rangeof investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion and growthhistory, topology of cosmic structure, and gaussianity of the initialconditions. our calculation of the survey selection function will be releasedat a future date via our website wigglez.swin.edu.au.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

0709.0730	the star formation and extinction co-evolution of uv-selected galaxies  over 0.05&lt;z&lt;1.2	we use a new stacking technique to obtain mean mid ir and far ir to far uvflux ratios over the rest near-uv/near-ir color-magnitude diagram. we employcombo-17 redshifts and combo-17 optical, galex far and near uv, spitzer iracand mips mid ir photometry. this technique permits us to probe infrared excess(irx), the ratio of far ir to far uv luminosity, and specific star formationrate (ssfr) and their co-evolution over two orders of magnitude of stellar massand redshift 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2. we find that the ssfr and the characteristic mass (m_0)above which the ssfr drops increase with redshift (downsizing). at any givenepoch, irx is an increasing function of mass up to m_0. above this mass irxfalls, suggesting gas exhaustion. in a given mass bin below m_0 irx increaseswith time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. we interpret these trendsusing a simple model with a schmidt-kennicutt law and extinction that tracksgas density and enrichment. we find that the average irx and ssfr follows agalaxy age parameter which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and timesince formation. we conclude that blue sequence galaxies have properties whichshow simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady build-upof heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and theexhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. the irxrepresents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution.

1101.6051	the recent star formation in ngc 6822: an ultraviolet study	we characterize the star formation in the low-metallicity galaxy ngc 6822over the past few hundred million years, using galex far-uv (fuv, 1344-1786 a)and near-uv (nuv, 1771-2831 a) imaging, and ground-based ha imaging. from galexfuv image, we define 77 star-forming (sf) regions with area &gt;860 pc^2, andsurface brightness &lt;=26.8 mag(ab)arcsec^-2, within 0.2deg (1.7kpc) of thecenter of the galaxy. we estimate the extinction by interstellar dust in eachsf region from resolved photometry of the hot stars it contains: e(b-v) rangesfrom the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. theintegrated fuv and nuv photometry, compared with stellar population models,yields ages of the sf complexes up to a few hundred myr, and masses from 2x10^2msun to 1.5x10^6 msun. the derived ages and masses strongly depend on theassumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary acrossthe galaxy. the total mass of the fuv-defined sf regions translates into anaverage star formation rate (sfr) of 1.4x10^-2 msun/yr over the past 100 myr,and sfr=1.0x10^-2 msun/yr in the most recent 10 myr. the latter is in agreementwith the value that we derive from the ha luminosity, sfr=0.008 msun/yr. thesfr in the most recent epoch becomes higher if we add the sfr=0.02 msun/yrinferred from far-ir measurements, which trace star formation still embedded indust (age &lt;= a few myr).

(2010). the results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0%measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=0.6 (in terms of theacoustic parameter "a(z)" introduced by eisenstein et al. (2005) we finda(z=0.6) = 0.452 +/- 0.018). both baos and power spectrum shape informationcontribute toward these constraints. the statistical significance of thedetection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to awiggle-free model, is 3.2-sigma. the ratios of our distance measurements tothose obtained using baos in the distribution of luminous red galaxies atredshifts z=0.2 and z=0.35 are consistent with a flat lambda cold dark mattermodel that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation. the addition of the currentwigglez data results in a ~ 30% improvement in the measurement accuracy of aconstant equation-of-state, w, using bao data alone. based solely on geometricbao distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w &lt; -1/3) is required with aprobability of 99.8%, providing a consistency check of conclusions based onsupernovae observations. further improvements in cosmological constraints willresult when the wigglez survey dataset is complete.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

1208.1280	at cnc: a second dwarf nova with a classical nova shell	we are systematically surveying all known and suspected z cam-type dwarfnovae for classical nova shells. this survey is motivated by the discovery ofthe largest known classical nova shell, which surrounds the archetypal dwarfnova z camelopardalis. the z cam shell demonstrates that at least some dwarfnovae must have undergone classical nova eruptions in the past, and that atleast some classical novae become dwarf novae long after their novathermonuclear outbursts, in accord with the hibernation scenario of cataclysmicbinaries. here we report the detection of a fragmented "shell", 3 arcmin indiameter, surrounding the dwarf nova at cancri. this second discoverydemonstrates that nova shells surrounding z cam-type dwarf novae cannot be veryrare. the shell geometry is suggestive of bipolar, conical ejection seen nearlypole-on. a spectrum of the brightest at cnc shell knot is similar to that ofthe ejecta of the classical nova gk per, and of z cam, dominated by [nii]emission. galex fuv imagery reveals a similar-sized, fuv-emitting shell. wedetermine a distance of 460 pc to at cnc, and an upper limit to its ejecta massof ~ 5 x 10^{-5} msun, typical of classical novae.

1210.2130	the wigglez dark energy survey: final data release and cosmological  results	this paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of thewigglez dark energy survey. we perform full analyses of different cosmologicalmodels using the wigglez power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and0.78, combined with other cosmological datasets. the limiting factor in thisanalysis is the theoretical modelling of the galaxy power spectrum, includingnon-linearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. in this paper weassess several different methods for modelling the theoretical power spectrum,testing them against the gigaparsec wigglez simulations (gigglez). we fit for abase set of 6 cosmological parameters, {omega_b h^2, omega_cdm h^2, h_0, tau,a_s, n_s}, and 5 supplementary parameters {n_run, r, w, omega_k, sum m_nu}. incombination with the cosmic microwave background (cmb), our results areconsistent with the lambdacdm concordance cosmology, with a measurement of thematter density of omega_m =0.29 +/- 0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8= 0.825 +/- 0.017. using wigglez data with cmb and other distance and matterpower spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parametersbeing inconsistent with their lambdacdm model values. the power spectra dataand theoretical modelling tools are available for use as a module for cosmomc,which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data . wealso release the data and random catalogues used to construct the baryonacoustic oscillation correlation function.

1211.5605	the wigglez dark energy survey: probing the epoch of radiation  domination using large scale structure	we place the most robust constraint to date on the scale of the turnover inthe cosmological matter power spectrum using data from the wigglez dark energysurvey. we find this feature to lie at a scale of$k_0=0.0160^{+0.0041}_{-0.0035}$ [h/mpc] (68% confidence) for an effectiveredshift of 0.62 and obtain from this the first-ever turnover-derived distanceand cosmology constraints: a measure of the cosmic distance-redshift relationin units of the horizon scale at the redshift of radiation-matter equality(r_h) of d_v(z=0.62)/r_h=18.3 (+6.3/-3.3) and, assuming a prior on the numberof extra relativistic degrees of freedom $n_{eff}=3$, constraints on the matterdensity parameter $\omega_mh^2=0.136^{+0.026}_{-0.052}$ and on the redshift ofmatter-radiation equality $z_{eq}=3274^{+631}_{-1260}$. all results are inexcellent agreement with the predictions of standard lcdm models. ourconstraints on the logarithmic slope of the power spectrum on scales largerthan the turnover is bounded in the lower limit with values only as low as -1allowed, with the prediction of standard lcdm models easily accommodated by ourresults. lastly, we generate forecasts for the achievable precision of futuresurveys at constraining $k_0$, $\omega_mh^2$, $z_{eq}$ and $n_{eff}$. we findthat boss should substantially improve upon the wigglez turnover constraint,reaching a precision on $k_0$ of $\pm$9% (68% confidence), translating toprecisions on $\omega_mh^2$ and $z_{eq}$ of $\pm$10% (assuming a prior$n_{eff}=3$) and on $n_{eff}$ of (+78/-56)% (assuming a prior$\omega_mh^2=0.135$). this is sufficient precision to sharpen the constraintson $n_{eff}$ from wmap, particularly in its upper limit. for euclid, we findcorresponding attainable precisions on $(k_0, \omega_mh^2, n_eff)$ of(3,4,+17/-21)%. this represents a precision approaching our forecasts for theplanck surveyor.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

1302.5178	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic growth rate with  the two-point galaxy correlation function	the growth history of large-scale structure in the universe is a powerfulprobe of the cosmological model, including the nature of dark energy. we studythe growth rate of cosmic structure to redshift $z = 0.9$ using more than$162{,}000$ galaxy redshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. we divide thedata into four redshift slices with effective redshifts $z =[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.76]$ and in each of the samples measure and model the 2-pointgalaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to theline-of-sight. after simultaneously fitting for the galaxy bias factor werecover values for the cosmic growth rate which are consistent with our assumed$\lambda$cdm input cosmological model, with an accuracy of around 20% in eachredshift slice. we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details ofthe assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making closecomparison with a set of n-body simulations for calibration. our measurementsare consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similardataset, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. wedetermine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametricmanner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, andinvestigate the alcock-paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial modelon the results. our techniques should prove useful for current and futuregalaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the 2-dimensionalcorrelation function.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1306.4031	the wigglez dark energy survey: star-formation in uv-luminous galaxies  from their luminosity functions	we present the ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function of galaxies from thegalex medium imaging survey with measured spectroscopic redshifts from thefirst data release of the wigglez dark energy survey. this sample selectsgalaxies with high star formation rates: at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 the median starformation rate is at the upper 95th percentile of optically-selected (r&lt;22.5)galaxies and the sample contains about 50 per cent of all nuv &lt; 22.8, 0.6 &lt; z &lt;0.9 starburst galaxies within the volume sampled.  the most luminous galaxies in our sample (-21.0&gt;m_nuv&gt;-22.5) evolve veryrapidly with a number density declining as (1+z)^{5\pm 1} from redshift z = 0.9to z = 0.6. these starburst galaxies (m_nuv&lt;-21 is approximately a starformation rate of 30 \msuny) contribute about 1 per cent of cosmic starformation over the redshift range z=0.6 to z=0.9. the star formation ratedensity of these very luminous galaxies evolves rapidly, as (1+z)^{4\pm 1}.such a rapid evolution implies the majority of star formation in these largegalaxies must have occurred before z = 0.9.  we measure the uv luminosity function in 0.05 redshift intervals spanning0.1&lt;z&lt;0.9, and provide analytic fits to the results. at all redshifts greaterthan z=0.55 we find that the bright end of the luminosity function is not welldescribed by a pure schechter function due to an excess of very luminous(m_nuv&lt;-22) galaxies. these luminosity functions can be used to create a radialselection function for the wigglez survey or test models of galaxy formationand evolution. here we test the agn feedback model in scannapieco et al.(2005), and find that this agn feedback model requires agn feedback efficiencyto vary with one or more of the following: stellar mass, star formation rateand redshift.

1506.06182	3c 273 with nustar: unveiling the agn	we present results from a 244\,ks \textit{nustar} observation of 3c\,273obtained during a cross-calibration campaign with the \textit{chandra},\textit{integral}, \textit{suzaku}, \textit{swift}, and \textit{xmm-newton}observatories. we show that the spectrum, when fit with a power-law model usingdata from all observatories except \textit{integral} over the 1--78\,kev band,leaves significant residuals in the \textit{nustar} data between 30--78\,kev.the \nustar\ 3--78\,kev spectrum is well-described by an exponentially cutoffpower-law ($\gamma = 1.646 \pm 0.006$, e$_\mathrm{cutoff} =202_{-34}^{+51}$\,kev) with a weak reflection component from cold, densematerial. there is also evidence for a weak ($ew = 23 \pm 11$ ev) neutral ironline. we interpret these features as arising from coronal emission plusreflection off an accretion disk or distant material. beyond 80\,kev\textit{integral} data show clear excess flux relative to an extrapolation ofthe agn model fit to \nustar. this high-energy power-law is consistent with thepresence of a beamed jet, which begins to dominate over emission from the inneraccretion flow at 30-40 kev. modeling the jet locally (in the \textit{nustar} +\textit{integral} band) as a power-law, we find the coronal component is fit by$\gamma_\mathrm{agn} = 1.638 \pm 0.045$, $e_\mathrm{cutoff} = 47 \pm 15$\,kev,and jet photon index by $\gamma_\mathrm{jet} = 1.05 \pm 0.4$. we also consider\textit{fermi}/lat observations of 3c\,273 and here the broad-band spectrum ofthe jet can be described by a log-parabolic model, peaking at $\sim 2$\,mev.finally, we investigate the spectral variability in the \textit{nustar} bandand find an inverse correlation between flux and $\gamma$.

1510.04631	nustar hard x-ray survey of the galactic center region i: hard x-ray  morphology and spectroscopy of the diffuse emission	we present the first sub-arcminute images of the galactic center above 10kev, obtained with nustar. nustar resolves the hard x-ray source igrj17456-2901 into non-thermal x-ray filaments, molecular clouds, point sourcesand a previously unknown central component of hard x-ray emission (chxe).nustar detects four non-thermal x-ray filaments, extending the detection oftheir power-law spectra with $\gamma\sim1.3$-$2.3$ up to ~50 kev. amorphological and spectral study of the filaments suggests that their originmay be heterogeneous, where previous studies suggested a common origin in youngpulsar wind nebulae (pwne). nustar detects non-thermal x-ray continuum emissionspatially correlated with the 6.4 kev fe k$\alpha$ fluorescence line emissionassociated with two sgr a molecular clouds: mc1 and the bridge. broad-bandx-ray spectral analysis with a monte-carlo based x-ray reflection modelself-consistently determined their intrinsic column density ($\sim10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$), primary x-ray spectra (power-laws with $\gamma\sim2$) and set alower limit of the x-ray luminosity of sgr a* flare illuminating the sgr aclouds to $l_x \stackrel{&gt;}{\sim} 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. above ~20 kev, hardx-ray emission in the central 10 pc region around sgr a* consists of thecandidate pwn g359.95-0.04 and the chxe, possibly resulting from an unresolvedpopulation of massive cvs with white dwarf masses $m_{\rm wd} \sim 0.9m_{\odot}$. spectral energy distribution analysis suggests that g359.95-0.04 islikely the hard x-ray counterpart of the ultra-high gamma-ray source hessj1745-290, strongly favoring a leptonic origin of the gc tev emission.

astro-ph;0104029	quasar evolution and the baldwin effect in the large bright quasar  survey	from a large homogeneous sample of optical/uv emission line measurements for993 quasars from the large bright quasar survey (lbqs), we study correlationsbetween emission line equivalent width and both restframe ultravioletluminosity (i.e., the baldwin effect) and redshift. our semi-automated spectralfitting accounts for absorption lines, fits blended iron emission, and providesupper limits to weak emission lines. use of a single large, well-defined sampleand consistent emission line measurements allows us to sensitively detect manycorrelations, most of which have been previously noted. a new finding is asignificant baldwin effect in uv iron emission. further analysis reveals thatthe primary correlation of iron emission strength is probably with redshift,implying an evolutionary rather than a luminosity effect. we show that for mostemission lines with a significant baldwin effect, and for some without,evolution dominates over luminosity effects. this may reflect evolution inabundances, in cloud covering factors, or overall cloud conditions such asdensity and ionization. we find that in our sample, a putative correlationbetween baldwin effect slope and the ionization potential is not significant.uniform measurements of other large quasar samples will extend the luminosityand redshift range of such spectral studies and provide even stronger tests ofspectral evolution.

astro-ph;0411302	the galaxy evolution explorer: a space ultraviolet survey mission	we give an overview of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex), a nasa explorermission launched on april 28, 2003. galex is performing the first space uvsky-survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750angstroms and 1750-2750 angstroms). the surveys include an all-sky imagingsurvey (m[ab] ~ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 square degrees (m[ab] ~23), a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees (m[ab] ~ 25), and a nearbygalaxy survey. spectroscopic grism surveys (r=100-200) are underway withvarious depths and sky coverage. many targets overlap existing or plannedsurveys. we will use the measured uv properties of local galaxies, along withcorollary observations, to calibrate the uv-global star formation raterelationship in local galaxies. we will apply this calibration to distantgalaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map thehistory of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5,and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. the galex missionincludes a guest investigator program supporting the wide variety of programsmade possible by the first uv sky survey.

astro-ph;0411319	uv emission and star formation in stephan's quintet	we present the first galex uv images of the well known interacting group ofgalaxies, stephan's quintet (sq). we detect widespread uv emission throughoutthe group. however, there is no consistent coincidence between uv structure andemission in the optical, h\alpha, or hi. excluding the foreground galaxyngc7320 (sd), most of the uv emission is found in regions associated with thetwo spiral members of the group, ngc7319 and ngc7318b, and the intragroupmedium starburst sq-a. the extinction corrected uv data are analyzed toinvestigate the overall star formation activity in sq. it is found that thetotal star formation rate (sfr) of sq is 6.69+-0.65 m_\sun/yr. among this,1.34+-0.16 m_sun/yr is due to sq-a. this is in excellent agreement with thatderived from extinction corrected h\alpha luminosity of sq-a. the sfr inregions related to ngc 7319 is 1.98+-0.58 m_\sun/yr, most of which(68%) iscontributed by the disk. the contribution from the 'young tail' is only 15%. inthe uv, the 'young tail' is more extended (~100 kpc) and shows a loop-likestructure, including the optical tail, the extragalactic hii regions recentlydiscovered in h\alpha, and other uv emission regions discovered for the firsttime. the uv and optical colors of the 'old tail' are consistent with a singlestellar population of age t ~10^{8.5+-0.4} yrs. the uv emission associated withngc 7318b is found in a very large (~80 kpc) disk, with a net sfr of 3.37+-0.25m_sun/yr. several large uv emission regions are 30 -- 40 kpc away from thenucleus of ngc7318b. although both ngc7319 and ngc7318b show peculiar uvmorphology, their sfr is consistent with that of normal sbc galaxies,indicating that the strength of star formation activity is not enhenced byinteractions.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0504489	the galex ultraviolet variability (guvv) catalog	we present version 1.0 of the nasa galaxy evolution explorer (galex)ultraviolet variability catalog (guvv) that contains information on 84time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and farultraviolet photometric observations. these time-variable sources wereserendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently beingsurveyed by the galex satellite in two ultraviolet bands (nuv 1750-2750a, fuv1350-1750a) with limiting ab magnitudes of 23-25. the largest-amplitudevariable objects presently detected by galex are m-dwarf flare stars, which canbrighten by 5-10 mag in both the nuv and fuv bands during short duration (&lt;500s) outbursts. other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objectsinclude ab-type rr lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in thegalex fuv band. this first guvv catalog lists galactic positions and possiblesource identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with alist of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at otherwavelengths. we expect the total number of time-variable source detections toincrease as the galex mission progresses, such that later version numbers ofthe guvv catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.

astro-ph;0507396	galex observations of an energetic ultraviolet flare on the dm4e star gj  3685a	the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite has obtained high timeresolution ultraviolet photometry during a large flare on the m4 dwarf star gj3685a. simultaneous nuv (1750 - 2800a) and fuv (1350 - 1750a) time-taggedphotometry with time resolution better than 0.1 s shows that the overallbrightness in the fuv band increased by a factor of 1000 in 200 s. under theassumption that the nuv emission is mostly due to a stellar continuum, and thatthe fuv flux is shared equally between emission lines and continuum, then thereis evidence for two distinct flare components for this event. the first flaretype is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or noincrease in temperature. the other involves rapid increases in both temperatureand flux. while the decay time for the first flare component may be severalhours, the second flare event decayed over less than 1 minute, suggesting thatthere was little or no confinement of the heated plasma.

astro-ph;0604058	uv and fir selected star-forming galaxies at z=0: differences and  overlaps	we study two samples of local galaxies, one is uv (galex) selected and theother fir (iras) selected, to address the question whether uv and fir surveyssee the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the samepopulation of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.no significant difference between the l$_{tot}$ ($=l_{60}+l_{fuv}$) luminosityfunctions of the uv and fir samples is found. also, after the correction forthe `malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the fir-to-uv ratio v.s.l$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. in therange of $9 \la \log(l_{tot}/l_\sun) \la 12$, both can be approximated by asimple linear relation of $\log (l_{60}/l_{fuv})=\log(l_{tot}/l_\sun)-9.66$.these are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent thesame population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differencesin l$_{tot}$ and in fir-to-uv ratio are due only to the selection effect. acomparison between the uv luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for apopulation of faint uv galaxies missing in the fir selected sample. thecontribution from these 'fir-quiet' galaxies to the overall uv population isinsignificant, given that the k-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellarmass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.

astro-ph;0605328	the detection of m-dwarf uv flare events in the galex data archives	we present the preliminary results from implementing a new software tool thatenables inspection of time-tagged photon data for the astronomical sourcescontained within individual galex ultraviolet images of the sky. we haveinspected the photon data contained within 1802 galex images to reveal rapid,short-term (&lt;500 sec) uv source variability in the form of stellar flares. themean associated change in nuv magnitude due to this flaring activity is2.7+/-0.3 mag. a list of 49 new uv variable-star candidates is presented,together with their associated sloan digital sky survey (sdss) photometricmagnitudes. from these data we can associate the main source of these uv flareevents with magnetic activity on m-dwarf stars. photometric parallaxes havebeen determined for 32 of these sources, placing them at distances ranging fromapproximately 25 to 1000pc. the average uv flare energy for these flare eventsis 2.5e30 ergs, which is of a similar energy to that of u-band, x-ray and euvflares observed on many local m-dwarf stars. we have found that stars ofclasses m0 to m5 flare with energies spanning a far larger range and with anenergy approximately 5 times greater than those of later (m6 to m8) spectraltype.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;9603152	extreme x-ray variability in the narrow-line qso phl 1092	a rosat observation of the narrow-line fe ii qso phl 1092 shows rapidvariability that requires an efficiency of at least 0.13, exceeding thetheoretical maximum for an accretion disk around a non-rotating black hole.plausible explanations for this high efficiency incorporate anisotropicemission and/or accretion onto a rapidly rotating black hole, the latterrecently suggested by kwan et al. as a mechanism for generating phl 1092'sstrong fe ii lines by mechanical heating in an accretion disk. the soft x-rayluminosity of phl 1092 had also increased by a factor of 21 over the weakeinstein detection, to more than 5 x 10^46 ergs/s. its photon spectral index of4.2 is among the steepest of any agn. these x-ray properties are characteristicof narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies, of which phl 1092 is evidently a veryluminous member. narrow-line qsos also extend a significant correlation betweenx-ray luminosity and x-ray spectral index which we have found among a largesample of optically-selected, narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies observed by rosat.

astro-ph;9802052	optical and x-ray spectroscopy of 1e 0449.4-1823: demise of the original  type 2 qso	new optical spectra of the original narrow-line quasar 1e 0449.4-1823 showthat it now has broad emission lines of considerable strength, eliminating itas a "type 2 qso" candidate. we suggest that the behavior of 1e 0449.4-1823 isthe same as that of some seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies, in which goodrichattributed long-term variations of their broad balmer lines to dynamicalmotions of obscuring material located in or around the broad-line region. theoptical continuum and broad emission-line regions of 1e 0449.4-1823 may stillbe partly covered in our line of sight, which would explain its largeforbidden-line equivalent widths and flat alpha_ox relative to otherlow-redshift qsos. also present are apparent absorption features in the broadbalmer lines and in mg ii, which may be related to the past obscuration andcurrent emergence of the broad-line region. however, it is difficult todistinguish absorption from broad emission-line peaks that are displaced invelocity; we consider the latter a plausible competing interpretation of thesepeculiar line profiles. an asca x-ray spectrum of 1e 0449.4-1823 can be fittedwith a power-law of gamma = 1.63, intrinsic n_h &lt; 9 x 10^20 cm-2, and no fekalpha line emission. its 2-10 kev luminosity is 6.7 x 10^44 ergs/s. withregard to the still hypothetical type 2 qsos, we argue that there is littleevidence for the existence of any among x-ray selected samples.

astro-ph;9903424	the x-ray spectra and spectral variability of intermediate type seyfert  galaxies: asca observations of ngc 4388 and eso 103-g35	the x-ray spectra of two intermediate type seyfert galaxies are investigatedusing asca observations separated by more than a year. both ngc 4388 and eso103-g35 exhibit strong, narrow fe k alpha line emission and absorption by coldneutral gas with a column density ~ 10^23 cm^-2, characteristic of the x-rayspectra of type 2 seyfert galaxies. the power law continuum flux has changed bya factor of 2 over a time-scale of ~ 2 years for both objects, declining in thecase of ngc 4388 and rising in eso 103-g35. no variation was observed in theequivalent width of the fe k alpha line in the spectra of ngc 4388, implyingthat the line flux declined with the continuum. we find that the strength ofthe line cannot be accounted for by fluorescence in line-of-sight material withthe measured column density unless a `leaky-absorber' model of the type favoredfor iras 04575-7537 is employed. the equivalent width of the fe k alphaemission line is seen to decrease between the observations of eso 103-g35 whilethe continuum flux increased. the 1996 observation of eso 103-g35 can also befitted with an absorption edge at 7.4 $\pm$ 0.2 kev due to partially ionizediron, and when an ionized absorber model is fitted to the data it is found thatthe equivalent column of neutral hydrogen rises to 3.5 x 10^23 cm^-2. the fe kalpha line flux can be accounted by fluorescence in this material alone andthis model is also a good representation of the 1988 and 1991 gingaobservations. there is then no requirement for a reflection component in theasca spectra of eso 103-g35 or ngc 4388.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
