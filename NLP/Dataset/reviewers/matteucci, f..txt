0901.1207	modeling the effects of dust evolution on the seds of galaxies of  different morphological type	we present photometric evolution models of galaxies, in which, in addition tothe stellar component, the effects of an evolving dusty interstellar mediumhave been included with particular care. starting from the work of calura,pipino &amp; matteucci (2008), in which chemical evolution models have been used tostudy the evolution of both the gas and dust components of the interstellarmedium in the solar neighbourhood, elliptical and irregular galaxies, it hasbeen possible to combine these models with a spectrophotometric stellar codethat includes dust reprocessing (grasil) (silva et al. 1998) to analyse theevolution of the spectral energy distributions (sed) of these galaxies. we testour models against observed seds both in the local universe and at highredshift and use them to predict how the percentage of reprocessed starlightevolves for each type of galaxy. the importance of following the dust evolutionis investigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simpleassumptions to treat this component.

0902.2768	cosmological formation and chemical evolution of an elliptical galaxy	we aim at studying the effect of a cosmologically motivated gas infall lawfor the formation of a massive elliptical galaxy in order to understand itsimpact on the formation of the spheroids. we replace the empirical infall lawof the model by pipino &amp; matteucci with a cosmologically derived infall law forthe formation of an elliptical galaxy. we constrast our predictions withobservations. we also compare the obtained results with those of pipino &amp;matteucci. we computed models with and without galactic winds: we found thatmodels without wind predict a too large current snia rate. in particular, thecosmological model produces a current snia which is about ten times higher thanthe observed values. moreover models without wind predict a large current sniirate, too large even if compared with the recent galex data. the predicted sniirate for the model with wind, on the other hand, is too low if compared withthe star formation histories given by galex. last but not least, the mean valuefor the [mg/fe] ratio in the dominant stellar population of the simulatedgalaxy, as predicted by the cosmological model, is too low if compared toobservations. this is, a very important result indicating that the cosmologicalinfall law is in contrast with the chemical evolution. a cosmologically derivedinfall law for an elliptical galaxy cannot reproduce all the chemicalconstraints given by the observations. the problem resides in the fact that thecosmologically derived infall law implies a slow gas accretion with consequentstar formation rate active for a long period. in this situation low [mg/fe]ratios are produced for the dominant stellar population in a typicalelliptical, at variance with observations.

0904.2180	the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation in galaxies of different  morphological types	by means of chemical evolution models for ellipticals, spirals and irregulargalaxies, we aim at investigating the physical meaning and the redshiftevolution of the mass-metallicity relation as well as how this relation isconnected with galaxy morphology. {abridged} we assume that galaxy morphologiesdo not change with cosmic time. we present a method to account for a spread inthe epochs of galaxy formation and to refine the galactic mass grid. (abridged)we compare our predictions to observational results obtained for galaxiesbetween redshifts 0.07 and 3.5. we reproduce the mass-metallicity (mz) relationmainly by means of an increasing efficiency of star formation with mass ingalaxies of all morphological types, without any need to invokegalacticoutflows favoring the loss of metals in the less massive galaxies. ourpredictions can help constraining the slope and the zero point of the observedlocal mz relation, both affected by uncertainties related to the use ofdifferent metallicity calibrations. we show how, by considering the mz, the o/hvs star formation rate (sfr), and the sfr vs galactic mass diagrams at variousredshifts, it is possible to constrain the morphology of the galaxies producingthese relations. our results indicate that the galaxies observed at z=3.5should be mainly proto-ellipticals, whereas at z=2.2 the observed galaxiesconsist of a morphological mix of proto-spirals and proto-ellipticals. at lowerredshifts, the observed mz relation is well reproduced by considering bothspirals and irregulars.

0904.3199	an investigation of chromospheric activity spanning the vaughan--preston  gap: impact on stellar ages	chromospheric activity is widely used as an age indicator for solar-typestars based on the early evidence that there is a smooth evolution from youngand active to old and inactive stars. we analysed chromospheric activity infive solar-type stars in two open clusters, in order to study how chromosphericactivity evolves with time. we took uves high-resolution, high s/n ratiospectra of 3 stars in ic 4756 and 2 in ngc 5822, which were combined with apreviously studied data-set and reanalysed here. the emission core of the deep,photospheric ca ii k line was used as a probe of the chromospheric activity.all of the 5 stars in the new sample, including those in the 1.2 gyr-old ngc5822, have activity levels comparable to those of hyades and praesepe. a likelyinterpretation of our data is that solar-type-star chromospheric activity, fromthe age of the hyades until that of the sun, does not evolve smoothly. starschange from active to inactive on a short timescale. evolution before and aftersuch a transition is much less significant than cyclical and long-termvariations. we show that data presented in the literature to support acorrelation between age and activity could be also interpreted differently inthe light of our results.

0905.0272	the effect of different type ia supernova progenitors on galactic  chemical evolution	our aim is to show how different hypotheses about type ia supernovaprogenitors can affect galactic chemical evolution. we include different typeia sn progenitor models, identified by their distribution of time delays, in avery detailed chemical evolution model for the milky way which follows theevolution of several chemical species. we test the single degenerate and thedouble degenerate models for supernova ia progenitors, as well as other moreempirical models based on differences in the time delay distributions. we findthat assuming the single degenerate or the double degenerate scenario producesnegligible differences in the predicted [o/fe] vs. [fe/h] relation. on theother hand, assuming a percentage of prompt (exploding in the first 100 myr)type ia supernovae of 50%, or that the maximum type ia rate is reached after3-4 gyr from the beginning of star formation, as suggested by several authors,produces more noticeable effects on the [o/fe] trend. however, given the spreadstill existing in the observational data no model can be firmly excluded on thebasis of only the [o/fe] ratios. on the other hand, when the predictions of thedifferent models are compared with the g-dwarf metallicity distribution, thescenarios with very few prompt type ia supernovae can be excluded. modelsincluding the single degenerate or double degenerate scenario with a percentageof 10-13% of prompt type ia supernovae produce results in very good agreementwith the observations. a fraction of prompt type ia supernovae larger than 30%worsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no prompt typeia supernovae are allowed. in particular, two empirical models for the type iasn progenitors can be excluded: the one without prompt type ia supernovae andthe one assuming delay time distribution going like t^{-0.5}.

0906.3400	effects of galactic fountains and delayed mixing in the chemical  evolution of the milky way	the majority of galactic chemical evolution models assumes the instantaneousmixing approximation (ima). this assumption is probably not realistic asindicated by the existence of chemical inhomogeneities, although currentchemical evolution models of the milky way can reproduce the majority of theobservational constraints under the ima. the aim of this paper is to testwhether relaxing this approximation in a detailed chemical evolution model canimprove or worsen the agreement with observations. to do that, we investigatedtwo possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the ``galacticfountain time delay effect'' and ii) the ``metal cooling time delay effect''.we found that the effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average timedelay of 0.1 gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed. longer timedelays produce differences in the results but they are not realistic. we alsofound that the o abundance gradient in the disk is not affected by galacticfountains. the metal cooling time delays produce strong effects on theevolution of the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields dependingon metallicity. if instead, the yields computed for to the solar chemicalcomposition are adopted, negligible effects are produced, as in the case of thegalactic fountain delay. the relaxation of the ima by means of the galacticfountain model, where the delay is considered only for massive stars and onlyin the disk, does not affect the chemical evolution results. the combination ofmetal dependent yields and time delay in the chemical enrichment from all starsstarting from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance withobservations.

0907.4308	the evolution of carbon and oxygen in the bulge and disk of the milky  way	the evolution of c and o abundances in the milky way can impose strongconstraints on stellar nucleosynthesis and help understanding the formation andevolution of our galaxy. the aim is to review the measured c and o abundancesin the disk and bulge of the galaxy and compare them with model predictions. weadopt two successful chemical evolution models for the bulge and the disk,which assume the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions but different histories ofstar formation. the data show a clear distinction between the trend of [c/o] inthe thick and thin galactic disks, while the thick disk and bulge trends areindistinguishable with a large (&gt;0.5 dex) increase in the c/o ratio in therange from -0.1 to +0.4 dex for [o/h]. in our models we consider yields frommassive stars with and without the inclusion of metallicity-dependent stellarwinds. the observed increase in the [c/o] ratio with metallicity in the bulgeand thick disk lies between the predictions utilizing the mass-loss rates ofmaeder (1992) and those of meynet &amp; maeder (2002). a model withoutmetallicity-dependent yields completely fails to match the observations. thus,the relative increase in carbon abundance at high metallicity appears to be dueto metallicity-dependent stellar winds in massive stars. these results alsoexplain the steep decline of the [o/fe] ratio with [fe/h] in the galacticbulge, while the [mg/fe] ratio is enhanced at all [fe/h].

0910.1299	on the origin of the helium-rich population in omega centauri	to study the possible origin of the huge helium enrichment attributed to thestars on the blue main sequence of omega centauri, we make use of a chemicalevolution model that has proven able to reproduce other major observedproperties of the cluster, namely, its stellar metallicity distributionfunction, age-metallicity relation and trends of several abundance ratios withmetallicity. in this framework, the key condition to satisfy all the availableobservational constraints is that a galactic-scale outflow develops in a muchmore massive parent system, as a consequence of multiple supernova explosionsin a shallow potential well. this galactic wind must carry out preferentiallythe metals produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, whereaselements restored to the interstellar medium through low-energy stellar windsby both asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massive stars must be mostlyretained. assuming that helium is ejected through slow winds by both agb starsand fast rotating massive stars (frmss), the interstellar medium of omegacentauri's parent galaxy gets naturally enriched in helium in the course of itsevolution.

1001.4374	the origin of the mass-metallicity relation: an analytical approach	the existence of a mass-metallicity (mz) relation in star forming galaxies atall redshift has been recently established. we aim at studying some possiblephysical mechanisms contributing to the mz relation by adopting analyticalsolutions of chemical evolution models including infall and outflow. we explorethe hypotheses of a variable galactic wind rate, infall rate and yield perstellar generation (i.e. a variation in the imf), as possible causes for the mzrelation. by means of analytical models we compute the expected o abundance forgalaxies of a given total baryonic mass and gas mass.the stellar mass isderived observationally and the gas mass is derived by inverting the kennicuttlaw of star formation, once the star formation rate is known. then we test howthe parameters describing the outflow, infall and imf should vary to reproducethe mz relation, and we exclude the cases where such a variation leads tounrealistic situations. we find that a galactic wind rate increasing withdecreasing galactic mass or a variable imf are both viable solutions for the mzrelation. a variable infall rate instead is not acceptable. it is difficult todisentangle among the outflow and imf solutions only by considering the mzrelation, and other observational constraints should be taken into account toselect a specific solution. for example, a variable efficiency of starformation increasing with galactic mass can also reproduce the mz relation andexplain the downsizing in star formation suggested for ellipticals. the bestsolution could be a variable efficiency of star formation coupled with galacticwinds, which are indeed observed in low mass galaxies.

0707.4108	what hydrodynamical simulations tell us about the radial properties of  the stellar populations in ellipticals	elliptical galaxies probably host the most metal rich stellar populations inthe universe. the processes leading to both the formation and the evolution ofsuch stars are discussed by means of a new gas dynamical model which implementsdetailed chemical evolution prescriptions. moreover, the radial variations inthe metallicity distribution of these stars are investigated by means ofg-dwarf-like diagrams. by comparing model predictions with observations, wederive a picture of galaxy formation in which the higher is the mass of thegalaxy, the shorter are the infall and the star formation timescales. thegalaxies seem to have formed outside-in, namely the most external regionsaccrete gas, form stars and develop a galactic wind very quickly (a few myr)compared to the central core, where the star formation can last up to 1 gyr. weshow for the first time a model able in reproducing the mass-metallicity andthe color-magnitude relations as well as the radial metallicity gradient, and,at the same time, the observed either positive or negative slopes in the[alpha/fe] abundace ratio gradient in stars.

1002.2547	abundances and physical parameters for stars in the open clusters ngc  5822 and ic 4756	classical chemical analyses may be affected by systematic errors that wouldcause observed abundance differences between dwarfs and giants. for someelements, however, the abundance difference could be real. we address the issueby observing 2 solar--type dwarfs in ngc 5822 and 3 in ic 4756, and comparingtheir composition with that of 3 giants in either of the aforementionedclusters. we determine iron abundance and stellar parameters of the dwarfstars, and the abundances of calcium, sodium, nickel, titanium, aluminium,chromium, silicon and oxygen for both the giants and dwarfs. we acquired uveshigh-resolution, of high signal--to--noise ratio (s/n) spectra. the width ofthe cross correlation profiles was used to measure rotation velocities. forabundance determinations, the standard equivalent width analysis was performeddifferentially with respect to the sun. for lithium and oxygen, we derivedabundances by comparing synthetic spectra with observed line features. we findan iron abundance for dwarf stars equal to solar to within the margins of errorfor ic 4756, and slightly above for ngc 5822 ([fe/h]= 0.01 and 0.05 dexrespectively). the 3 stars in ng 4756 have lithium abundances between log n(li)2.6 and 2.8 dex, the two stars in ngc 5822 have log n(li) ~ 2.8 and 2.5,respectively. for sodium, silicon, and titanium, we show that abundances ofgiants are significantly higher than those of the dwarfs of the same cluster(about 0.15, 0.15, and 0.35 dex).

1004.0832	effects of the integrated galactic imf on the chemical evolution of the  solar neighbourhood	the initial mass function determines the fraction of stars of differentintial mass born per stellar generation. in this paper, we test the effects ofthe integrated galactic initial mass function (igimf) on the chemical evolutionof the solar neighbourhood. the igimf (weidner &amp; kroupa 2005) is computed fromthe combination of the stellar intial mass function (imf), i.e. the massfunction of single star clusters, and the embedded cluster mass function, i.e.a power law with index beta. by taking into account also the fact that themaximum achievable stellar mass is a function of the total mass of the cluster,the igimf becomes a time-varying imf which depends on the star formation rate.we applied this formalism to a chemical evolution model for the solarneighbourhood and compared the results obtained by assuming three possiblevalues for beta with the results obtained by means of a standard, well-tested,constant imf. in general, a lower absolute value of beta implies a flatterigimf, hence a larger number of massive stars and larger metal ejection rates.this translates into higher type ia and ii supernova rates, higher massejection rates from massive stars and a larger amount of gas available for starformation, coupled with lower present-day stellar mass densities. (abridged) wealso discuss the importance of the present day stellar mass function (pdmf) inproviding a way to disentangle among various assumptions for beta. our resultsindicate that the model adopting the igimf computed with beta ~2 should beconsidered the best since it allows us to reproduce the observed pdmf and toaccount for most of the chemical evolution constraints considered in this work.

1005.2154	abundance gradient slopes versus mass in spheroids: predictions by  monolithic models	we investigate whether it is possible to explain the wide range of observedgradients in early type galaxies in the framework of monolithic models. to doso, we extend the set of hydrodynamical simulations by pipino et al. (2008a) byincluding low-mass ellipticals and spiral (true) bulges. these models satisfythe mass-metallicity and the mass-[alpha/fe] relations. the typical metallicitygradients predicted by our models have a slope of -0.3 dex per decade variationin radius, consistent with the mean values of several observational samples.however, we also find a few quite massive galaxies in which this slope is -0.5dex per decade, in agreement with some recent data. in particular, we find amild dependence from the mass tracers when we transform the stellar abundancegradients into radial variations of the mg_2 line-strength index, but not inthe mg_b. we conclude that, rather than a mass- slope relation, is moreappropriate to speak of an increase in the scatter of the gradient slope withthe galactic mass. we can explain such a behaviour with different efficienciesof star formation in the framework of the revised monolithic formationscenario, hence the scatter in the observed gradients should not be used as anevidence of the need of mergers. indeed, model galaxies that exhibit thesteepest gradient slopes are preferentially those with the highest starformation efficiency at that given mass.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1006.5863	quantifying the uncertainties of chemical evolution studies. ii. stellar  yields	this is the second paper of a series which aims at quantifying theuncertainties in chemical evolution model predictions related to the underlyingmodel assumptions. specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to thechoice of the stellar yields. we adopt a widely used model for the chemicalevolution of the galaxy and test the effects of changing the stellarnucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemicalspecies. we find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesisin stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect the modelpredictions. this is especially true for the majority of the iron-peakelements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen.the main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different modelsassuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observationsare: (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type ii supernovaexplosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning inmodels of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects ofrotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adoptedrates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions, and (vi) the differenttreatments of convection. our results suggest that it is mandatory to includeprocesses such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars and rotation instars of all masses in accurate studies of stellar evolution andnucleosynthesis. in spite of their importance, both these processes still haveto be better understood and characterized. as for massive stars, presupernovamodels computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the literature,but they still wait for a self-consistent coupling with the results ofexplosive nucleosynthesis computations.

1007.4435	the nature of long-grb host galaxies from chemical abundances	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most energetic events after the big bang andthey have been observed up to very high redshift. by means of measures ofchemical abundances now available for the galaxies hosting such events,thoughtto originate from the explosion of very powerful supernovae (type ib/c), wehave the opportunity to study the nature of these host galaxies. the aim ofthis paper is to identify the hosts of long grbs (lgrbs) observed both at lowand high redshift to see whether the hosts can be galaxies of the same typeobserved at different cosmic epochs. we adopt detailed chemical evolutionmodels for galaxies of different morphological type (ellipticals, spirals,irregulars) which follow the time evolution of the abundances of severalchemical elements (h, he, $\alpha$-elements, fe), and compare the results withthe observed abundances and abundance ratios in galaxies hosting lgrbs. we findthat the abundances and abundance ratios predicted by models devised fortypical irregular galaxies can well fit the abundances in the hosts both athigh and low redshift. we also find that the predicted type ib/c supernova ratefor irregulars is in good agreement with observations. models for spirals andparticularly ellipticals do not fit the high-redshift hosts of lgrbs (dlasystems) nor the low redshift hosts: in particular, ellipticals cannot possiblybe the hosts of gamma-ray-bursts at low redshift since they do not show anystar formation, and therefore no supernovae ib/c. we conclude that the observedabundance and abundance ratios in lgrbs hosts suggest that these hosts areirregular galaxies both at high and low redshift thus showing that the hostgalaxies belong to in an evolutionary sequence.

1008.3875	the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies with stellar and qso dust  production	the presence of dust strongly affects the way we see galaxies and also thechemical abundances we measure in gas. it is therefore important to study hechemical evolution of galaxies by taking into account dust evolution. we aim atperforming a detailed study of abundance ratios of high redshift objects andtheir dust properties. we focus on lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) and quasar (qso)hosts and likely progenitors of low- and high-mass present-day ellipticalgalaxies, respectively. we have adopted a chemical evolution model forelliptical galaxies taking account the dust production from low andintermediate mass stars, supernovae ia, supernovae ii, qsos and both dustdestruction and accretion processes. by means of such a model we have followedthe chemical evolution of ellipticals of different baryonic masses. our modelcomplies with chemical downsizing. we made predictions for the abundance ratiosversus metallicity trends for models of differing masses that can be used toconstrain the star formation rate, initial mass function and dust mass inobserved galaxies. we predict the existence of a high redshift dustmass-stellar mass relationship. we have found a good agreement with theproperties of lbgs if we assume that they formed at redshift z=2-4. inparticular, a non-negligible amount of dust is needed to explain the observedabundance pattern. we studied the qso sdss j114816, one of the most distant qsoever observed (z=6.4), and we have been able to reproduce the amount of dustmeasured in this object. the dust is clearly due to the production fromsupernovae and the most massive agb stars as well as from the grain growth inthe interstellar medium. the qso dust is likely to dominate only in the verycentral regions of the galaxies and during the early development of thegalactic wind.

0708.4026	the evolution of oxygen and magnesium in the bulge and disk of the milky  way	we show that the galactic bulge and disk share a similar, strong, decline in[o/mg] ratio with [mg/h]. the similarity of the [o/mg] trend in these two,markedly different, populations suggests a metallicity-dependent modulation ofthe stellar yields from massive stars, by mass loss from winds, and related tothe wolf-rayet phenomenon, as proposed by mcwilliam &amp; rich (2004). we havemodified existing models for the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge andthe solar neighborhood with the inclusion of metallicity-dependent oxygenyields from theoretical predictions for massive stars that include mass loss bystellar winds. our results significantly improve the agreement betweenpredicted and observed [o/mg] ratios in the bulge and disk above solarmetallicity; however, a small zero-point normalization problem remains to beresolved. the zero-point shift indicates that either the semi-empirical yieldsof francois et al. (2004) need adjustment, or that the bulge imf is not quiteas flat as found by ballero et al. (2007); the former explanation is preferred.our result removes a previous inconsistency between the interpretation of[o/fe] and [mg/fe] ratios in the bulge, and confirms the conclusion that thebulge formed more rapidly than the disk, based on the over-abundances ofelements produced by massive stars. we also provide an explanation for thelong-standing difference between [mg/fe] and [o/fe] trends among disk starsmore metal-rich than the sun.

1104.4881	effects of radial flows on the chemical evolution of the milky way disk	the majority of chemical evolution models assume that the galactic disk formsby means of infall of gas and divide the disk into several independent ringswithout exchange of matter between them. however, if gas infall is important,radial gas flows should be taken into account as a dynamical consequence ofinfall. the aim of this paper is to test the effect of radial gas flows ondetailed chemical evolution models (one-infall and two-infall) for the milkyway disk with different prescriptions for the infall law and star formationrate. we found, that with a gas radial inflow of constant speed the metallicitygradient tends to steepen. taking into account a constant time scale for theinfall rate along the galaxy disk and radial flows with a constant speed, weobtained a too flat gradient, at variance with data, implying that aninside-out formation and/or a variable gas flow speed are required. toreproduce the observed gradients the gas flow should increase in modulus withthe galactocentric distance, both in the one-infall and two-infall models.however, the inside-out disk formation coupled with a threshold in the gasdensity (only in the two-infall model) for star formation and/or a variableefficiency of star formation with galactocentric distance can also reproducethe observed gradients without radial flows. we showed that the radial flowscan be the most important process in reproducing abundance gradients but onlywith a variable gas speed. finally, one should consider that uncertainties inthe data concerning gradients prevent us to draw firm conclusions. future moredetailed data will help to ascertain whether the radial flows are a necessaryingredient in the formation and evolution of the galactic disk and disks ingeneral.

1112.3824	chemical evolution of the milky way: the origin of phosphorus	context. recently, for the first time the abundance of p has been measured indisk stars. this provides the opportunity of comparing the observed abundanceswith predictions from theoretical models. aims. we aim at predicting thechemical evolution of p in the milky way and compare our results with theobserved p abundances in disk stars in order to put constraints on the pnucleosynthesis. methods. to do that we adopt the two-infall model of galacticchemical evolution, which is a good model for the milky way, and compute theevolution of the abundances of p and fe. we adopt stellar yields for theseelements from different sources. the element p should have been formed mainlyin type ii supernovae. finally, fe is mainly produced by type ia supernovae.results. our results confirm that to reproduce the observed trend of [p/fe] vs.[fe/h] in disk stars, p is formed mainly in massive stars. however, none of theavailable yields for p can reproduce the solar abundance of this element. inother words, to reproduce the data one should assume that massive stars producemore p than predicted by a factor of ~ 3. conclusions. we conclude that all theavailable yields of p from massive stars are largely underestimated and thatnucleosynthesis calculations should be revised. we also predict the [p/fe]expected in halo stars.

0710.4129	evolution of chemical abundances in seyfert galaxies	we computed the chemical evolution of spiral bulges hosting seyfert nuclei,based on updated chemical and spectro-photometrical evolution models for thebulge of our galaxy, made predictions about other quantities measured inseyferts, and modeled the photometry of local bulges. the chemical evolutionmodel contains detailed calculations of the galactic potential and of thefeedback from the central supermassive black hole, and the spectro-photometricmodel covers a wide range of stellar ages and metallicities. we followed theevolution of bulges in the mass range 10^9 - 10^{11} msun by scaling the starformation efficiency and the bulge scalelength as in the inverse-wind scenariofor elliptical galaxies, and considering an eddington limited accretion ontothe central supermassive black hole. we successfully reproduced the observedblack hole-host bulge mass relation. the observed nuclear bolometric luminosityis reproduced only at high redshift or for the most massive bulges; in theother cases, at z = 0 a rejuvenation mechanism is necessary. the black holefeedback is in most cases not significant in triggering the galactic wind. theobserved high star formation rates and metal overabundances are easilyachieved, as well as the constancy of chemical abundances with redshift and thebulge present-day colours. those results are not affected if we vary the indexof the stellar imf from x=0.95 to x=1.35; a steeper imf is instead required inorder to reproduce the colour-magnitude relation and the present k-bandluminosity of the bulge.

1201.1751	cosmic star formation rate: a theoretical approach	the cosmic star formation rate (csfr), is an important clue to investigatethe history of the assembly and evolution of galaxies. here, we develop amethod to study the csfr from a purely theoretical point of view. starting fromdetailed models of chemical evolution, we obtain the histories of starformation of galaxies of different morphological types. these histories arethen used to determine the luminosity functions of the same galaxies by meansof a spectro-photometric code. we obtain the csfr under different hypothesis.first, we study the hypothesis of a pure luminosity evolution scenario, inwhich all galaxies are supposed to form at the same redshift and then evolveonly in luminosity. then we consider scenarios in which the number density orthe slope of the lfs are assumed to vary with redshift. after comparison withavailable data we conclude that a pure luminosity evolution does not provide agood fit to the data, especially at very high redshift, although manyuncertainties are still present in the data. on the other hand, a variation inthe number density of ellipticals and spirals as a function of redshift canprovide a better fit to the observed csfr. we also explore cases of variableslope of the lfs with redshift and variations of number density and slope atthe same time. we cannot find any of those cases which can improve the fit tothe data respect to the solely number density variation. finally, we computethe evolution of the average cosmic metallicity in galaxies with redshift.

1201.6359	metallicity gradients in disks: do galaxies form inside-out?	we examine radial and vertical metallicity gradients using a suite of diskgalaxy simulations, supplemented with two classic chemical evolutionapproaches. we determine the rate of change of gradient and reconciledifferences between extant models and observations within the `inside-out' diskgrowth paradigm. a sample of 25 disks is used, consisting of 19 from our rades(ramses disk environment study) sample, realised with the adaptive meshrefinement code ramses. four disks are selected from the mugs (mcmasterunbiased galaxy simulations) sample, generated with the smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) code gasoline, alongside disks from rahimi et al. (gcd+)and kobayashi &amp; nakasato (grape-sph). two chemical evolution models ofinside-out disk growth were employed to contrast the temporal evolution oftheir radial gradients with those of the simulations. we find that systematicdifferences exist between the predicted evolution of radial abundance gradientsin the rades and chemical evolution models, compared with the mugs sample;specifically, the mugs simulations are systematically steeper at high-redshift,and present much more rapid evolution in their gradients. we find that themajority of the models predict radial gradients today which are consistent withthose observed in late-type disks, but they evolve to this self-similarity indifferent fashions, despite each adhering to classical `inside-out' growth. wefind that radial dependence of the efficiency with which stars form as afunction of time drives the differences seen in the gradients; systematicdifferences in the sub-grid physics between the various codes are responsiblefor setting these gradients. recent, albeit limited, data at redshift z=1.5 areconsistent with the steeper gradients seen in our sph sample, suggesting amodest revision of the classical chemical evolution models may be required.

1204.2266	effects of thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing on the  evolution of light elements in the galaxy : d, 3he and 4he	recent studies of low- and intermediate-mass stars show that the evolution ofthe chemical elements in these stars is very different from that proposed bystandard stellar models. rotation-induced mixing modifies the internal chemicalstructure of main sequence stars, although its signatures are revealed onlylater in the evolution when the first dredge-up occurs. thermohaline mixing islikely the dominating process that governs the photospheric composition oflow-mass red giant branch stars and has been shown to drastically reduce thenet 3he production in these stars. the predictions of these new stellar modelsneed to be tested against galaxy evolution. in particular, the resultingevolution of the light elements d, 3he and 4he should be compared with theirprimordial values inferred from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe dataand with the abundances derived from observations of different galacticregions. we study the effects of thermohaline mixing and rotation-inducedmixing on the evolution of the light elements in the milky way. we computegalactic evolutionary models including new yields from stellar models computedwith thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing. we discuss theeffects of these important physical processes acting in stars on the evolutionof the light elements d, 3he, and 4he in the galaxy. galactic chemicalevolution models computed with stellar yields including thermohaline mixing androtation fit better observations of 3he and 4he in the galaxy than modelscomputed with standard stellar yields. the inclusion of thermohaline mixing instellar models provides a solution to the long-standing "3he problem" on agalactic scale. stellar models including rotation-induced mixing andthermohaline instability reproduce also the observations of d and 4he.

1301.5153	the effects of radial inflow of gas and galactic fountains on the  chemical evolution of m31	galactic fountains and radial gas flows are very important ingredients inmodeling the chemical evolution of galactic disks. our aim here is to study theeffects of galactic fountains and radial gas flows in the chemical evolution ofthe disk of m31. we adopt a ballistic method to study the effects of galacticfountains on the chemical enrichment of the m31 disk. we find that the landingcoordinate for the fountains in m31 is no more than 1 kpc from the startingpoint, thus producing negligible effect on the chemical evolution of the disk.we find that the delay time in the enrichment process due to fountains is nolonger than 100 myr and this timescale also produces negligible effects on theresults. then, we compute the chemical evolution of the m31 disk with radialgas flows produced by the infall of extragalactic material and fountains. wefind that a moderate inside-out formation of the disk coupled with radial flowsof variable speed can very well reproduce the observed gradient. we discussalso the effects of other parameters such a threshold in the gas density forstar formation and an efficiency of star formation varying with the galacticradius. we conclude that the most important physical processes in creating diskgradients are the inside-out formation and the radial gas flows. more data onabundance gradients both locally and at high redshift are necessary to confirmthis conclusion.

1303.7399	the dust properties of z ~ 3 mips-lbgs from photo-chemical models	the stacked spectral energy distribution (sed) of multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) 24$\mu m$ detected lyman break galaxies(mips-lbgs) is fitted by means of spectro-photometric model grasil with an"educated" fitting approach which benefits from results of chemical evolutionmodels. the star formation rate(sfr)-age-metallicity degeneracies of sedmodelling are broken by using sfh and chemical enrichment history suggested bychemical models, which also provide dust mass, dust abundance and chemicalelements locked in dust component. we derive the total mass $m_{tot}$, stellarmass $m_{\ast}$, gas mass $m_{g}$, dust mass $m_{d}$, age and sfr of thestacked mips-lbg in a self-consistent way. our estimate of $m_{\ast}= 8\times10^{10}$ agrees with other works based on uv-optical sed fitting. we suggestthat mips-lbgs at $z\sim3$ are young (0.3-0.6 gyr), massive ($m_{tot} \sim10^{11} m_{\odot}$), dusty ($m_{d} \sim 10^{8} m_{\odot}$), metal rich ($z \simz_{\odot} $) progenitors of elliptical galaxies suffering a strong burst ofstar formation (sfr $\sim 200 m_{\odot}/yr$). our estimate of $m_{d}=7 \times10^{7} m_{\odot}$ of the stacked mips-lbg is about a factor of eight lower thanthe estimated value based on single temperature grey-body fitting, suggestingthat self-consistent sed models are needed to estimate dust mass. by comparingwith the milky way molecular cloud and dust properties, we suggest that denserand dustier environments and flatter dust size distribution are likely in highredshift massive star forming galaxies. these dust properties, as well as thedifferent types of sfhs, can cause different sed shapes between high redshiftstar-forming ellipticals and local star-burst templates. this discrepancy ofsed shapes could in turn explain the non detection at submillimeterwavelengths, of ir luminous ($l_{ir} \succeq 10^{12} l_{\odot} $) mips-lbgs.

1304.2939	the two regimes of the cosmic ssfr evolution are due to spheroids and  discs	this paper aims at explaining the two phases in the observed specific starformation rate (ssfr), namely the high (&gt;3/gyr) values at z&gt;2 and the smoothdecrease since z=2. in order to do this, we compare to observations thespecific star formation rate evolution predicted by well calibrated models ofchemical evolution for elliptical and spiral galaxies, using the additionalconstraints on the mean stellar ages of these galaxies (at a given mass). wecan conclude that the two phases of the ssfr evolution across cosmic time aredue to different populations of galaxies. at z&gt;2 the contribution comes fromspheroids: the progenitors of present-day massive ellipticals (which featurethe highest ssfr) as well as halos and bulges in spirals (which contribute withaverage and lower-than-average ssfr). in each single galaxy the ssfr decreasesrapidly and the star formation stops in &lt;1 gyr. however the combination ofdifferent generations of ellipticals in formation might result in an apparentlack of strong evolution of the ssfr (averaged over a population) at highredshift. the z&lt;2 decrease is due to the slow evolution of the gas fraction indiscs, modulated by the gas accretion history and regulated by the schmidt law.the milky way makes no exception to this behaviour.

1304.4385	modelling the chemical evolution of the galaxy halo	we study the chemical evolution and formation of the galactic halo throughthe analysis of its stellar metallicity distribution function and some keyelemental abundance patterns. starting from the two-infall model for thegalaxy, which predicts too few low-metallicity stars, we add a gas outflowduring the halo phase with a rate proportional to the star formation ratethrough a free parameter, lambda. in addition, we consider a first generationof massive zero-metal stars in this two-infall + outflow model adopting twodifferent top-heavy initial mass functions and specific population iii yields.the metallicity distribution function of halo stars, as predicted by thetwo-infall + outflow model shows a good agreement with observations, when theparameter lambda=14 and the time scale for the first infall, out of which thehalo formed, is not longer than 0.2 gyr, a lower value than suggestedpreviously. moreover, the abundance patterns [x/fe] vs. [fe/h] for c, n andalpha-elements o, mg, si, s, ca show a good agreement with the observationaldata. if population iii stars are included, under the assumption of differentinitial mass functions, the overall agreement of the predicted stellarmetallicity distribution function with observational data is poorer than in thecase without population iii. we conclude that it is fundamental to include botha gas infall and outflow during the halo formation to explain the observed halometallicity distribution function, in the framework of a model assuming thatthe stars in the inner halo formed mostly in situ. moreover, we find that itdoes not exist a satisfactory initial mass function for population iii starswhich reproduces the observed halo metallicity distribution function. as aconsequence, there is no need for a first generation of only massive stars toexplain the evolution of the galactic halo.

1308.1549	abundance gradients in spiral disks: is the gradient inversion at high  redshift real?	we compute the abundance gradients along the disk of the milky way by meansof the two-infall model: in particular, the gradients of oxygen and iron andtheir temporal evolution. first, we explore the effects of several physicalprocesses which influence the formation and evolution of abundance gradients.they are: i) the inside-out formation of the disk, ii) a threshold in the gasdensity for star formation, iii) a variable star formation efficiency along thedisk, iv) radial flows and their speed, and v) different total surface massdensity (gas plus stars) distributions for the halo. we are able to reproduceat best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-outformation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formationalong the disk and radial gas flows. it is particularly important the choice ofthe velocity pattern for radial flows and the combination of this velocitypattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo. having selectedthe best model, we then explore the evolution of abundance gradients in timeand find that the gradients in general steepen in time and that at redshift z~3there is a gradient inversion in the inner regions of the disk, in the sensethat at early epochs the oxygen abundance decreases toward the galactic center.this effect, which has been observed, is naturally produced by our models if aninside-out formation of the disk and and a constant star formation efficiencyare assumed. the inversion is due to the fact that in the inside-out formationa strong infall of primordial gas, contrasting chemical enrichment, is presentin the innermost disk regions at early times. the gradient inversion remainsalso in the presence of radial flows, either with constant or variable speed intime, and this is a new result.

1407.5797	the effect of stellar migration on galactic chemical evolution: a  heuristic approach	in the last years, stellar migration in galactic discs has been the subjectof several investigations. however, its impact on the chemical evolution of themilky way still needs to be fully quantified. in this paper, we aim at imposingsome constraints on the significance of this phenomenon by considering itsinfluence on the chemical evolution of the milky way thin disc. we do notinvestigate the physical mechanisms underlying the migration of stars. rather,we introduce a simple, heuristic treatment of stellar migration in a detailedchemical evolution model for the thin disc of the milky way, which alreadyincludes radial gas flows and reproduces several observational constraints forthe solar vicinity and the whole galactic disc. when stellar migration isimplemented according to the results of chemo-dynamical simulations by minchevet. al. (2013) and finite stellar velocities of 1 km s$^{-1}$ are taken intoaccount, the high-metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution function oflong-lived thin-disc stars is well reproduced. by exploring the velocity space,we find that the migrating stars must travel with velocities in the range 0.5-2 km s$^{-1}$ to properly reproduce the high-metallicity tail of themetallicity distribution. we confirm previous findings by other authors thatthe observed spread in the age-metallicity relation of solar neighbourhoodstars can be explained by the presence of stars which originated at differentgalactocentric distances, and we conclude that the chemical properties of starscurrently observed in the solar vicinity do suggest that stellar migration ispresent to some extent.

0803.3032	galactic fountains and their connection with high and intermediate  velocity clouds	the aim of this paper is to calculate the expansion law and chemicalenrichment of a supershell powered by the energetic feedback of a typicalgalactic ob association at various galactocentric radii. we study then theorbits of the fragments created when the supershell breaks out and we comparetheir kinetic and chemical properties with the available observations of high -and intermediate - velocity clouds. we use the kompaneets (1960) approximationfor the evolution of the superbubble driven by sequential supernova explosionsand we compute the abundances of oxygen and iron residing in the thin coldsupershell. we assume that supershells are fragmented by means ofrayleigh-taylor instabilities and we follow the orbit of the clouds eitherballistically or by means of a hybrid model considering viscous interactionbetween the clouds and the extra-planar gas.given the self-similarity of thekompaneets solutions, clouds are always formed ~ 448 pc above the plane. if theinitial metallicity is solar, the pollution from dying stars of the obassociation has a negligible effect on the chemical composition of the clouds.the maximum height reached by the clouds above the plane seldom exceeds 2 kpcand when averaging over different throwing angles, the landing coordinatediffers from the throwing coordinate ~ 1 kpc at most. the range of heights and[o/fe] ratios spun by our clouds suggest us that the high velocity cloudscannot have a galactic origin, whereas intermediate velocity clouds havekinematic properties similar to our modeled clouds but overabundance observedfor the [o/fe] ratios which can be reproduced only with initial metallicitieswhich are too low compared for those of the galaxy disk.

0705.1650	a new comprehensive set of elemental abundances in dlas iii. star  formation histories	we obtained comprehensive sets of elemental abundances for eleven dampedly-alpha systems (dlas) at z_dla=1.7-2.5. in paper i of this series, we showedfor three dla galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories andages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns withchemical evolution models. we determine in this paper the star formationproperties of six additional dla galaxies. the derived results confirm that nosingle star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patternsin dlas. we demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducingthe dla abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst andquiescent spiral galaxies. independent of the star formation history, the dlashave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models withhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. all the derived dla starformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 &lt;log sfr &lt; -1.1 m_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. the dla abundance patterns require alarge spread in ages ranging from 20 myr up to 3 gyr. the oldest dla in oursample is observed at z_dla=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 gyr; itnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f&gt;10. but, most of thedlas show ages much younger than that of the universe at the epoch ofobservation. young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift universe atz&gt;2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for mosthigh-redshift galaxies. the dla star formation properties are compared withthose of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys withthe aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.

1410.7257	chemical evolution of the bulge of m31: predictions about abundance  ratios	we aim at reproducing the chemical evolution of the bulge of m31 by means ofa detailed chemical evolution model, including radial gas flows coming from thedisk. we study the impact of the initial mass function, the star formation rateand the time scale for bulge formation on the metallicity distribution functionof stars. we compute several models of chemical evolution using the metallicitydistribution of dwarf stars as an observational constraint for the bulge ofm31. then, by means of the model which best reproduces the metallicitydistribution function, we predict the [x/fe] vs. [fe/h] relations for severalchemical elements (o, mg, si, ca, c, n). our best model for the bulge of m31 isobtained by means of a robust statistical method and assumes a salpeter initialmass function, a schmidt-kennicutt law for star formation with an exponentk=1.5, an efficiency of star formation of $\sim 15\pm 0.27\, gyr^{-1}$, and aninfall timescale of $\sim 0.10\pm 0.03$gyr. our results suggest that the bulgeof m31 formed very quickly by means of an intense star formation rate and aninitial mass function flatter than in the solar vicinity but similar to thatinferred for the milky way bulge. the [$\alpha$/fe] ratios in the stars of thebulge of m31 should be high for most of the [fe/h] range, as is observed in themilky way bulge. these predictions await future data to be proven.

1502.01836	the effect of radial gas flows on the chemical evolution of the milky  way and m31	we present detailed chemical evolution models for the milky way and m31 inpresence of radial gas flows. these models follow in detail the evolution ofseveral chemical elements (h, he, cno, $\alpha$ elements, fe-peak elements) inspace and time. the contribution of supernovae of different type to chemicalenrichment is taken into account. we find that an inside-out formation of thedisks coupled with radial gas inflows of variable speed can reproduce very wellthe observed abundance gradients in both galaxies. we also discuss the effectsof other parameters, such as a threshold in the gas density for star formationand efficiency of star formation varying with galactic radius. moreover, forthe first time we compute the galactic habitable zone in our galaxy and m31 inpresence of radial gas flows. the main effect is to enhance the number of starshosting a habitable planet with respect to the models without radial flow, inthe region of maximum probability for this occurrence. in the milky way themaximum number of stars hosting habitable planets is at 8 kpc from the galacticcenter, and the model with radial gas flows predicts a number of planets whichis 38% larger than that predicted by the classical model.

1502.03686	are z&gt;2 herschel galaxies proto-spheroids?	we present a backward approach for the interpretation of the evolution of thenear-infrared and the far-infrared luminosity functions across the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;3. in our method, late-type galaxies are treated by means of aparametric phenomenological method based on pep/hermes data up to z~4, whereasspheroids are described by means of a physically motivated backward model. thespectral evolution of spheroids is modelled by means of a single-mass model,associated to a present-day elliptical with k-band luminosity comparable to thebreak of the local early-type luminosity function. the formation ofproto-spheroids is assumed to occurr across the redshift range 1&lt; z &lt; 5. thekey parameter is represented by the redshift z_0.5 at which halfproto-spheroids are already formed. a statistical study indicates for thisparameter values between z_0.5=1.5 and z_0.5=3. we assume as fiducial valuez_0.5~2, and show that this assumption allows us to describe accourately theredshift distributions and the source counts. by assuming z_0.5 ~ 2 at thefar-ir flux limit of the pep-cosmos survey, the pep-selected sources observedat z&gt;2 can be explained as progenitors of local spheroids caught during theirformation. we also test the effects of mass downsizing by dividing thespheroids into three populations of different present-day stellar masses. theresults obtained in this case confirm the validity of our approach, i.e. thatthe bulk of proto-spheroids can be modelled by means of a single model whichdescribes the evolution of galaxies at the break of the present-day early typek-band lf.

1503.08949	chemical evolution of the galactic center	in recent years, the galactic center (gc) region (200 pc in radius) has beenstudied in detail with spectroscopic stellar data as well as an estimate of theongoing star formation rate. the aims of this paper are to study the chemicalevolution of the gc region by means of a detailed chemical evolution model andto compare the results with high resolution spectroscopic data in order toimpose constraints on the gc formation history.the chemical evolution modelassumes that the gc region formed by fast infall of gas and then follows theevolution of alpha-elements and fe. we test different initial mass functions(imfs), efficiencies of star formation and gas infall timescales. to reproducethe currently observed star formation rate, we assume a late episode of starformation triggered by gas infall/accretion. we find that, in order toreproduce the [alpha/fe] ratios as well as the metallicity distributionfunction observed in gc stars, the gc region should have experienced a mainearly strong burst of star formation, with a star formation efficiency as highas 25 gyr^{-1}, occurring on a timescale in the range 0.1-0.7 gyr, in agreementwith previous models of the entire bulge. although the small amount of dataprevents us from drawing firm conclusions, we suggest that the best imf shouldcontain more massive stars than expected in the solar vicinity, and the lastepisode of star formation, which lasted several hundred million years, shouldhave been triggered by a modest episode of gas infall/accretion, with a starformation efficiency similar to that of the previous main star formationepisode. this last episode of star formation produces negligible effects on theabundance patterns and can be due to accretion of gas induced by the bar. ourresults exclude an important infall event as a trigger for the last starburst.

1510.02622	chemical evolution of the inner 2 degrees of the milky way bulge:  [alpha/fe] trends and metallicity gradients	the structure, formation, and evolution of the milky way bulge is a matter ofdebate. important diagnostics for discriminating between bulge models includealpha-abundance trends with metallicity, and spatial abundance and metallicitygradients. due to the severe optical extinction in the inner bulge region, onlya few detailed investigations have been performed of this region. here we aimat investigating the inner 2 degrees by observing the [alpha/fe] element trendsversus metallicity, and by trying to derive the metallicity gradient.[alpha/fe] and metallicities have been determined by spectral synthesis of 2micron spectra observed with vlt/crires of 28 m-giants, lying along thesouthern minor axis at (l,b)=(0,0), (0,-1), and (0,-2). vlt/isaac spectra areused to determine the effective temperature of the stars. we present the firstconnection between the galactic center and the bulge using similar stars, highspectral resolution, and analysis techniques. the [alpha/fe] trends in all our3 fields show a large similarity among each other and with trends further outin the bulge, with a lack of an [\alpha/fe] gradient all the way into thecentre. this suggests a homogeneous bulge when it comes to the enrichmentprocess and star-formation history. we find a large range of metallicities(-1.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.3), with a lower dispersion in the galactic center:-0.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.3. the derived metallicities get in the mean, progressivelyhigher the closer to the galactic plane they lie. we could interpret this as acontinuation of the metallicity gradient established further out in the bulge,but due to the low number of stars and possible selection effects, more data ofthe same sort as presented here is necessary to conclude on the innermetallicity gradient from our data alone. our results firmly argues for thecenter being in the context of the bulge rather than very distinct.

0806.2410	amaze. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3	we present initial results of an eso-vlt large programme (amaze) aimed atdetermining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3 by means ofdeep near-ir spectroscopy. gas metallicities are measured, for an initialsample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebularlines redshifted into the near-ir. stellar masses are accurately determined byusing spitzer-irac data, which sample the rest-frame near-ir stellar light inthese distant galaxies. when compared with previous surveys, themass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much strongerthan observed at lower redshifts. the evolution is prominent even in massivegalaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of starformation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. there are alsoindications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is strongerrelative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemicalversion of the galaxy downsizing. the mass-metallicity relation observed atz~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchicalevolutionary models. such discrepancies suggest that at z&gt;3 galaxies areassembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies withlow star formation efficiency. the bulk of the star formation and metallicityevolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into biggersystems.

0807.2354	theoretical cosmic type ia supernova rates	the aim of this work is the computation of the cosmic type ia supernova ratesat very high redshifts (z&gt;2). we adopt various progenitor models in order topredict the number of explosions in different scenarios for galaxy formationand to check whether it is possible to select the best delay time distributionmodel, on the basis of the available observations of type ia supernovae. wealso computed the type ia supernova rate in typical elliptical galaxies ofdifferent initial luminous masses and the total amount of iron produced by typeia supernovae in each case. it emerges that: it is not easy to select the bestdelay time distribution scenario from the observational data and this isbecause the cosmic star formation rate dominates over the distribution functionof the delay times; the monolithic collapse scenario predicts an increasingtrend of the sn ia rate at high redshifts whereas the predicted rate in thehierarchical scheme drops dramatically at high redshift; for the ellipticalgalaxies we note that the predicted maximum of the type ia supernova ratedepends on the initial galactic mass. the maximum occurs earlier (at about 0.3gyr) in the most massive ellipticals, as a consequence of downsizing in starformation. we find that different delay time distributions predict differentrelations between the type ia supernova rate per unit mass at the present timeand the color of the parent galaxies and that bluer ellipticals present highersupernova type ia rates at the present time.

0808.0118	the effect of differential galactic winds on the chemical evolution of  galaxies	(abridged) the aim of this paper is to study the basic equations of thechemical evolution of galaxies with gas flows. we focus on models in which theoutflow is differential, namely in which the heavy elements (or some of theheavy elements) can leave the parent galaxy more easily than other chemicalspecies such as h and he. we study the chemical evolution of galaxies in theframework of simple models. this allows us to solve analytically the equationsfor the evolution of gas masses and metallicities. we find new analyticalsolutions for various cases in which the effects of winds and infall are takeninto account. differential galactic winds have the effect of reducing theglobal metallicity of a galaxy, with the amount of reduction increasing withthe ejection efficiency of the metals. abundance ratios are predicted to remainconstant throughout the whole evolution of the galaxy, even in the presence ofdifferential winds. one way to change them is by assuming differential windswith different ejection efficiencies for different elements. however, simplemodels apply only to elements produced on short timescales, namely all by typeii sne, and therefore large differences in the ejection efficiencies ofdifferent metals are unlikely. variations in abundance ratios such as [o/fe] ingalaxies, without including the fe production by type ia supernovae, can inprinciple be obtained by assuming an unlikely different efficiency in the lossof o relative to fe from type ii supernovae. therefore, we conclude that it isnot realistic to ignore type ia supernovae and that the delayed production ofsome chemical elements relative to others (time-delay model) remains the mostplausible explanation for the evolution of alpha-elements relative to fe.

astro-ph;0101284	galactic winds in irregular starburst galaxies	in this paper we present some results concerning the study of the developmentof galactic winds in blue compact galaxies. in particular, we model a situationvery similar to that of the galaxy izw18, the most metal poor and unevolvedgalaxy known locally. to do that we compute the chemo-dynamical evolution of agalaxy in the case of one istantaneous isolated starburst as well as in thecase of two successive instantaneous starbursts. we show that in both cases ametal enriched wind develops and that the metals produced by the type ia sneare lost more efficiently than those produced by type ii sne. we also find thatone single burst is able to enrich chemically the surrounding region in fewmyr. both these results are the effect of the assumed efficiency of energytransfer from sne to ism and to the consideration of type ia sne in this kindof problem. the comparison with observed abundances of izw18 suggests that thisgalaxy is likely to have suffered two bursts in its life, with the previousbeing less intense than the last one.

astro-ph;0105074	on the typical timescale for the chemical enrichment from sneia in  galaxies	we calculate the type ia supernova rate for different star formationhistories in galaxies by adopting the most popular and recent progenitormodels. we show that the timescale for the maximum in the type ia supernovarate, which corresponds also to time of the maximum enrichment, is not uniquebut is a strong function of the adopted stellar lifetimes, initial massfunction and star formation rate. this timescale varies from $\sim 40-50$ myrfor an instantaneous starburst to $\sim$ 0.3 gyr for a typical ellipticalgalaxy to $\sim 4.0-5.0$ gyr for a disk of a spiral galaxy like the milky way.we also show that the typical timescale of 1 gyr, often quoted as the typicaltimescale for the type ia supernovae, is just the time at which, in the solarneighbourhood, the fe production from supernovae ia starts to become importantand not the time at which sne ia start to explode. as a cosequence of this, achange in slope in the [o/fe] ratio is expected in correspondance of thistimescale. we conclude that the suggested lack of supernovae ia at lowmetallicities produces results at variance with the observed [o/fe] vs. [fe/h]relation in the solar region. we also compute the supernova ia rates fordifferent galaxies as a function of redshift and predict an extended maximumbetween redshift $z \sim 3.6$ and $z \sim 1.6$ for elliptical galaxies, and twomaxima, one at $z \sim 3$ and the other at $z \sim 1$, for spiral galaxies,under the assumption that galaxies start forming stars at $z_f \sim 5$ and$\omega_m = 0.3$, $\omega_{\lambda} = 0.7$.

astro-ph;0401576	simulating the metal enrichment of the icm	we present results from tree+sph simulations of a galaxy cluster, aimed atstudying the metal enrichment of the intra--cluster medium (icm). thesimulation code includes a fairly advanced treatment of star formation, as wellas the release of energy feedback and detailed yields from both type-ii andtype-ia supernovae, also accurately accounting for the lifetimes of differentstellar populations. we perform simulations of a cluster with virial mass ~3.9x 10^14 msun, to investigate the effect of varying the feedback strength andthe stellar initial mass function (imf). although most of the models are ableto produce acceptable amounts of fe mass, we find that the profiles of the ironabundance are always steeper than observed. the [o/fe] ratio is found to besub--solar for a salpeter imf, with [o/fe] -0.2 at r &gt;~ 0.1r200, whereasincreasing to super-solar values in central regions, as a result of recent starformation. using a top--heavier imf gives a larger [o/fe] over the wholecluster, at variance with observations. on the other hand, the adoption of avariable imf, which becomes top-heavier at z&gt;2, provides a roughly solar [o/fe]ratio. our results indicate that our simulations still lack a feedbackmechanism which should quench star formation at low redshift and transportmetals away from the star forming regions.

astro-ph;0406157	cosmic star formation: constraints on the galaxy formation models	we study the evolution of the cosmic star formation by computing theluminosity density (ld) in the uv, b, j, and k bands, and the stellar massdensity (md) of galaxies in two reference models of galaxy evolution: the pureluminosity evolution (ple) model developed by calura &amp; matteucci (2003) and thesemi-analytical model (sam) of hierarchical galaxy formation by menci et al.(2002). the former includes a detailed description of the chemical evolution ofgalaxies of different morphological types with no density evolution; the latterincludes the merging histories of the galactic dm haloes, as predicted by thehierarchical clustering scenario, but it does not contain morphologicalclassification nor chemical evolution. we find that at z&lt; 1.5 both models areconsistent with the available data on the ld of galaxies in all the consideredbands. at high z, the lds predicted in the ple model show a peak due to theformation of ellipticals, whereas the sam predicts a gradual decrease of thestar formation and of the ld for z&gt; 2.5. at such redshifts the ple predictionstend to overestimate the present data in the b band whereas the sam tends tounderestimate the observed uv ld. as for the stellar md, the ple picturepredicts that nearly 50% and 85% of the present stellar mass are in place atz=4 and z=1, respectively. according to the sam, 50% and 60% of the presentstellar mass are in place at z=1.2 and z=1, respectively. both predictions fitthe observed md up to z=1. at z&gt;1, the ple model and the sam tend tooverestimate and underestimate the observed values, respectively. we discussthe origin of the above model results, and the role of observationaluncertainties (such as dust extinction) in comparing models with observations.

astro-ph;0406484	continuous star formation in izw18	we study the dynamical and chemical evolution of a galaxy similar to izw18under the assumption of a continuous star formation during bursts. we adopt a2-d hydrocode coupled with detailed chemical yields originating from sneii,sneia and from single intermediate-mass stars. different nucleosynthetic yieldsand different imf slopes are tested. in most of the explored cases, a galacticwind develops, mostly carrying out of the galaxy the metal-enriched gasproduced by the burst itself. the chemical species with the largest escapeprobabilities are fe and n. consequently, we predict that the [$\alpha$/fe] and[$\alpha$/n] ratios outside the galaxy are lower than inside. in order toreproduce the chemical composition of izw18, the best choice seems to be theadoption of the yields of meynet &amp; maeder (2002) which take into accountstellar rotation, although these authors do not follow the whole evolution ofall the stars. models with a flat imf (x=0.5) seem to be able to betterreproduce the chemical properties of izw18, but they inject in the gas a muchlarger amount of energy and the resulting galactic wind is very strong, atvariance with observations. we also predict the evolution of the abundances inthe \hi medium and compare them with recent {\sl fuse} observations.

astro-ph;0502487	early chemical enrichment of the universe and the role of very massive  pop iii stars	in this paper the role of very massive pop iii stars in the chemicalenrichment of the early universe is discussed. we first compare our predictionswith the abundance ratios measured in the high redshift lyman-alpha forest tocheck whether they are compatible with the values predicted by assuming thatthe early universe was enriched by massive pop iii stars. we conclude that toexplain the observed c/si ratio in the intergalactic medium, a contributionfrom pop ii stars to carbon enrichment is necessary, already at redshift z=5.we then evaluate the number of pair-instability supernovae (sn_(gamma gamma))required to enrich the universe to the critical metallicity z_cr, i.e. themetallicity value which causes the transition from a very massive star regime(m &gt; 100 m_sun) to a lower mass regime, similar to the one characteristic ofthe present time (m &lt; 100 m_sun). it is found that between 110 and 115sn_(gamma gamma) are sufficient to chemically enrich a cubic megaparsec of theintergalactic medium at high redshift for a variety of initial mass functions.the number of ionizing photons provided by these sn_(gamma gamma) and also bythe pop iii stars ending as black holes was computed and we conclude that thereare not enough photons to reionize the universe, being down by at least afactor of ~ 3. finally, we calculate the abundance ratios generated by pop iiistars and compare it with the ones observed in low metallicity dampedlyman-alpha systems (dlas). we suggest that pop iii stars alone cannot beresponsible for the abundance ratios in these objects and that intermediatemass pop ii stars must have played an important role especially in enrichingdlas in nitrogen.

astro-ph;0503492	the origin of nitrogen: implications of recent measurements of n/o in  galactic metal-poor stars	recent new high-precision abundance data for galactic halo stars suggestimportant primary nitrogen production in very metal-poor massive stars. here,we compute a new model for the chemical evolution of the milky way aimed atexplaining these new abundance data. the new data can be explained by adopting:a) the stellar yields obtained from stellar models that take into accountrotation and b) an extra production of nitrogen in the very metal-poor massivestars. in particular, we suggest an increase of nearly a factor of 200 in 14nfor a star of 60 msun and 40 for a star of 9msun, for metallicities belowz=10$^{-5}$, with respect to the yields given in the literature for z=10$^{-5}$and rotational velocity of 300 km/s. we show that once we adopt the aboveprescriptions, our model is able to predict high n/o abundance ratios at lowmetallicities and still explains the nitrogen abundances observed in thin diskstars in the solar vicinity. the physical motivation for a larger nitrogenproduction in massive stars in very metal-poor environments could be the factthat some stellar models as well as observational data suggest that at lowmetallicities stars rotate faster. if this is the case, such large nitrogenproduction seen in the pristine phases of the halo formation would notnecessarily happen in damped lyman-alpha systems which have metallicitiesalways above [fe/h]$\simeq -$2.5, and could have been pre-enriched. we alsocompute the abundance gradient of n/o along the galactic disk and show that anegative gradient is predicted once we adopt stellar yields where rotation istaken into account. the latter result implies that intermediate mass starscontribute less to the primary nitrogen than previously thought.

astro-ph;0509381	dynamical and chemical evolution of ngc1569	blue compact dwarf and dwarf irregular galaxies are generally believed to beunevolved objects, due to their blue colors, compact appearance and large gasfractions. many of these objects show an ongoing intense burst of starformation or have experienced it in the recent past. by means of 2-dhydrodynamical simulations, coupled with detailed chemical yields originatingfrom sneii, sneia, and intermediate-mass stars, we study the dynamical andchemical evolution of model galaxies with structural parameters similar tongc1569, a prototypical starburst galaxy. a burst of star formation with shortduration is not able to account for the chemical and morphological propertiesof this galaxy. the best way to reproduce the chemical composition of thisobject is by assuming long-lasting episodes of star formation and a more recentburst, separated from the previous episodes by a short quiescent period. thelast burst of star formation, in most of the explored cases, does not affectthe chemical composition of the galaxy, since the enriched gas produced byyoung stars is in a too hot phase to be detectable with the opticalspectroscopy. models assuming the infall of a big cloud towards the center ofthe galaxy reproduce the chemical composition of the ngc1569, but the pressureexercised by the cloud hampers the expansion of the galactic wind, at variancewith what observed in ngc1569.

astro-ph;0510496	the chemical evolution of barium and europium in the milky way	we compute the evolution of the abundances of barium and europium in themilky way and we compare our results with the observed abundances from therecent uves large program "first stars". we use a chemical evolution modelwhich already reproduces the majority of observational constraints. we confirmthat barium is a neutron capture element mainly produced in the low mass agbstars during the thermal-pulsing phase by the 13c neutron source, in a slowneutron capture process. however, in order to reproduce the [ba/fe] vs. [fe/h]as well as the ba solar abundance, we suggest that ba should be also producedas an r-process element by massive stars in the range 10-30 solar masses. onthe other hand, europium should be only an r-process element produced in thesame range of masses (10-30 solar masses), at variance with previoussuggestions indicating a smaller mass range for the eu producers. as it is wellknown, there is a large spread in the [ba/fe] and [eu/fe] ratios at lowmetallicities, although smaller in the newest data. with our model we estimatefor both elements (ba and eu) the ranges for the r-process yields from massivestars which better reproduce the trend of the data. we find that with the sameyields which are able to explain the observed trends, the large spread in the[ba/fe] and [eu/fe] ratios cannot be explained even in the context of aninhomogeneous models for the chemical evolution of our galaxy. we thereforederive the amount by which the yields should be modified to fully account forthe observed spread. we then discuss several possibilities to explain the sizeof the spread. we finally suggest that the production ratio of [ba/eu] could bealmost constant in the massive stars.

astro-ph;0511031	a new comprehensive set of elemental abundances in dlas - ii. data  analysis and chemical variation studies	we present new elemental abundance studies of seven damped lyman-alphasystems (dlas). together with the four dlas analyzed in dessauges-zavadsky etal. (2004), we have a sample of eleven dla galaxies with uniquely comprehensiveand homogeneous abundance measurements. these observations allow one to studythe abundance patterns of 22 elements and the chemical variations in theinterstellar medium of galaxies outside the local group. comparing thegas-phase abundance ratios of these high redshift galaxies, we found that theyshow low rms dispersions, reaching only up 2-3 times the statistical errors forthe majority of elements. this uniformity is remarkable given that the quasarsightlines cross gaseous regions with hi column densities spanning over oneorder of magnitude and metallicities ranging from 1/55 to 1/5 solar. thegas-phase abundance patterns of interstellar medium clouds within the dlagalaxies detected along the velocity profiles show, on the other hand, a highdispersion in several abundance ratios, indicating that chemical variationsseem to be more confined to individual clouds within the dla galaxies than tointegrated profiles. the analysis of the cloud-to-cloud chemical variationswithin seven individual dlas reveals that five of them show statisticallysignificant variations, higher than 0.2 dex at more than 3 sigma. the sourcesof these variations are both the differential dust depletion and/or ionizationeffects; however, no evidence for variations due to different star formationhistories could be highlighted. these observations place large constraints onthe mixing timescales of protogalaxies and on scenarios of galaxy formationwithin the cdm hierarchical theory. finally, we provide an astrophysicaldetermination of the oscillator strength of the niii 1317 transition.

astro-ph;0602459	a strong case for fast stellar rotation at very low metallicities	we investigate the effect of new stellar models, which take rotation intoaccount, computed for a metallicity z = 10^{-8} on the chemical evolution ofthe earliest phases of the milky way. these models are computed under theassumption that the ratio of the initial rotation velocity to the criticalvelocity of stars is roughly constant with metallicity. this naturally leads tofaster rotation at lower metallicity, as metal poor stars are more compact thanmetal rich ones. we find that the new z = 10^{-8} stellar yields have atremendous impact on the interstellar medium nitrogen enrichment forlog(o/h)+12 &lt; 7 (or [fe/h]&lt; -3).we show that upon the inclusion of the z =10^{-8} stellar yields in chemical evolution models, both high n/o and c/oratios are obtained in the very-metal poor metallicity range in agreement withobservations. our results give further support to the idea that stars at verylow metallicities could have rotational velocities of the order of 600-800 kms^{-1}.

astro-ph;0603261	metals and dust in high redshift agns	we summarize some recent results on the metallicity and dust properties ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) at high redshift (1&lt;z&lt;6.4). by using the spectraof more than 5000 qsos from the sdss we find no evidence for any metallicityevolution in the redshift range 2&lt;z&lt;4.5, while there is a significantluminosity-metallicity dependence. these results are confirmed by the spectraof a smaller sample of narrow line agns at high-z (qso2s and radio galaxies).the lack of metallicity evolution is interpreted both as a consequence of thecosmic downsizing and as a selection effect resulting from the joint qso-galaxyevolution. the luminosity-metallicity relation is interpreted as a consequenceof the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxies of qsos, but arelationship with the accretion rate is also possible. the lack of metallicityevolution is observed even in the spectra of the most distant qsos known (z~6).this result is particularly surprising for elements such as fe, c and si, whichare subject to a delayed enrichment, and requires that the hosts of these qsosformed in short bursts and at very high redshift (z&gt;10). the properties of dustin high-z qsos are discussed within the context of the dust productionmechanisms in the early universe. the dust extinction curve is observed toevolve beyond z&gt;4, and by z~6 it is well described by the properties expectedfor dust produced by sne, suggesting that the latter is the main mechanism ofdust production in the early universe. we also show that the huge dust massesobserved in distant qsos can be accounted for by sn dust within theobservational constraints currently available. finally, we show that qso winds,which have been proposed as an alternative mechanism of dust production, mayalso contribute significantly to the total dust budget at high redshift.

astro-ph;0607504	a new formulation of the type ia sn rate and its consequences on  galactic chemical evolution	in recent papers mannucci et al. (2005, 2006) suggested, on the basis ofobservational arguments, that there is a bimodal distribution of delay timesfor the explosion of type ia sne. in this paper, we test this hypothesis inmodels of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type:ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. we show that this proposed scenario iscompatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. when the newrate is introduced in the two-infall model for the milky way, the derived typeia sn rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at veryearly epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo morethan in the previous widely adopted formulations for the snia rate. as aconsequence of this, the [o/fe] ratio decreases faster for [fe/h] &gt; -2.0 dex,relative to the old models. for a typical elliptical of 10^11 m_sun of luminousmass, the new rate produces average [alpha/ fe] ratios in the dominant stellarpopulation still in agreement with observations. the type ia sn rate also inthis case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to theprevious results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of ourgalaxy. we have also checked the effects of the new type ia sn rate on theevolution of the fe content in the icm, as a consequence of its production fromcluster ellipticals and we found that less fe in the icm is produced with thenew rate, due to the higher fraction of fe synthesized at early times andremaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. for dwarf irregular galaxiessuffering few bursts of star formation we obtain [o/fe] ratios larger by 0.2dex relative to the previous models.

astro-ph;0607674	cosmic supernova rates and the hubble sequence	we compute the type ia, ib/c and ii supernova (sn) rates as functions of thecosmic time for galaxies of different morphological types. we use fourdifferent chemical evolution models, each one reproducing the features of aparticular morphological type: e/s0, s0a/b, sbc/d and irr galaxies. weessentially describe the hubble sequence by means of decreasing efficiency ofstar formation and increasing infall timescale. these models are used to studythe evolution of the sn rates per unit luminosity and per unit mass asfunctions of cosmic time and as functions of the hubble type. our resultsindicate that: (i) the observed increase of the sn rate per unit luminosity andunit mass from early to late galaxy types is accounted for by our models. ourexplanation of this effect is related to the fact that the latest hubble typeshave the highest star formation rate per unit mass; (ii) by adopting a scalo(1986) initial mass function in spiral disks, we find that massive single starsending their lives as wolf-rayet objects are not sufficient to account for theobserved type ib/c sn rate per unit mass. less massive stars in close binarysystems can give instead a significant contribution to the local ib/c sn rates.on the other hand, with the assumption of a salpeter (1955) imf for all galaxytypes, single massive wr stars are sufficient to account for the observed typeib/c sn rate. (iii) our models allow us to reproduce the observed type ia snrate density up to redshift z~1. we predict an increasing type ia sn ratedensity with redshift, reaching a peak at redshift z &gt;= 3, because of thecontribution of massive spheroids.

astro-ph;9312051	synthetic metal line indices for elliptical galaxies from super metal  rich alpha-enhanced stellar models	there are strong indications from recent papers (e.g. worthey et al. 1992)that the abundance ratio of mg/fe, and consequently also o/fe in giantelliptical galaxies is not solar. the line strengths of two fe lines at 5270and 5335 a are weaker than one expects from the strength of the mg b line if[mg/fe] = 0. we have synthesized absorption line indices to derive the mg andfe abundances of these galaxies. for these models we have calculated newevolutionary tracks of high metallicity stars with a range of mg/fe abundances.this is the first time that such tracks have been generated. integrating alongisochrones to synthesize metal line strengths we find that for a typical brightgiant elliptical [mg/fe] has to be between +0.3 and +0.7. we show that thisresult is independent of other parameters such as age, total metal content andmixing length parameter. the total metal content is super-solar, but the ironmetallicity of elliptical galaxies not necessarily has to be larger than solar.for the formation of elliptical galaxies our result on the mg and fe abundanceshas the implication that most of the enrichment of the gas has to come from sneii, which have more massive progenitors and as such produce relatively more oand mg than fe. it means that most of the stars have to be formed within aperiod of $3 \times 10^8$ years, so that there can only be one major collapsephase of the galaxy.

astro-ph;9605039	chemical evolution of dla systems	high redshift dla systems suggest that the relative abundances of elementsmight be roughly solar, although with absolute abundances of more than twoorders of magnitude below solar. the result comes from observations of the[sii/znii] ratio, which is a reliable diagnostic of the true abundance, andfrom dla absorbers with small dust depletion and negligible hii contamination.in particular, in two dla systems nitrogen is detected and at remarkably highlevels (vladilo et al. 1995, molaro et al. 1995, green et al. 1995, kulkarni etal. 1996). here we compare the predictions from chemical evolution models ofgalaxies of different morphological type with the abundances and abundanceratios derived for such systems. we conclude that solar ratios and relativelyhigh nitrogen abundances can be obtained in the framework of a chemicalevolution model assuming short but intense bursts of star formation, which inturn trigger enriched galactic winds, and a primary origin for nitrogen inmassive stars. such a model is the most successful in describing the chemicalabundances of dwarf irregular galaxies and in particular of the peculiar galaxyizw18. thus, solar ratios at very low absolute abundances, if confirmed, seemto favour dwarf galaxies rather than spirals as the progenitors of at leastsome of the dla systems.

astro-ph;9609199	the chemical evolution of the galaxy: the two-infall model	in this paper we present a new chemical evolution model for the galaxy whichassumes two main infall episodes for the formation of halo-thick disk and thindisk, respectively. we do not try to take into account explicitly the evolutionof the halo but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation ofthe halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thickdisk. the formation of the thin-disk is much longer than that of the thickdisk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin-disk comes not only fromthe thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. the timescale for theformation of the thin-disk is assumed to be a function of the galactocentricdistance, leading to an inside-out picture for the galaxy building. the modeltakes into account the most up to date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adoptsa threshold in the star formation process which naturally produces a hiatus inthe star formation rate at the end of the thick disk phase, as suggested byrecent observations. the model results are compared with an extended set ofobservational constraints. among these constraints, the tightest one is themetallicity distribution of the g-dwarf stars for which new data are nowavailable. our model fits very well these new data. we show that in order toreproduce most of these constraints a timescale $\le 1$ gyr for the(halo)-thick-disk and of 8 gyr for the thin-disk formation in the solarvicinity are required. we predict that the radial abundance gradients in theinner regions of the disk ($r&lt; r_{\odot}$) are steeper than in the outerregions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that theinner ones steepen in time during the galactic lifetime.

astro-ph;9710056	a possible theoretical explanation of metallicity gradients in  elliptical galaxies	models of chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies taking into accountdifferent escape velocities at different galactocentric radii are presented. asa consequence of this, the chemical evolution develops differently in differentgalactic regions; in particular, we find that the galactic wind, powered bysupernovae (of type ii and i) starts, under suitable conditions, in the outerregions and successively develops in the central ones. the rate of starformation (sfr) is assumed to stop after the onset of the galactic wind in eachregion. the main result found in the present work is that this mechanism isable to reproduce metallicity gradients, namely the gradients in the $mg_2$index, in good agreement with observational data. we also find that in order tohonor the constant [mg/fe] ratio with galactocentric distance, as inferred frommetallicity indices, a variable initial mass function as a function ofgalactocentric distance is required. this is only a suggestion since trends onabundances inferred just from metallicity indices are still uncertain.

astro-ph;9801131	the influence of stellar energetics and dark matter on the chemical  evolution of dwarf irregulars	a chemical evolution model following the evolution of the abundances of h,he, c, n, o and fe for dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies is presented.this model takes into account detailed nucleosynthesis and computes in detailthe rates of supernovae of type ii and i. the star formation is assumed to haveproceeded in short but intense bursts. the novelty relative to previous modelsis that the development of a galactic wind is studied in detail by taking intoaccount the energy injected into the interstellar medium (ism) from bothsupernovae and stellar winds from massive stars as well as the presence of darkmatter halos. both metal enriched and normal winds have been considered. ourmain conclusions are: i) a substantial amount of dark matter (from 1 to 50times larger than the luminous matter) is required in order to avoid thecomplete destruction of such galaxies during strong starbursts, and ii) theenergy injected by stellar winds and type ia supernovae into the ism isnegligible relative to the total thermal energy, and in particular to the typeii supernovae, which in fact, dominate the energetics during starbursts.

astro-ph;9803126	on the trend of [mg/fe] among giant elliptical galaxies	we revisit the problem of the flat slope of the mg2 versus &lt;fe&gt; relationshipfound for nuclei of elliptical galaxies (faber et al. 1992; worthey et al.1992; carollo et al. 1993; davies et al. 1993), indicating that the mg/fe ratioshould increase with galactic luminosity and mass. we transform the abundanceof fe, as predicted by classic wind models and alternative models for thechemical evolution of elliptical galaxies, into the metallicity indices mg2 and&lt;fe&gt;, by means of the more recent index calibrations and show that none of thecurrent models for the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies is able toreproduce exactly the observed slope of the &lt;fe&gt; versus mg2 relation, althoughthe existing spread in the data makes this comparison quite difficult. in otherwords, we can not clearly discriminate between models predicting a decrease(classic wind model) or an increase of such a ratio with galactic mass. thereason for this resides in the fact that the available observations show alarge spread due mostly to the errors in the derivation of the &lt;fe&gt; index. inour opinion this fact prevents us from drawing any firm conclusion on thebehaviour of mg and fe in these galaxies.

astro-ph;9809256	bepposax detection of the fe k line in the nearby starburst galaxy ngc  253	we present bepposax results on the nearby starburst galaxy ngc 253. althoughextended, a large fraction of the x-ray emission comes from the nuclear region.preliminary analysis of the lecs/mecs/pds ~0.2-60 kev data from the central 4'region indicates that the continuum is well fitted by two thermal models: a``soft'' component with kt ~ 0.9 kev, and a ``hard'' component with kt ~ 6 kevabsorbed by a column density of ~ 1.2 x10**22 cm-2. for the first time in thisobject, the fe k line at 6.7 kev is detected, with an equivalent width of ~ 300ev. this detection, together with the shape of the 2--60 kev continuum, impliesthat most of the hard x-ray emission is thermal in origin, and constrains theiron abundances of this component to be ~0.25 of solar. other lines clearlydetected are si, s and fe l/ne, in agreement with previous asca results. wediscuss our results in the context of the starburst-driven galactic superwindmodel.

0811.1591	constraining the star formation histories of grb host galaxies from  their observed abundance patterns	long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) are linked to the collapse of massivestars and their hosts are exclusively identified as active, star forminggalaxies. four long grbs observed at high spectral resolution at redshift 1.5&lt;z &lt; 4 allowed the determination of the elemental abundances for a set ofdifferent chemical elements. in this paper, for the first time, by means ofdetailed chemical evolution models taking into account also dust production, weattempt to constrain the star formation history of the host galaxies of thesegrbs from the study of the chemical abundances measured in their ism. we arealso able to provide constraints on the age and on the dust content of grbhosts. our results support the hypothesis that long duration grbs occurpreferentially in low metallicity, star forming galaxies. we compare thespecific star formation rate, namely the star formation rate per unit stellarmass, predicted for the hosts of these grbs with observational values for grbhosts distributed across a large redshift range. our models predict a decreaseof the specific star formation rate (ssfr) with redshift, consistent with theobserved decrease of the comoving cosmic sfr density between z ~2 and z=0. onthe other hand, observed grb hosts seems to follow an opposite trend in thessfr vs redshift plot, with an increase of the ssfr with decreasing redshift.finally, we compare the ssfr of grb050730 host with values derived for a sampleof quasar damped lyman alpha systems. our results indicate that the abundancepattern and the specific star formation rates of the host galaxies of thesegrbs are basically compatible with the ones determined in quasar damped lymanalpha systems, suggesting similar chemical evolution paths.

0811.3505	the origin of abundance gradients in the milky way: the predictions of  different models	we aim at studying the abundance gradients along the galactic disk and theirdependence upon several parameters: a threshold in the surface gas densityregulating star formation, the star formation efficiency, the timescale for theformation of the thin disk and the total surface mass density of the stellarhalo. we test a model which considers a cosmological infall law. this law doesnot predict an inside-out disk formation, but it allows to well fit theproperties of the solar vicinity. we study several cases. we find that toreproduce at the same time the abundance, star formation rate and surface gasdensity gradients along the galactic disk it is necessary to assume aninside-out formation for the disk. the threshold in the gas density is notnecessary and the same effect could be reached by assuming a variable starformation efficiency. a cosmologically derived infall law with an inside-outprocess for the disk formation and a variable star formation efficiency canindeed well reproduce all the properties of the disk. however, the cosmologicalmodel presented here does not have sufficient resolution to capture therequested inside-out formation for the disk.
