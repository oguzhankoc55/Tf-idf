0903.2140	lossless astronomical image compression and the effects of noise	we compare a variety of lossless image compression methods on a large sampleof astronomical images and show how the compression ratios and speeds of thealgorithms are affected by the amount of noise in the images. in the ideal casewhere the image pixel values have a random gaussian distribution, theequivalent number of uncompressible noise bits per pixel is given by nbits=log2(sigma * sqrt(12)) and the lossless compression ratio is given by r =bitpix / nbits + k where bitpix is the bit length of the pixel values and k isa measure of the efficiency of the compression algorithm.  we perform image compression tests on a large sample of integer astronomicalccd images using the gzip compression program and using a newer fitstiled-image compression method that currently supports 4 compressionalgorithms: rice, hcompress, plio, and gzip. overall, the rice compressionalgorithm strikes the best balance of compression and computational efficiency;it is 2--3 times faster and produces about 1.4 times greater compression thangzip. the rice algorithm produces 75%--90% (depending on the amount of noise inthe image) as much compression as an ideal algorithm with k = 0.  the image compression and uncompression utility programs used in this study(called fpack and funpack) are publicly available from the heasarc web site. asimple command-line interface may be used to compress or uncompress any fitsimage file.

0907.1081	faint, evolving radio agn in sdss luminous red galaxies	we detect and study the properties of faint radio agn in luminous redgalaxies (lrgs). the lrg sample comprises 760,000 objects from a catalog of lrgphotometric redshifts constructed from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)imaging data, and 65,000 lrgs from the sdss spectroscopic sample. thesegalaxies have typical 1.4 ghz flux densities in the 10s-100s of microjy, withthe contribution from a low-luminosity agn dominating any contribution fromstar formation. to probe the radio properties of such faint objects, we employa stacking technique whereby first survey image cutouts at each optical lrgposition are sorted by the parameter of interest and median-combined withinbins. we find that median radio luminosity scales with optical luminosity(l_opt) as l_1.4 ghz ~ l_opt^(beta), where beta appears to decrease from beta ~1 at z = 0.4 to beta ~ 0 at z = 0.7, a result which could be indicative of agncosmic downsizing. we also find that the overall lrg population, which isdominated by low-luminosity agn, experiences significant cosmic evolutionbetween z = 0.2 and z = 0.7. this implies a considerable increase in total agnheating for these massive ellipticals with redshift. by matching against thefirst catalog, we investigate the incidence and properties of lrgs associatedwith double-lobed (fr i/ii) radio galaxies.

0909.1082	stellar masses of lyman break galaxies, lyman alpha emitters and radio  galaxies in overdense regions at z=4-6	we present new information on galaxies in the vicinity of luminous radiogalaxies and quasars at z=4,5,6. these fields were previously found to containoverdensities of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) or spectroscopic lyman alphaemitters. we use hst and spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast ourresults with large samples of lbgs in more average environments as probed bythe great observatories origins deep survey (goods). the following results wereobtained. first, lbgs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lieon a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.this is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[m*/msun] = 9-11) inwhich galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their starformation rate (sfr) increases. second, the two radio galaxies are among themost massive objects (log[m*/msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and areextremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimatedfrom the ~25x larger area goods survey. we suggest that the presence of thesemassive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapidaccretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. third, the total stellarmass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' tn1338 accounts for &lt;30% of the stellarmass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z&gt;4, based on acomparison with the massive x-ray cluster cl1252 at z=1.2. although futurenear-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies arecurrently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference isthat tn1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than cl1252. this raises theinteresting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z&gt;4remain yet to be discovered.

0704.2074	star-formation in low radio luminosity agn from the sloan digital sky  survey	we investigate faint radio emission from low- to high-luminosity activegalactic nuclei (agn) selected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). theirradio properties are inferred by co-adding large ensembles of radio imagecut-outs from the first survey, as almost all of the sources are individuallyundetected. we correlate the median radio flux densities against a range ofother sample properties, including median values for redshift, [oiii]luminosity, emission line ratios, and the strength of the 4000a break. wedetect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formationto have excess radio emission beyond the ~10^28 ergs/s/hz level found forsources without any discernible star-formation. furthermore, this additionalradio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000a break in theoptical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-formingcomponent. we examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emissionline ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that havecharacteristic agn ratios. this division also separates the mechanismresponsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. agn). for both cases wefind a strong, almost identical, correlation between [oiii] and radioluminosity, with the agn sample extending toward lower, and the star-formationsample toward higher luminosities. a clearer separation between the twosubsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the hostgalaxy. for systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, thestar-formation subsample is brighter than the agn in the radio by an order ofmagnitude. this underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-formingsystems can dominate the emission associated with the agn.

1007.1179	optimal compression of floating-point astronomical images without  significant loss of information	we describe a compression method for floating-point astronomical images thatgives compression ratios of 6 -- 10 while still preserving the scientificallyimportant information in the image. the pixel values are first preprocessed byquantizing them into scaled integer intensity levels, which removes some of theuncompressible noise in the image. the integers are then losslessly compressedusing the fast and efficient rice algorithm and stored in a portable fitsformat file. quantizing an image more coarsely gives greater image compression,but it also increases the noise and degrades the precision of the photometricand astrometric measurements in the quantized image. dithering the pixel valuesduring the quantization process can greatly improve the precision ofmeasurements in the images. this is especially important if the analysisalgorithm relies on the mode or the median which would be similarly quantizedif the pixel values are not dithered. we perform a series of experiments onboth synthetic and real astronomical ccd images to quantitatively demonstratethat the magnitudes and positions of stars in the quantized images can bemeasured with the predicted amount of precision. in order to encourage wideruse of these image compression methods, we have made available a pair ofgeneral-purpose image compression programs, called fpack and funpack, which canbe used to compress any fits format image.

1010.3728	implications of dramatic broad absorption line variability in the quasar  fbqs j1408+3054	we have observed a dramatic change in the spectrum of the formerly heavilyabsorbed `overlapping-trough' iron low-ionization broad absorption line(felobal) quasar fbqs j1408+3054. over a time span of between 0.6 to 5rest-frame years, the mg ii trough outflowing at 12,000 km/s decreased inequivalent width by a factor of two and the fe ii troughs at the same velocitydisappeared. the most likely explanation for the variability is that astructure in the bal outflow moved out of our line of sight to the ultravioletcontinuum emitting region of the quasar's accretion disk. given the size ofthat region, this structure must have a transverse velocity of between 2600km/s and 22,000 km/s. in the context of a simple outflow model, we show thatthis bal structure is located between approximately 5800 and 46,000schwarzschild radii from the black hole. that distance corresponds to 1.7 to 14pc, 11 to 88 times farther from the black hole than the h-beta broad-lineregion. the high velocities and the parsec-scale distance for at least this onefelobal outflow mean that not all felobal outflows can be associated withgalaxy-scale outflows in ultraluminous infrared galaxies transitioning tounobscured quasars. the change of fbqs j1408+3054 from an felobal to a lobalquasar also means that if (some) felobal quasars have multiwavelengthproperties which distinguish them from hibal quasars, then some lobal quasarswill share those properties. finally, we extend previous work on howmultiple-epoch spectroscopy of bal and non-bal quasars can be used to constrainthe average lifetime of bal episodes (currently &gt;60 rest-frame years at 90%confidence).

1103.0259	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. ii. masses and ages of early-type galaxies  in different environments and their dependence on stellar population model  assumptions	we have derived masses and ages for 79 early-type galaxies (etgs) indifferent environments at z~1.3 in the lynx supercluster and in the goods/cdf-sfield using multiwavelength (0.6-4.5 $\mu$m; kpno, palomar, keck, hst, spitzer)datasets. at this redshift the contribution of the tp-agb phase is importantfor etgs, and the mass and age estimates depend on the choice of the stellarpopulation model used in the spectral energy distribution fits. we describe indetail the differences among model predictions for a large range of galaxyages, showing the dependence of these differences on age. current models stillyield large uncertainties. while recent models from maraston and charlot &amp;bruzual offer better modeling of the tp-agb phase with respect to less recentbruzual &amp; charlot models, their predictions do not often match. the modeling ofthis tp-agb phase has a significant impact on the derived parameters forgalaxies observed at high-redshift. some of our results do not depend on thechoice of the model: for all models, the most massive galaxies are the oldestones, independent of the environment. when using maraston and charlot &amp; bruzualmodels, the mass distribution is similar in the clusters and in the groups,whereas in our field sample there is a deficit of massive (m $\gtrsim$ 10^11msun) etgs. according to those last models, etgs belonging to the clusterenvironment host on average older stars with respect to group and fieldpopulations. this difference is less significant than the age difference ingalaxies of different masses.

1103.0265	early-type galaxies at z ~ 1.3. iii. on the dependence of formation  epochs and star formation histories on stellar mass and environment	we study the environmental dependence of stellar population properties at z ~1.3. we derive galaxy properties (stellar masses, ages and star formationhistories) for samples of massive, red, passive early-type galaxies in twohigh-redshift clusters, rxj0849+4452 and rxj0848+4453 (with redshifts of z =1.26 and 1.27, respectively), and compare them with those measured for therdcs1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 and with those measured for a similarlymass-selected sample of field contemporaries drawn from the goods-south field.robust estimates of the aforementioned parameters have been obtained bycomparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with extensive8-10 band photometric coverage, from the rest-frame far-ultraviolet to theinfrared. we find no variations of the overall stellar population propertiesamong the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. however, whencomparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, evenif the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxymass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their finalmass. we find that, approximately 1 gyr after the onset of star formation, themajority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (&gt; 80%) of theirfinal mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field etgs have. thus weconclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, theenvironment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories.

1103.5749	high-resolution vla imaging of sdss stripe 82 at 1.4 ghz	we present a high-resolution radio survey of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) southern equatorial stripe, a.k.a. stripe 82. this 1.4 ghz survey wasconducted with the very large array (vla) primarily in the a-configuration,with supplemental b-configuration data to increase sensitivity to extendedstructure. the survey has an angular resolution of 1.8" and achieves a medianrms noise of 52 microjy/bm over 92 deg^2. this is the deepest 1.4 ghz survey toachieve this large of an area, filling a gap in the phase space between small,deep and large, shallow surveys. it also serves as a pilot project for a largerhigh-resolution survey with the expanded very large array (evla). we discussthe technical design of the survey and details of the observations, and weoutline our method for data reduction. we present a catalog of 17,969 isolatedradio components, for an overall source density of ~195 sources/deg^2. theastrometric accuracy of the data is excellent, with an internal check utilizingmultiply-observed sources yielding an rms scatter of 0.19" in both rightascension and declination. a comparison to the sdss dr7 quasar catalog furtherconfirms that the astrometry is well tied to the optical reference frame, withmean offsets of 0.02" +/- 0.01" in right ascension, and 0.01" +/- 0.02" indeclination. a check of our photometry reveals a small, negative clean-likebias on the level of 35 microjy. we report on the catalog completeness, findingthat 97% of first-detected quasars are recovered in the new stripe 82 radiocatalog, while faint, extended sources are more likely to be resolved out bythe resolution bias. we conclude with a discussion of the optical counterpartsto the catalog sources, including 76 newly-detected radio quasars. the fullcatalog as well as a search page and cutout server are available online athttp://third.ucllnl.org/cgi-bin/stripe82cutout.

1109.0284	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. iv. scaling relations in different  environments	we present the kormendy and mass-size relations for early-type galaxies(etgs) as a function of environment at z~1.3. our sample includes 76 visuallyclassified etgs with masses 10^10 &lt; m/msun &lt; 10^11.5, selected in the lynxsupercluster and in the goods/cdf-s field, 31 etgs in clusters, 18 in groupsand 27 in the field, all with multi-wavelength photometry and hst/acsobservations. the kormendy relation, in place at z~1.3, does not depend on theenvironment. the mass-size relation reveals that etgs overall appear to be morecompact in denser environments: cluster etgs have sizes on average around30-50% smaller than those of the local universe, and a distribution with asmaller scatter, whereas field etgs show a mass-size relation with a similardistribution than the local one. our results imply that (1) the mass-sizerelation in the field did not evolve overall from z ~ 1.3 to present; this isinteresting and in contrast to the trend found at higher masses from previousworks; (2) in denser environments, either etgs have increased their size by30-50%, on average, and spread their distributions, or more etgs have beenformed within the dense environment from not etg progenitors or larger galaxieshave been accreted to a pristine compact population to reproduce the mass-sizerelation observed in the local universe. our results are driven by galaxieswith masses m&lt;2*10^11msun and those with masses m~10^11msun follow the sametrends that the entire sample. following valentinuzzi et al. definition ofsuperdense etgs, around 35-45% of our cluster sample is made of superdenseetgs.

0710.5560	principal component analysis of the time- and position-dependent point  spread function of the advanced camera for surveys	we describe the time- and position-dependent point spread function (psf)variation of the wide field channel (wfc) of the advanced camera for surveys(acs) with the principal component analysis (pca) technique. the time-dependentchange is caused by the temporal variation of the $hst$ focus whereas theposition-dependent psf variation in acs/wfc at a given focus is mainly theresult of changes in aberrations and charge diffusion across the detector,which appear as position-dependent changes in elongation of the astigmatic coreand blurring of the psf, respectively. using &gt;400 archival images of starcluster fields, we construct a acs psf library covering diverse environments ofthe $hst$ observations (e.g., focus values). we find that interpolation of asmall number ($\sim20$) of principal components or ``eigen-psfs'' per exposurecan robustly reproduce the observed variation of the ellipticity and size ofthe psf. our primary interest in this investigation is the application of thispsf library to precision weak-lensing analyses, where accurate knowledge of theinstrument's psf is crucial. however, the high-fidelity of the model judgedfrom the nice agreement with observed psfs suggests that the model ispotentially also useful in other applications such as crowded field stellarphotometry, galaxy profile fitting, agn studies, etc., which similarly demand afair knowledge of the psfs at objects' locations. our psf models, applicable toany wfc image rectified with the lanczos3 kernel, are publicly available.

0802.2506	discovery of a very bright strongly-lensed galaxy candidate at z ~ 7.6	using hst and spitzer irac imaging, we report the discovery of a very brightstrongly lensed lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidate at z~7.6 in the field of themassive galaxy cluster abell 1689. the galaxy candidate, which we refer to asa1689-zd1, shows a strong z-j break of at least 2.2 mag and is completelyundetected (&lt;1 sigma) in hst/acs g, r, i, and z-band data. these properties,combined with the very blue j-h and h-[4.5] colors, are exactly the propertiesof an z~7.6 lbg and can only be reasonably fit by a star-forming galaxy atz=7.6 +/- 0.4. attempts to reproduce these properties with a model galaxy atz&lt;4 yield particularly poor fits. a1689-zd1 has an observed (lensed) magnitudeof 24.7 ab (8 sigma) in the nicmos h band and is ~1.3 mag brighter than thebrightest-known z-dropout galaxy. when corrected for the cluster magnificationof 9.3 at z~7.6, the candidate has an intrinsic magnitude of h=27.1 ab, orabout an l* galaxy at z~7.6. the source-plane deprojection shows that the starformation is occurring in compact knots of size ~&lt;300 pc. the best-fit stellarpopulation synthesis models yield a median redshift of 7.6, stellar masses(1.6-3.9) x 10^9 m_sun, stellar ages 45-320 myr, star-formation rates ~&lt;7.6m_sun/yr, and low reddening with a_v &lt;= 0.3. these properties are generallysimilar to those of lbgs found at z~5-6. the inferred stellar ages suggest aformation redshift of z~8-10 (t~&lt;0.63 gyr). a1689-zd1 is the brightestobserved, highly reliable z&gt;7.0 galaxy candidate found to date.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

0806.3986	radio detection of radio-quiet galaxies	we investigate the radio emission of ~185,000 quiescent (opticallyunclassifiable) galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). bymedian-stacking first cutouts centered on the optically-selected sources, weare able to reach flux densities down to the 10s of microjy. the quiescentgalaxy sample is composed of two subgroups inhabiting vastly different regimes:those targeted for the sdss main galaxy sample (~55%), and those targeted forthe luminous red galaxy (lrg) sample (~45%). to investigate the star-formationrates (sfrs) of these quiescent galaxies, we calibrate a radio-sfr conversionusing a third sample of star-forming galaxies. comparing this sfr-indicatorwith indicators in the optical and uv, we derive conflicting sfr estimates forthe main sample quiescent galaxies. these radio-derived sfrs intersect thosecalculated using the 4000-angstrom break (d4000) around an sfr of 1 msun/yr andagree to within a factor of 3 over the range of sfrs. however, we find that theradio-derived sfrs are too high relative to the sfrs estimated for similarpopulations of galaxies using analysis of uv emission, implying eithercontamination of the radio by active galactic nuclei (agn) or incomplete dustmodeling. if agn activity is dominant in these galaxies, then a relationbetween agn radio luminosity and galaxy mass is required to explain theobserved trends. for the lrgs, on the other hand, we find the radio luminosityto be independent of sfr as derived from d4000, indicating an agn componentdominates their radio emission. agn-based radio emission often implies theexistence of radio jets, providing evidence of a mechanism for low-levelfeedback in these quiescent lrgs.

astro-ph;0005247	five high-redshift quasars discovered in commissioning imaging data of  the sloan digital sky survey	we report the discovery of five quasars with redshifts of 4.67 - 5.27 andz'-band magnitudes of 19.5-20.7 m_b ~ -27. all were originally selected asdistant quasar candidates in optical/near-infrared photometry from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), and most were confirmed as probable high-redshiftquasars by supplementing the sdss data with j and k measurements. the quasarspossess strong, broad lyman-alpha emission lines, with the characteristic sharpcutoff on the blue side produced by lyman-alpha forest absorption. threequasars contain strong, broad absorption features, and one of them exhibitsvery strong n v emission. the amount of absorption produced by the lyman-alphaforest increases toward higher redshift, and that in the z=5.27 object (d_a ~0.7) is consistent with a smooth extrapolation of the absorption seen in lowerredshift quasars. the high luminosity of these objects relative to most otherknown objects at z &gt;~ 5 makes them potentially valuable as probes of earlyquasar properties and of the intervening intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0008123	high-redshift quasars found in sloan digital sky survey commissioning  data iv: luminosity function from the fall equatorial stripe sampl	this is the fourth paper in a series aimed at finding high-redshift quasarsfrom five-color imaging data taken along the celestial equator by the sdss.during its commissioning phase. in this paper, we use the color-selected sampleof 39 luminous high-redshift quasars presented in paper iii to derive theevolution of the quasar luminosity function over the range of 3.6&lt;z&lt;5.0, and-27.5&lt;m_1450&lt;-25.5 (omega=1, h_0=50 km s^-1 mpc^-1). we use the selectionfunction derived in paper iii to correct for sample incompleteness. theluminosity function is estimated using three different methods: (1) the 1/v_aestimator; (2) a maximum likelihood solution, assuming that the density ofquasars depends exponentially on redshift and as a power law in luminosity and(3) lynden-bell's non-parametric c^- estimator. all three methods giveconsistent results. the luminous quasar density decreases by a factor of ~ 6from z=3.5 to z=5.0, consistent with the decline seen from several previousoptical surveys at z&lt;4.5. the luminosity function follows psi(l) ~ l^{-2.5} forz~4 at the bright end, significantly flatter than the bright end luminosityfunction psi(l) \propto l^{-3.5} found in previous studies for z&lt;3, suggestingthat the shape of the quasar luminosity function evolves with redshift as well,and that the quasar evolution from z=2 to 5 cannot be described as pureluminosity evolution. possible selection biases and the effect of dustextinction on the redshift evolution of the quasar density are also discussed.

astro-ph;0103087	the radio-luminosity - black hole mass correlation for quasars from the  first bright quasar survey, and a ``unification scheme'' for radio-loud and  radio-quiet quasars	several independent lines of evidence now point to a correlation betweenblack hole mass, m_bh, and radio-luminosity. in this paper we discuss thecorrelation for quasars from the first bright quasar survey (fbqs), using blackhole mass estimates from hbeta linewidths. the fbqs objects fill in the gapbetween the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars in the radio-luminosity -optical-luminosity plane, and we find that they fill the corresponding gap inthe m_bh - radio luminosity correlation. there is thus a continuous variationof radio luminosity with m_bh, and no evidence for a ``switch'' at some set ofcritical parameter values which turns on powerful radio jets. by combining thefbqs data with that for quasars from the palomar-green survey we find evidencefor a dependence of radio-luminosity on accretion rate relative to theeddington limit, l/l_edd, as well as on m_bh, consistent with the well-knownradio-optical correlation for radio-loud quasars. we therefore suggest a newscheme to ``unify'' radio-loud and radio-quiet objects in which radioluminosity scales proportional to m_bh^{1.9+/-0.2}(l/l_edd)^{1.0} forl/l_edd~0.1, with an apparently weaker accretion rate dependence at lowl/l_edd. the scatter about this relation is +/-1.1 dex, and may well hidesignificant contributions from other physical effects, such as black hole spinand radio source environment.

astro-ph;0203065	the reddest quasars ii. a gravitationally-lensed felobal quasar	we report the discovery of a z=2.65 low-ionization iron broad absorption linequasar, first j100424.9+122922, which is gravitationally-lensed by a galaxy atz~0.95. the object was discovered as part of a program to find very red quasarsby matching the first radio survey with the 2-mass near-infrared survey.j100424.9+122922 is the second lensed system to be found in this program,suggesting that many gravitational lenses are probably missed from conventionaloptical quasar surveys. we have made a simple lens model and a rough estimateof the reddening in the immediate environment of the quasar which suggests thatthe quasar is intrinsically very luminous and is accreting at close to theeddington limit of its ~10^9 m_sun black hole. the lensing galaxy has a smallamount of dust which is responsible for some excess reddening observed in thefainter image of the quasar, but is otherwise a fairly typical massiveelliptical galaxy. we model the selection effects working against the detectionof red quasars in both lensed and unlensed samples. we show that theseselection effects are very effective at removing even lightly-reddened highredshift quasars from magnitude-limited samples, whether they are lensed ornot. this suggests that the red quasar population in general could be verylarge, and in particular the class of iron broad absorption line quasars ofwhich j100424.9+122922 is a member may be much larger than their rarity inmagnitude-limited samples would suggest.

astro-ph;0210407	automated object classification with classx	classx is a project aimed at creating an automated system to classify x-raysources and is envisaged as a prototype of the virtual observatory. as asystem, classx integrates into a pipeline a network of classifiers and anengine that searches and retrieves for a given target multi-wavelengthcounterparts from the worldwide data storage media. it applies machine learningmethods to `train' different classifiers using different `training' data sets.in classx, each classifier can make its own class (object type) assignment andis optimized for handling different tasks and/or different object types. a userwould generally select a certain classifier to make, for instance, a mostcomplete list of candidate qsos, but a different classifier would be used tomake a most reliable list of candidate qsos. still different classifiers wouldbe selected to make similar lists for other object types. along with the classname assignment, a network classifier outputs the probability for a source tobelong to the assigned class as well as probabilities that the source belongsin fact to other classes. we illustrate the current capabilities of classx andthe concept of a classifiers network with the results obtained with classifierstrained using rosat data. ~

astro-ph;0211371	advanced camera for surveys observations of young star clusters in the  interacting galaxy ugc 10214	we present the first advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of youngstar clusters in the colliding/merging galaxy ugc 10214. the observations weremade as part of the early release observation (ero) program for the newlyinstalled acs during service mission sm3b for the hubble space telescope (hst).many young star clusters can be identified in the tails of ugc 10214, with agesranging from ~3 myr to 10 myr. the extreme blue v-i (f606w-f814w) colors of thestar clusters found in the tail of ugc 10214 can only be explained if strongemission lines are included with a young stellar population. this has beenconfirmed by our keck spectroscopy of some of these bright blue stellar knots.the most luminous and largest of these blue knots has an absolute magnitude ofm_v = -14.45, with a half-light radius of 161 pc, and if it is a single starcluster, would qualify as a super star cluster (ssc). alternatively, it couldbe a superposition of multiple scaled ob associations or clusters. with anestimated age of ~ 4-5 myr, its derived mass is &lt; 1.3 x 10^6 solar masses. thusthe young stellar knot is unbound and will not evolve into a normal globularcluster. the bright blue clusters and associations are much younger than thedynamical age of the tail, providing strong evidence that star formation occursin the tail long after it was ejected. ugc 10214 provides a nearby example ofprocesses that contributed to the formation of halos and intra-cluster media inthe distant and younger universe.

astro-ph;0302402	discovery of two distant type ia supernovae in the hubble deep field  north with the advanced camera for surveys	we present observations of the first two supernovae discovered with therecently installed advanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble spacetelescope. the supernovae were found in wide field camera images of the hubbledeep field north taken with the f775w, f850lp, and g800l optical elements aspart of the acs guaranteed time observation program. spectra extracted from theacs g800l grism exposures confirm that the objects are type ia supernovae (sneia) at redshifts z=0.47 and z=0.95. follow-up hst observations have beenconducted with acs in f775w and f850lp and with nicmos in the near-infraredf110w bandpass, yielding a total of 9 flux measurements in the 3 bandpassesover a period of 50 days in the observed frame. we discuss many of theimportant issues in doing accurate photometry with the acs. we analyze themulti-band light curves using two different fitting methods to calibrate thesupernovae luminosities and place them on the sne ia hubble diagram. theresulting distances are consistent with the redshift-distance relation of theaccelerating universe model, although evolving intergalactic grey dust remainsas a less likely possibility. the relative ease with which these sne ia werefound, confirmed, and monitored demonstrates the potential acs holds forrevolutionizing the field of high-redshift sne ia, and therefore of testing theaccelerating universe cosmology and constraining the "epoch of deceleration".

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0309036	advanced camera for surveys photometry of the cluster rdcs1252.9-2927:  the color-magnitude relation at z=1.24	we investigate the color-magnitude (cm) relation of galaxies in the distantx-ray selected cluster rdcs1252.9-2927 at z=1.24 using images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope in the f775wand f850lp bandpasses. we select galaxies based on morphologicalclassifications extending about 3.5 mag down the galaxy luminosity function,augmented by spectroscopic membership information. at the core of the clusteris an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair ofgalaxies that show signs of dynamical interaction. the early-type populationdefines a tight sequence in the cm diagram, with an intrinsic scatter inobserved (i-z) of $0.029\pm0.007$ mag based on 52 galaxies, or $0.024\pm0.008$mag for $\sim30$ ellipticals. simulations using the latest stellar populationmodels indicate an age scatter for the ellipticals of about 34%, with a meanage $\taul\gta2.6$ gyr (corresponding to $z_l\gta2.7$), and the last starformation occurring at $z_{end}\gta1.5$. transforming to rest-frame $(u-b)$, weconclude that the slope and scatter in the cm relation for morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies show little or no evidence for evolution out to$z\approx1.2$. thus, elliptical galaxies were already well established in x-rayluminous clusters when the universe was a third of its present age.

astro-ph;0311323	discovery of globular clusters in the proto-spiral ngc2915: implications  for hierarchical galaxy evolution	we have discovered three globular clusters beyond the holmberg radius inhubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys images of the gas-rich darkmatter dominated blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc2915. the clusters, all of whichstart to resolve into stars, have m_{v606} = -8.9 to -9.8 mag, significantlybrighter than the peak of the luminosity function of milky way globularclusters. their colors suggest a metallicity [fe/h] ~ -1.9 dex, typical ofmetal-poor galactic globular clusters. the specific frequency of clusters is ata minimum normal, compared to spiral galaxies. however, since only a smallportion of the system has been surveyed it is more likely that the luminosityand mass normalized cluster content is higher, like that seen in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters. this suggests that ngc2915 resembles a key phasein the early hierarchical assembly of galaxies - the epoch when much of the oldstellar population has formed, but little of the stellar disk. depending on thesubsequent interaction history, such systems could go on to build-up largerelliptical galaxies, evolve into normal spirals, or in rare circumstancesremain suspended in their development to become systems like ngc2915.

astro-ph;0402117	optical properties of faint first variable radio sources	a sample of 123 radio sources that exhibit significant variations at 1.4 ghzon a seven year base-line has been created using first vla b-array data from1995 and 2002 on a strip at dec=0 near the south galactic cap. this samplespans the range of radio flux densities from ~2 to 1000 mjy. it presents bothin size and radio flux density range a unique starting point for variabilitystudies of galaxies and quasars harboring lower luminosity active galacticnuclei (agn). we find, by comparing our variable and non-variable controlsamples to the sloan digital sky survey the following: 1) the quasar fractionof both the variable and non-variable samples declines as a function ofdeclining radio flux density levels; 2) our variable sample contains aconsistently higher fraction of quasars than the non-variable control sample,irrespective of radio flux; 3) the variable sources are almost twice as likelyto be retrieved from the optical sdss data than the non-variable ones; 4) basedon relative numbers, we estimate that quasars are about five times more likelyto harbor a variable radio source than are galaxies; and 5) there does notappear to be any significant optical color offset between the two samples, eventhough the suggestive trend for sources to be bluer when variable has beendetected before and may be real. this leads us to conclude that both radiovariability and radio flux density levels, in combination with accurate opticalinformation, are important discriminators in the study of (radio) variabilityof galaxies. the latter start to dominate the source counts below about 20 mjy.in any case, variability appears to be an intrinsic property of radio sources,and is not limited to quasars. radio variability at low flux density levels mayoffer a unique tool in agn unification studies.

astro-ph;0406613	ultra compact dwarf galaxies in abell 1689: a photometric study with the  acs	the properties of ultra compact dwarf (ucd) galaxy candidates in abell 1689(z=0.183) are investigated, based on deep high resolution acs images. a ucdcandidate has to be unresolved, have i&lt;28 (m_v&lt;-11.5) mag and satisfy colorlimits derived from bayesian photometric redshifts. we find 160 ucd candidateswith 22&lt;i&lt;28 mag. it is estimated that about 100 of these are cluster members,based on their spatial distribution and photometric redshifts. for i&gt;26.8 mag,the radial and luminosity distribution of the ucd candidates can be explainedwell by abell 1689's globular cluster (gc) system. for i&lt;26.8 mag, there is anoverpopulation of 15 +/- 5 ucd candidates with respect to the gc luminosityfunction. for i&lt;26 mag, the radial distribution of ucd candidates is moreconsistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the gc system of abell1689. the ucd candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar tothat of abell 1689's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter byabout 2-3 mag. two of the three brightest ucd candidates (m_v ~ -17 mag) areslightly resolved. at the distance of abell 1689, these two objects would haveking-profile core radii of ~35 pc and r_eff ~300 pc, implying luminosities andsizes 2-3 times those of m32's bulge. additional photometric redshifts obtainedwith late type stellar and elliptical galaxy templates support the assignmentof these two resolved sources to abell 1689. our findings imply that in abell1689 there are at least 10 ucds with m_v&lt;-12.7 mag. compared to the ucds in thefornax cluster they are brighter, larger and have colors closer to normal dwarfgalaxies. this suggests that they may be in an intermediate stage of thestripping process. spectroscopy is needed to definitely confirm the existenceof ucds in abell 1689.

astro-ph;0407644	the luminosity function of early-type galaxies at z~0.75	we measure the luminosity function of morphologically selected e/s0 galaxiesfrom $z=0.5$ to $z=1.0$ using deep high resolution advanced camera for surveysimaging data. our analysis covers an area of $48\box\arcmin$ (8$\times$ thearea of the hdf-n) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ($i\sim24$ mag) than waspossible in the deep groth strip survey (dgss). at $0.5&lt;z&lt;0.75$, we find$m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.1\pm0.3$ and $\alpha=-0.53\pm0.2$, and at$0.75&lt;z&lt;1.0$, we find $m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.4\pm0.2$. these luminosityfunctions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosityfunction using morphological selection (e.g., dgss), but are much steeper thanthe luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies likethe color or spectral energy distribution (e.g., cfrs, cadis, or combo-17). thedifference is due to the `blue', $(u-v)_0&lt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies, which make up to$\sim30%$ of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faintgalaxies. we thereby demonstrate the need for {\it both morphological andstructural information} to constrain the evolution of galaxies.  we find that the `blue' e/s0 galaxies have the same average sizes and sersicparameters as the `red', $(u-v)_0&gt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies at brighter luminosities($m_b&lt;-20.1$), but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where`blue' galaxies are both smaller and have lower sersic parameters. fits of thecolors to stellar population models suggest that most e/s0 galaxies have shortstar-formation time scales ($\tau&lt;1$ gyr), and that galaxies have formed at anincreasing rate from $z\sim8$ until $z\sim2$ after which there has been agradual decline.

astro-ph;0408165	the evolutionary status of clusters of galaxies at z ~ 1	combined hst, x-ray, and ground-based optical studies show that clusters ofgalaxies are largely "in place" by $z \sim 1$, an epoch when the universe wasless than half its present age. high resolution images show that elliptical,s0, and spiral galaxies are present in clusters at redshifts up to $z \sim1.3$. analysis of the cmds suggest that the cluster ellipticals formed theirstars several gyr earlier, near redshift 3. the morphology--density relation iswell established at $z\sim1$, with star-forming spirals and irregulars residingmostly in the outer parts of the clusters and e/s0s concentrated in denseclumps. the intracluster medium has already reached the metallicity ofpresent-day clusters. the distributions of the hot gas and early-type galaxiesare similar in $z\sim1$ clusters, indicating both have largely virialized inthe deepest potentials wells. in spite of the many similarities between$z\sim1$ and present-day clusters, there are significant differences. themorphologies revealed by the hot gas, and particularly the early-type galaxies,are elongated rather than spherical. we appear to be observing the clusters atan epoch when the sub-clusters and groups are still assembling into a singleregular cluster. support for this picture comes from cl0152 where the gasappears to be lagging behind the luminous and dark mass in two mergingsub-components. moreover, the luminosity difference between the first andsecond brightest cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$ is smaller than in 93% ofpresent-day abell clusters, which suggests that considerable luminosityevolution through merging has occurred since that epoch. evolution is also seenin the bolometric x-ray luminosity function.

astro-ph;0411348	structure function analysis of long term quasar variability	in our second paper on long-term quasar variability, we employ a much largerdatabase of quasars than in de vries, becker &amp; white. this expanded sample,containing 35165 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey data release 2, and6413 additional quasars in the same area of the sky taken from the 2df qsoredshift survey, allows us to significantly improve on our earlier conclusions.as before, all the historic quasar photometry has been calibrated onto the sdssscale by using large numbers of calibration stars around each quasar position.we find the following: (1) the outbursts have an asymmetric light-curveprofile, with a fast-rise, slow-decline shape; this argues against a scenarioin which micro-lensing events along the line-of-sight to the quasars aredominating the long-term variations in quasars; (2) there is no turnover in thestructure function of the quasars up to time-scales of ~40 years, and theincrease in variability with increasing time-lags is monotonic and constant;and consequently, (3) there is not a single preferred characteristic outbursttime-scale for the quasars, but most likely a continuum of outbursttime-scales, (4) the magnitude of the quasar variability is a function ofwavelength: variability increases toward the blue part of the spectrum, (5)high-luminosity quasars vary less than low-luminosity quasars, consistent witha scenario in which variations have limited absolute magnitude. based on this,we conclude that quasar variability is intrinsic to the active galacticnucleus, is caused by chromatic outbursts / flares with a limited luminosityrange and varying time-scales, and which have an overall asymmetric light-curveshape. currently the model that has the most promise of fitting theobservations is based on accretion disk instabilities.

astro-ph;0501150	hst/acs weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster rdcs 1252.9-2927 at  z=1.24	we present a weak lensing analysis of one of the most distant massive galaxycluster known, rdcs 1252.9-2927 at z=1.24, using deep images from the advancedcamera for survey (acs) on board the hubble space telescope (hst). by takingadvantage of the depth and of the angular resolution of the acs images, wedetect for the first time at z&gt;1 a clear weak lensing signal in both the i(f775w) and z (f850lp) filters. we measure a 5-\sigma signal in the i band anda 3-\sigma signal in the shallower z band image. the two radial mass profilesare found to be in very good agreement with each other, and provide ameasurement of the total mass of the cluster inside a 1mpc radius of m(&lt;1mpc) =(8.0 +/- 1.3) x 10^14 m_\odot in the current cosmological concordance model h=0.70, \omega_m=0.3, \omega_\lambda=0.7, assuming a redshift distribution ofbackground galaxies as inferred from the hubble deep fields surveys. a weaklensing signal is detected out to the boundary of our field (3' radius,corresponding to 1.5mpc at the cluster redshift). we detect a small offsetbetween the centroid of the weak lensing mass map and the brightest clustergalaxy, and we discuss the possible origin of this discrepancy. the cumulativeweak lensing radial mass profile is found to be in good agreement with thex-ray mass estimate based on chandr and xmm-newton observations, at least outto r_500=0.5mpc.

astro-ph;0503425	a new radio catalog of compact hii regions in the milky way ii. the 1.4  ghz data	we utilize a new vla galactic plane catalog at 1.4 ghz covering the first andsecond galactic quadrants (340 deg &lt;l&lt; 120 deg, |b|&lt;0.8 deg with |b|&lt; 1.8 degfor 350 deg &lt;l&lt; 40 deg and |b|&lt;2.5 deg for 100 deg &lt;l&lt;105 deg) in conjunctionwith the msx6c galactic plane mid-infrared catalog to supplement and betterunderstand our 5 ghz catalog (giveon et al. 2005). a radio catalog of thisregion was first published by zoonematkermani et al. (1990), but we havere-reduced the data with significantly improved calibration and mosaicingprocedures, resulting in more than a tripling of the number of 1.4 ghz sourcesdetected. comparison of the new 1.4 ghz catalog and the msx6c catalog resultedin a sample of 556 matches, out of which we estimate only 11 to be chancecoincidences. most of the matches show red msx colors. the scale height oftheir galactic latitude distribution is 24'-28' (fwhm) or ~60-70 pc (for adistance of 8.5 kpc), depending on longitude. the latitude distributionflattens out significantly above l~40 deg and the number of matches drops offsharply.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.

astro-ph;0508044	hst/acs weak-lensing and chandra x-ray studies of the high-redshift  cluster ms 1054-0321	we present hubble space telescope/advanced camera for surveys (acs)weak-lensing and chandra x-ray analyses of ms 1054-0321 at z=0.83, the mostdistant and x-ray luminous cluster in the einstein extended medium-sensitivitysurvey (emss). the high-resolution mass reconstruction through acs weak-lensingreveals the complicated dark matter substructure in unprecedented detail,characterized by the three dominant mass clumps with the four or more minorsatellite groups within the current acs field. the direct comparison of themass map with the chandra x-ray image shows that the eastern weak-lensingsubstructure is not present in the x-ray image and, more interestingly, the twox-ray peaks are displaced away from the hypothesized merging direction withrespect to the corresponding central and western mass clumps, possibly becauseof ram pressure. in addition, as observed in our previous weak-lensing study ofanother high-redshift cluster cl 0152-1357 at z=0.84, the two dark matterclumps of ms 1054-0321 seem to be offset from the galaxy counterparts. weexamine the significance of these offsets and discuss a possible scenario,wherein the dark matter clumps might be moving ahead of the cluster galaxies.the non-parametric weak-lensing mass modeling gives a projected mass of m(r&lt;1mpc)=(1.02+-0.15)x 10^{15} solar mass, where the uncertainty reflects both thestatistical error and the cosmic shear effects. our temperature measurement oft=8.9_{-0.8}^{+1.0} kev utilizing the newest available low-energy quantumefficiency degradation prescription for the chandra instrument, together withthe isothermal beta description of the cluster (r_c=16"+-15" andbeta=0.78+-0.08), yields a projected mass of m(r&lt;1 mpc)=(1.2+-0.2) x 10^{15}solar mass, consistent with the weak-lensing result.

astro-ph;0508534	discovery of radio emission from transient anomalous x-ray pulsar xte  j1810-197	we report the first detection of radio emission from any anomalous x-raypulsar (axp). data from the very large array (vla) magpis survey with angularresolution 6" reveals a point-source of flux density 4.5 +/- 0.5 mjy at 1.4 ghzat the precise location of the 5.54 s pulsar xte j1810-197. this is greaterthan upper limits from all other axps and from quiescent states of softgamma-ray repeaters (sgrs). the detection was made in 2004 january, 1 yearafter the discovery of xte j1810-197 during its only known outburst. additionalvla observations both before and after the outburst yield only upper limitsthat are comparable to or larger than the single detection, neither supportingnor ruling out a decaying radio afterglow related to the x-ray turn-on. anotherhypothesis is that, unlike the other axps and sgrs, xte j1810-197 may power aradio synchrotron nebula by the interaction of its particle wind with amoderately dense environment that was not evacuated by previous activity fromthis least luminous, in x-rays, of the known magnetars.

astro-ph;0510747	double lobed radio quasars from the sloan digital sky survey	we have combined a sample of 44984 quasars, selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data release 3, with the first radio survey. using a noveltechnique where the optical quasar position is matched to the complete radioenvironment within 450", we are able to characterize the radio morphologicalmake-up of what is essentially an optically selected quasar sample, regardlessof whether the quasar (nucleus) itself has been detected in the radio. about10% of the quasar population have radio cores brighter than 0.75 mjy at 1.4ghz, and 1.7% have double lobed fr2-like radio morphologies. about 75% of thefr2 sources have a radio core (&gt; 0.75 mjy). a significant fraction (~40%) ofthe fr2 quasars are bent by more than 10 degrees, indicating eitherinteractions of the radio plasma with the icm or igm. we found no evidence forcorrelations with redshift among our fr2 quasars: radio lobe flux densities andradio source diameters of the quasars have similar distributions at low (mean0.77) and high (mean 2.09) redshifts. using a smaller high reliability fr2sample of 422 quasars and two comparison samples of radio-quiet and non-fr2radio-loud quasars, matched in their redshift distributions, we constructedcomposite optical spectra from the sdss spectroscopic data. based on thesespectra we can conclude that the fr2 quasars have stronger high-ionizationemission lines compared to both the radio quiet and non-fr2 radio loud sources.this is consistent with the notion that the emission lines are brightened byongoing shock ionization of ambient gas in the quasar host as the radio sourceexpands.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.

astro-ph;0603548	improved constraints on the cosmological parameters using the vla first  survey	using the final version of the vla first survey (becker et al. 2003), theoptical sloan digital sky survey data release 3 (dr3) quasar list and a seriesof carefully selected criteria, we have defined the largest homogeneouspopulation of double-lobed sources. with the precise sample definition, theincreased depth and sensitivity of the survey data, the large size of thedataset, and our self-consistent method of analysis, which addresses many ofthe problems associated with previous work in the area, we are able to: a)explore the correlations between the intrinsic properties of the double-lobedradio sources (the results are also confirmed by a non-parametric analysis) andstudy their evolution, b) place more interesting and tighter constraints on thecosmological parameters, distinguish among the different cosmology models, anddetermine the impact of the angular size-redshift studies in cosmology, c)further our understanding of the behavior of the intergalactic medium (igm)density as a function of redshift and shed more light to the quasar-radiogalaxy unification issue.

astro-ph;9606176	the angular two-point correlation function for the first radio survey	the first (faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters) survey nowcovers 1550 square degrees of sky where $07^{h}16 &lt; \alpha &lt; 17^{h}40$ and$28^{\circ}.3 &lt; \delta &lt; 42^{\circ}$. this yields a catalog of 138,665 sourcesabove the survey threshold of 1 mjy, about one third of which are indouble-lobed and multi-component sources. we have used these data to obtain thefirst high-significance measurement of the two-point angular correlation for adeep radio sample. we find that the correlation function between $0.02^{\circ}$and $2^{\circ}$ is well fitted by a power law of the form $a\theta^{\gamma}$where $a\approx 3\times 10^{-3}$ and $\gamma\approx -1.1$. on small scales($\theta&lt;0.2^{\circ}$), double and multi-component sources are shown to have alarger clustering amplitude than that of the whole sample. sources with fluxdensities below 2 mjy are found to have a shallower slope than that obtainedfor the whole sample, consistent with there being a significant contributionfrom starbursting galaxies at these faint fluxes. the cross-correlation ofradio sources and abell clusters is determined. a preliminary approach toinferring spatial information is outlined.

astro-ph;9804333	a search for high-redshift quasars among gb/first flat-spectrum radio  sources	we present the method and first results of a survey for high-redshift (z&gt;3)radio-loud quasars, which is based on optical identifications of 2902flat-spectrum radio sources with s(5ghz)&gt;= 25mjy. the radio sample was definedover a 1600 sq degree region using the 5ghz green bank survey and the 1.4ghzvla first survey. 560 sources were identified to a limit of e=19.5 on apm scansof poss-i plates and 337 of these optical counterparts are unresolved. fromthese a complete sample of 73 optically red (o-e &gt;= 1.2) sources was definedfor spectroscopic follow up. we have obtained spectra for 36 of these and anadditional 14 had redshifts in the literature, thus 70% of the spectroscopicsample is completed. six objects in the sample were found to be radio-loudquasars with z&gt;3 of which two were previously known. the efficiency of thespectroscopic phase of the survey is therefore about 1 in 9. the six z&gt;3quasars were found in an effective area of 1100 square degrees, implying asurface density of one flat-spectrum z&gt;3 radio-loud quasar per 190 squaredegrees to limits of e=19.5 and s(5ghz)&gt;= 25mjy. this survey also produced thefirst known radio-loud bal quasar, 1556+3517 with z=1.48, which has beenreported in an earlier paper (becker et al 1997). in addition we have obtainedspectra of 22 gb/first sources which are not part of the complete sample. wegive positions, e (red) magnitudes, o-e colours, radio fluxes, radio spectralindex and redshifts where possible for objects for which we have obtainedspectra. we give spectra and finding charts for the z&gt;3 quasars.

astro-ph;9910099	first bent-double radio sources: tracers of high-redshift clusters	bent-double radio sources can act as tracers for clusters of galaxies. wepresent imaging and spectroscopic observations of the environments surroundingten of these sources (most of them wide angle tails (wats)) selected from thevla first survey. our results reveal a previously unknown cluster associatedwith eight of the radio sources with redshifts in the range 0.33 &lt; z &lt; 0.85;furthermore, we cannot rule out that the other two bent doubles may beassociated with clusters at higher redshift. richness measurements indicatethat these clusters are typical of the majority of those found in the abell(1958) catalog, with a range of abell richness classes from 0 to 2. theline-of-sight velocity dispersions are very different from cluster to cluster,ranging from approximately 300 to 1100 km/s. at the upper end of theseintervals, we may be sampling some of the highest-redshift massive clustersknown. alternatively, the large velocity dispersions measured in some of theclusters may indicate that they are merging systems with significantsubstructure, consistent with recent ideas concerning wat formation (burns etal. 1994).
