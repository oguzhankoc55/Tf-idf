0902.3671	imaging the cool gas, dust, star formation, and agn in the first  galaxies	when, and how, did the first galaxies and supermassive black holes (smbh)form, and how did they reionization the universe? first galaxy formation andcosmic reionization are among the last frontiers in studies of cosmic structureformation. we delineate the detailed astrophysical probes of early galaxy andsmbh formation afforded by observations at centimeter through submillimeterwavelengths. these observations include studies of the molecular gas (= thefuel for star formation in galaxies), atomic fine structure lines (= thedominant ism gas coolant), thermal dust continuum emission (= an ideal starformation rate estimator), and radio continuum emission from star formation andrelativistic jets. high resolution spectroscopic imaging can be used to studygalaxy dynamics and star formation on sub-kpc scales. these cm and mmobservations are the necessary compliment to near-ir observations, which probethe stars and ionized gas, and x-ray observations, which reveal the agn.together, a suite of revolutionary observatories planned for the next decadefrom centimeter to x-ray wavelengths will provide the requisite panchromaticview of the complex processes involved in the formation of the first generationof galaxies and smbhs, and cosmic reionization.

0907.0435	nir spectroscopy of sdss j0303-0019: a low luminosity, high eddington  ratio quasar at z~6	we present sensitive near--infrared vlt isaac spectroscopic observations ofthe z=6.08 quasar sdss j030331.40-001912.9. this qso is more than a magnitudefainter than other qsos at z~6 for which nir spectroscopy has been obtained todate and is therefore presumably more representative of the qso population atthe end of cosmic reionization. combining rest--frame uv continuum luminositywith the width measurements of the mg ii and c iv lines, we derive a black holemass of 2(+1.0/-0.5) x 10^8 solar masses, the lowest mass observed for z~6 qsosto date, and derive an eddington ratio of 1.6(+0.4/-0.6), amongst the highestvalue derived for qsos at any redshift. the spitzer 24 micron non--detection ofthis qso does not leave space for a significant hot dust component in itsoptical/near--infrared sed, in common with one other faint qso at z=6, but incontrast to more than twenty more z=6 qsos and all known lower redshift qsoswith sufficiently deep multi-wavelength photometry. we conclude that we havefound evidence for differences in the intrinsic properties of at least one z~6qso as compared to the lower--redshift population.

0911.0423	optically selected bl lacertae candidates from the sloan digital sky  survey data release seven	we present a sample of 723 optically selected bl lac candidates from the sdssdr7 spectroscopic database encompassing 8250 deg^2 of sky; our sampleconstitutes one of the largest uniform bl lac samples yet derived. each bl laccandidate has a high-quality sdss spectrum from which we determinespectroscopic redshifts for ~60% of the objects. redshift lower limits areestimated for the remaining objects utilizing the lack of host galaxy fluxcontamination in their optical spectra; we find that objects lackingspectroscopic redshifts are likely at systematically higher redshifts.approximately 80% of our bl lac candidates match to a radio source infirst/nvss, and ~40% match to a rosat x-ray source. the homogeneousmultiwavelength coverage allows subdivision of the sample into 637 radio-loudbl lac candidates and 86 weak-featured radio-quiet objects. the radio-loudobjects broadly support the standard paradigm unifying bl lac objects withbeamed radio galaxies. we propose that the majority of the radio-quiet objectsmay be lower-redshift (z&lt;2.2) analogs to high-redshift weak line quasars (i.e.,agn with unusually anemic broad emission line regions). these would constitutethe largest sample of such objects, being of similar size and complementary inredshift to the samples of high-redshift weak line quasars previouslydiscovered by the sdss. however, some fraction of the weak-featured radio-quietobjects may instead populate a rare and extreme radio-weak tail of the muchlarger radio-loud bl lac population. serendipitous discoveries of unusual whitedwarfs, high-redshift weak line quasars, and broad absorption line quasars withextreme continuum dropoffs blueward of rest-frame 2800 angstroms are alsobriefly described.

0912.2693	constraining cosmic reionization with quasar, gamma ray burst, and lya  emitter observations	we investigate the cosmic reionization history by comparing semi-analyticalmodels of the lya forest with observations of high-z quasars and gamma raybursts absorption spectra. in order to constrain the reionization epoch z_rei,we consider two physically motivated scenarios in which reionization endseither early (erm, z_rei&gt;= 7) or late (lrm, z_rei~6). we analyze thetransmitted flux in a sample of 17 quasars spectra at 5.7&lt;z&lt;6.4 and in thespectrum of the gamma ray burst 050904 at z=6.3, studying the wide darkportions (gaps) in the observed absorption spectra. by comparing the statisticsof these spectral features with our models, we conclude that currentobservational data do not require any sudden change in the ionization state ofthe igm at z~6, favouring indeed a highly ionized universe at these epochs, aspredicted by the erm. moreover, we test the predictions of this model throughlya emitters observations, finding that the erm provide a good fit to theevolution of the luminosity function of lya emitting galaxies in the redshiftrange z=5.7-6.5. the overall result points towards an extended reionizationprocess which starts at z&gt;=11 and completes at z_rei&gt;=7, in agreement with therecent wmap5 data.

1003.0016	ionization near-zones associated with quasars at z ~ 6	we analyze the size evolution of hii regions around 27 quasars between z=5.7to 6.4 ('quasar near-zones' or nz). we include more sources than previousstudies, and we use more accurate redshifts for the host galaxies, with 8 comolecular line redshifts and 9 mgii redshifts. we confirm the trend for anincrease in nz size with decreasing redshift, with the luminosity normalizedproper size evolving as: r_{nz,corrected} = (7.4 \pm 0.3) - (8.0 \pm 1.1)\times (z-6) mpc. while derivation of the absolute neutral fraction remainsdifficult with this technique, the evolution of the nz sizes suggests adecrease in the neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen by a factor ~ 9.4from z=6.4 to 5.7, in its simplest interpretation. alternatively, recentnumerical simulations suggest that this rapid increase in near-zone size fromz=6.4 to 5.7 is due to the rapid increase in the background photo-ionizationrate at the end of the percolation or overlap phase, when the average mean freepath of ionizing photons increases dramatically. in either case, the resultsare consistent with the idea that z ~ 6 to 7 corresponds to the tail end ofcosmic reionization. the scatter in the normalized nz sizes is larger thanexpected simply from measurement errors, and likely reflects intrinsicdifferences in the quasars or their environments. we find that the near-zonesizes increase with quasar uv luminosity, as expected for photo-ionizationdominated by quasar radiation.

1005.5016	herschel/pacs far-infrared photometry of two z&gt;4 quasars	we present herschel far-infrared (fir) observations of two sub-mm brightquasars at high redshift: sdss j1148+5251 (z=6.42) and br 1202-0725 (z=4.69)obtained with the pacs instrument. both objects are detected in the pacsphotometric bands. the herschel measurements provide additional data pointsthat constrain the fir spectral energy distributions (seds) of both sources,and they emphasise a broad range of dust temperatures in these objects. forlambda_rest ~&lt; 20mu, the two seds are very similar to the average seds ofquasars at low redshift. in the fir, however, both quasars show excess emissioncompared to low-z qso templates, most likely from cold dust powered by vigorousstar formation in the qso host galaxies. for sdss j1148+5251 we detect anotherobject at 160mu with a distance of ~10 arcseconds from the qso. although nophysical connection between the quasar and this object can be shown with theavailable data, it could potentially confuse low-resolution measurements, thusresulting in an overestimate of the fir luminosity of the z=6.42 quasar.

1006.4463	the extinction law at high redshift and its implications	we analyze the optical-near infrared spectra of 33 quasars with redshifts3.9&lt;z&lt;6.4 to investigate the properties of dust extinction at these cosmicepochs. the smc extinction curve has been shown to reproduce the dust reddeningof most quasars at z&lt;2.2; we investigate whether this curve also provides agood description of dust extinction at higher redshifts. we fit the observedspectra with synthetic absorbed quasar templates obtained by varying theintrinsic slope (alpha), the absolute extinction (a3000), and by using a gridof empirical and theoretical extinction curves. we find that seven quasars inour sample are affected by substantial extinction (a3000 &gt;0.8), andcharacterized by very steep intrinsic slopes (alpha&lt;-2.3). all of theindividual quasars require extinction curve deviating from that of the smc,with a tendency to flatten at lambda&lt;2000 a (in the rest frame of the source).we obtain a mean extinction curve at z&gt;4, both by performing a simultaneous fitof all quasars and by averaging the extinction curves inferred for individualquasars. in the case of broad absorption line quasars the mean extinction curvedeviates from the smc at a confidence level &gt;95%. the difference betweenextinction curves in quasars at z&gt;4 and in quasars at lower redshift isindicative of either a different dust production mechanism at high redshift, ora different mechanism for processing dust into the ism. we suggest that thesame transitions may also apply to normal, star-forming galaxies at z&gt;4. inparticular, the observed change in the average spectral slope of galaxies atz&gt;4 may be partially ascribed to a variation in the extinction curve, ratherthan a lower dust content at high redshift. in this scenario, the extinctioncurve inferred at z&gt;4 would imply a cosmic star-formation corrected for dustattenuation a factor of ~2 higher than estimated in the past.

1203.5306	the clustering of intermediate redshift quasars as measured by the  baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	we measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range2.2&lt;z&lt;2.8 using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we use ahomogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopicredshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements atthese redshifts to date. the sample covers 3,600 square degrees, correspondingto a comoving volume of 9.7(gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial lambdacdm cosmology,and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. afteraccounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlationfunction is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm0.5)mpc/h over the range 3&lt;s&lt;25mpc/h. the projected correlation function, whichintegrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fitwell by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)mpc/h over the range4&lt;r&lt;16mpc/h. there is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependenceto the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range inour sample. our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previousmeasurements at similar redshifts. our measurement of the quasar clusteringamplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. we compare thedata to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matterhalos at z~2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit halos with a characteristicmass of &lt;m&gt;~10^{12}msun/h with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 percent.

0712.2239	go long, go deep: finding optical jet breaks for swift-era grbs with the  lbt	using the 8.4m large binocular telescope, we observed six grb afterglows from2.8 hours to 30.8 days after the burst triggers to systematically probe thelate time behaviors of afterglows including jet breaks, flares, and supernovabumps. we detected five afterglows with sloan r' magnitudes ranging from23.0-26.3 mag. the depth of our observations allows us to extend the temporalbaseline for measuring jet breaks by another decade in time scale. we detectedtwo jet breaks and a third candidate, all of which are not detectable withoutdeep, late time optical observations. in the other three cases, we do notdetect the jet breaks either because of contamination from the host galaxylight, the presence of a supernova bump, or the intrinsic faintness of theoptical afterglow.  this suggests that the basic picture that grbs are collimated is still validand that the apparent lack of swift jet breaks is due to poorly sampledafterglow light curves, particularly at late times.

1305.3999	complete infrared spectral energy distributions of mm detected quasars  at z&gt;5	we present herschel far-infrared (fir) photometry of eleven quasars atredshift z&gt;5 that have previously been detected at 1.2mm. we perform fullspectral energy distribution (sed) fits over the wavelength range lambda_rest~0.1-400mu for those objects with good herschel detections. these fits revealthe need for an additional far-infrared (fir) component besides the emissionfrom a dusty agn-powered torus. this additional fir component has temperaturesof t_fir ~ 40-60k with luminosities of l_(8-1000mu) ~ 10^13 l_sun (accountingfor 25-60% of the bolometric fir luminosity). if the fir dust emission is dueto star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solarmasses per year. we show that at long wavelengths (lambda_rest &gt; 50mu) thecontribution of the agn-powered torus emission is negligible. this explains howprevious fir studies of high-redshift quasars that relied on single componentfits to (ground-based) observations at lambda_obs &gt; 350mu reached t_fir andl_fir values similar to our complete sed fits. stacking the herschel data offour individually undetected sources reveals a significant average signal inthe pacs bands but not in spire. the average sed of sources with individualherschel detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid-infrared emissionwhen compared to common agn templates. the comparison between two average seds(sources with and without individual herschel detections) matched in theuv/optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the mir emissionmay correlate with the strength of the fir emission.

1502.01927	the identification of z-dropouts in pan-starrs1: three quasars at  6.5&lt;z&lt;6.7	luminous distant quasars are unique probes of the high redshift intergalacticmedium (igm) and of the growth of massive galaxies and black holes in the earlyuniverse. absorption due to neutral hydrogen in the igm makes quasars beyond aredshift of z~6.5 very faint in the optical $z$-band, thus locating quasars athigher redshifts require large surveys that are sensitive above 1 micron. wereport the discovery of three new z&gt;6.5 quasars, corresponding to an age of theuniverse of &lt;850 myr, selected as z-band dropouts in the pan-starrs1 survey.this increases the number of known z&gt;6.5 quasars from 4 to 7. the quasars haveredshifts of z=6.50, 6.52, and 6.66, and include the brightest z-dropout quasarreported to date, pso j036.5078+03.0498 with m_1450=-27.4. we obtainednear-infrared spectroscopy for the quasars and from the mgii line we estimatethat the central black holes have masses between 5x10^8 and 4x10^9 m_sun, andare accreting close to the eddington limit (l_bol/l_edd=0.13-1.2). weinvestigate the ionized regions around the quasars and find near zone radii ofr_nz=1.5-5.2 proper mpc, confirming the trend of decreasing near zone sizeswith increasing redshift found for quasars at 5.7&lt;z&lt;6.4. by combining r_nz ofthe ps1 quasars with those of 5.7&lt;z&lt;7.1 quasars in the literature, we derive aluminosity corrected redshift evolution ofr_nz,corrected=(7.2+/-0.2)-(6.1+/-0.7)x(z-6) mpc. however, the large spread inr_nz in the new quasars implies a wide range in quasar ages and/or a largevariation in the neutral hydrogen fraction along different lines of sight.

0804.4142	improved cosmological constraints from new, old and combined supernova  datasets	we present a new compilation of type ia supernovae (sne ia), a new dataset oflow-redshift nearby-hubble-flow sne and new analysis procedures to work withthese heterogeneous compilations. this ``union'' compilation of 414 sn ia,which reduces to 307 sne after selection cuts, includes the recent largesamples of sne ia from the supernova legacy survey and essence survey, theolder datasets, as well as the recently extended dataset of distant supernovaeobserved with hst. a single, consistent and blind analysis procedure is usedfor all the various sn ia subsamples, and a new procedure is implemented thatconsistently weights the heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. wepresent the latest results from this union compilation and discuss thecosmological constraints from this new compilation and its combination withother cosmological measurements (cmb and bao). the constraint we obtain fromsupernovae on the dark energy density is $\omega_\lambda=0.713^{+0.027}_{-0.029} (stat)}^{+0.036}_{-0.039} (sys)}$, for a flat, lcdmuniverse. assuming a constant equation of state parameter, $w$, the combinedconstraints from sne, bao and cmb give$w=-0.969^{+0.059}_{-0.063}(stat)^{+0.063}_{-0.066} (sys)$. while our resultsare consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively weakconstraints on a $w$ that varies with redshift. in particular, the current sndata do not yet significantly constrain $w$ at $z&gt;1$. with the addition of ournew nearby hubble-flow sne ia, these resulting cosmological constraints arecurrently the tightest available.

1503.04214	constraining the radio-loud fraction of quasars at z&gt;5.5	radio-loud active galactic nuclei at z~2-4 are typically located in denseenvironments and their host galaxies are among the most massive systems atthose redshifts, providing key insights for galaxy evolution. findingradio-loud quasars at the highest accessible redshifts (z~6) is important tostudy their properties and environments at even earlier cosmic time. they wouldalso serve as background sources for radio surveys intended to study theintergalactic medium beyond the epoch of reionization in hi 21 cm absorption.currently, only five radio-loud ($r=f_{\nu,5{\rm ghz}}/f_{\nu,4400\aa}&gt;10$)quasars are known at z~6. in this paper we search for 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 7.2 quasars bycross-matching the optical pan-starrs1 and radio first surveys. the radioinformation allows identification of quasars missed by typical color-basedselections. while we find no good 6.4 &lt; z &lt;7.2 quasar candidates at thesensitivities of these surveys, we discover two new radio-loud quasars at z~6.furthermore, we identify two additional z~6 radio-loud quasars which were notpreviously known to be radio-loud, nearly doubling the current z~6 sample. weshow the importance of having infrared photometry for z&gt;5.5 quasars to robustlyclassify them as radio-quiet or radio-loud. based on this, we reclassify thequasar j0203+0012 (z=5.72), previously considered radio-loud, to beradio-quiet. using the available data in the literature, we constrain theradio-loud fraction of quasars at z~6, using the kaplan--meier estimator, to be$8.1^{+5.0}_{-3.2}\%$. this result is consistent with there being no evolutionof the radio-loud fraction with redshift, in contrast to what has beensuggested by some studies at lower redshifts.

1504.05216	bright [cii] 158$\mu$m emission in a quasar host galaxy at $z=6.54$	the [cii] 158$\mu$m fine-structure line is known to trace regions of activestar formation and is the main coolant of the cold, neutral atomic medium. inthis \textit{letter}, we report a strong detection of the [cii] line in thehost galaxy of the brightest quasar known at $z&gt;6.5$, the pan-starrs1 selectedquasar pso j036.5078+03.0498 (hereafter p036+03), using the iram noemamillimeter interferometer. its [cii] and total far-infrared luminosities are$(5.8 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 \,l_\odot$ and $(7.6\pm1.5) \times10^{12}\,l_\odot$, respectively. this results in a $l_{[cii]} /l_{tir}$ ratioof $\sim 0.8\times 10^{-3}$, which is at the high end for those found foractive galaxies, though it is lower than the average found in typical mainsequence galaxies at $z\sim 0$. we also report a tentative additional linewhich we identify as a blended emission from the $3_{22} - 3_{13}$ and $5_{23}- 4_{32}$ h$_2$o transitions. if confirmed, this would be the most distantdetection of water emission to date. p036+03 rivals the current prototypicalluminous j1148+5251 quasar at $z=6.42$, in both rest-frame uv and [cii]luminosities. given its brightness and because it is visible from bothhemispheres (unlike j1148+5251), p036+03 has the potential of becoming animportant laboratory for the study of star formation and of the interstellarmedium only $\sim 800\,$myr after the big bang.

0806.3022	thermal emission from warm dust in the most distant quasars	we report new continuum observations of fourteen z~6 quasars at 250 ghz andfourteen quasars at 1.4 ghz. we summarize all recent millimeter and radioobservations of the sample of the thirty-three quasars known with5.71&lt;=z&lt;=6.43, and present a study of the rest frame far-infrared (fir)properties of this sample. these quasars were observed with the max plankmillimeter bolometer array (mambo) at 250 ghz with mjy sensitivity, and 30% ofthem were detected. we also recover the average 250 ghz flux density of themambo undetected sources at 4 sigma, by stacking the on-source measurements.the derived mean radio-to-uv spectral energy distributions (seds) of the fullsample and the 250 ghz non-detections show no significant difference from thatof lower-redshift optical quasars. obvious fir excesses are seen in theindividual seds of the strong 250 ghz detections, with fir-to-radio emissionratios consistent with that of typical star forming galaxies. most 250ghz-detected sources follow the l_{fir}--l_{bol} relationship derived from asample of local ir luminous quasars (l_{ir}&gt;10^{12}l_{\odot}), while theaverage l_{fir}/l_{bol} ratio of the non-detections is consistent with that ofthe optically-selected pg quasars. the mambo detections also tend to haveweaker ly\alpha emission than the non-detected sources. we discuss possible firdust heating sources, and critically assess the possibility of active starformation in the host galaxies of the z~6 quasars. the average star formationrate of the mambo non-detections is likely to be less than a few hundredm_{\odot} yr^{-1}, but in the strong detections, the host galaxy star formationis probably at a rate of \gtrsim10^{3} m_{\odot} yr^{-1}, which dominates thefir dust heating.

astro-ph;0005247	five high-redshift quasars discovered in commissioning imaging data of  the sloan digital sky survey	we report the discovery of five quasars with redshifts of 4.67 - 5.27 andz'-band magnitudes of 19.5-20.7 m_b ~ -27. all were originally selected asdistant quasar candidates in optical/near-infrared photometry from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), and most were confirmed as probable high-redshiftquasars by supplementing the sdss data with j and k measurements. the quasarspossess strong, broad lyman-alpha emission lines, with the characteristic sharpcutoff on the blue side produced by lyman-alpha forest absorption. threequasars contain strong, broad absorption features, and one of them exhibitsvery strong n v emission. the amount of absorption produced by the lyman-alphaforest increases toward higher redshift, and that in the z=5.27 object (d_a ~0.7) is consistent with a smooth extrapolation of the absorption seen in lowerredshift quasars. the high luminosity of these objects relative to most otherknown objects at z &gt;~ 5 makes them potentially valuable as probes of earlyquasar properties and of the intervening intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0005414	the discovery of a luminous z=5.80 quasar from the sloan digital sky  survey	we present observations of sdssp j104433.04--012502.2, a luminous quasar atz=5.80 discovered from sloan digital sky survey (sdss) multicolor imaging data.this object was selected as an i'-band dropout object, with i*=21.8 +/- 0.2,z*=19.2 +/- 0.1. it has an absolute magnitude m1450 = -27.2 (h_0 =50 km/s/mpc,q0 = 0.5). the spectrum shows a strong and broad ly alpha emission line, strongly alpha forest absorption lines with a mean continuum decrement d_a = 0.91,and a lyman limit system at z=5.72. the spectrum also shows strong oi and siivemission lines similar to those of quasars at z&lt;= 5, suggesting that thesemetals were produced at redshift beyond six. the lack of a gunn-peterson troughin the spectrum indicates that the universe is already highly ionized at z ~5.8. using a high-resolution spectrum in the ly alpha forest region, we place aconservative upper limit of the optical depth due to the gunn-peterson effectof tau &lt; 0.5 in regions of minimum absorption. the ly alpha forest absorptionin this object is much stronger than that in quasars at z&lt;= 5. the object isunresolved in a deep image with excellent seeing, implying that it is unlensed.the black hole mass of this quasar is ~3 x 10^9 m_solar if we assume that it isradiating at the eddington luminosity and no lensing amplification, implyingthat it resides in a very massive dark matter halo. the discovery of one quasarat m_1450 &lt; -27 in a survey area of 600 deg^2 is consistent with anextrapolation of the observed luminosity function at lower redshift. theabundance and evolution of such quasars can provide sensitive tests of modelsof quasar and galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0008122	high-redshift quasars found in sloan digital sky survey commissioning  data iii: a color selected sample at i^*&lt;20 in the fall equatorial stripe	this is the third paper in a series aimed at finding high-redshift quasarsfrom five-color (u'g'r'i'z') imaging data taken along the celestial equator bythe sdss during its commissioning phase. in this paper, we first present theobservations of 14 bright high-redshift quasars (3.66&lt;z&lt;4.77, i^*&lt;20)discovered in the sdss fall equatorial stripe, and the sdss photometry of twopreviously known high-redshift quasars in the same region of the sky. combinedwith the quasars presented in previous papers, we define a color-selectedflux-limited sample of 39 quasars at 3.6 &lt; z &lt; 5.0 and i^*&lt;20, covering a totaleffective area of 182 deg^2. from this sample, we estimate the average spectralpower law slope in the rest-frame ultraviolet for quasars at z~4 to be -0.79with a standard deviation of 0.34, and the average rest-frame equivalent widthof the ly alpha+n v emission line to be 69 a with a standard deviation of 18 a.the selection completeness of this multicolor sample is determined from themodel colors of high-redshift quasars, taking into account the distributions ofemission line strengths, intrinsic continuum slope, the line and continuumabsorption from intervening material, and the effects of photometric errors.the average completeness of this sample is about 75%. the selection functioncalculated in this paper will be used to correct the incompleteness of thiscolor-selected sample and to derive the high-redshift quasar luminosityfunction in a subsequent paper. in the appendix, we present the observations ofan additional 18 faint quasars (3.57&lt;z&lt;4.80, 20.1&lt;i^*&lt;20.8) discovered in theregion on the sky that has been imaged twice. several quasars presented in thispaper exhibit interesting properties, including a radio-loud quasar at z=4.77,and a narrow-line quasar (fwhm = 1500 km s^-1) at z=3.57.

astro-ph;0008123	high-redshift quasars found in sloan digital sky survey commissioning  data iv: luminosity function from the fall equatorial stripe sampl	this is the fourth paper in a series aimed at finding high-redshift quasarsfrom five-color imaging data taken along the celestial equator by the sdss.during its commissioning phase. in this paper, we use the color-selected sampleof 39 luminous high-redshift quasars presented in paper iii to derive theevolution of the quasar luminosity function over the range of 3.6&lt;z&lt;5.0, and-27.5&lt;m_1450&lt;-25.5 (omega=1, h_0=50 km s^-1 mpc^-1). we use the selectionfunction derived in paper iii to correct for sample incompleteness. theluminosity function is estimated using three different methods: (1) the 1/v_aestimator; (2) a maximum likelihood solution, assuming that the density ofquasars depends exponentially on redshift and as a power law in luminosity and(3) lynden-bell's non-parametric c^- estimator. all three methods giveconsistent results. the luminous quasar density decreases by a factor of ~ 6from z=3.5 to z=5.0, consistent with the decline seen from several previousoptical surveys at z&lt;4.5. the luminosity function follows psi(l) ~ l^{-2.5} forz~4 at the bright end, significantly flatter than the bright end luminosityfunction psi(l) \propto l^{-3.5} found in previous studies for z&lt;3, suggestingthat the shape of the quasar luminosity function evolves with redshift as well,and that the quasar evolution from z=2 to 5 cannot be described as pureluminosity evolution. possible selection biases and the effect of dustextinction on the redshift evolution of the quasar density are also discussed.

astro-ph;0102059	infrared spectroscopy of brown dwarfs: the onset of methane absorption  in l dwarfs and the l/t transition	we present infrared spectra of brown dwarfs with spectral types from mid-l tot. the 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m spectra of three dwarfs found by the sloan digital skysurvey contain absorption bands of both methane and carbon monoxide and bridgethe gap between late l and previously observed t dwarfs. these dwarfs form aclear spectral sequence, with ch$_{4}$ absorption increasing as the coabsorption decreases. water vapor band strengths increase in parallel with themethane bands and thus also link the l and t types. we suggest that objectswith detectable co and ch$_{4}$ in the h and k bands should define the earliestt subclasses. from observations of bright (k~$\leq$~13 mag) l dwarfs found by2mass, we find that the onset of detectable amounts of ch$_{4}$ occurs nearspectral type l5. for this spectral type methane is observable in the3.3~$\mu$m $\nu$$_{3}$ band only, and not in the overtone and combination bandsat h and k.

astro-ph;0108443	towards spectral classification of l and t dwarfs: infrared and optical  spectroscopy and analysis	we present 0.6-2.5um, r~400 spectra of twenty-seven cool, low luminositystars and substellar objects. based on these and previously published spectrawe develop a preliminary spectral classification system for l and t dwarfs. forlate l and t types the classification system is based entirely on four spectralindices in the 1-2.5um interval. two of these indices are derived from waterabsorption bands at 1.15um and 1.4um, the latter of which shows a smoothincrease in depth through the l and t sequences and can be used to classifyboth spectral types. the other two indices make use of methane absorptionfeatures in the h and k bands, with the k band index also applicable to mid tolate l dwarfs. continuum indices shortward of 1um used by previous authors toclassify l dwarfs are found to be useful only through mid l subclasses. weemploy the 1.5um water index and the 2.2um methane index to complete the lclassification through l9.5 and to link the new system with a modified versionof the 2mass ``color-d'' index. by correlating the depths of the methane andwater absorption features, we establish a t spectral sequence from types t0 tot8, based on all four indices, which is a smooth continuation of the lsequence. we reclassify two 2mass l8 dwarfs as l9 and l9.5 and identify onesdss object as l9. in the proposed system methane absorption appears in the kband approximately at l8, two subclasses earlier than its appearance in the hband. the l and t spectral classes are distinguished by the absence andpresence, respectively, of h band methane absorption.

astro-ph;0109331	infrared classification of l and t dwarfs	we use new and published medium resolution 0.6--2.5 $\mu$m spectra of l and tdwarfs to develop a unified classification system for both of these newspectral classes. two indices of the system at 1.2 $\mu$m and 1.5 $\mu$m arebased on nearby absorption bands of water vapor and two are associated withmethane bands near 1.6 $\mu$m and 2.2 $\mu$m. the 1.5 $\mu$m index is monotonicthrough the l and t sequences, and forms the backbone of the system; theindices for the other bands provide extensive, but only partial, coverage. wecorrelate the 1.5 $\mu$m index with continuum indices shortward of 1 $\mu$mdevised by others for classifying l dwarfs, in order to obtain a tight linkbetween optical and infrared classifications. our proposed system defines tenspectral subclasses for l (l0--l9) and nine for t (t0--t8). the boundarybetween l and t is defined to be the onset of absorption by methane in the hband. methane absorption in the k band near 2.2 $\mu$m is found to beginapproximately at l8.

astro-ph;0204065	characterization of m,l and t dwarfs in the sloan digital sky survey	an extensive sample of m, l and t dwarfs identified in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) has been compiled. the sample of 718 dwarfs includes 677 newobjects (629 m dwarfs, 48 l dwarfs) together with 41 that have been previouslypublished. all new objects and some of the previously published ones have newoptical spectra obtained either with the sdss spectrographs or with the apachepoint observatory 3.5m arc telescope. spectral types and sdss colors areavailable for all objects; approximately 35% also have near-infrared magnitudesmeasured by 2mass or on the mauna kea system. we use this sample tocharacterize the color--spectral type and color--color relations of late typedwarfs in the sdss filters, and to derive spectroscopic and photometricparallax relations for use in future studies of the luminosity and massfunctions based on sdss data. we find that the (i*-z*) and (i*-j) colorsprovide good spectral type and absolute magnitude (m_i*) estimates for m and ldwarfs. our distance estimates for the current sample indicate that sdss isfinding early m dwarfs out to about 1.5 kpc, l dwarfs to approximately 100 pcand t dwarfs to near 20 pc. the t dwarf photometric data show large scatter andare therefore less reliable for spectral type and distance estimation.

astro-ph;0301480	vlt+uves spectroscopy of the caii lobal quasar sdss j030000.56+004828.0	we study high-resolution spectra of the `overlapping-trough' low-ionizationbroad absorption line (lobal) quasar sdss j030000.56+004828.0. the caii, mgiiand mgi column densities in this object are the largest reported to date forany bal outflow. the broad caii absorption is mildly blended, but the blendingcan be disentangled to measure the caii column density, which is large enoughthat the outflow must include a strong hydrogen ionization front. the outflowbegins at a blueshift of ~1650 km/s from the systemic redshift. the lowestvelocity bal region produces strong caii absorption but does not producesignificant excited feii absorption, while the higher velocity excited feiiabsorption region produces very little caii absorption. we have found that onlya disk wind outflow can explain this segregation. whether the outflow is smoothor clumpy, we conclude that the caii bal region has a density high enough topopulate excited levels of feii, but a temperature low enough to prevent themfrom being significantly populated. this requirement means the caii bal regionhas t&lt;1000 k, and perhaps even t&lt;550 k. this quasar also has an associatedabsorption line system (aal) that exhibits partial covering, and therefore islikely located near the central engine. its association with the bal outflow isunclear. blending of the aal with the bal trough shows that the spatial regioncovered by the bal outflow can vary over velocity differences of ~1700 km/s.

astro-ph;0302558	chandra and xmm-newton observations of the first quasars: x-rays from  the age of cosmic enlightenment	we report on chandra and xmm-newton observations of a sample of 13 quasars atz~4.7-5.4 mostly taken from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the presentsample complements previous x-ray studies of z&gt;4 quasars, in which the majorityof the objects are optically more luminous and at lower redshifts. all but twoof our quasars have been detected in the x-ray band, thus doubling the numberof z&gt;4.8 x-ray detected quasars. the two non-detections are likely to be due toa short exposure time and to the presence of intrinsic absorption. we confirmand extend to the highest redshifts the presence of a correlation betweenab1450(1+z) magnitude and soft x-ray flux for z&gt;4 quasars, and the presence ofa steeper optical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (parameterized by aox)for high-luminosity, high-redshift quasars than for lower-luminosity,lower-redshift quasars. the second effect is likely due to the knownanti-correlation between aox and rest-frame 2500 angstrom luminosity, whosesignificance is confirmed via partial correlation analysis. the joint ~2.5-36kev rest-frame spectrum of the z&gt;4.8 sdss quasars observed thus far by chandrais well parameterized by a power-law with photon index gamma=1.84+/-0.30; thisphoton index is consistent with those of z~0-3 quasars and that obtained fromjoint spectral fitting of z~4.1-4.5 optically luminous palomar digital skysurvey quasars. no evidence for widespread intrinsic x-ray absorption has beenfound (nh&lt;4.0x10^{22} cm^{-2} on average at 90% confidence). we also obtainedhobby-eberly telescope (het) photometric observations for eight of our targetquasars. none of these shows significant (&gt;30%) optical variability over thetime interval of a few years (in the observed frame) between the sdss and hetobservations.

astro-ph;0307408	high-excitation co in a quasar host galaxy at z=6.42	we report the detection of high excitation co emission from the most distantquasar currently known, sdss j114816.64+525150.3 (hereafter j1148+5251), at aredshift z=6.419. the co (j=6-5) and (j=7-6) lines were detected using the iramplateau de bure interferometer, showing a width of ~280 km/s. an upper fluxlimit for the co (j=1-0) line was obtained from observations with theeffelsberg 100-meter telescope. assuming no gravitational magnification, weestimate a molecular gas mass of ~2x10^10 m_sun. using the co (3-2)observations by walter et al. (2003), a comparison of the line flux ratios withpredictions from a large velocity gradient model suggests that the gas islikely of high excitation, at densities ~10^5 cm^-3 and a temperature ~100 k.since in this case the co lines appear to have moderate optical depths, the gasmust be extended over a few kpc. the gas mass detected in j1148+5251 can fuelstar formation at the rate implied by the far-infrared luminosity for less than10 million years, a time comparable to the dynamical time of the region. thegas must therefore be replenished quickly, and metal and dust enrichment mustoccur fast. the strong dust emission and massive, dense gas reservoir at z~6.4provide further evidence that vigorous star formation is co-eval with the rapidgrowth of massive black holes at these early epochs of the universe.

astro-ph;0402272	preliminary parallaxes of 40 l and t dwarfs from the u.s. naval  observatory infrared astrometry program	we present preliminary trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for 22 ldwarfs and 18 t dwarfs measured using the astrocam infrared imager. relative toabsolute parallax corrections are made by employing 2mass and/or sdssphotometry for reference frame stars. we combine usno infrared and opticalparallaxes with the best available cit system photometry to determine m_j, m_h,and m_k values for 37 l dwarfs between spectral types l0 to l8 and 19 t dwarfsbetween spectral types t0.5 and t8 and present selected absolute magnitudeversus spectral type and color diagrams, based on these results. luminositiesand temperatures are estimated for these objects. of special interest are thedistances of several objects which are at or near the l-t dwarf boundary sothat this important transition can be better understood. the previouslyreported early-mid t dwarf luminosity excess is clearly confirmed and found tobe present at j, h, and k. the large number of objects that populate thisluminosity excess region indicates that it cannot be due entirely to selectioneffects. the t dwarf sequence is extended to m_j~16.9 by 2mass j041519-0935which, at d = 5.74 pc, is found to be the least luminous [log(l/l_sun)=-5.58]and coldest (t_eff~760 k) brown dwarf known. combining results from this paperwith earlier usno ccd results we find that, in contrast to the l dwarfs, thereare no examples of low velocity (v_tan &lt; 20 km/s) t dwarfs. we briefly discussfuture directions for the usno infrared astrometry program.

astro-ph;0402475	l' and m' photometry of ultracool dwarfs	we have compiled l' and m' photometry of 63 single and binary m, l,and tdwarfs obtained at ukirt using the mko filter set. this compilation includesnew l' data for 8 l dwarfs and 13 t dwarfs and new m' data for 7 l dwarfs, 5 tdwarfs, and gl 229a. we compute l_bol, bc_k, and t_eff for 42 dwarfs whoseflux-calibrated jhk spectra, l' photometry, and trigonometric parallaxes areavailable, and we estimate these quantities for 9 other dwarfs whose parallaxesand flux-calibrated spectra have been obtained. bc_k is a well-behaved functionof near-ir spectral type with a dispersion of ~0.1 mag for types m6-t5; it issignificantly more scattered for types t5-t9. t_eff declines steeply andmonotonically for types m6-l7 and t4-t9, but is nearly constant at ~1450 k fortypes l7-t4 with assumed ages of ~3 gyr. this constant t_eff is evidenced bynearly unchanging values of l'-m' between types l6 and t3. we compare theobserved k, l', and m' luminosities of l and t dwarfs in our sample with thosepredicted by model atmospheres with varying surface gravities and sedimentationefficiencies. the models indicate that the l3-t4.5 dwarfs generally have highergravities (log g = 5.0-5.5) than the t6-t9 dwarfs (log g = 4.5-5.0). thepredicted m' luminosities of t dwarfs are 1.5-2.5 times larger than thosederived empirically for the t dwarfs in our sample. this discrepancy isattributed to absorption at 4.5-4.9 um by co, which is not expected under thecondition of chemical equilibrium assumed in the models. we determine that thel3 dwarf kelu-1 and the t0 dwarf sdss j0423-0414 are probable binary systems.we compute log(l_bol/l_sun) = -5.73 +/- 0.05 and t_eff = 600-750 k for the t9dwarf 2mass j0415-0935, which supplants gl 570d as the least luminous andcoolest brown dwarf presently known.

astro-ph;0403167	star formation at z~6: the udf-parallel acs fields	we report on the i-dropouts detected in two exceptionally deep acs fields(b_{435}, v_{606}, i_{775}, and z_{850} with 10 sigma limits of 28.8, 29.0,28.5, and 27.8, respectively) taken in parallel with the udf nicmosobservations. using an i-z&gt;1.4 cut, we find 30 i-dropouts over 21 arcmin^2 downto z_ab=28.1, or 1.4 i-dropouts arcmin^{-2}, with significant field-to-fieldvariation (as expected from cosmic variance). this extends i-dropout searchessome ~0.9^m further down the luminosity function than was possible in the goodsfield, netting a ~7x increase in surface density. an estimate of the sizeevolution for uv bright objects is obtained by comparing the composite radialflux profile of the bright i-dropouts (z&lt;27.2) with scaled versions of thehdf-n + hdf-s u-dropouts. the best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-1.57_{-0.53}^{+0.50}} scaling in size (for fixed luminosity), extending lower redshift(1&lt;z&lt;5) trends to z~6. adopting this scaling and the brighter i-dropouts fromboth goods fields, we make incompleteness estimates and construct a z~6 lf inthe rest-frame continuum uv (~1350 a) over a 3.5 magnitude baseline, finding ashape consistent with that found at lower redshift. to evaluate the evolutionin the lf from z~3.8, we make comparisons against different scalings of a lowerredshift b-dropout sample. though a strong degeneracy is found betweenluminosity and density evolution, our best-fit model scales as (1+z)^{-2.8} innumber and (1+z)^0.1 in luminosity, suggesting a rest-frame continuum uvluminosity density at z~6 which is just 0.38_{-0.07} ^{+0.09}x that at z~3.8.our inclusion of size evolution makes the present estimate lower than previousz~6 estimates.

astro-ph;0611062	physical parameters of two very cool t dwarfs	we present new infrared spectra of the t8 brown dwarf 2massj04151954-0935066: 2.9-4.1 micron spectra obtained with the infrared camera andspectrograph on the subaru telescope, and 5.2-14.5 micron spectra obtained withthe infrared spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope. we use these data andmodels to determine an accurate bolometric luminosity of log l_bol/l_sun=-5.67and to constrain the effective temperature, gravity, mass and age to 725-775k,log g=5.00-5.37, m=33-58 m_jupiter and age=3-10gyr. we perform the sameanalysis using published 0.6-15 micron spectra for the t7.5 dwarf 2massj12171110-0311131, for which we find a metal-rich composition ([fe/h]~0.3) andlog l_bol/l_sun=-5.31, t_eff=850-950k, log g=4.80-5.42, m=25-66m_jupiter andage=1-10gyr. these luminosities and effective temperatures straddle thosedetermined with the same method and models for gl 570d by saumon et al. (2006)and make 2mass j04151954-0935066 the coolest and least luminous t dwarf withwell-determined properties. we find that synthetic spectra generated by themodels reproduce the observed red through mid-infrared spectra of 2massj04151954-0935066 and 2mass j12171110-0311131 very well, except for knowndiscrepancies which are most likely due to the incomplete ch4 opacities. bothobjects show evidence of departures from strict chemical equilibrium and wediscuss this result in the context of other late t dwarfs where disequilibriumphenomena have been observed.

astro-ph;9903237	high-redshift quasars found in sloan digital sky survey commissioning  data	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of 15 high-redshiftquasars (z &gt; 3.6) discovered from ~140 deg^2 of five-color (u'g'r'i'z') imagingdata taken by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) during its commissioningphase. the quasars are selected by their distinctive colors in sdss multicolorspace. four of the quasars have redshifts higher than 4.6 (z=4.63, 4.75, 4.90and 5.00, the latter being the highest redshift quasar yet known). in addition,two previously known z &gt; 4 objects were recovered from the data. the quasarsall have i* &lt; 20 and have luminosities comparable to that of 3c273. the spectraof the quasars have similar features (strong, broad emission lines andsubstantial absorption blueward of the ly alpha emission line) seen inpreviously known high-redshift quasars. although the photometric accuracy andimage quality fail to meet the final survey requirements, our success rate foridentifying high-redshift quasars (17 quasars from 27 candidates) is muchhigher than that of previous multicolor surveys. however, the numbers ofhigh-redshift quasars found is in close accord with the number density inferredfrom previous surveys.

0706.1053	glimpsing through the high redshift neutral hydrogen fog	we analyze the transmitted flux in a sample of 17 qsos spectra at5.74&lt;zem&lt;6.42 to obtain tighter constraints on the volume-averaged neutralhydrogen fraction, xhi, at z~6. we study separately the narrow transmissionwindows (peaks) and the wide dark portions (gaps) in the observed absorptionspectra. by comparing the statistics of these spectral features with lyalphaforest simulations, we conclude that xhi evolves smoothly from 10^{-4.4} atz=5.3 to 10^{-4.2} at z=5.6, with a robust upper limit xhi&lt;0.36 at z=6.3. thefrequency and physical sizes of the peaks imply an origin in cosmic underdenseregions and/or in hii regions around faint quasars or galaxies. in one case(the intervening hii region of the faint quasar rd j1148+5253 at z=5.70 alongthe los of sdss j1148+5251 at z=6.42) the increase of the peak spectral densityis explained by the first-ever detected transverse proximity effect in the hilyalpha forest; this indicates that at least some peaks result from a locallyenhanced radiation field. we then obtain a strong lower limit on the foregroundqso lifetime of tq&gt;11 myr. the observed widths of the peaks are found to besystematically larger than the simulated ones. reasons for such discrepancymight reside either in the photoionization equilibrium assumption or inradiative transfer effects.
