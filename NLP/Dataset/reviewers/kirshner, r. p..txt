0908.2817	a relativistic type ibc supernova without a detected gamma-ray burst	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) mark the explosive death of somemassive stars and are a rare sub-class of type ibc supernovae (sne ibc). theyare distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativisticoutflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and along-lived radio afterglow. to date, central engine-driven sne have beendiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expectedthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivityor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. in thisframework, the recovery of undetected grbs may be possible through radiosearches for sne ibc with relativistic outflows. here we report the discoveryof luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type ibc sn 2009bb,which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.the lack of a coincident grb makes sn 2009bb the first engine-driven sndiscovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. a comparison with our extensiveradio survey of sne ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines islow, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferredrate of nearby grbs. our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radiosurveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearestengine-driven sne. a similar result for a different supernova is reportedindependently.

0908.2818	the high-metallicity explosion environment of the relativistic supernova  2009bb	we investigate the environment of the nearby (d ~ 40mpc) broad-lined type icsupernova sn 2009bb. this event was observed to produce a relativistic outflowlikely powered by a central accreting compact object. while such a phenomenonwas previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), no lgrbwas detected in association with sn 2009bb. using an optical spectrum of the sn2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ism properties for the hostenvironment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and starformation rate. we compare the sn explosion site properties to observations oflgrb and broad-lined sn ic host environments on optical emission line ratiodiagnostic diagrams. based on these analyses, we find that the sn 2009bbexplosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement withother broad-lined sn ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshiftlgrb host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits forrelativistic explosions. we consider the implications of these findings and theimpact that sn 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have onour understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some sne toproduce a relativistic outflow.

0911.3774	characteristic velocities of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernova  cores	the velocity of the inner ejecta of stripped-envelope core-collapsesupernovae (cc-sne) is studied by means of an analysis of their nebularspectra. stripped-envelope cc-sne are the result of the explosion of bare coresof massive stars ($\geq 8$ m$_{\odot}$), and their late-time spectra aretypically dominated by a strong [o {\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6363 emissionline produced by the innermost, slow-moving ejecta which are not visible atearlier times as they are located below the photosphere. a characteristicvelocity of the inner ejecta is obtained for a sample of 56 stripped-envelopecc-sne of different spectral types (iib, ib, ic) using direct measurements ofthe line width as well as spectral fitting. for most sne, this value shows asmall scatter around 4500 km s$^{-1}$. observations ($&lt; 100$ days) ofstripped-envelope cc-sne have revealed a subclass of very energetic sne, termedbroad-lined sne (bl-sne) or hypernovae, which are characterised by broadabsorption lines in the early-time spectra, indicative of outer ejecta movingat very high velocity ($v \geq 0.1 c$). sne identified as bl in the early phaseshow large variations of core velocities at late phases, with some having muchhigher and some having similar velocities with respect to regular cc-sne. thismight indicate asphericity of the inner ejecta of bl-sne, a possibility weinvestigate using synthetic three-dimensional nebular spectra.

1003.5660	direct confirmation of the asymmetry of the cas a supernova with light  echoes	we report the first detection of asymmetry in a supernova (sn) photospherebased on sn light echo (le) spectra of cas a from the different perspectives ofdust concentrations on its le ellipsoid. new les are reported based ondifference images, and optical spectra of these les are analyzed and compared.after properly accounting for the effects of finite dust-filament extent andinclination, we find one field where the he i and h alpha features areblueshifted by an additional ~4000 km/s relative to other spectra and to thespectra of the type iib sn 1993j. that same direction does not show any shiftrelative to other cas a le spectra in the ca ii near-infrared triplet feature.we compare the perspectives of the cas a le dust concentrations with recentthree-dimensional modeling of the sn remnant (snr) and note that the locationhaving the blueshifted he i and h alpha features is roughly in the direction ofan fe-rich outflow and in the opposite direction of the motion of the compactobject at the center of the snr. we conclude that cas a was an intrinsicallyasymmetric sn. future le spectroscopy of this object, and of other historicalsne, will provide additional insight into the connection of explosion mechanismto sn to snr, as well as give crucial observational evidence regarding howstars explode.

1008.4353	displaying the heterogeneity of the sn 2002cx-like subclass of type ia  supernovae with observations of the pan-starrs-1 discovered sn2009ku	sn2009ku, discovered by pan-starrs-1, is a type ia supernova (snia), and amember of the distinct sn2002cx-like class of sneia. its light curves aresimilar to the prototypical sn2002cx, but are slightly broader and have a laterrise to maximum in g. sn2009ku is brighter (~0.6 mag) than other sn2002cx-likeobjects, peaking at m_v = -18.4 mag - which is still significantly fainter thantypical sneia. sn2009ku, which had an ejecta velocity of ~2000 kms^-1 at 18days after maximum brightness is spectroscopically most similar to sn2008ha,which also had extremely low-velocity ejecta. however, sn2008ha had anexceedingly low luminosity, peaking at m_v = -14.2 mag, ~4 mag fainter thansn2009ku. the contrast of high luminosity and low ejecta velocity for sn2009kuis contrary to an emerging trend seen for the sn2002cx class. sn2009ku is acounter-example of a previously held belief that the class was more homogeneousthan typical sneia, indicating that the class has a diverse progenitorpopulation and/or complicated explosion physics. as the first example of amember of this class of objects from the new generation of transient surveys,sn2009ku is an indication of the potential for these surveys to find rare andinteresting objects.

1102.4568	the chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33): the final source catalog	this study presents the final source catalog of the chandra acis survey ofm33 (chasem33). with a total exposure time of 1.4 ms, chasem33 covers ~70% ofthe d25 isophote (r\approx4kpc) of m33 and provides the deepest, most complete,and detailed look at a spiral galaxy in x-rays. the source catalog includes 662sources, reaches a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of ~2.4x10^(34) erg/s in the0.35-8.0kev energy band, and contains source positions, source net counts,fluxes and significances in several energy bands, and information on sourcevariability. the analysis challenges posed by chasem33 and the techniquesadopted to address these challenges are discussed. to constrain the nature ofthe detected x-ray source, hardness ratios were constructed and spectra werefit for 254 sources, followup mmt spectra of 116 sources were acquired, andcross-correlations with previous x-ray catalogs and other multi-wavelength datawere generated. based on this effort, 183 of the 662 chasem33 sources could beidentified. finally, the luminosity function for the detected point sources aswell as the one for the x-ray binaries in m33 is presented. the luminosityfunctions in the soft band (0.5-2.0 kev) and the hard band (2.0-8.0 kev) have alimiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 4.0x10^(34) erg/s and1.6x10^(35) erg/s (for d=817kpc), respectively, which is significantly lowerthan what was reported by previous x-ray binary population studies in galaxiesmore distant than m33. the resulting distribution is consistent with a dominantpopulation of high mass x-ray binaries as would be expected for m33.

1107.0009	confronting 2d delayed-detonation models with light curves and spectra  of type ia supernovae	we compare models for type ia supernova (sn ia) light curves and spectra withan extensive set of observations. the models come from a recent survey of 44two-dimensional delayed-detonation models computed by kasen, roepke &amp; woosley(2009), each viewed from multiple directions. the data include optical lightcurves of 251 sne ia and 2231 low-dispersion spectra from the center forastrophysics, plus data from the literature. the analysis uses standardtechniques employed by observers, including mlcs2k2, salt2, and snoopy forlight-curve analysis, and the supernova identification (snid) code of blondin &amp;tonry for spectroscopic comparisons to assess how well the models match thedata. we show that the models that match observed spectra best liesystematically on the observed width-luminosity relation. conversely, we rejectsix models with highly asymmetric ignition conditions and a large amount (&gt;1m_sun) of synthesized 56ni that yield poor matches to observed sn ia spectra.more subtle features of the comparison include the general difficulty of themodels to match the u-band flux at early times, caused by a hot ionized ejectathat affect the subsequent redistribution of flux at longer wavelengths. weexamine ways in which the asymptotic kinetic energy of the explosion affectsboth the predicted velocity and velocity gradient in the si ii and ca ii lines.models with an asymmetric distribution of 56ni are found to result in a largervariation of photometric and spectroscopic properties with viewing angle,regardless of the initial ignition setup. we discuss more generally whetherhighly anisotropic ignition conditions are ruled out by observations, and howdetailed comparisons between models and observations involving both lightcurves and spectra can lead to a better understanding of sn ia explosionmechanisms.

1107.3552	pan-starrs1 discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae at z ~ 0.9	we present the discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae (sne) at z ~ 0.9with the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey. these sne, ps1-10ky and ps1-10awh, areamongst the most luminous sne ever discovered, comparable to the unusualtransients sn 2005ap and scp 06f6. like sn 2005ap and scp 06f6, they showcharacteristic high luminosities (m_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a fewbroad absorption lines, and no evidence for h or he. we have constructed a fullmulti-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-seriesspectroscopy for these sne. given the similarities between the sne, we combinetheir light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course ofexplosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10^51 erg. we find photospheric velocities of12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of anoptically-thick massive shell of material. we show that, consistent withfindings for other ultra-luminous sne in this class, radioactive decay is notsufficient to power ps1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for theseevents: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse sn, orsn shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a wolf-rayetstar.

1109.0987	very early ultraviolet and optical observations of the type ia supernova  2009ig	supernova (sn) 2009ig was discovered 17 hours after explosion by the lickobservatory supernova search, promptly classified as a normal type ia sn (snia), peaked at v = 13.5 mag, and was equatorial, making it one of the foremostsupernovae for intensive study in the last decade. here, we present ultraviolet(uv) and optical observations of sn 2009ig, starting about 1 day afterexplosion until around maximum brightness. our data include excellent uv andoptical light curves, 25 premaximum optical spectra, and 8 uv spectra,including the earliest uv spectrum ever obtained of a sn ia. sn 2009ig is arelatively normal sn ia, but does display high-velocity ejecta - the ejectavelocity measured in our earliest spectra (v ~ -23,000 km/s for si ii 6355) isthe highest yet measured in a sn ia. the spectral evolution is very dramatic attimes earlier than 12 days before maximum brightness, but slows after thattime. the early-time data provide a precise measurement of 17.13 +/- 0.07 daysfor the sn rise time. the optical color curves and early-time spectra aresignificantly different from template light curves and spectra used forlight-curve fitting and k-corrections, indicating that the template lightcurves and spectra do not properly represent all type ia supernovae at veryearly times. in the age of wide-angle sky surveys, sne like sn 2009ig that arenearby, bright, well positioned, and promptly discovered will still be rare. asshown with sn 2009ig, detailed studies of single events can providesignificantly more information for testing systematic uncertainties related tosn ia distance estimates and constraining progenitor and explosion models thanlarge samples of more distant sne.

0710.2338	constraining cosmic evolution of type ia supernovae	we present the first large-scale effort of creating composite spectra ofhigh-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia) and comparing them to low-redshiftcounterparts. through the essence project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88high-redshift sne ia with excellent light-curve information. in addition, wehave obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift sne through a multiple-decade effortat lick and keck observatories, and we have used 45 uv spectra obtained byhst/iue. the low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to theessence spectra. in all instances, the essence and lick composite spectraappear very similar. the addition of galaxy light to the lick composite spectraallows a nearly perfect match of the overall spectral-energy distribution withthe essence composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift sne are morecontaminated with host-galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. thisis caused by observing objects at all redshifts with the same slit width, whichcorresponds to different projected distances. after correcting for thegalaxy-light contamination, subtle differences in the spectra remain. we haveestimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates fork-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. the variance in the composite spectra give anestimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum-light sn spectra of~3% in the optical and growing toward the uv. the difference between themaximum light low and high-redshift spectra constrain sn evolution between oursamples to be &lt; 10% in the rest-frame optical.

1203.4832	the spectroscopic diversity of type ia supernovae	we present 2603 spectra of 462 nearby type ia supernovae (sn ia) obtainedduring 1993-2008 through the center for astrophysics supernova program. most ofthe spectra were obtained with the fast spectrograph at the flwo 1.5m telescopeand reduced in a consistent manner, making data set well suited for studies ofsn ia spectroscopic diversity. we study the spectroscopic and photometricproperties of sn ia as a function of spectroscopic class using theclassification schemes of branch et al. and wang et al. the width-luminosityrelation appears to be steeper for sn ia with broader lines. based on theevolution of the characteristic si ii 6355 line, we propose improved methodsfor measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previouslysuspected, from ~0 to ~400 km/s/day considering the instantaneous velocitydecline rate at maximum light. we find a weaker and less significantcorrelation between si ii velocity and intrinsic b-v color at maximum lightthan reported by foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment ofuncertainties and host galaxy dust. we study the extent of nuclear burning andreport new detections of c ii 6580 in 23 early-time spectra. the frequency of cii detections is not higher in sn ia with bluer colors or narrower lightcurves, in conflict with the recent results of thomas et al. based on nebularspectra of 27 sn ia, we find no relation between the fwhm of the iron emissionfeature at ~4700 a and dm15(b) after removing the two low-luminosity sn 1986gand sn 1991bg, suggesting that the peak luminosity is not strongly dependent onthe kinetic energy of the explosion for most sn ia. finally, we confirm thecorrelation of velocity shifts in some nebular lines with the intrinsic b-vcolor of sn ia at maximum light, although several outliers suggest a possiblenon-monotonic behavior for the largest blueshifts.

1205.0252	an ultraviolet-optical flare from the tidal disruption of a helium-rich  stellar core	the flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star canbe used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant andundetected in the centres of distant galaxies. previous candidate flares havehad declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poorconstraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, becausethe rising emission was not observed. recently, two `relativistic' candidatetidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme x-ray luminosityand synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from arelativistic jet. here we report the discovery of a luminousultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at aredshift of 0.1696. the observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simpleaccreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decline of its light curvefollows the predicted mass accretion rate, and can be modelled to determine thetime of disruption to an accuracy of two days. the black hole has a mass ofabout 2 million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radiusof the star disrupted. on the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionizedhelium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was ahelium-rich stellar core.

1206.4050	ultra-luminous supernovae as a new probe of the interstellar medium in  distant galaxies	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery and light curves, and follow-up mmt andgemini spectroscopy of an ultra-luminous supernova (ulsn; dubbed ps1-11bam) ata redshift of z=1.566 with a peak brightness of m_uv=-22.3 mag. ps1-11bam isone of the highest redshift spectroscopically-confirmed sne known to date. thespectrum is characterized by broad absorption features typical of previousulsne (e.g., cii, siiii), and by strong and narrow mgii and feii absorptionlines from the interstellar medium (ism) of the host galaxy, confirmed by an[oii]3727 emission line at the same redshift. the equivalent widths of thefeii2600 and mgii2803 lines are in the top quartile of the quasar interveningabsorption system distribution, but are weaker than those of gamma-ray burstintrinsic absorbers (i.e., grb host galaxies). we also detect the host galaxyin pre-explosion pan-starrs1 data and find that its uv spectral energydistribution is best fit with a young stellar population age of tau~15-45 myrand a stellar mass of m \sim (1.1-2.6)x10^9 m_sun (for z=0.05-1 z_sun). thestar formation rate inferred from the uv continuum and [oii]3727 emission lineis ~10 m_sun/yr, higher than in any previous ulsn host. ps1-11bam provides thefirst direct demonstration that ulsne can serve as probes of the interstellarmedium in distant galaxies. at the present, the depth and red sensitivity ofps1 are uniquely suited to finding such events at cosmologically interestingredshifts (z~1-2); the future combination of lsst and 30-m class telescopespromises to extend this technique to z~4.

0712.0430	long gamma-ray bursts and type ic core collapse supernovae have similar  locations in hosts	when the afterglow fades at the site of a long-duration gamma-ray burst(lgrb), type ic supernovae (sn ic) are the only type of core collapse supernovaobserved. recent work found that a sample of lgrb in high-redshift galaxies haddifferent environments from a collection of core-collapse environments, whichwere identified from their colors and light curves. lgrb were in the brightestregions of their hosts, but the core-collapse sample followed the overalldistribution of the galaxy light. here we examine 504 supernovae with typesassigned based on their spectra that are located in nearby (z &lt; 0.06) galaxiesfor which we have constructed surface photometry from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). the distributions of the thermonuclear supernovae (sn ia) andsome varieties of core-collapse supernovae (sn ii and sn ib) follow the galaxylight, but the sn ic (like lgrb) are much more likely to erupt in the brightestregions of their hosts. the high-redshift hosts of lgrb are overwhelminglyirregulars, without bulges, while many low redshift sn ic hosts are spiralswith small bulges. when we remove the bulge light from our low-redshift sample,the sn ic and lgrb distributions agree extremely well. if both lgrb and sn icstem from very massive stars, then it seems plausible that the conditionsnecessary for forming sn ic are also required for lgrb. additional factors,including metallicity, may determine whether the stellar evolution of a massivestar leads to a lgrb with an underlying broad-lined sn ic, or simply a sn icwithout a gamma-ray burst.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

1303.1531	ps1-10bzj: a fast, hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova in a metal poor  host galaxy	we present observations and analysis of ps1-10bzj, a superluminous supernova(slsn) discovered in the pan-starrs medium deep survey at a redshift z = 0.650.spectroscopically, ps1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor slsne 2005ap andscp 06f6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (m_bol = -21.4mag) than previous events. we construct a bolometric light curve, and show thatwhile ps1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, itsluminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. weexplore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario andfind that either can fit the data. ps1-10bzj is located in the extended chandradeep field south and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys,including with the hubble space telescope. the host is a compact dwarf galaxy(m_b ~ -18 mag, diameter &lt; 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (m_* ~ 2.4 * 10^7m_sun), young stellar population (\tau_* ~ 5 myr), and a star formation rate of~ 2-3 m_sun/yr. the specific star formation rate is the highest seen in a slsnhost so far (~ 100 gyr^{-1}). we detect the [o iii]\lambda 4363 line, and finda low metallicity: 12+(o/h) = 7.8 +/- 0.2 (~ 0.1 z_sun). together, thisindicates that at least some of the progenitors of slsne come from young,low-metallicity populations.

1303.1818	ps1-12sk is a peculiar supernova from a he-rich progenitor system in a  brightest cluster galaxy environment	we report on our discovery and observations of the pan-starrs1 supernova (sn)ps1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation inits host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system modelsfor this class of explosion. the optical spectra of ps1-12sk classify it as atype ibn sn (c.f. sn 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) andtime variable he i emission. our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes therise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an nuv-nir sed with temperature &gt; 17x10^3 kand a peak rise magnitude of mz = -18.9 mag. sn ibn spectroscopic propertiesare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 m_sun)explosion within a he-enriched circumstellar medium. however, unlike previoustype ibn supernovae, ps1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightestcluster galaxy, cgcg 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster rxc j0844.9+4258. theexpected probability of an event like ps1-12sk in such environments is lowgiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse sne in red sequence galaxiescompounded by the low volumetric rate of sn ibn. furthermore, we find noevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (sigmahalpha &lt; 2x10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2). we therefore discuss white dwarf binarysystems as a possible progenitor channel for sne ibn. we conclude that ps1-12skrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidencefor a top-heavy imf in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first cluesuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for type ibn sne.

1306.2337	the fast and furious decay of the peculiar type ic supernova 2005ek	we present extensive multi-wavelength observations of the extremely rapidlydeclining type ic supernova, sn 2005ek. reaching a peak magnitude of m_r =-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, sn 2005ek isamong the fastest type i supernovae observed to date. the spectra of sn 2005ekclosely resemble those of normal sn ic, but with an accelerated evolution.there is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine dayspost-maximum. spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 msun thatis dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve isconsistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 msun of radioactive ni-56.although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., sn 1885a, sn 1939b, sn 2002bj,sn 2010x) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shellon a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with thisproposed mechanism. we find that the properties of sn 2005ek are consistentwith either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or theiron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. however,if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of sn 2005ek to other snic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarfprogenitor becomes very improbable. sn 2005ek may be one of the lowest massstripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. we find that the rateof such rapidly declining type i events is at least 1-3% of the normal sn iarate.

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.3824	systematic uncertainties associated with the cosmological analysis of  the first pan-starrs1 type ia supernova sample	we probe the systematic uncertainties from 113 type ia supernovae (snia) inthe pan-starrs1 (ps1) sample along with 197 sn ia from a combination oflow-redshift surveys. the companion paper by rest et al. (2013) describes thephotometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the ps1 sample. thelargest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of theps1 and low-z samples. we increase the sample of observed calspec standardsfrom 7 to 10 used to define the ps1 calibration system. the ps1 and sdss-iicalibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag arerecovered. we find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colorsand reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. weestimate masses of host galaxies of ps1 supernovae and detect an insignificantdifference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037\pm0.031 mag forhost galaxies with high and low masses. assuming flatness in our analysis ofonly sne measurements, we find $w = {-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)}^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}}$. with additional constraints from bao,cmb(planck) and h0 measurements, we find $w = -1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ and$\omega_m=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ (statistical and systematic errors added inquadrature). significance of the inconsistency with $w=-1$ depends on whetherwe use planck or wmap measurements of the cmb:$w_{\textrm{bao+h0+sn+wmap}}=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$.

1310.3828	cosmological constraints from measurements of type ia supernovae  discovered during the first 1.5 years of the pan-starrs1 survey	we present griz light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed type iasupernovae ($0.03 &lt; z &lt;0.65$) discovered during the first 1.5 years of thepan-starrs1 medium deep survey. the pan-starrs1 natural photometric system isdetermined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument responsefunction and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. we find thatthe systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2\%without accounting for the uncertainty in the hst calspec definition of the absystem. a hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 sne iathat pass our light curve quality cuts. the cosmological fit to 310 sne ia (113ps1 sne ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z sne ia), using only sne andassuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields$w=-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)} ^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}$.when combined with bao+cmb(planck)+$h_0$, the analysis yields $\omega_{\rmm}=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ and $w=-1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ including allidentified systematics (see also scolnic et al. 2014). the value of $w$ isinconsistent with the cosmological constant value of $-1$ at the 2.3$\sigma$level. tension endures after removing either the bao or the $h_0$ constraint,though it is strongest when including the $h_0$ constraint. if we include wmap9cmb constraints instead of those from planck, we find$w=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$, which diminishes the discord to $&lt;2\sigma$. wecannot conclude whether the tension with flat $\lambda$cdm is a feature of darkenergy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. the fullpan-starrs1 supernova sample with $\sim\!\!$3 times as many sne should providemore conclusive results.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.0026	hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts have similar host galaxies	we present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-ir photometry of 31 hostgalaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including 15 eventsfrom the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey. our sample spans the redshift range0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specificsubclass of cosmic explosions. combining the multi-band photometry andemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, starformation rates and metallicities. we find that as a whole, the hosts of slsneare a low-luminosity (&lt;m_b&gt; ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (&lt;m_*&gt; ~ 2 x 10^8m_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (&lt;ssfr&gt; ~ 2gyr^-1). the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +log(o/h}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solarmetallicity. the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are statistically distinct fromthe hosts of goods core-collapse sne (which cover a similar redshift range),but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) interms of stellar mass, sfr, ssfr and metallicity. this result indicates thatthe environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbsare similar, and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in lowmetallicity environments. we speculate that the key ingredient is large coreangular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in slsne and anaccreting black hole in lgrbs.

1401.2991	interaction between the broad-lined type ic supernova 2012ap and  carriers of diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are absorption features observed inoptical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated withcarbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. however, because thecentral wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronictransitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remaineduncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. here we report onunusually strong dibs in optical spectra of the broad-lined type ic supernovasn 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)timescales. the 4428 and 6283 angstrom dib features get weaker with time,whereas the 5780 angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. these nonuniformchanges suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of thedibs and that the dib carriers possess high ionization potentials, such assmall cations or charged fullerenes. we conclude that moderate-resolutionspectra of supernovae with dib absorptions obtained within weeks of outburstcould reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of theirprogenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of dibcarriers.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1405.3677	extensive hst ultraviolet spectra and multi-wavelength observations of  sn 2014j in m82 indicate reddening and circumstellar scattering by typical  dust	sn 2014j in m82 is the closest detected type ia supernova (sn ia) in at least28 years and perhaps in 410 years. despite its small distance of 3.3 mpc, sn2014j is surprisingly faint, peaking at v = 10.6 mag, and assuming a typical snia luminosity, we infer an observed visual extinction of a_v = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mag.but this picture, with r_v = 1.6 +/- 0.2, is too simple to account for allobservations. we combine 10 epochs (spanning a month) of hst/stis ultravioletthrough near-infrared spectroscopy with hst/wfc3, kait, and fancam photometryfrom the optical to the infrared and 9 epochs of high-resolution tresspectroscopy to investigate the sources of extinction and reddening for sn2014j. we argue that the wide range of observed properties for sn 2014j iscaused by a combination of dust reddening, likely originating in theinterstellar medium of m82, and scattering off circumstellar material. for thismodel, roughly half of the extinction is caused by reddening from typical dust(e(b-v ) = 0.45 mag and r_v = 2.6) and roughly half by scattering off lmc-likedust in the circumstellar environment of sn 2014j.

1405.3970	early observations and analysis of the type ia sn 2014j in m82	we present optical and near infrared (nir) observations of the nearby type iasn 2014j. seventeen optical and twenty-three nir spectra were obtained from 10days before ($-$10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum $b$-bandbrightness. the relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns ofdevelopment can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of thisperiod. carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify ci$\lambda$ 1.0693 in the nir spectra. we find that mgii lines with highoscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other mgii lines. weshow that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in opticaldepths due to oscillator strengths. the spectra of sn 2014j show it is a normalsn ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal andhigh-velocity subclasses. the velocities for oi, mgii, siii, sii, caii and feiisuggest that sn 2014j has a layered structure with little or no mixing. thatresult is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models. we alsoreport photometric observations, obtained from $-$10d to +29d, in the $ubvrijh$and $k_s$ bands. sn 2014j is about 3 magnitudes fainter than a normal sn ia atthe distance of m82, which we attribute to extinction in the host. the templatefitting package snoopy is used to interpret the light curves and to derivephotometric parameters. using $r_v$ = 1.46, which is consistent with previousstudies, snoopy finds that $a_v = 1.80$ for $e(b-v)_{host}=1.23 \pm 0.01$ mag.the maximum $b$-band brightness of $-19.19 \pm 0.10$ mag was reached onfebruary 1.74 ut $ \pm 0.13$ days and the supernova had a decline parameter of$\delta m_{15}=1.11 \pm 0.02$ mag.

1411.1060	zooming in on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae with the hst	we present hubble space telescope (hst) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of thehost galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including11 events from the pan-starrs medium deep survey. taking advantage of thesuperb angular resolution of hst, we characterize the galaxies' morphologicalproperties, sizes and star formation rate (sfr) densities. we determine thesupernova (sn) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometricmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the snpositions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness. wefind that the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are irregular, compact dwarfgalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. the uv-derived sfrdensities are high (&lt;sigma_sfr&gt; ~ 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that slsneform in overdense environments. their locations trace the uv light of theirhost galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regionsof their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normalcore-collapse sne), though cannot be statistically distinguished from eitherwith the current sample size. taken together, this strengthens the picture thatslsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinarycore-collapse sne to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies asdo lgrbs. if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightestregions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate adifferent, potentially lower-mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs.

1501.01314	selection of burst-like transients and stochastic variables using  multi-band image differencing in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey	we present a novel method for the light-curve characterization of pan-starrs1medium deep survey (ps1 mds) extragalactic sources into stochastic variables(sv) and burst-like (bl) transients, using multi-band image-differencingtime-series data. we select detections in difference images associated withgalaxy hosts using a star/galaxy catalog extracted from the deep ps1 mdsstacked images, and adopt a maximum a posteriori formulation to model theirdifference-flux time-series in four pan-starrs1 photometric bands g,r,i, and z.we use three deterministic light-curve models to fit burst-like transients andone stochastic light curve model, the ornstein-uhlenbeck process, in order tofit variability that is characteristic of active galactic nuclei (agn). weassess the quality of fit of the models band-wise source-wise, using theirestimated leave-out-one cross-validation likelihoods and corrected akaikeinformation criteria. we then apply a k-means clustering algorithm on thesestatistics, to determine the source classification in each band. the finalsource classification is derived as a combination of the individual filterclassifications. we use our clustering method to characterize 4361extragalactic image difference detected sources in the first 2.5 years of theps1 mds, into 1529 bl, and 2262 sv, with a purity of 95.00% for agn, and 90.97%for sn based on our verification sets. we combine our light-curveclassifications with their nuclear or off-nuclear host galaxy offsets, todefine a robust photometric sample of 1233 active galactic nuclei and 812supernovae. we use these samples to identify simple photometric priors thatwould enable their real-time identification in future wide-field synopticsurveys.

1501.06491	supernova 2013by: a type iil supernova with a iip-like light curve drop	we present multi-band ultraviolet and optical light curves, as well asvisual-wavelength and near-infrared spectroscopy of the type ii linear (iil)supernova (sn) 2013by. we show that sn 2013by and other sne iil in theliterature, after their linear decline phase that start after maximum, have asharp light curve decline similar to that seen in type ii plateau (iip)supernovae. this light curve feature has rarely been observed in other sne iildue to their relative rarity and the intrinsic faintness of this particularphase of the light curve. we suggest that the presence of this drop could beused as a physical parameter to distinguish between subclasses of sne ii,rather than their light curve decline rate shortly after peak. close inspectionof the spectra of sn 2013by indicate asymmetric line profiles and signatures ofhigh-velocity hydrogen. late (less than 90 days after explosion) near-infraredspectra of sn 2013by exhibit oxygen lines, indicating significant mixing withinthe ejecta. from the late-time light curve, we estimate that 0.029 solar massof 56ni was synthesized during the explosion. it is also shown that the v -bandlight curve slope is responsible for part of the scatter in the luminosity (vmagnitude 50 days after explosion) vs. 56ni relation. our observations of sn2013by and other sne iil through the onset of the nebular phase indicate thattheir progenitors are similar to those of sne iip.

1502.06964	galex detection of shock breakout in type ii-p supernova ps1-13arp:  implications for the progenitor star wind	we present the galex detection of a uv burst at the time of explosion of anoptically normal type ii-p supernova (ps1-13arp) from the pan-starrs1 survey atz=0.1665. the temperature and luminosity of the uv burst match the theoreticalpredictions for shock breakout in a red supergiant, but with a duration afactor of ~50 longer than expected. we compare the $nuv$ light curve ofps1-13arp to previous galex detections of type iip sne, and find cleardistinctions that indicate that the uv emission is powered by shock breakout,and not by the subsequent cooling envelope emission previously detected inthese systems. we interpret the ~ 1 d duration of the uv signal with a shockbreakout in the wind of a red supergiant with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate of~ 10^-3 msun yr^-1. this mass-loss rate is enough to prolong the duration ofthe shock breakout signal, but not enough to produce an excess in the opticalplateau light curve or narrow emission lines powered by circumstellarinteraction. this detection of non-standard, potentially episodic highmass-loss in a rsg sn progenitor has favorable consequences for the prospectsof future wide-field uv surveys to detect shock breakout directly in thesesystems, and provide a sensitive probe of the pre-explosion conditions of snprogenitors.

1503.02293	strong near-infrared carbon in the type ia supernova iptf13ebh	we present near-infrared (nir) time-series spectroscopy, as well ascomplementary ultraviolet (uv), optical, and nir data, of the type ia supernova(sn ia) iptf13ebh, which was discovered within two days from the estimated timeof explosion. the first nir spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosionand may be the earliest nir spectrum yet obtained of a sn ia. the most strikingfeatures in the spectrum are several nir c i lines, and the c i {\lambda}1.0693{\mu}m line is the strongest ever observed in a sn ia. interestingly, no strongoptical c ii counterparts were found, even though the optical spectroscopictime series began early and is densely-cadenced. except at the very earlyepochs, within a few days from the time of explosion, we show that the strongnir c i compared to the weaker optical c ii appears to be general in sne ia.iptf13ebh is a fast decliner with {\delta}m15(b) = 1.79 $\pm$ 0.01, and itsabsolute magnitude obeys the linear part of the width-luminosity relation. itis therefore categorized as a "transitional" event, on the fast-declining endof normal sne ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like objects. iptf13ebh showsnir spectroscopic properties that are distinct from both the normal andsubluminous/91bg-like classes, bridging the observed characteristics of the twoclasses. these nir observations suggest composition and density of the innercore similar to that of 91bg-like events, and a deep reaching carbon burninglayer not observed in slower declining sne ia. there is also a substantialdifference between the explosion times inferred from the early-time light curveand the velocity evolution of the si ii {\lambda}0.6355 {\mu}m line, implying along dark phase of ~ 4 days.

0805.2201	from shock breakout to peak and beyond: extensive panchromatic  observations of the type ib supernova 2008d associated with swift x-ray  transient 080109	we present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-infrared)and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on supernova (sn) 2008d aswell as x-ray data analysis on the associated swift/x-ray transient (xrt)080109. our data span a time range of 5 hours before the detection of the x-raytransient to 150 days after its detection, and detailed analysis allowed us toderive constraints on the nature of the sn and its progenitor; throughout wedraw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several keyaspects that differ. we show that the x-ray spectrum of xrt 080109 can be fitequally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal partsof both power law and blackbody. our data first established that sn 2008d is aspectroscopically normal sn ib (i.e., showing conspicuous he lines), and showthat sn 2008d had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest opticalpeak luminosity. the early-time light curves of the sn are dominated by acooling stellar envelope (for \delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the bluebands) followed by 56^ni decay. we construct a reliable measurement of thebolometric output for this stripped-envelope sn, and, combined with estimatesof e_k and m_ej from the literature, estimate the stellar radius r_star of itsprobable wolf-rayet progenitor. according to the model of waxman et al. and ofchevalier &amp; fransson, we derive r_star^{w07}= 1.2+/-0.7 r_sun andr_star^{cf08}= 12+/-7 r_sun, respectively; the latter being more in line withtypical wn stars. spectra obtained at 3 and 4 months after maximum light showdouble-peaked oxygen lines that we associate with departures from sphericalsymmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number of sn ibcores.

0805.4360	supernovae in early-type galaxies: directly connecting age and  metallicity with type ia luminosity	we have obtained optical spectra of 29 early-type (e/s0) galaxies that hostedtype ia supernovae (sne ia). we have measured absorption-line strengths andcompared them to a grid of models to extract the relations between thesupernova properties and the luminosity-weighted age/composition of the hostgalaxies. the same analysis was applied to a large number of early-type fieldgalaxies selected from the sdss spectroscopic survey. we find no difference inthe age and abundance distributions between the field galaxies and the sn iahost galaxies. we do find a strong correlation suggesting that sne ia ingalaxies whose populations have a characteristic age greater than 5 gyr are ~ 1mag fainter at v(max) than those found in galaxies with younger populations.however, the data cannot discriminate between a smooth relation connecting ageand supernova luminosity or two populations of sn ia progenitors. we find thatsn ia distance residuals in the hubble diagram are correlated with host-galaxymetal abundance, consistent with the predictions of timmes, brown &amp; truran(2003). the data show that high iron abundance galaxies host less-luminoussupernovae. we thus conclude that the time since progenitor formation primarilydetermines the radioactive ni production while progenitor metal abundance has aweaker influence on peak luminosity, but one not fully corrected by light-curveshape and color fitters. assuming no selection effects in discovering sne ia inlocal early-type galaxies, we find a higher specific sn ia rate in e/s0galaxies with ages below 3 gyr than in older hosts. the higher rate andbrighter luminosities seen in the youngest e/s0 hosts may be a result of recentstar formation and represents a tail of the "prompt" sn ia progenitors.

astro-ph;0010614	preliminary spectral analysis of the type ii supernova 1999em	we have calculated fast direct spectral model fits to two early-time spectraof the type-ii plateau sn 1999em, using the synow synthetic spectrum code. thefirst is an extremely early blue optical spectrum and the second a combined hstand optical spectrum obtained one week later. spectroscopically this supernovaappears to be a normal type ii and these fits are in excellent agreement withthe observed spectra. our direct analysis suggests the presence of enhancednitrogen. we have further studied these spectra with the full nlte generalmodel atmosphere code phoenix. while we do not find confirmation for enhancednitrogen (nor do we rule it out), we do require enhanced helium. an even moreintriguing possible line identification is complicated balmer and he i lines,which we show falls naturally out of the detailed calculations with a shallowdensity gradient. we also show that very early spectra such as those presentedhere combined with sophisticated spectral modeling allows an independentestimate of the total reddening to the supernova, since when the spectrum isvery blue, dereddening leads to changes in the blue flux that cannot bereproduced by altering the ``temperature'' of the emitted radiation. theseresults are extremely encouraging since they imply that detailed modeling ofearly spectra can shed light on both the abundances and total extinction of sneii, the latter improving their utility and reliability as distance indicators.

astro-ph;0205337	the axially symmetric ejecta of supernova 1987a	extensive early observations proved that the ejecta of supernova 1987a (sn1987a) are aspherical. fifteen years after the supernova explosion, the hubblespace telescope has resolved the rapidly expanding ejecta. the late-time imagesand spectroscopy provide a geometrical picture that is consistent with earlyobservations and suggests a highly structured, axially symmetric geometry. wepresent here a new synthesis of the old and new data. we show that the bochumevent, presumably a clump of $^{56}$ni, and the late-time image, the locus ofexcitation by $^{44}$ti, are most naturally accounted for by sharing a commonposition angle of about 14\degree, the same as the mystery spot and earlyspeckle data on the ejecta, and that they are both oriented along the axis ofthe inner circumstellar ring at 45\degree to the plane of the sky. we alsodemonstrate that the polarization represents a prolate geometry with the sameposition angle and axis as the early speckle data and the late-time image andhence that the geometry has been fixed in time and throughout the ejecta. thebochum event and the doppler kinematics of the [ca ii]/[o ii] emission inspatially resolved hst spectra of the ejecta can be consistently integratedinto this geometry. the radioactive clump is deduced to fall approximatelyalong the axis of the inner circumstellar ring and therefore to be redshiftedin the north whereas the [ca ii]/[o ii] 7300 \aa emission is redshifted in thesouth. we present a jet-induced model for the explosion and argue that such amodel can account for many of the observed asymmetries. in the jet models, theoxygen and calcium are not expected to be distributed along the jet, butprimarily in an expanding torus that shares the plane and northern blue shiftof the inner circumstellar ring.

astro-ph;0208382	the progenitor of supernova 1993j revisited	from hubble space telescope images with 0.05" resolution we identify fourstars brighter than v=25 mag within 2.5" of sn 1993j in m81 which contaminatedprevious ground-based brightness estimates for the supernova progenitor.correcting for the contamination, we find that the energy distribution of theprogenitor is consistent with that of an early k-type supergiant star with m_v\~ -7.0 +/- 0.4 mag and an initial mass of 13--22 msun. the brightnesses of thenearby stars are sufficient to account for the excess blue light seen from theground in pre-explosion observations. therefore, the sn 1993j progenitor didnot necessarily have a blue companion, although by 2001, fainter blue stars areseen in close proximity to the supernova. these observations do not stronglylimit the mass of a hypothetical companion. a blue dwarf star with a mass up to30 msun could have been orbiting the progenitor without being detected in theground-based images. explosion models and observations show that the sn 1993jprogenitor had a helium-rich envelope. to test whether the helium abundancecould influence the energy distribution of the progenitor, we calculated modelsupergiant atmospheres with a range of plausible helium abundances. the modelsshow that the pre-supernova colors are not strongly affected by the heliumabundance longward of 4000 a, and abundances ranging between solar and 90%helium (by number) are all consistent with the observations.

astro-ph;0509557	the unique type ib supernova 2005bf: a wn star explosion model for  peculiar light curves and spectra	observations and modeling for the light curve (lc) and spectra of supernova(sn) 2005bf are reported. this sn showed unique features: the lc had twomaxima, and declined rapidly after the second maximum, while the spectra showedstrengthening he lines whose velocity increased with time. the double-peaked lccan be reproduced by a double-peaked $^{56}$ni distribution, with most$^{56}$ni at low velocity and a small amount at high velocity. the rapidpost-maximum decline requires a large fraction of the $\gamma$-rays to escapefrom the $^{56}$ni-dominated region, possibly because of low-density ``holes''.the presence of balmer lines in the spectrum suggests that the he layer of theprogenitor was substantially intact. increasing $\gamma$-ray deposition in thehe layer due to enhanced $\gamma$-ray escape from the $^{56}$ni-dominatedregion may explain both the delayed strengthening and the increasing velocityof the he lines. the sn has massive ejecta ($\sim6-7\msun$), normal kineticenergy ($\sim 1.0-1.5\times 10^{51}$ ergs), high peak bolometric luminosity($\sim 5\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for an epoch as late as $\sim$ 40 days,and a large $^{56}$ni mass ($\sim0.32\msun$). these properties, and thepresence of a small amount of h suggest that the progenitor was initiallymassive (m$\sim 25-30 \msun$) and had lost most of its h envelope, and waspossibly a wn star. the double-peaked $^{56}$ni distribution suggests that theexplosion may have formed jets that did not reach the he layer. the propertiesof sn 2005bf resemble those of the explosion of cassiopeia a.

astro-ph;0512572	hydrogen and helium traces in type ib-c supernovae	the spectroscopic properties of a selected optical photospheric spectra ofcore collapse supernovae (ccsne) are investigated.special attention is devotedto traces of hydrogen at early phases.  the generated spectra are found to match the observed ones reasonably well,including a list of only 23 candidate ions. guided by sn ib 1990i, the observedtrough near 6300\aa is attributed to h$\alpha$ in almost all type ib events,although in some objects it becomes too weak to be discernible, especially atlater phases. alternative line identifications are discussed. differences inthe way hydrogen manifests its presence within ccsne are highlighted. in typeib sne, the h$\alpha$ contrast velocity (i.e. line velocity minus thephotospheric velocity) seems to increase with time at early epochs, reachingvalues as high as 8000 km s$^{-1}$ around 15-20 days after maximum and thenremains almost constant. the derived photospheric velocities, indicate a lowervelocity for type ii sne 1987a and 1999em as compared to sn ic 1994i and sn iib1993j, while type ib events display a somewhat larger variation. the scatter,around day 20, is measured to be $\sim$5000 km s$^{-1}$. following two simpleapproaches, rough estimates of ejecta and hydrogen masses are given. a mass ofhydrogen of approximately 0.02 $m_\odot$ is obtained for sn 1990i, while sne1983n and 2000h ejected $\sim$0.008 $m_\odot$ and $\sim$0.08 $m_\odot$ ofhydrogen, respectively. sn 1993j has a higher hydrogen mass, $\sim 0.7$$m_\odot$ with a large uncertainty. a low mass and thin hydrogen layer withvery high ejection velocities above the helium shell, is thus the most likelyscenario for type ib sne. some interesting and curious issues relating tooxygen lines suggest future investigations.

astro-ph;0701041	observational constraints on the nature of the dark energy: first  cosmological results from the essence supernova survey	we present constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter,w=p/(rho c^2), using 60 type ia supernovae (sne ia) from the essence supernovasurvey. we derive a set of constraints on the nature of the dark energyassuming a flat universe. by including constraints on (omega_m, w) from baryonacoustic oscillations, we obtain a value for a static equation-of-stateparameter w=-1.05^{+0.13}_{-0.12} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.11 (sys) andomega_m=0.274^{+0.033}_{-0.020} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fit chi^2/dof of0.96. these results are consistent with those reported by the supernova legacysurvey in a similar program measuring supernova distances and redshifts. weevaluate sources of systematic error that afflict supernova observations andpresent monte carlo simulations that explore these effects. currently, thelargest systematic currently with the potential to affect our measurements isthe treatment of extinction due to dust in the supernova host galaxies.combining our set of essence sne ia with the supernova legacy survey sne ia, weobtain a joint constraint of w=-1.07^{+0.09}_{-0.09} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.12(sys), omega_m=0.267^{+0.028}_{-0.018} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fitchi^2/dof of 0.91. the current sn ia data are fully consistent with acosmological constant.

astro-ph;0701246	measured metallicities at the sites of nearby broad-lined type ic  supernovae and implications for the sn-grb connection	we compare the chemical abundances at the sites of 12 nearby (z &lt;0.14) typeic supernovae (sn ic) that showed broad lines, but had no observed gamma-rayburst (grb), with the chemical abundances in 5 nearby (z &lt; 0.25) galaxies atthe sites of grb where broad-lined sn ic were seen after the fireball hadfaded. it has previously been noted that grb hosts are low in luminosity andlow in their metal abundances. if low metallicity is sufficient to force theevolution of massive stars to end their lives as grb with an accompanyingbroad-lined sn ic, then we would expect higher metal abundances for thebroad-lined sn ic that have no detected grb. this is what we observe, and thistrend is independent of the choice of metallicity calibration we adopt, and themode of sn survey that found the broad-lined sn. a unique feature of thisanalysis is that we present new spectra of the host galaxies and analyze allthe measurements of both samples in the same set of ways, using the galaxyemission-line measurements corrected for extinction and stellar absorption, viaindependent metallicity diagnostics of kewley &amp; dopita (2002), of mcgaugh(1991) and of pettini &amp; pagel (2004). in our small sample, the boundary betweengalaxies that have grb accompanying their broad-lined sn ic and those that havebroad-lined sn ic without a grb lies at an oxygen abundance of 12+log(o/h)_kd02~ 8.5, which corresponds to 0.2-0.6 z_sun depending on the adopted metallicityscale and solar abundance value. even when we limit the comparison to sn icthat were found in untargeted supernova surveys, the environment of everybroad-lined sn ic that had no grb is more metal rich than the site of anybroad-lined sn ic where a grb was detected.

astro-ph;9512058	the environment of ``e+a'' galaxies	the violent star formation history of ``e+a'' galaxies and their detectionalmost exclusively in distant clusters is frequently used to link them to the``butcher-oemler effect'' and to argue that cluster environment influencesgalaxy evolution. from 11113 spectra in the las campanas redshift survey, wehave obtained a unique sample of 21 nearby ``e+a" galaxies. surprisingly, alarge fraction (about 75%) of these ``e+a''s lie in the field. therefore,interactions with the cluster environment, in the form of the icm or clusterpotential, are not essential for ``e+a'' formation. if one mechanism isresponsible for ``e+a''s, their existence in the field and the tidal featuresin at least 5 of the 21 argue that galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers arethat mechanism. the most likely environments for such interactions are poorgroups, which have lower velocity dispersions than clusters and higher galaxydensities than the field. in hierarchical models, groups fall into clusters ingreater numbers at intermediate redshifts than they do today. thus, thebutcher-oemler effect may reflect the typical evolution of galaxies in groupsand in the field rather than the influence of clusters on star formation ingalaxies. this abstract is abridged.

astro-ph;9610021	the evolution of ultraviolet emission lines from the circumstellar  material surrounding sn 1987a	the presence of narrow high-temperature emission lines from nitrogen-rich gasclose to sn 1987a has been the principal observational constraint on the evolu-tionary status of the supernova's progenitor. a new analysis of the completefive-year set of low and high resolution iue ultraviolet spectra of sn 1987a(1987.2--1992.3) provide fluxes for the n v 1240, n iv] 1486, he ii 1640, oiii]1665, niii] 1751, and ciii] 1908 lines with significantly reduced random andsystematic errors and reveals significant short-term fluctuations in the lightcurves. the n v, n iv] and n iii] lines turn on sequentially over 15 to 20 daysand show a progression from high to low ionization potential, implying an ioni-zation gradient in the emitting region. the line emission turns on suddenly at83+/-4 days after the explosion, as defined by n iv]. the n iii] line reachespeak luminosity at 399+/-15 days. a ring radius of (6.24+/-0.20)e{17} cm andinclination of 41.0+/-3.9 is derived from these times, assuming a circularring. the probable role of resonant scattering in the n v light curveintroduces systematic errors that leads us to exclude this line from the timinganalysis. a new nebular analysis yields improved cno abundance ratiosn/c=6.1+/-1.1 and n/o=1.7+/-0.5, confirming the nitrogen enrichment found inour previous paper. from the late-time behavior of the light curves we findthat the emission origi- nates from progressively lower density gas. weestimate the emitting mass near maximum (roughly 400 days) to be roughly4.7e{-2} solar masses, assuming a filling factor of unity and an electrondensity of 2.6e4 cm^{-3}. these results are discussed in the context of currentmodels for the emission and hydrodynamics of the ring.

astro-ph;9707260	time dilation from spectral feature age measurements of type ia  supernovae	we have developed a quantitative, empirical method for estimating the age oftype ia supernovae (sne ia) from a single spectral epoch. the techniqueexamines the goodness of fit of spectral features as a function of the temporalevolution of a large database of sne ia spectral features. when a sn iaspectrum with good signal-to-noise ratio over the rest frame range 3800 to 6800a is available, the precision of a spectral feature age (sfa) is (1-sigma) ~1.4 days. sfa estimates are made for two spectral epochs of sn 1996bj (z=0.574)to measure the rate of aging at high redshift. in the 10.05 days which elapsedbetween spectral observations, sn 1996bj aged 3.35 $\pm$ 3.2 days, consistentwith the 6.38 days of aging expected in an expanding universe and inconsistentwith no time dilation at the 96.4 % confidence level. the precision to whichindividual features constrain the supernova age has implications for the sourceof inhomogeneities among sne ia.

astro-ph;9710123	constraints on cosmological models from hubble space telescope  observations of high-z supernovae	we have coordinated hubble space telescope photometry with ground-baseddiscovery for three supernovae: two sn ia near z~0.5 (sn 1997ce, sn 1997cj) anda third event at z=0.97 (sn 1997ck). the superb spatial resolution of hstseparates each supernova from its host galaxy and leads to good precision inthe light curves. the hst data combined with ground-based photometry providegood temporal coverage. we use these light curves and relations betweenluminosity, light curve shape, and color calibrated from low-z samples toderive relative luminosity distances which are accurate to 10% at z~0.5 and 20%at z=1. the redshift-distance relation is used to place constraints on theglobal mean matter density, omega_matter, and the normalized cosmologicalconstant, omega_lambda. when the hst sample is combined with the distance to sn1995k (z=0.48), analyzed by the same precepts, it suggests that matter alone isinsufficient to produce a flat universe. specifically, foromega_matter+omega_lambda=1, omega_matter is less than 1 with &gt;95% confidence,and our best estimate of omega_matter is -0.1 +/- 0.5 if omega_lambda=0.although the present result is based on a very small sample whose systematicsremain to be explored, it demonstrates the power of hst measurements for highredshift supernovae.

astro-ph;9806396	supernova limits on the cosmic equation of state	we use type ia supernovae studied by the high-z supernova search team toconstrain the properties of an energy component which may have contributed toaccelerating the cosmic expansion. we find that for a flat geometry theequation of state parameter for the unknown component, alpha_x=p_x/rho_x, mustbe less than -0.55 (95% confidence) for any value of omega_m and is furtherlimited to alpha_x&lt;-0.60 (95%) if omega_m is assumed to be greater than 0.1 .these values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topologicaldefects such as domain walls, strings, or textures. the supernova data areconsistent with a cosmological constant (alpha_x=-1) or a scalar field whichhas had, on average, an equation of state parameter similar to the cosmologicalconstant value of -1 over the redshift range of z=1 to the present. supernovaand cosmic microwave background observations give complementary constraints onthe densities of matter and the unknown component. if only matter and vacuumenergy are considered, then the current combined data sets provide directevidence for a spatially flat universe with omega_tot=omega_m+omega_lambda =0.94 +/- 0.26 (1-sigma).

0811.0002	a second case of variable na i d lines in a highly-reddened type ia  supernova	recent high-resolution spectra of the type ia sn 2006x have revealed thepresence of time-variable and blueshifted na i d features, interpreted by patatet al. as originating in circumstellar material within the progenitor system.the variation seen in sn 2006x induces relatively large changes in the total nai d equivalent width (\delta ew ~ 0.5 a in just over two weeks), that would bedetectable at lower resolutions. we have used a large data set comprising 2400low-resolution spectra of 450 type ia supernovae (sne ia) obtained by the cfasupernova program to search for variable na i d features. out of the 31 sne ia(including sn 2006x) in which we could have detected similar ew variations,only one other (sn 1999cl) shows variable na i d features, with an even largerchange over a similar ~10-day timescale (\delta ew = 1.66 +/- 0.21 a).interestingly, both sn 1999cl and sn 2006x are the two most highly-reddenedobjects in our sample, raising the possibility that the variability isconnected to dusty environments.

0811.1205	a golden standard type ia supernova sn 2005cf: observations from the  ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavebands	we present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (uv), optical, andnear-infrared (nir) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra,for the normal type ia supernova (sn ia) 2005cf. from the well-sampled lightcurves, we find that sn 2005cf reached a b-band maximum at 13.63+/-0.02 mag,with an observed luminosity decline rate dm_15(b) = 1.05+/-0.03 mag. thecorrelations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibratedon the basis of an expanded sn ia sample, yielded e(b-v)_host=0.09+/-0.03 magfor sn2005cf. the uv photometry was obtained with the hst and the swiftultraviolet/optical telescope, and the results match each other to within0.1-0.2 mag. the uv light curves show similar evolution to the broadband u,with an exception in the 2000-2500 angstrom spectral range (corresponding tothe f220w/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainterthan that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution).combining the uv data with the ground-based optical and nir data, we establishthe generic uv-optical-nir bolometric light curve for sn 2005cf and derive thebolometric corrections in the absence of uv and/or nir data. the overallspectral evolution of sn 2005cf is similar to that of a normal sn ia, but withvariety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. the spectra atearly times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (hv) features in the ca iih&amp;k doublet and nir triplet. similar hv features may exist in the siii 6355absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in theearliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be commonin other normal sne ia. the possible origin of the hv absorption features isbriefly discussed (abridged).

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.
