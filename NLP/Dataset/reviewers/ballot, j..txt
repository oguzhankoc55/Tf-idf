0905.0070	effects of resolution and helium abundance in a star surface convection  simulations	we present results from 2d radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of fullycompressible convection for the surface layers of a-type stars with the antarescode. spectroscopic indicators for photospheric convective velocity fields showa maximum of velocities near teff ~8000 k. in that range the largest values aremeasured for the subgroup of am stars. thus far, no prognostic model, neithertheoretical nor numerical, is able to exactly reproduce the line profiles ofsharp line a and am stars in that temperature range. in general, the heliumabundance of a stars is not known from observations. hence, we have consideredtwo extreme cases for our simulations: a solar helium abundance as an upperlimit and zero helium abundance as a lower limit. the simulation for the heliumfree case is found to differ from the case with solar helium abundance bylarger velocities, larger flow structures, and by a sign reversal of the fluxof kinetic energy inside the hydrogen ionisation zone. both simulations showextended shock fronts emerging from the optical surface, as well as mixing farbelow the region of partial ionisation of hydrogen, and vertical oscillationsemerging after initial perturbations have been damped. we discuss problemsrelated to the rapid radiative cooling at the surface of a-type stars such asresolution and efficient relaxation. the present work is considered as a steptowards a systematic study of convection in a- to f-type stars, encouraged bythe new data becoming available for these objects from both asteroseismologicalmissions and from high resolution spectroscopy.

0906.0766	radius determination of solar-type stars using asteroseismology: what to  expect from the kepler mission	for distant stars, as observed by the nasa kepler satellite, parallaxinformation is currently of fairly low quality and is not complete. this limitsthe precision with which the absolute sizes of the stars and their potentialtransiting planets can be determined by traditional methods. asteroseismologywill be used to aid the radius determination of stars observed during nasa'skepler mission. we report on the recent asteroflag hare-and-hounds exercise#2,where a group of `hares' simulated data of f-k main-sequence stars that a groupof `hounds' sought to analyze, aimed at determining the stellar radii. based onthe asteroseismic large frequency spacing, obtained from simulations of 4-yeartime series data from the kepler mission, we demonstrate that the stellar radiican be correctly and precisely determined, when combined with traditionalstellar parameters from the kepler input catalogue. the radii found by thevarious methods used by each independent hound generally agree with the truevalues of the artificial stars to within 3%, when the large frequency spacingis used. this is 5--10 times better than the results where seismology is notapplied. these results give strong confidence that radius estimation can beperformed to better than 3% for solar-like stars using automatic pipelinereduction. even when the stellar distance and luminosity are unknown we canobtain the same level of agreement.

0907.1139	analysing solar-like oscillations with an automatic pipeline	kepler mission will provide a huge amount of asteroseismic data during thenext few years, among which hundreds of solar-like stars will be targeted. theamount of stars and their observation length represent a step forward in thecomprehension of the stellar evolution that has already been initiated by corotand most missions. up to now, the slow cadence of observed targets allowed anindividual and personalized analysis of each star. during the survey phase ofkepler, this will be impossible. this is the reason why, within the asteroflagteam, we have been developing automatic pipelines for the kepler solar-likeoscillation stars. our code starts by finding the frequency-range where p-modepower is present and, after fitting the background, it looks for the modeamplitudes as well as the central frequency of the p-mode hump. a goodestimation of the large separation can thus be inferred in this region. if thesignal to noise is high enough, the code obtains the characteristics of the pmodes by doing a global fitting on the power spectrum. here, we will firstdescribe a few features of this pipeline and its application to asteroflagsynthetic data to check the validity of the code.

0912.3367	determining global parameters of the oscillations of solar-like stars	helioseismology has enabled us to better understand the solar interior, whilealso allowing us to better constrain solar models. but now is a tremendousepoch for asteroseismology as space missions dedicated to studying stellaroscillations have been launched within the last years (most and corot). corothas already proved valuable results for many types of stars, while kepler,which was launched in march 2009, will provide us with a huge number of seismicdata very soon. this is an opportunity to better constrain stellar models andto finally understand stellar structure and evolution. the goal of thisresearch work is to estimate the global parameters of any solar-likeoscillating target in an automatic manner. we want to determine the globalparameters of the acoustic modes (large separation, range of excited pressuremodes, maximum amplitude, and its corresponding frequency), retrieve thesurface rotation period of the star and use these results to estimate theglobal parameters of the star (radius and mass).to prepare the analysis ofhundreds of solar-like oscillating stars, we have developed a robust andautomatic pipeline. the pipeline consists of data analysis techniques, such asfast fourier transform, wavelets, autocorrelation, as well as the applicationof minimisation algorithms for stellar-modelling. we apply our pipeline to somesimulated lightcurves from the asteroflag team and the aarhus-asteroflagsimulator, and obtain results that are consistent with the input data to thesimulations. our strategy gives correct results for stars with magnitudes below11 with only a few 10% of bad determinations among the reliable results. wethen apply the pipeline to the sun and three corot targets.in particular wedetermine the parameters of the sun, hd49933, hd181906, and hd181420.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1003.5178	inpainting: a powerful interpolation technique for helio- and  asteroseismic data	in helio- and asteroseismology, it is important to have continuous,uninterrupted, data sets. however, seismic observations usually contain gapsand we need to take them into account. in particular, if the gaps are notrandomly distributed, they will produce a peak and a series of harmonics in theperiodogram that will destroy the stellar information. an interpolation of thedata can be good solution for this problem. in this paper we have studied aninterpolation method based on the so-called 'inpainting' algorithms. to checkthe algorithm, we used both virgo and corot satellite data to which we applieda realistic artificial window of a real corot observing run to introduce gaps.next we compared the results with the original, non-windowed data. therefore,we were able to optimize the algorithm by minimizing the difference between thepower spectrum density of the data with gaps and the complete time series. ingeneral, we find that the power spectrum of the inpainted time series is verysimilar to the original, unperturbed one. seismic inferences obtained afterinterpolating the data are the same as in the original case.

1005.0275	gravity modes in rapidly rotating stars. limits of perturbative methods	corot and kepler missions are now providing high-quality asteroseismic datafor a large number of stars. among intermediate-mass and massive stars, fastrotators are common objects. taking the rotation effects into account is neededto correctly understand, identify, and interpret the observed oscillationfrequencies of these stars. a classical approach is to consider the rotation asa perturbation. in this paper, we focus on gravity modes, such as thoseoccurring in gamma doradus, slowly pulsating b (spb), or be stars. we aim todefine the suitability of perturbative methods. with the two-dimensionaloscillation program (top), we performed complete computations of gravity modes-including the coriolis force, the centrifugal distortion, and compressibleeffects- in 2-d distorted polytropic models of stars. we started with the modesl=1, n=1-14, and l=2-3, n=1-5,16-20 of a nonrotating star, and followed thesemodes by increasing the rotation rate up to 70% of the break-up rotation rate.we then derived perturbative coefficients and determined the domains ofvalidity of the perturbative methods. second-order perturbative methods aresuited to computing low-order, low-degree mode frequencies up to rotationspeeds ~100 km/s for typical gamma dor stars or ~150 km/s for b stars. thedomains of validity can be extended by a few tens of km/s thanks to thethird-order terms. for higher order modes, the domains of validity arenoticeably reduced. moreover, perturbative methods are inefficient for modeswith frequencies lower than the coriolis frequency 2omega. we interpret thisfailure as a consequence of a modification in the shape of the resonant cavitythat is not taken into account in the perturbative approach.

1009.5939	p-modes in rapidly rotating stars -- looking for regular patterns in  synthetic asymptotic spectra	according to a recent ray-based asymptotic theory, the high-frequency p-modespectrum of rapidly rotating stars is a superposition of frequency subsetsassociated with dynamically independent regions of the ray-dynamics phasespace. at high rotation rates corresponding to typical $\delta$ scuti stars,two frequency subsets are expected to be visible : a regular frequency subsetdescribed by a tassoul like formula and an irregular frequency subset withspecific statistical properties. in this paper, we investigate whether theregular patterns can be detected in the resulting spectrum. we compute theautocorrelation function of synthetic spectra where the frequencies follow theasymptotic theory, the relative amplitudes are simply given by the modes'disk-averaging factors, and the frequency resolution is that of a corot longrun. our first results are that (i) the detection of regular patterns stronglydepends on the ratio of regular over irregular modes, (ii) low inclinationangle configurations are more favorable than near equator-on configurations,(iii) in the absence of differential rotation, the $2 \omega$ rotationalsplitting between $m=1$ and $m=-1$ modes is an easy feature to detect.

1102.0779	constraining mixing processes in stellar cores using asteroseismology.  impact of semiconvection in low-mass stars	the overall evolution of low-mass stars is heavily influenced by theprocesses occurring in the stellar interior. in particular, mixing processes inconvectively unstable zones and overshooting regions affect the resultingobservables and main sequence lifetime. we study the effects of differentconvective boundary definitions and mixing prescriptions in convective cores oflow-mass stars, to discriminate the existence, size, and evolutionary stage ofthe central mixed zone by means of asteroseismology. we implemented the ledouxcriterion for convection in our stellar evolution code, together with atime-dependent diffusive approach for mixing of elements when semiconvectivezones are present. we compared models with masses ranging from 1 m* to 2 m*computed with two different criteria for convective boundary definition andincluding different mixing prescriptions within and beyond the formal limits ofthe convective regions. using calculations of adiabatic oscillationsfrequencies for a large set of models, we developed an asteroseismic diagnosisusing only l=0 and l=1 modes based on the ratios of small to large separationsr01 and r10 defined by roxburgh &amp; vorontsov (2003). these variables are almostlinear in the expected observable frequency range, and we show that their slopedepends simultaneously on the central hydrogen content, the extent of theconvective core, and the amplitude of the sound-speed discontinuity at the coreboundary. by considering about 25 modes and an accuracy in the frequencydeterminations as expected from the corot and kepler missions, the technique wepropose allows us to detect the presence of a convective core and todiscriminate the different sizes of the homogeneously mixed central regionwithout the need of a strong a priori for the stellar mass.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

0711.1050	on the backwards difference filter	it is usual in helioseismology to remove unwanted instrumental low-frequencytrends by applying high-pass filters to the time series. however, the choice ofthe filter is very important because it can keep the periodic signalsthroughout the spectrum. at the same time, these filters should not introduceany spurious effects on the remaining signal, which would modify the periodicsignatures in the fourier domain. one of the most used filters is the so-calledbackwards difference filter that can be applied when the time series areregularly sampled. the problem of this filter is that the amplitudes and thephases of the periodic signals in the fourier domain are modified and,therefore, their extracted amplitudes are biased when the frequency of theperiodic signals decreases. the objective of this research note is to give acorrection that could be applied to the power spectrum to over come thisproblem. we properly derive the transfer function of the backwards differencefilter and we show how this can be applied to the power spectrum to correct theamplitudes. for the amplitude spectrum and the time series, we also derive acorrection for the phase. the amplitudes of the periodic signals in theresultant power spectrum density are corrected from the cut-off frequency downto zero.

1208.6294	verifying asteroseismically determined parameters of kepler stars using  hipparcos parallaxes: self-consistent stellar properties and distances	accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance forcharacterizing stellar populations in our galaxy. the field of asteroseismologyhas been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars indifferent evolutionary stages. however, to fully exploit its potential, robustmethods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independentverification of the results is mandatory. with this purpose, we present a newtechnique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis withthe infrared flux method. by using two global seismic observables andmulti-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii,effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field starsin a self-consistent manner. we apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillatorsin the kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate hipparcos parallaxes.our distance determinations agree to better than 5%, while measurements ofspectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validateour results. we briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellarpopulation analysis and models of galactic chemical evolution.

1212.0630	constraining magnetic-activity modulations in 3~solar-like stars  observed by corot and narval	stellar activity cycles are the manifestation of dynamo process running inthe stellar interiors. they have been observed during years to decades thanksto the measurement of stellar magnetic proxies at the surface of the stars suchas the chromospheric and x-ray emissions, and the measurement of the magneticfield with spectropolarimetry. however, all of these measurements rely onexternal features that cannot be visible during for example, a maunder-typeminimum. with the advent of long observations provided by space asteroseismicmissions, it has been possible to pierce inside the stars and study theirproperties. moreover, the acoustic-mode properties are also perturbed by thepresence of these dynamos. we track the temporal variations of the amplitudesand frequencies of acoustic modes allowing us to search for signature ofmagnetic activity cycles, as has already been done in the sun and in the corottarget hd49933. we use asteroseimic tools and more classical spectroscopicmeasurements performed with the narval spectropolarimeter to check if there arehints of any activity cycle in three solar-like stars observed continuously bythe corot satellite: hd49385, hd181420, and hd52265.our analysis gives verysmall variation of the seismic parameters preventing us from detecting anymagnetic modulation. however we are able to provide a lower limit of anymagnetic-activity change in the three stars that should be longer than 120days, which is the length of the time series. moreover we computed the upperlimit for the line-of-sight magnetic field component. more seismic andspectroscopic data would be required to have a firm detection in these stars.

1311.6990	study of kic 8561221 observed by kepler: an early red giant showing  depressed dipolar modes	the continuous high-precision photometric observations provided by the corotand kepler space missions have allowed us to better understand the structureand dynamics of red giants using asteroseismic techniques. a small fraction ofthese stars shows dipole modes with unexpectedly low amplitudes. the reductionin amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximumpower. in this work we want to characterize kic 8561221 in order to confirmthat it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and todiscuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipolemode amplitudes. we used kepler short- and long-cadence data combined withspectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of kic8561221. we then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to thereduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or theeffect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. we also performed adetailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. we have been able tocharacterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes abovenu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. we have inferred a surfacerotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation inthe surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. as expected, theinternal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 timesfaster than the surface. with our grid of standard models we are able toproperly fit the observed frequencies. our model calculation of mode inertiaand damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. a fast rotatingcore is also ruled out as a possible explanation. finally, we do not have anyobservational evidence of the presence of a strong deep magnetic field insidethe star.

1312.4907	measurement of acoustic glitches in solar-type stars from oscillation  frequencies observed by kepler	for the very best and brightest asteroseismic solar-type targets observed bykepler, the frequency precision is sufficient to determine the acoustic depthsof the surface convective layer and the helium ionization zone. such sharpfeatures inside the acoustic cavity of the star, which we call acousticglitches, create small oscillatory deviations from the uniform spacing offrequencies in a sequence of oscillation modes with the same spherical harmonicdegree. we use these oscillatory signals to determine the acoustic locations ofsuch features in 19 solar-type stars observed by the kepler mission. fourindependent groups of researchers utilized the oscillation frequenciesthemselves, the second differences of the frequencies and the ratio of thesmall and large separation to locate the base of the convection zone and thesecond helium ionization zone. despite the significantly different methods ofanalysis, good agreement was found between the results of these four groups,barring a few cases. these results also agree reasonably well with thelocations of these layers in representative models of the stars. these resultsfirmly establish the presence of the oscillatory signals in the asteroseismicdata and the viability of several techniques to determine the location ofacoustic glitches inside stars.

0802.1510	influence of low-degree high-order p-mode splittings on the solar  rotation profile	the solar rotation profile is well constrained down to about 0.25 r thanks tothe study of acoustic modes. since the radius of the inner turning point of aresonant acoustic mode is inversely proportional to the ratio of its frequencyto its degree, only the low-degree p modes reach the core. the higher the orderof these modes, the deeper they penetrate into the sun and thus they carry morediagnostic information on the inner regions. unfortunately, the estimates offrequency splittings at high frequency from sun-as-a-star measurements havehigher observational errors due to mode blending, resulting in weakerconstraints on the rotation profile in the inner core. therefore inversions forthe solar internal rotation use only modes below 2.4 mhz for l &lt; 4. in the workpresented here, we used an 11.5 year-long time series to compute the rotationalfrequency splittings for modes l &lt; 4 using velocities measured with the golfinstrument. we carried out a theoretical study of the influence of thelow-degree modes in the region 2 to 3.5 mhz on the inferred rotation profile asa function of their error bars.

1312.6997	magnetic activity of f stars observed by kepler	the study of stellar activity is important because it can provide newconstraints for dynamo models, when combined with surface rotation rates andthe depth of the convection zone. we know that the dynamo mechanism, which isbelieved to be the main process to rule the magnetic cycle of solar-like starsat least, results from the interaction between (differential) rotation,convection, and magnetic field. the kepler mission has been collecting data fora large number of stars during 4 years allowing us to investigate magneticstellar cycles. we investigated the kepler light curves to look for magneticactivity or even hints of magnetic activity cycles. based on the photometricdata we also looked for new magnetic indexes to characterise the magneticactivity of the stars. we selected a sample of 22 solar-like f stars that havea rotation period smaller than 12 days. we performed a time-frequency analysisusing the morlet wavelet yielding a magnetic proxy. we computed the magneticindex s_ph as the standard deviation of the whole time series and the index&lt;s_ph&gt; that is the mean of standard deviations measured in subseries of lengthfive times the rotation period of the star. we defined new indicators to takeinto account the fact that complete magnetic cycles are not observed for allthe stars, such as the contrast between high and low activity. we also inferredthe rossby number of the stars and studied their stellar background. thisanalysis shows different types of behaviours in the 22 f stars. two stars showbehaviours very similar to magnetic activity cycles. five stars show long-livedspots or active regions suggesting the existence of active longitudes. twostars of our sample seem to have a decreasing or increasing trend in thetemporal variation of the magnetic proxies. finally the last group of starsshow magnetic activity (with presence of spots) but no sign of cycle.

0803.0229	can we constrain the solar interior physics studying the gravity-mode  asymptotic signature?	gravity modes are the best probes to infer the properties of the solarradiative zone that represents 98% of the sun's total mass. it is usuallyassumed that high-frequency g modes give information about the structure of thesolar interior whereas low-frequency g modes are more sensitive to the solardynamics (the internal rotation). in this work, we develop a new methodology,based on the analysis of the almost constant separation of the dipole gravitymodes, to introduce new constraints on the solar models. to validate thisanalysis procedure, several solar models -- including different physicalprocesses and either old or new chemical abundances (from, respectively,grevesse and noels (origin and evolution of the elements. cambridge, england,199, 15, 1993) and asplund, grevesse, and sauval (astron. soc. pac. cs, sanfrancisco, 36, 25, 2005)) -- have been compared to another model used as areference. the analysis clearly shows that this methodology has enoughsensitivity to distinguish between some of the models, in particular, betweenthose with different compositions. the comparison of the models with the g-modeasymptotic signature detected in golf data favors the ones with old abundances.therefore, the physics of the core -- through the analysis of the g-modeproperties -- is in agreement with the results obtained in the previous studiesbased on the acoustic modes, which are mostly sensitive to more external layersof the sun.

1405.5374	impact on asteroseismic analyses of regular gaps in kepler data	the nasa kepler mission has observed more than 190,000 stars in theconstellations of cygnus and lyra. around 4 years of almost continuous ultrahigh-precision photometry have been obtained reaching a duty cycle higher than90% for many of these stars. however, almost regular gaps due to nominaloperations are present in the light curves at different time scales. in thispaper we want to highlight the impact of those regular gaps in asteroseismicanalyses and we try to find a method that minimizes their effect in thefrequency domain. to do so, we isolate the two main time scales of quasiregular gaps in the data. we then interpolate the gaps and we compare the powerdensity spectra of four different stars: two red giants at different stages oftheir evolution, a young f-type star, and a classical pulsator in theinstability strip. the spectra obtained after filling the gaps in the selectedsolar-like stars show a net reduction in the overall background level, as wellas a change in the background parameters. the inferred convective propertiescould change as much as 200% in the selected example, introducing a bias in thep-mode frequency of maximum power. when global asteroseismic scaling relationsare used, this bias can lead up to a variation in the surface gravity of 0.05dex. finally, the oscillation spectrum in the classical pulsator is cleanercompared to the original one.

1408.0817	the connection between stellar granulation and oscillation as seen by  the kepler mission	the long and almost continuous observations by kepler show clear evidence ofa granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, which isinterpreted as the surface manifestation of convection. it has been shown thatits characteristic timescale and rms intensity fluctuation scale with the peakfrequency (\nu_{max}) of the solar-like oscillations. various attempts havebeen made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations, andto compare them to theoretical predictions. we use a probabilistic method tocompare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. we fit thepower density spectra of a large set of kepler targets, determine thegranulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relationsbetween them. we establish that a depression in power at about \nu_{max}/2,known from the sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statisticallysignificant in red giants and that a super-lorentzian function with twocomponents is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broadervicinity of the pulsation power excess. we also establish that the specificchoice of the background model can affect the determination of \nu_{max},introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the randomuncertainties. we find the characteristic background frequency and amplitude totightly scale with \nu_{max} for a wide variety of stars, and quantify a massdependency of the latter. to enable comparison with theoretical predictions, wecomputed effective timescales and intensity fluctuations and found them toapproximately scale as \tau_{eff} \propto g^{-0.85}\,t^{-0.4} and a_{gran}\propto (g^2m)^{-1/4}, respectively. similarly, the bolometric pulsationamplitude scales approximately as a_{puls} \propto (g^2m)^{-1/3}, whichimplicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of a_{puls}.

1506.02704	seismic evidence for a weak radial differential rotation in  intermediate-mass core helium burning stars	the detection of mixed modes that are split by rotation in kepler red giantshas made it possible to probe the internal rotation profiles of these stars,which brings new constraints on the transport of angular momentum in stars.mosser et al. (2012) have measured the rotation rates in the central regions ofintermediate-mass core helium burning stars (secondary clump stars). our aimwas to exploit&amp; the rotational splittings of mixed modes to estimate the amountof radial differential rotation in the interior of secondary clump stars usingkepler data, in order to place constraints on angular momentum transport inintermediate-mass stars. we selected a subsample of kepler secondary clumpstars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. by applying athorough statistical analysis, we showed that the splittings of bothgravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and p-dominated modes(trapped in the envelope) can be measured. we then used these splittings toestimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques andby applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory (goupil et al.2013). we obtained evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six ofthe seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating$1.8\pm0.3$ to $3.2\pm1.0$ times faster than the envelope. the last target wasfound to be consistent with a solid-body rotation. this demonstrates that anefficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the mainsequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during theshort-lived subgiant phase, or once he-burning has started in the core. ineither case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transportmechanisms that are at work.

astro-ph;0510854	the magnetism of the solar interior for a complete mhd solar vision	the solar magnetism is no more considered as a purely superficial phenomenon.the soho community has shown that the length of the solar cycle depends on thetransition region between radiation and convection. nevertheless, the internalsolar (stellar) magnetism stays poorly known. starting in 2008, the americaninstrument hmi/sdo and the european microsatellite picard will enrich our viewof the sun-earth relationship. thus obtaining a complete mhd solar picture is aclear objective for the next decades and it requires complementary observationsof the dynamics of the radiative zone. for that ambitious goal, spaceprototypes are being developed to improve gravity mode detection. the sun isunique to progress on the topology of deep internal magnetic fields and tounderstand the complex mechanisms which provoke photospheric and coronalmagnetic changes and possible longer cycles important for human life. wepropose the following roadmap in europe to contribute to this "impressive"revolution in astronomy and in our sun-earth relationship: soho (1995-2007),picard (2008-2010), dynamics (2009-2017) in parallel to sdo (2008-2017) then aworld-class mission located at the l1 orbit or above the solar poles.

astro-ph;0603671	rotation speed and stellar axis inclination from p modes: how corot  would see other suns	in the context of future space-based asteroseismic missions, we have studiedthe problem of extracting the rotation speed and the rotation-axis inclinationof solar-like stars from the expected data. we have focused on slow rotators(at most twice solar rotation speed), firstly because they constitute the mostdifficult case and secondly because some of the corot main targets are expectedto have slow rotation rates. our study of the likelihood function has shown acorrelation between the estimates of inclination of the rotation axis i and therotational splitting deltanu of the star. by using the parameters, i anddeltanu*=deltanu sin(i), we propose and discuss new fitting strategies. montecarlo simulations have shown that we can extract a mean splitting and therotation-axis inclination down to solar rotation rates. however, at the solarrotation rate we are not able to correctly recover the angle i although we arestill able to measure a correct deltanu* with a dispersion less than 40 nhz.

astro-ph;0604092	curvelet analysis of asteroseismic data i: method description and  application to simulated sun-like stars	context: the detection and identification of oscillation modes (in terms oftheir $\ell$, $m$ and successive $n$) is a great challenge for present andfuture asteroseismic space missions. the "peak tagging" is an important step inthe analysis of these data to provide estimations of stellar oscillation modeparameters, i.e., frequencies, rotation rates, and further studies on thestellar structure.  aims: to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the asteroseismic spectracomputed from time series representative of most and corot observations (30-and 150-day observations).  methods: we apply the curvelet transform -- a recent image processingtechnique which looks for curved patterns -- to echelle diagrams built usingasteroseismic power spectra. in this diagram the eigenfrequencies appear assmooth continuous ridges. to test the method we use monte carlo simulations ofseveral sun-like stars with different combinations of rotation rates,rotation-axis inclination and signal-to-noise ratios.  results: the filtered diagrams enhance the contrast between the ridges of themodes and the background allowing a better tagging of the modes and a betterextraction of some stellar parameters. monte carlo simulations have also shownthat the region where modes can be detected is enlarged at lower and higherfrequencies compared to the raw spectra. even more, the extraction of the meanrotational splitting from modes at low frequency can be done more easily thanusing the raw spectrum.

astro-ph;0611806	detection of periodic signatures in the solar power spectrum. on the  track of l=1 gravity modes	in the present work we show robust indications of the existence of g modes inthe sun using 10 years of golf data. the present analysis is based on theexploitation of the collective properties of the predicted low-frequency (25 to140 microhz) g modes: their asymptotic nature, which implies a quasiequidistant separation of their periods for a given angular degree (l). thepower spectrum (ps) of the power spectrum density (psd), reveals a significantstructure indicating the presence of features (peaks) in the psd with nearequidistant periods corresponding to l=1 modes in the range n=-4 to n=-26. thestudy of its statistical significance of this feature was fully undertaken andcomplemented with monte carlo simulations. this structure has a confidencelevel better than 99.86% not to be due to pure noise. furthermore, a detailedstudy of this structure suggests that the gravity modes have a much morecomplex structure than the one initially expected (line-widths, magneticsplittings...). compared to the latest solar models, the obtained results tendto favor a solar core rotating significantly faster than the rest of theradiative zone. in the framework of the phoebus group, we have also applied thesame methodology to other helioseismology instruments on board soho and groundbased networks.

0810.2031	what can we learn on the structure and the dynamics of the solar core  with g modes?	the detection of the signature of dipole gravity modes has opened the path tostudy the solar inner radiative zone. indeed, g modes should be the best probesto infer the properties of the solar nuclear core that represents more thanhalf of the total mass of the sun. concerning the dynamics of the solar core,we can study how future observations of individual g modes could enhance ourknowledge of the rotation profile of the deep radiative zone. applyinginversions on a set of real p-mode splittings coupled with either one orseveral g modes, we have checked the improvement of the inferred rotationprofile when different error bars are considered for the g modes. moreover,using a new methodology based on the analysis of the almost constant separationof the dipole gravity modes, we can introduce new constraints on solar models.for that purpose, we can compare g-mode predictions computed from severalmodels including different physical inputs with the g-mode asymptotic signaturedetected in golf data and calculate the correlation. this work shows the greatconsistency between the signature of dipole gravity modes and our knowledge ofp-modes: incompatibility of data with a present standard model including theasplund composition
