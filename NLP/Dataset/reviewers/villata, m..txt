0905.1616	the correlated optical and radio variability of bl lacertae. webt data  analysis 1994-2005	since 1997, bl lacertae has undergone a phase of high optical activity, withthe occurrence of several prominent outbursts. starting from 1999, the wholeearth blazar telescope (webt) consortium has organized various multifrequencycampaigns on this blazar, collecting tens of thousands of data points. one ofthe main issues in the study of this huge dataset has been the search forcorrelations between the optical and radio flux variations, and for possibleperiodicities in the light curves. the analysis of the data assembled duringthe first four campaigns (comprising also archival data to cover the period1968-2003) revealed a fair optical-radio correlation in 1994-2003, with a delayof the hard radio events of ~100 days. moreover, various statistical methodssuggested the existence of a radio periodicity of ~8 years. in 2004 the webtstarted a new campaign to extend the dataset to the most recent observingseasons, in order to possibly confirm and better understand the previousresults. in this campaign we have collected and assembled about 11000 newoptical observations from twenty telescopes, plus near-ir and radio data atvarious frequencies. here, we perform a correlation analysis on the long-termr-band and radio light curves. in general, we confirm the ~100-day delay of thehard radio events with respect to the optical ones, even if longer (~200-300days) time lags are also found in particular periods. the radioquasi-periodicity is confirmed too, but the "period" seems to progressivelylengthen from 7.4 to 9.3 years in the last three cycles. the optical and radiobehaviour in the last forty years suggests a scenario where geometric effectsplay a major role. in particular, the alternation of enhanced and suppressedoptical activity (accompanied by hard and soft radio events, respectively) can

0908.2722	the gasp-webt monitoring of 3c 454.3 during the 2008 optical-to-radio  and gamma-ray outburst	since 2001, the radio quasar 3c 454.3 has undergone a period of high opticalactivity, culminating in the brightest optical state ever observed, during the2004-2005 outburst. the whole earth blazar telescope (webt) consortium hascarried out several multifrequency campaigns to follow the source behaviour.the glast-agile support program (gasp) was born from the webt to providelong-term continuous optical-to-radio monitoring of a sample of gamma-loudblazars, during the operation of the agile and glast (now known as fermi gst)gamma-ray satellites. the main aim is to shed light on the mechanisms producingthe high-energy radiation, through correlation analysis with the low-energyemission. thus, since 2008 the monitoring task on 3c 454.3 passed from the webtto the gasp, while both agile and fermi detected strong gamma-ray emission fromthe source. we present the main results obtained by the gasp at optical, mm,and radio frequencies in the 2008-2009 season, and compare them with the webtresults from previous years. an optical outburst was observed to peak in midjuly 2008, when fermi detected the brightest gamma-ray levels. acontemporaneous mm outburst maintained its brightness for a longer time, untilthe cm emission also reached the maximum levels. the behaviour compared in thethree bands suggests that the variable relative brightness of thedifferent-frequency outbursts may be due to the changing orientation of acurved inhomogeneous jet. the optical light curve is very well sampled duringthe entire season, which is also well covered by the various agile and fermiobserving periods. the relevant cross-correlation studies will be veryimportant in constraining high-energy emission models.

1005.3263	the december 2009 gamma-ray flare of 3c 454.3: the multifrequency  campaign	during the month of december, 2009 the blazar 3c 454.3 became the brightestgamma-ray source in the sky, reaching a peak flux f ~2000e-8 ph/cm2/s for e &gt;100 mev. starting in november, 2009 intensive multifrequency campaignsmonitored the 3c 454 gamma-ray outburst. here we report the results of a2-month campaign involving agile, integral, swift/xrt, swift/bat, rossixte forthe high-energy observations, and swift/uvot, kanata, grt, rem for thenear-ir/optical/uv data. the gasp/webt provided radio and additional opticaldata. we detected a long-term active emission phase lasting ~1 month at allwavelengths: in the gamma-ray band, peak emission was reached on december 2-3,2009. remarkably, this gamma-ray super-flare was not accompanied bycorrespondingly intense emission in the optical/uv band that reached a levelsubstantially lower than the previous observations in 2007-2008. the lack ofstrong simultaneous optical brightening during the super-flare and thedetermination of the broad-band spectral evolution severely constrain thetheoretical modelling. we find that the pre- and post-flare broad-band behaviorcan be explained by a one-zone model involving ssc plus external comptonemission from an accretion disk and a broad-line region. however, the spectraof the dec. 2-3, 2009 super-flare and of the secondary peak emission on dec. 9,2009 cannot be satisfactorily modelled by a simple one-zone model. anadditional particle component is most likely active during these states.

0708.2793	webt and xmm-newton observations of 3c 454.3 during the post-outburst  phase. detection of the little and big blue bumps	the blazar 3c 454.3 underwent an unprecedented optical outburst in spring2005. this was first followed by a mm and then by a cm radio outburst, whichpeaked in february 2006. we report on follow-up observations by the webt tostudy the multiwavelength emission in the post-outburst phase. xmm-newtonobservations on july and december 2006 added information on the x-ray and uvfluxes. the source was in a faint state. the radio flux at the higherfrequencies showed a fast decreasing trend, which represents the tail of thebig radio outburst. it was followed by a quiescent state, common at all radiofrequencies. in contrast, moderate activity characterized the nir and opticallight curves, with a progressive increase of the variability amplitude withincreasing wavelength. we ascribe this redder-when-brighter behaviour to thepresence of a "little blue bump" due to line emission from the broad lineregion, which is clearly visible in the source sed during faint states.moreover, the data from the xmm-newton om reveal a rise of the sed in the uv,suggesting the existence of a "big blue bump" due to thermal emission from theaccretion disc. the x-ray spectra are well fitted with a power-law model withphotoelectric absorption, possibly larger than the galactic one. however, thecomparison with previous x-ray observations would imply that the amount ofabsorbing matter is variable. alternatively, the intrinsic x-ray spectrumpresents a curvature, which may depend on the x-ray brightness. in this case,two scenarios are possible.

1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1011.3224	integral observations of the gev blazar pks1502+106 and of the hard  x-ray bright seyfert galaxy mkn841	extragalactic nuclear activity is best explored with observations at highenergies, where the most extreme flux and spectral variations are expected tooccur, witnessing changes in the accretion flow or in the kinematics of theplasma. in active galactic nuclei of blazar type, these variations are the mostdramatic. by following blazar outbursts from their onset and by correlating theobserved variations at many different wavelengths we can reconstruct thebehavior of the plasma and map out the development of the flare within the jet.the advent of the fermi satellite has allowed the start of a systematic andintensive monitoring program of blazars. blazar outbursts are very effectivelydetected by the lat instrument in the mev-gev domain, and these can be promptlyfollowed up with other facilities. based on a fermi lat detection of a highmev-gev state, we have observed the blazar pks 1502+106 with the integralsatellite between 9 and 11 august 2008. simultaneous swift observations havebeen also accomplished, as well as optical follow-up at the nordic opticaltelescope. the ibis instrument onboard integral detected a source at a positioninconsistent with the optical coordinates of pks 1502+106, but consistent withthose of the seyfert 1 galaxy mkn 841, located at 6.8 arcmin south-west fromthe blazar, which is therefore responsible for all the hard x-ray flux detectedby ibis. at the location of the blazar, ibis sets an upper limit of ~10^{-11}erg/s/cm2 on the 15-60 kev flux, that turns out to be consistent with a modelof inverse compton scattering accounting for the soft x-ray and gamma-rayspectra measured by swift xrt and fermi lat, respectively. the gamma-rayspectrum during the outburst indicates substantial variability of thecharacteristic energy of the inverse compton component in thisblazar.(abridged).

1201.3810	"dark energy" in the local void	the unexpected discovery of the accelerated cosmic expansion in 1998 hasfilled the universe with the embarrassing presence of an unidentified "darkenergy", or cosmological constant, devoid of any physical meaning. while thisstandard cosmology seems to work well at the global level, improved knowledgeof the kinematics and other properties of our extragalactic neighborhoodindicates the need for a better theory. we investigate whether the recentlysuggested repulsive-gravity scenario can account for some of the features thatare unexplained by the standard model. through simple dynamical considerations,we find that the local void could host an amount of antimatter($\sim5\times10^{15}\,m_\odot$) roughly equivalent to the mass of a typicalsupercluster, thus restoring the matter-antimatter symmetry. the antigravityfield produced by this "dark repulsor" can explain the anomalous motion of thelocal sheet away from the local void, as well as several other properties ofnearby galaxies that seem to require void evacuation and structure formationmuch faster than expected from the standard model. at the global cosmologicallevel, gravitational repulsion from antimatter hidden in voids can provide morethan enough potential energy to drive both the cosmic expansion and itsacceleration, with no need for an initial "explosion" and dark energy.moreover, the discrete distribution of these dark repulsors, in contrast to theuniformly permeating dark energy, can also explain dark flows and otherrecently observed excessive inhomogeneities and anisotropies of the universe.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

1302.3515	on the nature of dark energy: the lattice universe	there is something unknown in the cosmos. something big. which causes theacceleration of the universe expansion, that is perhaps the most surprising andunexpected discovery of the last decades, and thus represents one of the mostpressing mysteries of the universe. the current standard $\lambda$cdm modeluses two unknown entities to make everything fit: dark energy and dark matter,which together would constitute more than 95% of the energy density of theuniverse. a bit like saying that we have understood almost nothing, but withoutopenly admitting it. here we start from the recent theoretical results thatcome from the extension of general relativity to antimatter, through cptsymmetry. this theory predicts a mutual gravitational repulsion between matterand antimatter. our basic assumption is that the universe contains equalamounts of matter and antimatter, with antimatter possibly located in cosmicvoids, as discussed in previous works. from this scenario we develop a simplecosmological model, from whose equations we derive the first results. while theexistence of the elusive dark energy is completely replaced by gravitationalrepulsion, the presence of dark matter is not excluded, but not strictlyrequired, as most of the related phenomena can also be ascribed torepulsive-gravity effects. with a matter energy density ranging from $\sim5%$(baryonic matter alone, and as much antimatter) to $\sim25%$ of the so-calledcritical density, the present age of the universe varies between about 13 and$15\rm\,gyr$. the sn ia test is successfully passed, with residuals comparablewith those of the $\lambda$cdm model in the observed redshift range, but with aclear prediction for fainter sne at higher $z$. moreover, this model hasneither horizon nor coincidence problems, and no initial singularity isrequested. in conclusion, we have replaced all the tough problems of thecurrent

0801.1236	radio-to-uv monitoring of ao 0235+164 by the webt and swift during the  2006--2007 outburst	the blazar ao 0235+164 was claimed to show a quasi-periodic behaviour in theradio and optical bands. moreover, an extra emission component contributing tothe uv and soft x-ray flux was detected, whose nature is not yet clear. apredicted optical outburst was observed in late 2006/early 2007. we herepresent the radio-to-optical webt light curves during the outburst, togetherwith uv data acquired by swift in the same period. we found the opticaloutburst to be as strong as the big outbursts of the past: starting from lateseptember 2006, a brightness increase of 5 mag led to the outburst peak infebruary 19-21, 2007. we also observed an outburst at mm and then at cmwavelengths, with an increasing time delay going toward lower frequenciesduring the rising phase. cross-correlation analysis indicates that the 1 mm and37 ghz flux variations lagged behind the r-band ones by about 3 weeks and 2months, respectively. these short time delays suggest that the correspondingjet emitting regions are only slightly separated and/or misaligned. incontrast, during the outburst decreasing phase the flux faded contemporaneouslyat all cm wavelengths. this abrupt change in the emission behaviour may suggestthe presence of some shutdown mechanism of intrinsic or geometric nature. thebehaviour of the uv flux closely follows the optical and near-ir one. byseparating the synchrotron and extra component contributions to the uv flux, wefound that they correlate, which suggests that the two emissions have a commonorigin.

1307.0558	an active state of the bl lac object markarian 421 detected by integral  in april 2013	multiwavelength variability of blazars offers indirect insight into theirpowerful engines and on the mechanisms through which energy is propagated fromthe centre down the jet. the bl lac object mkn 421 is a tev emitter, a brightblazar at all wavelengths, and therefore an excellent target for variabilitystudies. mkn 421 was observed by integral and fermi-lat in an active state on16-21 april 2013. well sampled optical, soft, and hard x-ray light curves showthe presence of two flares. the average flux in the 20-100 kev range is 9.1e-11erg/s/cm2 (~4.5 mcrab) and the nuclear average apparent magnitude, correctedfor galactic extinction, is v ~12.2. in the time-resolved x-ray spectra (3.5-60kev), which are described by broken power laws and, marginally better, bylog-parabolic laws, we see a hardening that correlates with flux increase, asexpected in refreshed energy injections in a population of electrons that latercool via synchrotron radiation. the hardness ratios between the jem-x fluxes intwo different bands and between the jem-x and ibis/isgri fluxes confirm thistrend. during the observation, the variability level increases monotonicallyfrom the optical to the hard x-rays, while the large lat errors do not allow asignificant assessment of the mev-gev variability. the cross-correlationanalysis during the onset of the most prominent flare suggests a monotonicallyincreasing delay of the lower frequency emission with respect to that at higherfrequency, with a maximum time-lag of about 70 minutes, that is however notwell constrained. the spectral energy distributions from the optical to the tevdomain are satisfactorily described by homogeneous models of blazar emissionbased on synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-compton scattering, exceptin the state corresponding to the lat softest spectrum and highest flux.

1309.1282	the awakening of bl lacertae: observations by fermi, swift, and the  gasp-webt	since the launch of the fermi satellite, bl lacertae has been moderatelyactive at gamma-rays and optical frequencies until may 2011, when the sourcestarted a series of strong flares. the exceptional optical sampling achieved bythe glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) in collaboration with the steward observatory allows us to perform adetailed comparison with the daily gamma-ray observations by fermi. discretecorrelation analysis between the optical and gamma-ray emission revealscorrelation with a time lag of 0 +- 1 d, which suggests cospatiality of thecorresponding jet emitting regions. a better definition of the time lag ishindered by the daily gaps in the sampling of the extremely fast fluxvariations. in general, optical flares present more structure and develop onlonger time scales than corresponding gamma-ray flares. observations at x-raysand at millimetre wavelengths reveal a common trend, which suggests that theregion producing the mm and x-ray radiation is located downstream from theoptical and gamma-ray-emitting zone in the jet. the mean optical degree ofpolarisation slightly decreases over the considered period and in general it ishigher when the flux is lower. the optical electric vector polarisation angle(evpa) shows a preferred orientation of about 15 deg, nearly aligned with theradio core evpa and mean jet direction. oscillations around it increase duringthe 2011-2012 outburst. we investigate the effects of a geometricalinterpretation of the long-term flux variability on the polarisation. a helicalmagnetic field model predicts an evolution of the mean polarisation that is inreasonable agreement with the observations. these can be fully explained byintroducing slight variations in the compression factor in a transverse shockwaves model.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0203379	broadband spectra and variability of bl lacertae in 2000	we have organized an extensive multiwavelength campaign on bl lacertae in thesecond half of 2000. simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations were takenat radio frequencies, in the optical - carried out by the webt collaboration -,in x-rays - using bepposax and rxte -, and at vhe gamma-rays with the cat andhegra cherenkov telescope facilities. in this paper, we are presenting firstresults from this campaign. the webt optical campaign achieved an unprecedentedtime coverage, virtually continuous over several 10 - 20 hour segments, andrevealed intraday variability on time scales of ~ 1.5 hours. the x-rayobservations of nov. 1 - 2, 2000, revealed significant variability on similartime scales, and provided evidence for the synchrotron spectrum extending outto ~ 10 kev during that time. at higher energies, the onset of the hardpower-law commonly observed in radio-loud quasars and radio-selected bl lacobjects is seen. from the energy-resolved x-ray variability patterns, we findevidence that electron cooling might not be dominated by one single radiationmechanism; rather, a combination of synchrotron and compton cooling seems to berequired.

astro-ph;0404155	the webt bl lacertae campaign 2001 and its extension	bl lacertae has been the target of four observing campaigns by the wholeearth blazar telescope (webt) collaboration. in this paper we present $ubvri$light curves obtained by the webt from 1994 to 2002, including the last,extended bl lac 2001 campaign. a total of about 7500 optical observationsperformed by 31 telescopes from japan to mexico have been collected, to beadded to the $\sim 15600$ observations of the bl lac campaign 2000. all thesedata allow one to follow the source optical emission behaviour withunprecedented detail. the analysis of the colour indices reveals that the fluxvariability can be interpreted in terms of two components: longer-termvariations occurring on a few-day time scale appear as mildly-chromatic events,while a strong bluer-when-brighter chromatism characterizes very fast(intraday) flares. by decoupling the two components, we quantify the degree ofchromatism inferring that longer-term flux changes imply moving along a $\sim0.1$ bluer-when-brighter slope in the $b-r$ versus $r$ plane; a steeper slopeof $\sim 0.4$ would distinguish the shorter-term variations. this means that,when considering the long-term trend, the $b$-band flux level is related to the$r$-band one according to a power law of index $\sim 1.1$. doppler factorvariations on a "convex" spectrum could be the mechanism accounting for boththe long-term variations and their slight chromatism.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

astro-ph;0612149	multi-frequency monitoring of gamma-ray loud blazars: i. light curves  and spectral energy distributions	context: being dominated by non-thermal emission from aligned relativisticjets, blazars allow us to elucidate the physics of extragalactic jets, and,ltimately, how the energy is extracted from the central black hole inradio-loud active galactic nuclei. aims: crucial information is provided bybroad-band spectral energy distributions (seds), their trends with luminosityand correlated multi-frequency variability. with this study we plan to obtain adatabase of contemporaneous radio-to-optical spectra of a sample of blazars,which are and will be observed by current and future high-energy satellites.methods: since december 2004 we are performing a monthly multi-frequency radiomonitoring of a sample of 35 blazars at the antennas in medicina and noto.contemporaneous near-ir and optical observations for all our observing epochsare organised. results: until june 2006 about 4000 radio measurements and 5500near-ir and optical measurements were obtained. most of the sources showsignificant variability in all observing bands. here we present themulti-frequency data acquired during the first eighteen months of the project,and construct the seds for the best-sampled sources.

astro-ph;0701299	the radio delay of the exceptional 3c 454.3 outburst. follow-up webt  observations in 2005-2006	in spring 2005 the blazar 3c 454.3 was observed in an unprecedented brightstate from the near-ir to the hard x-ray frequencies. a mm outburst peaked injune-july 2005, and it was followed by a flux increase at high radiofrequencies. in this paper we report on multifrequency monitoring by the webtaimed at following the further evolution of the outburst in detail. inparticular, we investigate the expected correlation and time delays between theoptical and radio emissions in order to derive information on the variabilitymechanisms and jet structure. a comparison among the light curves at differentfrequencies is performed by means of visual inspection and discrete correlationfunction, and the results are interpreted with a simple model taking intoaccount doppler factor variations of geometric origin. the high-frequency radiolight curves show a huge outburst starting during the dimming phase of theoptical one and lasting more than 1 year. the first phase is characterized by aslow flux increase, while in early 2006 a major flare is observed. thelower-frequency radio light curves show a progressively delayed and fainterevent, which disappears below 8 ghz. we suggest that the radio major peak isnot physically connected with the spring 2005 optical one, but it is actuallycorrelated with a minor optical flare observed in october-november 2005. thisinterpretation involves both an intrinsic and a geometric mechanism. the formeris represented by disturbances travelling down the emitting jet, the latterbeing due to the curved-jet motion, with the consequent differential changes ofviewing angles of the different emitting regions.

astro-ph;0701325	spectroscopic monitoring of the bl lac object ao 0235+164	we performed optical spectroscopic monitoring of the bl lac object ao0235+164 (z=0.94) with the vlt and tng telescopes from aug. 2003 to dec. 2004,during an extended webt campaign. the flux of this source is both contaminatedand absorbed by a foreground galactic system at z=0.524, the stars of which canact as gravitational micro-lenses. in this period the object was in anoptically faint, though variable state, and a broad mg ii emission line wasvisible at all epochs. the spectroscopic analysis reveals an overall variationin the mg ii line flux of a factor 1.9, while the corresponding continuum fluxdensity changed by a factor 4.3. most likely, the photoionising radiation canbe identified with the emission component that was earlier recognised to bepresent as a uv-soft-x-ray bump in the source sed and that is visible in theoptical domain only in very faint optical states. we estimate an upper limit tothe blr size of a few light months from the historical minimum brightnesslevel; from this we infer the maximum amplification of the mg ii line predictedby the microlensing scenario. unless we have strongly overestimated the size ofthe blr, only very massive stars could significantly magnify the broad mg iiemission line, but the time scale of variations due to these (rare) eventswould be of several years. in contrast, the continuum flux, coming from muchsmaller emission regions in the jet, could be affected by microlensing from themore plausible macho deflectors, with variability time scales of some months.

astro-ph;0701420	ten-year optical monitoring of pks 0735+178: historical comparison,  multiband behaviour and variability timescales	new data and results on the optical behaviour of the blazar pks 0735+178 arepresented. in addition the whole historical light curve, and a new photometriccalibration of comparison stars are reported. optical spectral indexes arecalculated and studied on years scales, while several methods for time-seriesanalysis are applied to the whole historical series and to each observingseason of our data set. this allowed to search and identify optical variabilitymodes, characteristic timescales and the signal power spectrum over 3 decadesin time. in the last 10 years the optical flux of pks 0735+178 exhibited arather achromatic long-term behaviour and a variability mode resembling theshot-noise. the brightness level was in an intermediate/low state with a mildflaring activity and a superimposition/succession of rapid and slower flares,with no extraordinary/isolated outbursts but, at any rate, characterized by 1major active phase in 2001. several mid-term scales (days, weeks) were found,the more common falling into values of about 27-28 days, 50-56 days and 76-79days. the rapid variability in the historical curve appear to be modulated by ageneral, slower and rather oscillating trend, where typical timescales of about4.5, 8.5 and 11-13 years can be identified. this spectral and temporalanalysis, accompanying our data publication, suggests the occurrence ofdistinctive variability signatures at days/weeks scales, that can likely be oftransitory nature. on the other hand the possible pseudo-cyclical ormulti-component modulations at long times could be more stable, recurrent andcorrelated to the bimodal radio flux behaviour and the twisted radio structureobserved by many years in this blazar.

astro-ph;9706254	optical-iue observations of the gamma-ray loud bl lacertae object s5  0716+714: data and interpretation	we monitored the bl lac object s5 0716+714 in the optical band during theperiod november 1994-april 1995, which includes the time of a gamma-rayobservation by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope (egret) on february14--28, 1995. the light curves in the r and b bands show fast fluctuationssuperimposed on longer timescale variations. the color index correlates withintensity during the rapid flares (the spectrum is flatter when the flux ishigher), but it is rather insensitive to the long term trends. over the 5 monthobservational period the light curve shows an overall brightening of about 1mag followed by a fast decline. the egret pointing covers part of the verybright phase (v about 13.2) and the initial decline. an ultraviolet spectrumwas also obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer (iue) (1200-3000a) during the egret observations. the variability of the optical emission of s50716+714 by itself sets important constraints on the magnetic field strengthand on the physical processes responsible for it. interpreting the wholeelectromagnetic spectrum with synchrotron self compton models leads to theprediction of a bright gamma-ray state during the egret pointing. we discusshow the gamma-ray data could be used as a diagnostic of the proposed models.

astro-ph;9804299	bepposax spectral survey of soft x-ray selected bl lacs	we present x-ray spectra obtained with bepposax (satellite per astronomia x)of 10 bl lac objects, selected from the einstein medium sensitivity and slewsurveys. we find that in about half of the objects a fit in the 0.1-10 kevrange with a single power law and free absorption yields values of nh largerthan the galactic ones. in most of these cases, however, broken power law fitswith nh fixed at the galactic values yield an alternative, better descriptionof the data and indicate a steepening of the spectrum with increasing energy.one object (1es1101-232) is detected up to ~100 kev. its spectral energydistribution (sed) peaks in the medium energy x-ray band. for each object wecompute the peak frequency of the sed from multifrequency data. the spectralindices alpha_x in the 2-10 kev band (fnu prop to nu^{-alpha_x}) are smaller(i.e. flatter spectrum) for objects with higher peak frequencies. we thereforeconfirm and extend to higher energies the behavior already known for x-rayselected bl lac objects in the rosat band. we do not find spectral indicessmaller than 1; however, the flat distribution of alpha_x and the correlationbetween alpha_x and peak frequency found from our data suggest that a number ofobjects may exist, which in the quiescent status have flatter spectrum and peakfrequency in the hard x-ray range.

astro-ph;9912055	the concave x-ray spectrum of the blazar on 231: the signature of  intermediate bl lac objects	on 231 was observed with bepposax in may and june 1998, following anexceptional optical outburst which occured in april--may. we measured the x-rayspectrum from 0.1 up to 100 kev. in both occasions the spectrum had a concaveshape, with a break detected at about 4 and 2.5 kev, respectively. we interpretthe steeper component at energies below the break as due to synchrotronemission and the extremely flat component at energies above the break as due toinverse compton emission. this is so far the best example in which both thesynchrotron and the inverse compton component are detected simultaneously andwith the same instruments in the x-ray spectrum of a blazar. we detect adecrease of the x-ray flux of about 30% below the break between the first andthe second observation, and smaller variability amplitude between 4 and 10 kev.during the may observation we also detected a fast variability event with theflux below 4 kev increasing by about a factor of three in 5 hours. above 4 kevno variability was detected. we discuss these results in the framework ofsynchrotron self-compton models.

0810.1676	agile detection of intense gamma-ray emission from the blazar pks  1510-089	we report the detection by the agile (astro-rivelatore gamma a immaginileggero) satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the source aglj1511-0909, associated with the powerful quasar pks 1510-089, during ten daysof observations from 23 august to 1 september 2007. during the observationperiod, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitoredby the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt). the simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us tostudy the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on thesynchrotron and inverse compton (ic) emission mechanisms. agile observed thesource with its two co-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector and thehard x-ray imager super-agile sensitive in the 30 mev - 50 gev and 18 - 60 kevbands, respectively. between 23 and 27 august 2007, agile detected gamma-rayemission from pks 1510-089 when this source was located about 50 degreesoff-axis, with an average flux of (270 +/- 65) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}for photon energy above 100 mev. in the following period, 28 august - 1september, after a satellite re-pointing, agile detected the source at about 35degrees off-axis, with an average flux (e &gt; 100 mev) of (195 +/- 30) x 10^{-8}photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no emission was detected by super-agile, with a 3-sigmaupper limit of 45 mcrab in 200 ksec. the spectral energy distribution ismodelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton (ssc) emissionplus contributions by external photons: the ssc emission contributes primarilyto the x-ray band, whereas the contribution of the ic from the external discand the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.

0810.2424	a new activity phase of the blazar 3c 454.3. multifrequency observations  by the webt and xmm-newton in 2007-2008	we present and analyse the webt multifrequency observations of 3c 454.3 inthe 2007-2008 observing season, including xmm-newton observations and near-irspectroscopic monitoring, and compare the recent emission behaviour with thepast one. in the optical band we observed a multi-peak outburst in july-august2007, and other faster events in november 2007 - february 2008. during theseoutburst phases, several episodes of intranight variability were detected. a mmoutburst was observed starting from mid 2007, whose rising phase wascontemporaneous to the optical brightening. a slower flux increase alsoaffected the higher radio frequencies, the flux enhancement disappearing below8 ghz. the analysis of the optical-radio correlation and time delays, as wellas the behaviour of the mm light curve, confirm our previous predictions,suggesting that changes in the jet orientation likely occurred in the last fewyears. the historical multiwavelength behaviour indicates that a significantvariation in the viewing angle may have happened around year 2000. colouranalysis reveals a complex spectral behaviour, which is due to the interplay ofdifferent emission components. all the near-ir spectra show a prominent halphaemission line, whose flux appears nearly constant. the analysis of thexmm-newton data indicates a correlation between the uv excess and thesoft-x-ray excess, which may represent the head and the tail of the big bluebump, respectively. the x-ray flux correlates with the optical flux, suggestingthat in the inverse-compton process either the seed photons are synchrotronphotons at ir-optical frequencies or the relativistic electrons are those thatproduce the optical synchrotron emission. the x-ray radiation would thus beproduced in the jet region from where the ir-optical emission comes.

0810.4261	results of webt, vlba and rxte monitoring of 3c 279 during 2006-2007	we present radio-to-optical data taken by the webt, supplemented by vlba andrxte observations, of 3c 279. our goal is to use this extensive database todraw inferences regarding the physics of the relativistic jet. we assemblemultifrequency light curves with data from 30 ground-based observatories andthe space-based instruments, along with linear polarization vs. time in theoptical r band. in addition, we present a sequence of 22 images (withpolarization vectors) at 43 ghz at resolution 0.15 milliarcsec, obtained withthe vlba. we analyse the light curves and polarization, as well as the spectralenergy distributions at different epochs, corresponding to different brightnessstates. the ir-optical-uv continuum spectrum of the variable componentcorresponds to a power law with a constant slope of -1.6, while in the 2.4-10kev x-ray band it varies in slope from -1.1 to -1.6. the steepest x-rayspectrum occurs at a flux minimum. during a decline in flux from maximum inlate 2006, the optical and 43 ghz core polarization vectors rotate by ~300degrees. the continuum spectrum agrees with steady injection of relativisticelectrons with a power-law energy distribution of slope -3.2 that is steepenedto -4.2 at high energies by radiative losses. the x-ray emission at fluxminimum comes most likely from a new component that starts in an upstreamsection of the jet where inverse compton scattering of seed photons fromoutside the jet is important. the rotation of the polarization vector impliesthat the jet contains a helical magnetic field that extends ~20 pc past the 43ghz core.
