0906.0248	optical and submillimetre observations of bok globules -- tracing the  magnetic field from low to high density	we present optical and submillimetre polarimetry data of the bok globule cb3and optical polarimetry data of the bok globule cb246. we use each set ofpolarimetry data to infer the b-field orientation in each of the clouds. theoptical data can only be used in the low density, low extinction edge regionsof clouds. the submillimetre data can only be used in the high column-density,central regions of the clouds.  it has previously been found that near-infrared polarisation mapping ofbackground stars does not accurately trace the magnetic field in dense cloudregions. this may be due to a lack of aligned grains in dense regions. we testthis by comparing the field orientations measured by our two independentpolarimetry methods. we find that the field orientation deduced from theoptical data matches up well with the orientation estimated from thesubmillimetre data. we therefore claim that both methods are accurately tracingthe same magnetic field in cb3. hence, in this case, there must be significantnumbers of aligned dust grains in the high density region, and they do indeedtrace the magnetic field in the submillimetre.  we find an offset of 40$\pm$14 degrees between the magnetic field orientationand the short axis of the globule. this is consistent with the mean value of31$\pm$3 degrees found in our previous work on prestellar cores, even thoughcb3 is a protostellar core. taken together, the six prestellar cores that wehave now studied in this way show a mean offset between magnetic fieldorientation and core short axis of $\sim30\pm$3 degrees, in apparentcontradiction with some models of magnetically dominated star formation.

0707.0169	the james clerk maxwell telescope legacy survey of nearby star-forming  regions in the gould belt	this paper describes a james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) legacy surveythat has been awarded roughly 500 hrs of observing time to be carried out from2007 to 2009. in this survey we will map with scuba-2 (submillimetre commonuser bolometer array 2) almost all of the well-known low-mass andintermediate-mass star-forming regions within 0.5 kpc that are accessible fromthe jcmt. most of these locations are associated with the gould belt. fromthese observations we will produce a flux-limited snapshot of star formationnear the sun, providing a legacy of images, as well as point-source andextended-source catalogues, over almost 700 square degrees of sky. theresulting images will yield the first catalogue of prestellar and protostellarsources selected by submillimetre continuum emission, and should increase thenumber of known sources by more than an order of magnitude. we will also obtainco maps with the array receiver harp (heterodyne array receiver programme), inthree co isotopologues, of a large typical sample of prestellar andprotostellar sources. we will then map the brightest hundred sources with thescuba-2 polarimeter (pol-2), producing the first statistically significant setof polarization maps in the submillimetre. the images and source catalogueswill be a powerful reference set for astronomers, providing a detailed legacyarchive for future telescopes, including alma, herschel and jwst.

0707.0489	an unbiased survey of 500 nearby stars for debris disks: a jcmt legacy  program	we present the scientific motivation and observing plan for an upcomingdetection survey for debris disks using the james clerk maxwell telescope. thescuba-2 unbiased nearby stars (suns) survey will observe 500 nearby mainsequence and sub-giant stars (100 of each of the a, f, g, k and m spectralclasses) to the 850 micron extragalactic confusion limit to search for evidenceof submillimeter excess, an indication of circumstellar material. the surveydistance boundaries are 8.6, 16.5, 22, 25 and 45 pc for m, k, g, f and a stars,respectively, and all targets lie between the declinations of -40 deg to 80deg. in this survey, no star will be rejected based on its inherent properties:binarity, presence of planetary companions, spectral type or age. this will bethe first unbiased survey for debris disks since iras. we expect to detect ~125debris disks, including ~50 cold disks not detectable in current shorterwavelength surveys. a substantial amount of complementary data will be requiredto constrain the temperatures and masses of discovered disks. high resolutionstudies will likely be required to resolve many of the disks. therefore, thesesystems will be the focus of future observational studies using a variety ofobservatories to characterize their physical properties. for non-detectedsystems, this survey will set constraints (upper limits) on the amount ofcircumstellar dust, of typically 200 times the kuiper belt mass, but as low as10 times the kuiper belt mass for the nearest stars in the sample(approximately 2 pc).

1002.2020	the jcmt legacy survey of the gould belt: a first look at taurus with  harp	as part of a jcmt legacy survey of star formation in the gould belt, wepresent early science results for taurus. co j=3-2 maps have been secured alongthe north-west ridge and bowl, collectively known as l 1495, along with deep13co and c18o j=3-2 maps in two sub-regions. with these data we search formolecular outflows, and use the distribution of flows, hh objects and shockedh2 line emission features, together with the population of young stars,protostellar cores and starless condensations to map star formation across thisextensive region. in total 21 outflows are identified. it is clear that thebowl is more evolved than the ridge, harbouring a greater population of t tauristars and a more diffuse, more turbulent ambient medium. by comparison, theridge contains a much younger, less widely distributed population of protostarswhich, in turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. weestimate the ratio of the numbers of prestellar to protostellar cores in l 1495to be ~ 1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores to(gravitationally bound) prestellar cores to be ~ 1. if we take previousestimates of the protostellar lifetime of ~ 5 x 10^5 yrs, this indicates aprestellar lifetime of 9(+/-3) x 10^5 yrs. from the number of outflows we alsocrudely estimate the star formation efficiency in l 1495, finding it to becompatible with a canonical value of 10-15 %. we note that molecularoutflow-driving sources have redder near-ir colours than their hh jet-drivingcounterparts. we also find that the smaller, denser cores are associated withthe more massive outflows, as one might expect if mass build-up in the flowincreases with the collapse and contraction of the protostellar envelope.

1002.2475	the 6-ghz methanol multibeam maser catalogue i: galactic centre region,  longitudes 345 to 6	we have conducted a galactic plane survey of methanol masers at 6668 mhzusing a 7-beam receiver on the parkes telescope. here we present results fromthe first part, which provides sensitive unbiased coverage of a large regionaround the galactic centre. details are given for 183 methanol maser sites inthe longitude range 345$^{\circ}$ through the galactic centre to 6$^{\circ}$.within 6$^{\circ}$ of the centre, we found 88 maser sites, of which more thanhalf (48) are new discoveries. the masers are confined to a narrow galacticlatitude range, indicative of many sources at the galactic centre distance andbeyond, and confined to a thin disk population; there is no high latitudepopulation that might be ascribed to the galactic bulge.  within 2$^{\circ}$ of the galactic centre the maser velocities all liebetween -60 and +77 \kms, a range much smaller than the 540 \kms range observedin co. elsewhere, the maser with highest positive velocity (+107 \kms) occurs,surprisingly, near longitude 355$^{\circ}$ and is probably attributable to thegalactic bar. the maser with the most negative velocity (-127 \kms) is nearlongitude 346$^{\circ}$, within the longitude-velocity locus of the near sideof the `3-kpc arm'. it has the most extreme velocity of a clear population ofmasers associated with the near and far sides of the 3-kpc arm. closer to thegalactic centre the maser space density is generally low, except within 0.25kpc of the centre itself, the `galactic centre zone', where it is 50 timeshigher, which is hinted at by the longitude distribution, and confirmed by theunusual velocities.

1005.1506	mapping the column density and dust temperature structure of irdcs with  herschel	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are cold and dense reservoirs of gas potentiallyavailable to form stars. many of these clouds are likely to be pristinestructures representing the initial conditions for star formation. the studypresented here aims to construct and analyze accurate column density and dusttemperature maps of irdcs by using the first herschel data from the hi-galgalactic plane survey. these fundamental quantities, are essential forunderstanding processes such as fragmentation in the early stages of theformation of stars in molecular clouds. we have developed a simplepixel-by-pixel sed fitting method, which accounts for the background emission.by fitting a grey-body function at each position, we recover the spatialvariations in both the dust column density and temperature within the irdcs.this method is applied to a sample of 22 irdcs exhibiting a range of angularsizes and peak column densities. our analysis shows that the dust temperaturedecreases significantly within irdcs, from background temperatures of 20-30 kto minimum temperatures of 8-15 k within the clouds, showing that densemolecular clouds are not isothermal. temperature gradients have most likely animportant impact on the fragmentation of irdcs. local temperature minima arestrongly correlated with column density peaks, which in a few cases reach nh2 =1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, identifying these clouds as candidate massive prestellarcores. applying this technique to the full hi-gal data set will provideimportant constraints on the fragmentation and thermal properties of irdcs, andhelp identify hundreds of massive prestellar core candidates.

1005.1565	the physical properties of the dust in the rcw 120 hii region as seen by  herschel	context. rcw 120 is a well-studied, nearby galactic hii region with ongoingstar formation in its surroundings. previous work has shown that it displays abubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths and has a massive layer ofcollected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. given the well-definedphoto-dissociation region (pdr) boundary and collected layer, it is anexcellent laboratory to study the "collect and collapse" process of triggeredstar formation. using herschel space observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350,and 500 micron, in combination with spitzer and apex-laboca data, we can forthe first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an hii region athigh angular resolution. aims. we seek a better understanding of rcw120 and itslocal environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. additionally,we wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to thedust temperature. methods. we determine dust temperatures in selected regionsof the rcw 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (sed),derived using aperture photometry. additionally, we fit the sed extracted froma grid of positions to create a temperature map. results. we find a gradient indust temperature, ranging from &gt;30 k in the interior of rcw 120, to ~20k forthe material collected in the pdr, to ~10k toward local infrared dark cloudsand cold filaments. our results suggest that rcw 120 is in the process ofdestroying the pdr delineating its bubble morphology. the leaked radiation fromits interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. wefind support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta,in rough agreement with what has been found previously. the extended wavelengthcoverage of the herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1103.0201	characterizing interstellar filaments with herschel in ic5146	we provide a first look at the results of the herschel gould belt surveytoward the ic5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of thefilamentary structure in this region. the column density map, derived from our70-500 micron herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, andconfirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. weanalyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that theunderlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at largeradii. our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by anarrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, whichis in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central jeans lengths.this characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 tothe sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffusegas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of thedissipation of large-scale turbulence.

1104.2170	the immediate environment of the class 0 protostar vla1623, on scales of  ~50-100 au, observed at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths	we present high angular resolution observations, taken with the very largearray (vla) and multiple element radio linked interferometer network (merlin)radio telescopes, at 7mm and 4.4cm respectively, of the prototype class 0protostar vla1623. at 7mm we detect two sources (vla1623a &amp; b) coincident withthe two previously detected components at the centre of this system. theseparation between the two is 1.2arcsec, or ~170au at an assumed distance of139pc. the upper limit to the size of the source coincident with each componentof vla1623 is ~0.7arcsec, in agreement with previous findings. this correspondsto a diameter of ~100au at an assumed distance of 139pc. both components showthe same general trend in their broadband continuum spectra, of a steeper dustcontinuum spectrum shortward of 7mm and a flatter spectrum longward of this.  we estimate an upper limit to the vla1623a disc mass of &lt;0.13msol and anupper limit to its radius of ~50au. the longer wavelength data have a spectralindex of \alpha~0.6+/-0.3. this is too steep to be explained by optically thinfree-free emission. it is most likely due to optically thick free-freeemission. alternatively, we speculate that it might be due to the formation oflarger grains or planetesimals in the circumstellar disc. we estimate the massof vla1623b to be &lt;0.15m$sol. we can place a lower limit to its size of ~30x7au, and an upper limit to its diameter of ~100au. the longer wavelength data ofvla1623b also have a spectral index of \alpha~0.6+/-0.3. the nature of vla1623bremains a matter of debate. it could be a binary companion to the protostar, ora knot in the radio jet from vla1623a.

1106.1885	the initial conditions of isolated star formation - x. a suggested  evolutionary diagram for prestellar cores	we propose an evolutionary path for prestellar cores on the radius-massdiagram, which is analogous to stellar evolutionary paths on thehertzsprung-russell diagram. using james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt)observations of l1688 in the ophiuchus star-forming complex, we analyse thehco+ (j=4\rightarrow3) spectral line profiles of prestellar cores. we find thatof the 58 cores observed, 14 show signs of infall in the form of ablue-asymmetric double-peaked line profile. these 14 cores all lie beyond thejeans mass line for the region on a radius-mass plot. furthermore another 10cores showing tentative signs of infall, in their spectral line profile shapes,appear on or just over the jeans mass line. we therefore propose the manner inwhich a prestellar core evolves across this diagram. we hypothesise that a coreis formed in the low-mass, low-radius region of the plot. it then accretesquasistatically, increasing in both mass and radius. when it crosses the limitof gravitational instability it begins to collapse, decreasing in radius,towards the region of the diagram where protostellar cores are seen.

1202.0395	cores in infra-red dark clouds (irdcs) seen in the hi-gal survey between  l = 300{\deg} and l = 330{\deg}	we have used data taken as part of the herschel infrared galactic planesurvey (hi-gal) to study 3171 infrared-dark cloud (irdc) candidates that wereidentified in the mid-infrared (8 {\mu}m) by spitzer (we refer to these as'spitzer-dark' regions). they all lie in the range l=300 - 330 \circ and |b| 61 \circ. of these, only 1205 were seen in emission in the far-infrared (250-500{\mu}m) by herschel (we call these 'herschel-bright' clouds). it is predictedthat a dense cloud will not only be seen in absorption in the mid-infrared, butwill also be seen in emission in the far-infrared at the longest herschelwavebands (250-500 {\mu}m). if a region is dark at all wavelengths throughoutthe mid-infrared and far-infrared, then it is most likely to be simply a regionof lower background infrared emission (a 'hole in the sky'). hence, it appearsthat previous surveys, based on spitzer and other mid-infrared data alone, mayhave over-estimated the total irdc population by a factor of 2. this hasimplications for estimates of the star formation rate in irdcs in the galaxy.westudied the 1205 herschel-bright irdcs at 250 {\mu}m, and found that 972 ofthem had at least one clearly defined 250-{\mu}m peak, indicating that theycontained one or more dense cores. of these, 653 (67 per cent) contained an8-{\mu}m point source somewhere within the cloud, 149 (15 per cent) contained a24-{\mu}m point source but no 8-{\mu}m source, and 170 (18 per cent) containedno 24-{\mu}m or 8-{\mu}m point sources. we use these statistics to makeinferences about the lifetimes of the various evolutionary stages of irdcs.

1202.1413	the herschel view of the on-going star formation in the vela-c molecular  cloud	as part of the herschel guaranteed time key program 'hobys', we present thephotometric survey of the star forming region vela-c, one of the nearest sitesof low-to-high-mass star formation in the galactic plane. vela-c has beenobserved with pacs and spire in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over anarea of about 3 square degrees. a photometric catalogue has been extracted fromthe detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the localbackground. out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. their spectral energydistributions (seds) have been fitted with a modified black body function. weclassify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. for two furthersources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are class0 protostars.  from sed fitting we have derived key physical parameters. protostellarsources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. boththese evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) ofmoderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a morepeaked intensity distribution. moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellarsources may indicate that they will not fragment further. a virial analysis ofthe starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sourcesgravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. we fit a power law n(logm) propm^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.this is in between that typical of co clumps and those of cores in nearbystar-forming regions. we interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of oursample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

1203.3403	the pipe nebula as seen with herschel: formation of filamentary  structures by large-scale compression ?	a growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments ininterstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. in thispaper, we present new herschel pacs and spire observations of the b59 and stemregions in the pipe nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network offilaments. the asymmetric column density profiles observed for severalfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of b59, indicates that the pipe nebulais being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from thenearby sco ob2 association. we suggest that this compressive flow hascontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. inb59, the only region of the entire pipe complex showing star formationactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial columndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsiblefor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in b59. while thequestion of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remainsopen in b59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism forthe initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

1203.6472	cluster-formation in the rosette molecular cloud at the junctions of  filaments	for many years feedback processes generated by ob-stars in molecular clouds,including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or uv-radiation, havebeen proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. however, hydrodynamicmodels including radiation and gravity show that uv-illumination has little orno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. the rosette molecularcloud, irradiated by the ngc2244 cluster, is a template region for triggeredstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure byapplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (disperse), andprobability density functions (pdfs) on herschel column density maps, obtainedwithin the hobys key program. the analysis reveals not only the filamentarystructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lieat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. the pdfs ofsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. the two uv-exposedregions have a double-peaked pdf we interprete as caused by shock compression.the deviations of the pdf from the log-normal shape typically associated withlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, arefound here within the very same cloud. this shows that there is no fundamentaldifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.we conclude that star-formation in rosette - and probably in high-massstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact ofuv-radiation. moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose fromthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced inthe direct interaction zone between an expanding hii--region and the molecularcloud.

1206.1243	the spine of the swan: a herschel study of the dr21 ridge and filaments  in cygnus x	in order to characterise the cloud structures responsible for the formationof high-mass stars, we present herschel observations of the dr21 environment.maps of the column density and dust temperature unveil the structure of thedr21 ridge and several connected filaments. the ridge has column densitieslarger than 1e23/cm^2 over a region of 2.3 pc^2. it shows substructured columndensity profiles and branching into two major filaments in the north. themasses in the studied filaments range between 130 and 1400 msun whereas themass in the ridge is 15000 msun. the accretion of these filaments onto the dr21ridge, suggested by a previous molecular line study, could provide a continuousmass inflow to the ridge. in contrast to the striations seen in e.g., thetaurus region, these filaments are gravitationally unstable and form cores andprotostars. these cores formed in the filaments potentially fall into theridge. both inflow and collisions of cores could be important to drive theobserved high-mass star formation. the evolutionary gradient of star formationrunning from dr21 in the south to the northern branching is traced bydecreasing dust temperature. this evolution and the ridge structure can beexplained by two main filamentary components of the ridge that merged first inthe south.

1206.4837	profiling filaments: comparing near-infrared extinction and  submillimetre data in tmc-1	interstellar filaments are an important part of star formation. to understandthe structure of filaments, cross-section profiles are often fitted withplummer profiles. this profiling is often done with submm studies, such asherschel. it would be convenient if filament properties could also be studiedusing groundbased nir data. we compare the filament profiles obtained by nirextinction and submm observations to find out if reliable profiles can bederived using nir data. we use j-, h-, and k-band data of a filament north oftmc-1 to derive an extinction map from colour excesses of background stars. wecompare the plummer profiles obtained from extinction maps with herschel dustemission maps. we present 2 methods to estimate profiles from nir: plummerprofile fits to median av of stars or directly to the av of individual stars.we compare the methods by simulations. in simulations extinction maps and thenew methods give correct results to within ~10-20 for modest densities. directfit to data on individual stars gives more accurate results than extinctionmap, and can work in higher density. in profile fits to real observations,values of plummer parameters are generally similar to within a factor of ~2.although parameter values can vary significantly, estimates of filament massusually remain accurate to within some tens of per cent. our results for tmc-1are in agreement with earlier results. high resolution nir data give moredetails, but 2mass data can be used to estimate profiles. nir extinction can beused as an alternative to submm observations to profile filaments. direct fitsof stars can also be a valuable tool. plummer profile parameters are not alwayswell constrained, and caution should be taken when making fits. in theevaluation of plummer parameters, one can use the independence of dust emissionand nir data and the difference in the shapes of the confidence regions.

1209.5290	herschel observations of b1-bs and b1-bn: two first hydrostatic core  candidates in the perseus star-forming cloud	we report far-ir herschel observations obtained between 70 $\mu$m and 500$\mu$m of two star-forming dusty condensations, b1-bs and b1-bn, in the b1region of the perseus star-forming cloud. in the western part of the perseuscloud, b1-bs is the only source detected in all of the 6 pacs and spirephotometric bands without being visible in the spitzer map at 24 $\mu$m. b1-bnis clearly detected between 100 $\mu$m and 250 $\mu$m. we have fitted thespectral energy distributions of these sources to derive their physicalproperties, and find that a simple greybody model fails to reproduce theobserved seds. at least a two-component model, consisting of a central sourcesurrounded by a dusty envelope is required. the properties derived from thefit, however, suggest that the central source is not a class 0 object. we thenconclude that while b1-bs and b1-bn appear to be more evolved than apre-stellar core, the best-fit models suggest that their central objects areyounger than a class 0 source. hence, they may be good candidates to beexamples of the first hydrostatic core phase. the projected distance betweenb1-bs and b1-bn is a few jeans lengths. if their physical separation is closeto this value, this pair would allow the mutual interactions between twoforming stars at a very early stage of their evolution to be studied.

1212.1784	the mid-infrared environments of 6.7 ghz methanol masers from the  methanol multi-beam survey	we present a study of the mid-infrared environments and association with starformation tracers of 6.7 ghz methanol masers taken from the methanol multi-beam(mmb) survey. our ultimate goal is to establish the mass of the host star andits evolutionary stage for each maser site. as a first step, the glimpse surveyof the galactic plane is utilised to investigate the environment of 776methanol masers and we find that while the majority of the masers areassociated with mid-infrared counterparts, a significant fraction (17%) are notassociated with any detectable mid-infrared emission. a number of the masercounterparts are clearly extended with respect to the glimpse point spreadfunction and we implement an adaptive non-circular aperture photometry (ancap)technique to determine the fluxes of the maser counterparts. the ancaptechnique doubles the number of masers with flux information at all fourwavelengths compared to the number of the corresponding counterparts obtainedfrom the glimpse point source catalogue. the colours of the maser counterpartsare found to be very similar to the smaller study carried out by ellingsen(2006). the mmb masers are weakly associated with extended green objects (egos)and red msx survey (rms) embedded sources (yso and hii classifications) with18% and 12% of masers associated with these objects respectively. the majorityof mmb masers (60%) have detectable glimpse infrared counterparts but have notbeen identified with previously recognised tracers of massive star formation;this confirms that the mmb survey has the potential to identify massive starforming regions independent of infrared selection.

1304.0327	what determines the density structure of molecular clouds ? a case study  of orion b with herschel	a key parameter to the description of all star formation processes is thedensity structure of the gas. in this letter, we make use of probabilitydistribution functions (pdfs) of herschel column density maps of orion b,aquila, and polaris, obtained with the herschel gould belt survey (hgbs). weaim to understand which physical processes influence the pdf shape, and withwhich signatures. the pdfs of orion b (aquila) show a lognormal distributionfor low column densities until av 3 (6), and a power-law tail for high columndensities, consistent with a rho r^-2 profile for the equivalent sphericaldensity distribution. the pdf of orion b is broadened by external compressiondue to the nearby ob stellar aggregates. the pdf of a quiescent subregion ofthe non-star-forming polaris cloud is nearly lognormal, indicating thatsupersonic turbulence governs the density distribution. but we also observe adeviation from the lognormal shape at av&gt;1 for a subregion in polaris thatincludes a prominent filament. we conclude that (i) the point where the pdfdeviates from the lognormal form does not trace a universal av-threshold forstar formation, (ii) statistical density fluctuations, intermittency andmagnetic fields can cause excess from the lognormal pdf at an early cloudformation stage, (iii) core formation and/or global collapse of filaments and anon-isothermal gas distribution lead to a power-law tail, and (iv) externalcompression broadens the column density pdf, consistent with numericalsimulations.

1304.4098	first results from the herschel gould belt survey in taurus	the whole of the taurus region (a total area of 52 sq. deg.) has beenobserved by the herschel spire and pacs instruments at wavelengths of 70, 160,250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m as part of the herschel gould belt survey. in thispaper we present the first results from the part of the taurus region thatincludes the barnard 18 and l1536 clouds. a new source-finding routine, thecardiff source-finding algorithm (csar), is introduced, which is loosely basedon clumpfind, but that also generates a structure tree, or dendrogram, whichcan be used to interpret hierarchical clump structure in a complex region.sources were extracted from the data using the hierarchical version of csar andplotted on a mass-size diagram. we found a hierarchy of objects with sizes inthe range 0.024-2.7 pc. previous studies showed that gravitationally boundprestellar cores and unbound starless clumps appeared in different places onthe mass-size diagram. however, it was unclear whether this was due to a lackof instrumental dynamic range or whether they were actually two distinctpopulations. the excellent sensitivity of herschel shows that our sources fillthe gap in the mass-size plane between starless and pre-stellar cores, andgives the first clear supporting observational evidence for the theory thatunbound clumps and (gravitationally bound) prestellar cores are all part of thesame population, and hence presumably part of the same evolutionary sequence(c.f. simpson et al. 2011).

1311.5086	reconstructing the density and temperature structure of prestellar cores  from $herschel$ data: a case study for b68 and l1689b	utilizing multi-wavelength dust emission maps acquired with $herschel$, wereconstruct local volume density and dust temperature profiles for theprestellar cores b68 and l1689b using inverse-abel transform based technique.we present intrinsic radial dust temperature profiles of starless coresdirectly from dust continuum emission maps disentangling the effect oftemperature variations along the line of sight which was previously limited tothe radiative transfer calculations. the reconstructed dust temperatureprofiles show a significant drop in core center, a flat inner part, and arising outward trend until the background cloud temperature is reached. thecentral beam-averaged dust temperatures obtained for b68 and l1689b are 9.3$\pm$ 0.5 k and 9.8 $\pm$0.5 k, respectively, which are lower than thetemperatures of 11.3 k and 11.6 k obtained from direct sed fitting. the bestmass estimates derived by integrating the volume density profiles of b68 andl1689b are 1.6 m_sol and 11 m_sol, respectively. comparing our results for b68with the near-infrared extinction studies, we find that the dust opacity lawadopted by the hgbs project, $\kappa_{\lambda} =0.1(\lambda/300 \mu m)^{-2}$,agrees to within 50% with the dust extinction constraints

1401.7871	properties of starless and prestellar cores in taurus revealed by  herschel spire/pacs imaging	the density and temperature structures of dense cores in the l1495 cloud ofthe taurus star-forming region are investigated using herschel spire and pacsimages in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$mcontinuum bands. a sample consisting of 20 cores, selected using spectral andspatial criteria, is analysed using a new maximum likelihood technique,corefit, which takes full account of the instrumental point spread functions.we obtain central dust temperatures, $t_0$, in the range 6-12 k and find that,in the majority of cases, the radial density falloff at large radial distancesis consistent with the $r^{-2}$ variation expected for bonnor-ebert spheres.two of our cores exhibit a significantly steeper falloff, however, and sinceboth appear to be gravitationally unstable, such behaviour may haveimplications for collapse models. we find a strong negative correlation between$t_0$ and peak column density, as expected if the dust is heated predominantlyby the interstellar radiation field. at the temperatures we estimate for thecore centres, carbon-bearing molecules freeze out as ice mantles on dustgrains, and this behaviour is supported here by the lack of correspondencebetween our estimated core locations and the previously-published positions ofh$^{13}$co$^+$ peaks. on this basis, our observations suggest asublimation-zone radius typically $\sim 10^4$ au. comparison withpreviously-published n$_2$h$^+$ data at 8400 au resolution, however, shows noevidence for n$_2$h$^+$ depletion at that resolution.

1403.2426	a herschel and bima study of the sequential star formation near the w48a  hii region	we present the results of herschel hobys photometric mapping combined withbima observations and additional archival data, and perform an in-depth studyof the evolutionary phases of the star-forming clumps in w 48a and theirsurroundings. age estimates for the compact sources were derived frombolometric luminosities and envelope masses, which were obtained from the dustcontinuum emission, and agree within an order of magnitude with age estimatesfrom molecular line and radio data. the clumps in w 48a are linearly aligned byage (east-old to west-young): we find a ultra compact (uc) hii region, a youngstellar object (yso) with class ii methanol maser emission, a yso with amassive outflow, and finally the nh_2d prestellar cores from pillai et al. thisremarkable positioning reflects the (star) formation history of the region. wefind that it is unlikely that the star formation in the w 48a molecular cloudwas triggered by the uchii region and discuss the aquila supershell expansionas a mayor influence on the evolution of w 48a. we conclude that thecombination of herschel continuum data with interferometric molecular line andradio continuum data is important to derive trustworthy age estimates andinterpret the origin of large scale structures through kinematic information.

1405.0331	comparison of prestellar core elongations and large-scale molecular  cloud structures in the lupus i region	turbulence and magnetic fields are expected to be important for regulatingmolecular cloud formation and evolution. however, their effects on subparsec to100 parsec scales, leading to the formation of starless cores, is not wellunderstood. we investigate the prestellar core structure morphologies obtainedfrom analysis of the herschel-spire 350 $\mu$m maps of the lupus i cloud. thisdistribution is first compared on a statistical basis to the large scale shapeof the main filament. we find the distribution of the elongation position angleof the cores to be consistent with a random distribution, which means nospecific orientation of the morphology of the cores is observed with respect toa large-scale filament shape model for lupus i, or relative to a large-scalebent filament model. this distribution is also compared to the mean orientationof the large-scale magnetic fields probed at 350 $\mu$m with the balloon-bornelarge aperture telescope for polarimetry (blastpol) during its 2010 campaign.here again we do not find any correlation between the core morphologydistribution and the average orientation of the magnetic fields on parsecscales. our main conclusion is that the local filament dynamics - includingsecondary filaments that often run orthogonally to the primary filament - andpossibly small-scale variations in the local magnetic field direction, could bethe dominant factors for explaining the final orientation of each core.

1407.1882	blastbus electronics: general-purpose readout and control for  balloon-borne experiments	we present the second generation blastbus electronics. the primary purposesof this system are detector readout, attitude control, and cryogenichousekeeping, for balloon-borne telescopes. readout of neutron transmutationdoped germanium (ntd-ge) bolometers requires low noise and parallel acquisitionof hundreds of analog signals. controlling a telescope's attitude requires thecapability to interface to a wide variety of sensors and motors, and to usethem together in a fast, closed loop. to achieve these different goals, theblastbus system employs a flexible motherboard-daughterboard architecture. theprogrammable motherboard features a digital signal processor (dsp) andfield-programmable gate array (fpga), as well as slots for threedaughterboards. the daughterboards provide the interface to the outside world,with versions for analog to digital conversion, and optoisolated digitalinput/output. with the versatility afforded by this design, the blastbus alsofinds uses in cryogenic, thermometry, and power systems. for accurate timingcontrol to tie everything together, the system operates in a fully synchronousmanner. blastbus electronics have been successfully deployed to the south pole,and flown on stratospheric balloons.

1412.5965	the jcmt gould belt survey: evidence for radiative heating in serpens  mwc 297 and its influence on local star formation	we present scuba-2 450micron and 850micron observations of the serpens mwc297 region, part of the jcmt gould belt survey of nearby star-forming regions.simulations suggest that radiative feedback influences the star-formationprocess and we investigate observational evidence for this by constructingtemperature maps. maps are derived from the ratio of scuba-2 fluxes and a twocomponent model of the jcmt beam for a fixed dust opacity spectral index ofbeta = 1.8. within 40 of the b1.5ve herbig star mwc 297, the submillimetrefluxes are contaminated by free-free emission with a spectral index of1.03+-0.02, consistent with an ultra-compact hii region and polar winds/jets.contamination accounts for 73+-5 per cent and 82+-4 per cent of peak flux at450micron and 850micron respectively. the residual thermal disk of the star isalmost undetectable at these wavelengths. young stellar objects are confirmedwhere scuba-2 850micron clumps identified by the fellwalker algorithm coincidewith spitzer gould belt survey detections. we identify 23 objects and use tbolto classify nine ysos with masses 0.09 to 5.1 msun. we find two class 0, oneclass 0/i, three class i and three class ii sources. the mean temperature is15+-2k for the nine ysos and 32+-4k for the 14 starless clumps. we observe astarless clump with an abnormally high mean temperature of 46+-2k and concludethat it is radiatively heated by the star mwc 297. jeans stability providesevidence that radiative heating by the star mwc 297 may be suppressing clumpcollapse.

1501.06589	6.7ghz methanol maser associated outflows: an evolutionary sequence	we present a continuing study of a sample 44 molecular outflows, observed in13co lines, closely associated with 6.7ghz methanol masers, hence calledmethanol maser associated outflows (mmaos). we compare mmao properties withthose of outflows from other surveys in the literature. in general, mmaosfollow similar trends, but show a deficit in number at low masses and momenta,with a corresponding higher fraction at the high end of the distributions. asimilar trend is seen for the dynamical timescales of mmaos. we argue that thelack of relatively low mass and young flows in mmaos is due to the inherentselection-bias in the sample, i.e. its direct association with 6.7ghz methanolmasers. this implies that methanol masers must switch on after the onset ofoutflows (hence accretion), and not before a sufficient abundance of methanolis liberated from icy dust mantles. consequently the average dynamical age ofmmaos is older than for the general population of molecular outflows. wepropose an adjusted evolutionary sequence of outflow and maser occurrence inthe hot core phase, where methanol masers turn on after the onset of theoutflow phase.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1507.05926	a census of dense cores in the aquila cloud complex: spire/pacs  observations from the herschel gould belt survey	we present and discuss the results of the herschel gould belt surveyobservations in a ~11 deg^2 area of the aquila molecular cloud complex at d~260pc, imaged with the spire/pacs cameras from 70 to 500 micron. we identify acomplete sample of starless dense cores and embedded protostars in this region,and analyze their global properties and spatial distributions. we find a totalof 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellarcores, and they will likely form stars in the future. we also detect 58protostellar cores. the core mass function (cmf) derived for the prestellarcores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (imf),supporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the imfand the cmf. the global shift in mass scale observed between the cmf and theimf is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. bycomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,we estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 myr. we find a strongcorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and thedensest filaments. about 90% of the herschel-identified prestellar cores arelocated above a background column density corresponding to a_v~7, and ~75% ofthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unitlength &gt;~16 m_sun/pc. these findings support a picture wherein the cores makingup the peak of the cmf (and probably responsible for the base of the imf)result primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginallysupercritical filaments. given that filaments appear to dominate the massbudget of dense gas at a_v&gt;7, our findings also suggest that the physics ofprestellar core formation within filaments is responsible for a characteristic"efficiency" sfr/m_dense ~5+-2 x 10^-8 yr^-1 for the star formation process indense gas.

1509.01819	a possible link between the power spectrum of interstellar filaments and  the origin of the prestellar core mass function	two major features of the prestellar cmf are: 1) a broad peak below 1 msun,presumably corresponding to a mean gravitational fragmentation scale, and 2) acharacteristic power-law slope, very similar to the salpeter slope of thestellar initial mass function (imf) at the high-mass end. while recent herschelobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar cmf is close to thethermal jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of thepower-law tail of the cmf/imf at the high-mass end is less clear. inutsuka(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-lawtail can be understood as resulting from the growth of an initial spectrum ofdensity perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellarturbulence. here, we report the statistical properties of the line-massfluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with herschelusing a 1-d power spectrum analysis. the observed filament power spectra werefitted by a power-law function $(p_{true}(s) \propto s^{\alpha})$ afterremoving the effect of beam convolution at small scales. a gaussian-likedistribution of power-spectrum slopes was found centered at -1.6, close to thatof the one-dimensional velocity power spectrum generated by subsonickolomogorov turbulence (-1.67). an empirical correlation, $p^{0.5}(s_0) \propto&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;^{1.4 \pm 0.1} $, was also found between the amplitude of eachfilament power spectrum $p(s_0)$ and the mean column density along the filament$&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;$. finally, the dispersion of line-mass fluctuations along eachfilament $\sigma_{\rm m_{line}}$ was found to scale with the physical length$l$ of the filament, roughly as $\sigma_{m_{line}} \propto l^{0.7}$. overall,our results are consistent with the suggestion that the bulk of the cmf/imfresults from the gravitational fragmentation of filaments.

1509.06385	the jcmt gould belt survey: a quantitative comparison between scuba-2  data reduction methods	performing ground-based submillimetre observations is a difficult task as themeasurements are subject to absorption and emission from water vapour in theearth's atmosphere and time variation in weather and instrument stability.removing these features and other artifacts from the data is a vital processwhich affects the characteristics of the recovered astronomical structure weseek to study. in this paper, we explore two data reduction methods for datataken with the submillimetre common-user bolometer array-2 (scuba-2) at thejames clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). the jcmt legacy reduction 1 (jcmt lr1)and the gould belt legacy survey legacy release 1 (gbs lr1) reduction both usethe same software, starlink, but differ in their choice of data reductionparameters. we find that the jcmt lr1 reduction is suitable for determiningwhether or not compact emission is present in a given region and the gbs lr1reduction is tuned in a robust way to uncover more extended emission, whichbetter serves more in-depth physical analyses of star-forming regions. usingthe gbs lr1 method, we find that compact sources are recovered well, even at apeak brightness of only 3 times the noise, whereas the reconstruction of largerobjects requires much care when drawing boundaries around the expectedastronomical signal in the data reduction process. incorrect boundaries canlead to false structure identification or it can cause structure to be missed.in the jcmt lr1 reduction, the extent of the true structure of objects largerthan a point source is never fully recovered.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

0705.2941	the dust temperatures of the prestellar cores in the rho oph main cloud  and in other star forming regions: consequences for the core mass function	we estimate the dust temperatures of the clumps in the rho oph main cloudtaking into account the 3d geometry of the region, and external heating fromthe interstellar radiation field and from hd147879,a nearby luminous b2v star,which is believed to dominate the radiation field in the region. we find thatthe regions where prestellar cores are observed (i.e. at optical visualextinctions &gt;7 mag) are colder than ~10-11k. these dust temperatures aresmaller than those which previous studies of the same region have assumed. weuse the new dust temperatures to estimate the masses of the prestellar cores inthe rho oph main cloud from mm observations, and we find core masses that arelarger than previous estimates by a factor of ~2-3. this affects the core massfunction (cmf) of the region; we find that the mass at which the core massspectrum steepens from a slope alpha~1.5 to a slope alpha~2.5 has moved from~0.5 msun to ~1msun. in contrast with the cmf in other star forming regions(e.g. orion), there is no indication for a turnover down to the completenesslimit (~0.2msun), but the cmf may flatten at around ~0.4msun. we generalize ourresults to the prestellar cores in taurus and in orion. in taurus the ambientradiation field heating the prestellar cores is believed to be weaker than thanthat in rho oph. hence, the dust temperatures of the cores in taurus areexpected to be below ~ 10-11 k.in orion the radiation field is believed to be10^3 times stronger than the standard interstellar radiation field. based onthis assumption we estimate that the dust temperatures of the prestellar coresin orion are around ~20-30k.

astro-ph;0109173	the initial conditions of isolated star formation. v: isophot imaging  and the temperature and energy balance of pre-stellar cores	iso data taken with the long-wavelength imaging photo-polarimeter isophot arepresented of 18 pre-stellar cores at three far-infrared wavelengths - 90, 170and 200 microns. most of the cores are detected clearly at 170 and 200 but onlyone is detected strongly at 90 microns, indicating that mostly they are verycold, with typical temperatures of only 10-20k. colour temperature images areconstructed for each of the cores. most of the cores are seen to be eitherisothermal, or to have associated temperature gradients from the core centresto their edges, with all except one being cooler at the centre. we compare thedata with previous isocam absorption data and calculate the energy balance forthose cores in common between the two samples. we find that the energy radiatedby each core in the far-ir is similar to that absorbed at shorter wavelengths.hence there is no evidence for a central heating source in any of the cores -even those for which previous evidence for core contraction exists. this is allconsistent with external heating of the cores by the local interstellarradiation field, confirming their pre-stellar nature.

astro-ph;0210294	molecular gas freeze-out in the pre-stellar core l1689b	c17o (j=2-1) observations have been carried out towards the pre-stellar corel1689b. by comparing the relative strengths of the hyperfine components of thisline, the emission is shown to be optically thin. this allows accurate cocolumn densities to be determined and, for reference, this calculation isdescribed in detail. the hydrogen column densities that these measurementsimply are substantially smaller than those calculated from scuba dust emissiondata. furthermore, the c17o column densities are approximately constant acrossl1689b whereas the scuba column densities are peaked towards the centre. themost likely explanation is that co is depleted from the central regions ofl1689b. simple models of pre-stellar cores with an inner depleted region arecompared with the results. this enables the magnitude of the co depletion to bequantified and also allows the spatial extent of the freeze-out to be firmlyestablished. we estimate that within about 5000 au of the centre of l1689b,over 90% of the co has frozen onto grains. this level of depletion can only beachieved after a duration that is at least comparable to the free-falltimescale.

astro-ph;0305604	scuba polarization measurements of the magnetic field strengths in the  l183, l1544, and l43 prestellar cores	we have mapped linearly polarized dust emission from l183 with the jcmt scubapolarimeter and have analyzed these and our previously published data for theprestellar cores l183, l1544, and l43 in order to estimate magnetic fieldstrengths in the plane of the sky, $b_{pos}$. the analysis used thechandrasekhar-fermi technique, which relates the dispersion in polarizationposition angles to $b_{pos}$. we have used these estimates of the fieldstrengths (neglecting the unmeasured line-of-sight component) to find themass-to-magnetic flux ratios $\lambda$ (in units of the critical ratio formagnetic support). results are $b_{pos} \approx 80$ $\mu$g and $\lambda \approx2.6$ for l183, $b_{pos} \approx 140$ $\mu$g and $\lambda \approx 2.3$ forl1544, and $b_{pos} \approx 160$ $\mu$g and $\lambda \approx 1.9$ for l43.hence, without correction for geometrical biases, for all three cores themass-to-flux ratios are supercritical by a factor of $\sim 2$, and magneticsupport cannot prevent collapse. however, a statistical mean correction forgeometrical bias may be up to a factor of three; this correction would reducethe individual $\lambda$'s to $\lambda_{cor} \approx 0.9$, 0.8, and 0.6,respectively; these values are approximately critical or slightly subcritical.these data are consistent with models of star formation driven by ambipolardiffusion in a weakly turbulent medium, but cannot rule out models of starformation driven by turbulence.

astro-ph;0308123	why do starless cores appear more flattened than protostellar cores?	we evaluate the intrinsic three dimensional shapes of molecular cores, byanalysing their projected shapes. we use the recent catalogue of molecular lineobservations of jijina et al. and model the data by the method originallydevised for elliptical galaxies. our analysis broadly supports the conclusionof jones et al. that molecular cores are better represented by triaxialintrinsic shapes (ellipsoids) than biaxial intrinsic shapes (spheroids).however, we find that the best fit to all of the data is obtained with moreextreme axial ratios ($1:0.8:0.4$) than those derived by jones et al.  more surprisingly, we find that starless cores have more extreme axial ratiosthan protostellar cores -- starless cores appear more `flattened'. this is theopposite of what would be expected from modeling the freefall collapse oftriaxial ellipsoids. the collapse of starless cores would be expected toproceed most swiftly along the shortest axis - as has been predicted by everymodeller since zel'dovich - which should produce more flattened cores aroundprotostars, the opposite of what is seen.

astro-ph;0309829	simulating star formation in molecular cloud cores i. the influence of  low levels of turbulence on fragmentation and multiplicity	we present the results of an ensemble of simulations of the collapse andfragmentation of dense star-forming cores. we show that even with very lowlevels of turbulence the outcome is usually a binary, or higher-order multiple,system. we take as the initial conditions for these simulations a typicallow-mass core, based on the average properties of a large sample of observedcores. all the simulated cores start with a mass of $m = 5.4 m_{\odot}$, aflattened central density profile, a ratio of thermal to gravitational energy$\alpha_{\rm therm} = 0.45$ and a ratio of turbulent to gravitational energy$\alpha_{\rm turb} = 0.05 $. even this low level of turbulence is sufficient toproduce multiple star formation in 80% of the cores; the mean number of starsand brown dwarfs formed from a single core is 4.55, and the maximum is 10. atthe outset, the cores have no large-scale rotation. the only difference betweeneach individual simulation is the detailed structure of the turbulent velocityfield. the multiple systems formed in the simulations have propertiesconsistent with observed multiple systems. dynamical evolution tendspreferentially to eject lower mass stars and brown dwarves whilst hardening theremaining binaries so that the median semi-major axis of binaries formed is$\sim 30$ au. ejected objects are usually single low-mass stars and browndwarfs, yielding a strong correlation between mass and multiplicity. oursimulations suggest a natural mechanism for forming binary stars that does notrequire large-scale rotation, capture, or large amounts of turbulence.

astro-ph;0404443	radiative transfer models of non-spherical prestellar cores	we present 2d monte carlo radiative transfer simulations of prestellar cores.we consider two types of asymmetry: disk-like asymmetry, in which the core isdenser towards the equatorial plane than towards the poles; and axialasymmetry, in which the core is denser towards the south pole than the northpole. we limit our treatment to cores with mild asymmetries, which are exposeddirectly to the interstellar radiation field or are embedded inside molecularclouds.  the isophotal maps of a core depend strongly on the viewing angle. maps atwavelengths longer than the peak of the sed (e.g. 850 micron) essentially tracethe column-density. thus, for instance, cores with disk-like asymmetry appearelongated when mapped at 850 micron from close to the equatorial plane.however, at wavelengths near the peak of the sed (e.g. 200 micron), theemissivity is more strongly dependent on the temperature, and therefore, atparticular viewing angles, there are characteristic features which reflect amore complicated convolution of the density and temperature fields within thecore.  these characteristic features are on scales 1/5 to 1/3 of the overall coresize, and so high resolution observations are needed to observe them. they arealso weaker if the core is embedded in a molecular cloud (because the range oftemperature within the core is then smaller), and so high sensitivity is neededto detect them. herschel, to be launched in 2007, will in principle provide thenecessary resolution and sensitivity at 170 to 250 micron.

astro-ph;0505190	the initial conditions of isolated star formation - vi. scuba mapping of  prestellar cores	observations have been carried out with scuba at the jcmt of 52 molecularcloud cores that do not contain any sign of protostellar activity. these areall therefore candidate prestellar cores, which are believed to represent thestage of star formation that precedes the formation of a protostar. 29 of the52 cores were detected at 850 microns at varying levels of signal-to-noiseratio greater than 3 sigma at peak. the detected cores were split into 'bright'cores and `intermediate' cores, depending on their peak flux density at 850microns. cores with peak 850 microns flux densities greater than 170 mjy/beamwere designated 'bright' (13 cores), while those flux densities below thisvalue were designated 'intermediate' (16 cores). this dividing line correspondsto a_v~50 under typical assumptions. the data are combined with our previouslypublished iso data, and the physical parameters of the cores, such as densityand temperature, are calculated. detailed fitting of the bright core radialprofiles shows that they are not critical bonnor-ebert spheres, in agreementwith previous findings. however, we find that intermediate cores, such as b68(which has previously been claimed to be a bonnor-ebert sphere), may in fact beconsistent with the bonnor-ebert criterion, suggesting perhaps that cores passthrough such a phase during their evolution. we make rough estimates of corelifetimes based on the statistics of detections and find that the lifetime of aprestellar core is roughly ~3x10^5 years, while that of a bright core is\~1.5x10^5 years. comparisons with some magnetic and turbulence regulatedcollapse models show that no model can match all of the data. models that aretuned to fit the total prestellar core lifetime, do not predict the relativenumbers of cores seen at each stage.

astro-ph;0603203	a scuba survey of l1689 - the dog that didn't bark	we present submillimetre data for the l1689 cloud in the rho-ophiuchimolecular cloud complex. we detect a number of starless and prestellar coresand protostellar envelopes. we also detect a number of filaments for the firsttime in the submillimetre continuum that are parallel both to each other, andto filaments observed in the neighbouring l1688 cloud. these filaments are alsoseen in the 13co observations of l1689. the filaments contain all of thestar-formation activity in the cloud. l1689 lies next to the well studied l1688cloud that contains the rho oph-a core. l1688 has a much more activestar-formation history than l1689 despite their apparent similarity in 13codata. hence we label l1689 as the dog that didn't bark. we endeavour to explainthis apparent anomaly by comparing the total mass of each cloud that iscurrently in the form of dense material such as prestellar cores. we notefirstly that l1688 is more massive than l1689, but we also find that whennormalised to the total mass of each cloud, the l1689 cloud has a much lowerpercentage of mass in dense cores than l1688. we attribute this to thehypothesis of loren (1989) that the star formation in the rho-ophiuchi complexis being affected and probably dominated by the external influence of thenearby upper scorpius ob association and predominantly by sigma-sco. l1689 isfurther from sigma-sco and is therefore less active. the influence of sigma-scoappears nonetheless to have created the filaments that we observe in l1689.accepted by mnras.

astro-ph;0603474	an observational perspective of low mass dense cores ii: evolution  towards the initial mass function	we review the properties of low mass dense molecular cloud cores, includingstarless, prestellar, and class 0 protostellar cores, as derived fromobservations. in particular we discuss them in the context of the currentdebate surrounding the formation and evolution of cores. there exist severalfamilies of model scenarios to explain this evolution (with many variations ofeach) that can be thought of as a continuum of models lying between two extremeparadigms for the star and core formation process. at one extreme there is thedynamic, turbulent picture, while at the other extreme there is a slow,quasi-static vision of core evolution. in the latter view the magnetic fieldplays a dominant role, and it may also play some role in the former picture.polarization and zeeman measurements indicate that some, if not all, corescontain a significant magnetic field. wide-field surveys constrain thetimescales of the core formation and evolution processes, as well as thestatistical distribution of core masses. the former indicates that prestellarcores typically live for 2--5 free-fall times, while the latter seems todetermine the stellar initial mass function. in addition, multiple surveysallow one to compare core properties in different regions. from this it appearsthat aspects of different models may be relevant to different star-formingregions, depending on the environment. prestellar cores in cluster-formingregions are smaller in radius and have higher column densities, by up to anorder of magnitude, than isolated prestellar cores. this is probably due to thefact that in cluster-forming regions the prestellar cores are formed byfragmentation of larger, more turbulent cluster-forming cores, which in turnform as a result of strong external compression.

astro-ph;0603604	scuba observations of the horsehead nebula - what did the horse swallow?	we present observations taken with scuba on the jcmt of the horsehead nebulain orion (b33), at wavelengths of 450 and 850 \mum. we see bright emission fromthat part of the cloud associated with the photon-dominated region (pdr) at the`top' of the horse's head, which we label b33-smm1. we characterise thephysical parameters of the extended dust responsible for this emission, andfind that b33-smm1 contains a more dense core than was previously suspected. wecompare the scuba data with data from the infrared space observatory (iso) andfind that the emission at 6.75-\mum is offset towards the west, indicating thatthe mid-infrared emission is tracing the pdr while the submillimetre emissioncomes from the molecular cloud core behind the pdr. we calculate the virialbalance of this core and find that it is not gravitationally bound but is beingconfined by the external pressure from the hii region ic434, and that it willeither be destroyed by the ionising radiation, or else may undergo triggeredstar formation. furthermore we find evidence for a lozenge-shaped clump in the`throat' of the horse, which is not seen in emission at shorter wavelengths. welabel this source b33-smm2 and find that it is brighter at submillimetrewavelengths than b33-smm1. smm2 is seen in absorption in the 6.75-\mum isodata, from which we obtain an independent estimate of the column density inexcellent agreement with that calculated from the submillimetre emission. wecalculate the stability of this core against collapse and find that it is inapproximate gravitational virial equilibrium. this is consistent with it beinga pre-existing core in b33, possibly pre-stellar in nature, but that it mayalso eventually undergo collapse under the effects of the hii region.

astro-ph;0611164	a scuba survey of orion, the low-mass end of the core mass function	we have re-analysed all of the scuba archive data of the orion star-formingregions. we have put together all of the data taken at different times bydifferent groups. consequently we have constructed the deepest submillimetremaps of these regions ever made. there are four regions that have been mapped:orion a north &amp; south, and orion b north &amp; south. we find that two of theregions, orion a north and orion b north, have deeper sensitivity andcompleteness limits, and contain a larger number of sources, so we concentrateon these two. we compare the data with archive data from the spitzer spacetelescope to determine whether or not a core detected in the submillimetre ispre-stellar in nature. we extract all of the pre-stellar cores from the dataand make a histogram of the core masses. this can be compared to the stellarinitial mass function (imf). we find the high-mass core mass function follows aroughly salpeter-like slope, just like the imf, as seen in previous work. ourdeeper maps allow us to see that the core mass function (cmf) turns over at ~1.3 mo, about a factor of 4 higher than our completeness limit. this turnoverhas never previously been observed, and is only visible here due to our muchdeeper maps. it mimics the turnover seen in the stellar imf at ~ 0.1 mo. thelow-mass side of the cmf is a power-law with an exponent of 0.35 +/- 0.2, whichis consistent with the low-mass slope of the young cluster imf of 0.3 +/- 0.1.this shows that the cmf continues to mimic the shape of the imf all the waydown to the lower completeness limit of these data at ~ 0.3 mo.

astro-ph;0611290	a vla search for young protostars embedded in dense cores	four dense cores, l1582a, l1689a, b133 and b68, classified as prestellar interms of the absence of detectable nir emission, are observed at radiowavelengths to investigate whether they nurture very young protostars. nodefinite young protostars were discovered in any of the four cores observed. afew radio sources were discovered close to the observed cores, but these aremost likely extragalactic sources or ysos unrelated to the cores observed. inl1582a we discovered a weak radio source near the centre of the core with radiocharacteristics and offset from the peak of the submillimeter emission similarto that of the newly discovered protostar in the core l1014, indicating apossible protostellar nature for this source. this needs to be confirmed withnear- and/or mid-infrared observations (e.g. with spitzer). hence based on thecurrent observations we are unable to confirm unequivocally that l1582a isstarless. in l1689a a possible 4.5-sigma radio source was discovered at thecentre of the core, but needs to be confirmed with future observations. in b133a weak radio source, possibly a protostar, was discovered at the edge of thecore on a local peak of the core submm emission, but no source was detected atthe centre of the core. thus, b133 is probably starless, but may have aprotostar at its edge. in b68 no radio sources were discovered inside or at theedge of the core, and thus b68 is indeed starless. four more radio sources withspectral indices characteristic of young protostars were discovered outside thecores but within the extended clouds in which these cores reside. conclusions:we conclude that the number of cores misclassified as prestellar is probablyvery small and does not significantly alter the estimated lifetime of theprestellar phase.

astro-ph;9908230	a far-infrared survey of molecular cloud cores	we present a catalogue of molecular cloud cores drawn from high latitude,medium opacity clouds, using the all-sky iras sky survey atlas (issa) images at60 and 100~$\mu$m. the typical column densities of the cores are $ n(h_2)\sim3.8 \times 10^{21} $cm$^{-2}$ and the typical volume densities are $ n(h_2)\sim 2 \times 10^3$cm$^{-3}$. they are therefore significantly less dense thanmany other samples obtained in other ways. those cloud cores with iras pointsources are seen to be already forming stars, but this is found to be only asmall fraction of the total number of cores. the fraction of the cores in theprotostellar stage is used to estimate the prestellar timescale - the timeuntil the formation of a hydrostatically supported protostellar object. weargue, on the basis of a comparison with other samples, that a trend exists forthe prestellar lifetime of a cloud core to decrease with the mean columndensity and number density of the core. we compare this with model predictionsand show that the data are consistent with star formation regulated by theionisation fraction.
