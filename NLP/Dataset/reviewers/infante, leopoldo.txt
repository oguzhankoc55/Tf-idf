0901.1138	the acs fornax cluster survey. v. measurement and recalibration of  surface brightness fluctuations and a precise value of the fornax--virgo  relative distance	we present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster imaged withhst/acs. these are combined with measurements for virgo cluster galaxies toderive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band sbf absolute magnitude asa function of g-z. in all, we tabulate recalibrated sbf distances for 134galaxies in virgo, fornax, the virgo w' group, and ngc4697 in the virgosouthern extension. the calibration procedure yields a precise relativedistance modulus for fornax with respect to virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or adistance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. the resulting fornax distance modulus is 31.51+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 mpc, where the second set of error barsreflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed virgo distance of 16.5 mpc.the rms distance scatter for the early-type fornax galaxies is0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.this translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or "cosmic",scatter sigma_cosmic in the sbf calibration, unlike in virgo. as a result, weare able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic&lt;0.08 mag, atleast for galaxies with g-z&gt;1.02. we also present an alternative sbfcalibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter nbar, a proxy for galaxymass, which gives a consistent relative distance. finally, we find no evidencefor systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,no current infall); the fornax cluster appears both compact and wellvirialized.[abridged]

0912.0201	lsst science book, version 2.0	a survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faintmagnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting scienceopportunities of the next decade. the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst)will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with fieldof view of 9.6 deg^2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over20,000 deg^2 south of +15 deg. each pointing will be imaged 2000 times withfifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to atotal point-source depth of r~27.5. the lsst science book describes the basicparameters of the lsst hardware, software, and observing plans. the bookdiscusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe abroad range of science that lsst will revolutionize: mapping the inner andouter solar system, stellar populations in the milky way and nearby galaxies,the structure of the milky way disk and halo and other objects in the localvolume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and theproperties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. it thenturns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae toz~1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies andbaryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined toconstrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.

0707.3869	a flat faint end of the fornax cluster galaxy luminosity function	we analyse the photometric properties of the early-type fornax cluster dwarfgalaxy population (m_v&gt;-17 mag), based on a wide field imaging study of thecentral cluster area in v and i band-passes with imacs/magellan at las campanasobservatory. we create a fiducial sample of ~100 fornax cluster dwarfellipticals (des) with -16.6&lt;m_v&lt;-8.8 mag in the following three steps: (1) toverify cluster membership, we measured i-band surface brightness fluctuations(sbf) distances to candidate des known from previous surveys; (2) were-assessed morphological classifications for those candidate des that are toofaint for sbf detection; and (3) we searched for new candidate des in thesize-luminosity regime close to the resolution limit of previous surveys. theresulting fiducial de sample follows a well-defined surface brightness -magnitude relation, showing that fornax des are about 40% larger than localgroup des. the sample also defines a colour-magnitude relation similar to thatof local group des. the early-type dwarf galaxy luminosity function in fornaxhas a very flat faint end slope alpha = -1.1 +/- 0.1. we compare the number ofdwarfs per unit mass with those in other environments and find that the fornaxcluster fits well into a general trend of a lack of high-mass dwarfs in moremassive environments.

1002.2226	southern cosmology survey ii: massive optically-selected clusters from  70 square degrees of the sze common survey area	we present a catalog of 105 rich and massive ($m&gt;3\times10^{14}m_{\sun}$)optically-selected clusters of galaxies extracted from 70 square-degrees ofpublic archival griz imaging from the blanco 4-m telescope acquired over 45nights between 2005 and 2007. we use the clusters' optically-derived propertiesto estimate photometric redshifts, optical luminosities, richness, and masses.we complement the optical measurements with archival xmm-newton and rosat x-raydata which provide additional luminosity and mass constraints on a modestfraction of the cluster sample. two of our clusters show clear evidence forcentral lensing arcs; one of these has a spectacular large-diameter,nearly-complete einstein ring surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy. astrong motivation for this study is to identify the massive clusters that areexpected to display prominent signals from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect (sze)and therefore be detected in the wide-area mm-band surveys being conducted byboth the atacama cosmology telescope and the south pole telescope. the opticalsample presented here will be useful for verifying new sze cluster candidatesfrom these surveys, for testing the cluster selection function, and forstacking analyzes of the sze data.

1004.2883	the acs fornax cluster survey. viii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in virgo and fornax early-type galaxies and its use as a distance  indicator	we use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globularcluster luminosity function (gclf). the globular cluster system of each galaxywas studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic gclfafter accounting for contamination and completeness effects. the resultspresented here update our virgo measurements and confirm our previous resultsshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the gclf and the absolutemagnitude of the parent galaxy. regarding the use of the gclf as a standardcandle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the virgo andfornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distanceestimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived fromsurface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. fromnumerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the valueof the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsicdispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for virgo and fornaxrespectively. all in all, our study shows that the gclf properties varysystematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy betweengiant and dwarf early-type galaxies. these properties may be influenced by thecluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.

1006.5126	the atacama cosmology telescope: physical properties and purity of a  galaxy cluster sample selected via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present optical and x-ray properties for the first confirmed galaxycluster sample selected by the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 148 ghz maps over455 square degrees of sky made with the atacama cosmology telescope. thesemaps, coupled with multi-band imaging on 4-meter-class optical telescopes, haveyielded a sample of 23 galaxy clusters with redshifts between 0.118 and 1.066.of these 23 clusters, 10 are newly discovered. the selection of this sample isapproximately mass limited and essentially independent of redshift. we provideoptical positions, images, redshifts and x-ray fluxes and luminosities for thefull sample, and x-ray temperatures of an important subset. the mass limit ofthe full sample is around 8e14 msun, with a number distribution that peaksaround a redshift of 0.4. for the 10 highest significance sze-selected clustercandidates, all of which are optically confirmed, the mass threshold is 1e15msun and the redshift range is 0.167 to 1.066. archival observations fromchandra, xmm-newton, and rosat provide x-ray luminosities and temperatures thatare broadly consistent with this mass threshold. our optical follow-upprocedure also allowed us to assess the purity of the act cluster sample.eighty (one hundred) percent of the 148 ghz candidates with signal-to-noiseratios greater than 5.1 (5.7) are confirmed as massive clusters. the reportedsample represents one of the largest sze-selected sample of massive clustersover all redshifts within a cosmologically-significant survey volume, whichwill enable cosmological studies as well as future studies on the evolution,morphology, and stellar populations in the most massive clusters in theuniverse.

1006.5645	clustering and descendants of musyc galaxies at z&lt;1.5	we measure the evolution of galaxy clustering out to a redshift of z~1.5using data from two musyc fields, the extended hubble deep field south (ehdf-s)and the extended chandra deep field south (ecdf-s). we use photometric redshiftinformation to calculate the projected-angular correlation function,omega(sigma), from which we infer the projected correlation function xi(sigma).we demonstrate that this technique delivers accurate measurements of clusteringeven when large redshift measurement errors affect the data. to this aim we usetwo mock musyc fields extracted from a lambdacdm simulation populated withgalform semi-analytic galaxies which allow us to assess the degree of accuracyof our estimates of xi(sigma) and to identify and correct for systematiceffects in our measurements. we study the evolution of clustering for volumelimited subsamples of galaxies selected using their photometric redshifts andrest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes. we find that the real-space correlationlength r_0 of bright galaxies, m_r&lt;-21 (rest-frame) can be accurately recoveredout to z~1.5, particularly for ecdf-s given its near-infrared photometriccoverage. there is mild evidence for a luminosity dependent clustering in bothfields at the low redshift samples (up to &lt;z&gt;=0.57), where the correlationlength is higher for brighter galaxies by up to 1mpc/h between medianrest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes of -18 to -21.5. as a result of thephotometric redshift measurement, each galaxy is assigned a best-fit template;we restrict to e and e+20%sbc types to construct subsamples of early typegalaxies (etgs). our etg samples show a strong increase in r_0 as the redshiftincreases, making it unlikely (95% level) that etgs at median redshiftz_med=1.15 are the direct progenitors of etgs at z_med=0.37 with equivalentpassively evolved luminosities.

1010.1025	the atacama cosmology telescope: cosmology from galaxy clusters detected  via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample ofsunyaev-zel'dovich-selected galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wavesurvey by the atacama cosmology telescope. the cluster sample used in thisanalysis consists of 9 optically-confirmed high-mass clusters comprising thehigh-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 squaredegrees of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 ghz. we focus on the most massivesystems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics andcosmology derived from sz surveys. we describe the scaling relation betweencluster mass and sz signal with a 4-parameter fit. marginalizing over thevalues of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives sigma_8 =0.851 +/- 0.115 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.35 for a spatially-flat wcdm cosmologicalmodel with wmap 7-year priors on cosmological parameters. this gives a modestimprovement in statistical uncertainty over wmap 7-year constraints alone.fixing the scaling relation between cluster mass and sz signal to a fiducialrelation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by x-rayobservations, we find sigma_8 = 0.821 +/- 0.044 and w = -1.05 +/- 0.20. theseresults are consistent with constraints from wmap 7 plus baryon acousticoscillations plus type ia supernoava which give sigma_8 = 0.802 +/- 0.038 and w= -0.98 +/- 0.053. a stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample comparedto clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement.these results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both theastrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived fromthem are broadly consistent with current models.

1011.1852	dynamical versus stellar masses of ultracompact dwarf galaxies in the  fornax cluster	the origin of ultracompact dwarf (ucd) galaxies, compact extragalacticstellar systems, is still a puzzle for present galaxy formation models. wepresent the comprehensive analysis of high resolution multi-objectspectroscopic data for a sample of 24 fornax cluster ucds obtained with vltflames. it comprises previously published data for 19 objects (mieske et al.2008) which we re-analysed, including 13 with available hst photometric data.using virtual observatory technologies we found archival hst images for twomore ucds and then determined their structural properties. for all objects wederived internal velocity dispersions, stellar population parameters, andstellar mass-to-light ratios (m/l)* by fitting individual simple stellarpopulation (ssp) synthetic spectra convolved with a gaussian against theobserved spectra using the nbursts full spectral fitting technique. for 14objects we estimated dynamical masses suggesting no dark matter (dm) in 12 ofthem and no more than 40 per cent dm mass fraction in the remaining two, incontrast to findings for several ucds in the virgo cluster. some fornax ucdseven have too high values of (m/l)* estimated using the kroupa stellar initialmass function (imf) resulting in negative formally computed dm mass fractions.the objects with too high (m/l)* ratios compared to the dynamical ones haverelatively short dynamical relaxation timescales, close to the hubble time orbelow. we therefore suggest that their lower dynamical ratios (m/l)dyn arecaused by low-mass star depletion due to dynamical evolution. overall, theobserved ucd characteristics suggest at least two formation channels: tidalthreshing of nucleated dwarf galaxies for massive ucds (~10^8 m_sun), and aclassical scenario of red globular cluster formation for lower-mass ucds (&lt;10^7 m_sun).

1012.0306	the acs fornax cluster survey. iv. deprojection of the surface  brightness profiles of early-type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters:  investigating the "core/power-law dichotomy"	although early observations with the hubble space telescope (hst) pointed toa sharp dichotomy among early-type galaxies in terms of the logarithmic slopegamma' of their central surface brightness profiles, several studies in thepast few years have called this finding into question. in particular, recentimaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the virgo and fornaxclusters using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on board hst have notfound a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from centralluminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of thebest-fitting global sersic model. given that earlier studies also found thatthe dichotomy persisted when analyzing the deprojected density profile slopes,we investigate the distribution of the three-dimensional luminosity densityprofiles of the acs virgo and fornax cluster survey galaxies. having fitted thesurface brightness profiles with modified sersic models, we then deproject thegalaxies using an abel integral and measure the inner slopes gamma_3d of theresulting luminosity density profiles at various fractions of the effectiveradius r_e. we find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuousvariation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.we introduce a parameter, delta_3d, that measures the central deviation of thedeprojected luminosity profiles from the global sersic fit, showing that thisparameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.

1101.5163	pop. iii stars from turbulent fragmentation at redshift ~ 11	we report results from a cosmological simulation with non-equilibriumchemistry of 21 species, including h2, hd, and lih molecular cooling. startingfrom cosmological initial conditions, we focus on the evolution of the central1.8 kpc region of a 3 x 10^7 msun halo. the crossing of a few 10^6 msun halosand the gas accretion through larger scale filaments generate a turbulentenvironment within this region. due to the short cooling time caused by thenon-equilibrium formation of h2, the supersonic turbulence results in a veryfragmented mass distribution, where dense, gravitationally unstable clumpsemerge from a complex network of dense filaments. at z=10.87, we findapproximately 25 well defined, gravitationally unstable clumps, with masses of4 x 10^3-9 x 10^5 msun, temperatures of approximately 300k, and cooling timesmuch shorter than the free-fall time. only the initial phase of the collapse ofindividual clumps is spatially resolved in the simulation. depending on thedensity reached in the collapse, the estimated average bonnor-ebert masses arein the range 200-800 msun. we speculate that each clump may further fragmentinto a cluster of stars with a characteristic mass in the neighborhood of 50msun. this process at z ~ 11 may represent the dominant mode of pop. iii starformation, causing a rapid chemical enrichment of the protogalacticenvironment.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

0711.1358	the acs fornax cluster survey. ii. the central brightness profiles of  early-type galaxies: a characteristic radius on nuclear scales and the  transition from central luminosity deficit to excess	we analyse hst surface brightness profiles for 143 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters. sersic models provide accurate descriptions of theglobal profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviatesystematically inside a characteristic "break" radius of r_b ~ 0.02r_e wherer_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. the sense of the deviation is suchthat bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -20) typically show central light deficits withrespect to the inward extrapolation of the sersic model, while the greatmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 &lt; m_b &lt; -15) showcentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediateluminosities (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.5) are usually well fitted by sersic models overall radii. the slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measuredat fixed fractions of r_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity ina manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. we showthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of thegalaxy selection function used in that study. to provide a more robustcharacterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameterthat describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inwardextrapolation of the outer sersic model. we find that this parameter variessmoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the virgo andfornax sample galaxies, with no evidence for a dichotomy. we argue that thecentral light excesses (nuclei) in m_b &gt; -19 galaxies may be the analogs of thedense central cores that are predicted by some numerical simulations to formvia gas inflows.

1208.0050	the atacama cosmology telescope: data characterization and map making	we present a description of the data reduction and mapmaking pipeline usedfor the 2008 observing season of the atacama cosmology telescope (act). thedata presented here at 148 ghz represent 12% of the 90 tb collected by act from2007 to 2010. in 2008 we observed for 136 days, producing a total of 1423 hoursof data (11 tb for the 148 ghz band only), with a daily average of 10.5 hoursof observation. from these, 1085 hours were devoted to a 850 deg^2 stripe (11.2hours by 9.1 deg) centered on a declination of -52.7 deg, while 175 hours weredevoted to a 280 deg^2 stripe (4.5 hours by 4.8 deg) centered at the celestialequator. we discuss sources of statistical and systematic noise, calibration,telescope pointing, and data selection. out of 1260 survey hours and 1024detectors per array, 816 hours and 593 effective detectors remain after dataselection for this frequency band, yielding a 38% survey efficiency. the totalsensitivity in 2008, determined from the noise level between 5 hz and 20 hz inthe time-ordered data stream (tod), is 32 micro-kelvin sqrt{s} in cmb units.atmospheric brightness fluctuations constitute the main contaminant in the dataand dominate the detector noise covariance at low frequencies in the tod. themaps were made by solving the least-squares problem using the preconditionedconjugate gradient method, incorporating the details of the detector and noisecorrelations. cross-correlation with wmap sky maps, as well as analysis fromsimulations, reveal that our maps are unbiased at multipoles ell &gt; 300. thispaper accompanies the public release of the 148 ghz southern stripe maps from2008. the techniques described here will be applied to future maps and datareleases.

1209.4643	subaru weak-lensing measurement of a z = 0.81 cluster discovered by the  atacama cosmology telescope survey	we present a subaru weak lensing measurement of act-cl j0022.2-0036, one ofthe most luminous, high-redshift (z=0.81) sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) clustersdiscovered in the 268 deg^2 equatorial region survey of the atacama cosmologytelescope. for the weak lensing analysis using i'-band images, we use amodel-fitting (gauss-laguerre shapelet) method to measure shapes of galaxyimages, where we fit galaxy images in different exposures simultaneously toobtain best-fit ellipticities taking into account the different psfs in eachexposure. we also take into account the astrometric distortion effect on galaxyimages by performing the model fitting in the world coordinate system. toselect background galaxies behind the cluster at z=0.81, we use photometricredshift (photo-z) estimates for every galaxy derived from the co-added imagesof multi-passband br'i'z'y, with psf matching/homogenization. after a photo-zcut for background galaxy selection, we detect the tangential weak lensingdistortion signal with a total signal-to-noise ratio of about 3.7. by fitting anavarro-frenk-white model to the measured shear profile, we find the clustermass to be m_200\bar{\rho}_m = [7.5^+3.2_-2.8(stat.)^+1.3_-0.6(sys.)] x 10^14m_\odot/h. the weak lensing-derived mass is consistent with previous massestimates based on the sz observation, with assumptions of hydrostaticequilibrium and virial theorem, as well as with scaling relations between szsignal and mass derived from weak lensing, x-ray, and velocity dispersion,within the measurement errors. we also show that the existence of act-clj0022.2-0036 at z=0.81 is consistent with the cluster abundance prediction ofthe \lambda-dominated cold dark matter structure formation model. we thusdemonstrate the capability of subaru-type ground-based images for studying weaklensing of high-redshift clusters.

1301.0780	the atacama cosmology telescope: the stellar content of galaxy clusters  selected using the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present a first measurement of the stellar mass component of galaxyclusters selected via the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect, using 3.6 um and 4.5um photometry from the spitzer space telescope. our sample consists of 14clusters detected by the atacama cosmology telescope (act), which span theredshift range 0.27 &lt; z &lt; 1.07 (median z = 0.50), and have dynamical massmeasurements, accurate to about 30 per cent, with median m500 = 6.9 x 10^{14}msun. we measure the 3.6 um and 4.5 um galaxy luminosity functions, finding thecharacteristic magnitude (m*) and faint-end slope (alpha) to be similar tothose for ir-selected cluster samples. we perform the first measurements of thescaling of sz-observables (y500 and y0) with both brightest cluster galaxy(bcg) stellar mass and total cluster stellar mass (m500star). we find asignificant correlation between bcg stellar mass and y500 (e(z)^{-2/3} da^2y500 ~ m*^{1.2 +/- 0.6}), although we are not able to obtain a strongconstraint on the slope of the relation due to the small sample size.additionally, we obtain e(z)^{-2/3} da^2 y500 ~ m500star^{1.0 +/- 0.6} for thescaling with total stellar mass. the mass fraction in stars spans the range0.006-0.034, with the second ranked cluster in terms of dynamical mass (act-clj0237-4939) having an unusually low total stellar mass and the lowest stellarmass fraction. for the five clusters with gas mass measurements available inthe literature, we see no evidence for a shortfall of baryons relative to thecosmic mean value.

1301.0816	the atacama cosmology telescope: sunyaev-zel'dovich selected galaxy  clusters at 148 ghz from three seasons of data	[abridged] we present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are newdiscoveries, detected via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sz) at 148 ghz in theatacama cosmology telescope (act) survey of 504 square degrees on the celestialequator. a subsample of 48 clusters within the 270 square degree regionoverlapping sdss stripe 82 is estimated to be 90% complete for m_500c &gt; 4.5e14msun and 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.8. while matched filters are used to detect the clusters,the sample is studied further through a "profile based amplitude analysis"using a single filter at a fixed \theta_500 = 5.9' angular scale. this newapproach takes advantage of the "universal pressure profile" (upp) to fix therelationship between the cluster characteristic size (r_500) and the integratedcompton parameter (y_500). the upp scalings are found to be nearly identical toan adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure bettermatches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the south pole telescope. ahigh signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 act clusters is used to obtaincosmological constraints. we first confirm that constraints from sz data arelimited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than samplesize or measurement uncertainty. we next add in seven clusters from the actsouthern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements based on galaxyvelocity dispersions. in combination with wmap7 these data simultaneouslyconstrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding \sigma_8 =0.829 \pm 0.024 and \omega_m = 0.292 \pm 0.025. the results includemarginalization over a 15% bias in dynamical mass relative to the true halomass. in an extension to lcdm that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density,we combine our data with wmap7+bao+hubble constant measurements to constrain\sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.29 ev (95% c. l.).

1303.1210	the complex nature of the nuclear star cluster in fcc 277	recent observations have shown that compact nuclear star clusters (nscs) arepresent in up to 80% of galaxies. however, detailed studies of their dynamicaland chemical properties are confined mainly to spiral galaxy hosts, where theyare more easily observed. in this paper we present our study of the nsc in fcc277, a nucleated elliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster. we use a combinationof adaptive optics assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopy, hubblespace telescope imaging, and literature long slit data. we show that while thensc does not appear to rotate within our detection limit of ~6 km/s, rotationis detected at larger radii, where the isophotes appear to be disky, suggestingthe presence of a nuclear disk. we also observe a distinct central velocitydispersion drop that is indicative of a dynamically cold rotating sub-system.following the results of orbit-based dynamical modelling, co-rotating as wellas counter-rotating stellar orbits are simultaneously needed to reproduce theobserved kinematics. we find evidence for varying stellar populations, with thensc and nuclear disk hosting younger and more metal rich stars than the mainbody of the galaxy. we argue that gas dissipation and some level of merginghave likely played an important role in the formation of the nucleus of thisintermediate-mass galaxy. this is in contrast to nscs in low-mass early- typegalaxies, which may have been formed primarily through the infall of starclusters.

1304.0455	a highly elongated prominent lens at z=0.87: first strong lensing  analysis of el gordo	we present the first strong-lensing (sl) analysis of the galaxy clusteract-cl j0102-4915 (\emph{el gordo}), in recent \emph{hst}/acs images, revealinga prominent strong lens at a redshift of $z=0.87$. this finding adds to thealready-established unique properties of \emph{el gordo}: it is the mostmassive, hot, x-ray luminous, and bright sunyaev-zeldovich effect cluster at$z\gtrsim0.6$, and the only `bullet'-like merging cluster known at theseredshifts. the lens consists of two merging massive clumps, where for a sourceredshift of $z_{s}\sim2$ each clump exhibits only a small, separate criticalarea, with a total area of $0.69\pm0.11\sq\arcmin$ over the two clumps. for ahigher source redshift, $z_{s}\sim4$, the critical curves of the two clumpsmerge together into one bigger and very elongated lens (axis ratio$\simeq5.5$), enclosing an effective area of $1.44\pm0.22\sq\arcmin$. thecritical curves continue expanding with increasing redshift so that forhigh-redshift sources ($z_{s}\gtrsim9$) they enclose an area of$\sim1.91\pm0.30\sq\arcmin$ (effective $\theta_{e}\simeq46.8\pm3.7\arcsec$) anda mass of $6.09\pm1.04\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. according to our model, the areaof high magnification ($\mu&gt;10$) for such high redshift sources is$\simeq1.2\sq\arcmin$, and the area with $\mu&gt;5$ is $\simeq2.3\sq\arcmin$,making \emph{el gordo} a compelling target for studying the high-redshiftuniverse. we obtain a strong lower limit on the total mass of \emph{el gordo},$\gtrsim1.7\times10^{15}m_{\odot}$ from the sl regime alone, suggesting a totalmass of, roughly, $m_{200}\sim2.3\times10^{15}m_{\odot}$. our results should berevisited when additional spectroscopic and \emph{hst} imaging data areavailable.

1304.1223	clash: complete lensing analysis of the largest cosmic lens macs  j0717.5+3745 and surrounding structures	the galaxy cluster macs j0717.5+3745 (z=0.55) is the largest known cosmiclens, with complex internal structures seen in deep x-ray, sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect and dynamical observations. we perform a combined weak and stronglensing analysis with wide-field bvri'z' subaru/suprime-cam observations and16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). we find consistent weakdistortion and magnification measurements of background galaxies, and combinethese signals to construct an optimally estimated radial mass profile of thecluster and its surrounding large-scale structure out to 5 mpc/h. we findconsistency between strong-lensing and weak-lensing in the region where theseindependent data overlap, &lt;500 kpc/h. the two-dimensional weak-lensing mapreveals a clear filamentary structure traced by distinct mass halos. we modelthe lensing shear field with 9 halos, including the main cluster, correspondingto mass peaks detected above 2.5\sigma_\kappa. the total mass of the cluster asdetermined by the different methods is m_{vir}=(2.8\pm0.4) \times 10^15 m_sun.although this is the most massive cluster known at z&gt;0.5, in terms of extremevalue statistics we conclude that the mass of macs j0717.5+3745 by itself isnot in serious tension with lambdacdm, representing only a ~2{\sigma} departureabove the maximum simulated halo mass at this redshift.

1306.5240	galaxy halo truncation and giant arc surface brightness reconstruction  in the cluster macsj1206.2-0847	in this work we analyze the mass distribution of macsj1206.2-0847, especiallyfocusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. the cluster appearsrelaxed in its x-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intraclusterlight which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scaleinteractions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. the clusterlenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$into a giant arc and its counterimage. the multiple image positions and thesurface brightness distribution (sfb) of the arc which is bent around severalcluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. we modelthe cluster mass distribution with a nfw profile and the galaxy halos with twoparameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assumingscalings with their observed nir--light. we match the multiple image positionsat an r.m.s. level of $0.85\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the sfb distribution ofthe arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this clustermodel. the length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrainedis about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamicaland field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weaklensing results on the other hand. the velocity dispersion and halo size of agalaxy with $m_{\rm 160w,ab}=19.2$ or $m_{\rm b,vega}=-20.7$ are $\sigma=150\rm kms^{-1}$ and $r\approx 26\pm 6 \rm kpc$, indicating that the halos of thecluster galaxies are tidally stripped. we also reconstruct the unlensed source(which is smaller by a factor of $\sim5.8$ in area), demonstrating the increaseof morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy haslikely star--forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1309.5097	weighing "el gordo" with a precision scale: hubble space telescope  weak-lensing analysis of the merging galaxy cluster act-cl j0102-4915 at  z=0.87	(abridged) we present a hst weak-lensing study of the merging galaxy cluster"el gordo" (act-cl j0102-4915) at z=0.87 discovered by the atacama cosmologytelescope collaboration as the strongest sz decrement in its ~1000 sq. degsurvey. our weak-lensing analysis confirms that act-cl j0102-4915 is indeed anextreme system consisting of two massive (~10^15 msun each) subclusters with aprojected separation of ~0.7 mpc. this binary mass structure revealed by ourlensing study is consistent with the cluster galaxy distribution and thedynamical study carried out with 89 spectroscopic members. we estimate the massof act-cl j0102-4915 by simultaneously fitting two axisymmetric nfw profilesallowing their centers to vary. our mcmc analysis shows that the masses of thenorthwestern (nw) and the southeastern (se) components are m200c=(1.38+-0.22) x10^15 msun and (0.78+-0.20) x 10^15 msun, respectively. the lensing-basedvelocity dispersions are consistent with their spectroscopic measurements. thecentroids of both components are tightly constrained (~4") and close to theoptical luminosity centers. the x-ray and mass peaks are spatially offset by~8" (~62 kpc), which is significant at the ~2 sigma confidence level andconfirms that the baryonic and dark matter in this cluster are disassociated.the dark matter peak, however, does not lead the gas peak in the directionexpected if we are viewing the cluster soon after first core passage during ahigh speed merger. under the assumption that the merger is happening in theplane of the sky, extrapolation of the two nfw halos to a radius r200a=2.4 mpcyields a combined mass of m200a=(3.13+-0.56) x 10^15 msun. this extrapolatedtotal mass is consistent with our two-component-based dynamical analysis andprevious x-ray measurements, projecting act-cl j0102-4915 to be the mostmassive cluster at z&gt;0.6 known to date.

1405.5524	the atacama cosmology telescope: cmb polarization at $200&lt;\ell&lt;9000$	we report on measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) andcelestial polarization at 146 ghz made with the atacama cosmology telescopepolarimeter (actpol) in its first three months of observing. four regions ofsky covering a total of 270 square degrees were mapped with an angularresolution of $1.3'$. the map noise levels in the four regions are between 11and 17 $\mu$k-arcmin. we present tt, te, ee, tb, eb, and bb power spectra fromthree of these regions. the observed e-mode polarization power spectrum,displaying six acoustic peaks in the range $200&lt;\ell&lt;3000$, is an excellent fitto the prediction of the best-fit cosmological models from wmap9+act and planckdata. the polarization power spectrum, which mainly reflects primordial plasmavelocity perturbations, provides an independent determination of cosmologicalparameters consistent with those based on the temperature power spectrum, whichresults mostly from primordial density perturbations. we find that withoutmasking any point sources in the ee data at $\ell&lt;9000$, the poisson tail ofthe ee power spectrum due to polarized point sources has an amplitude less than$2.4$ $\mu$k$^2$ at $\ell = 3000$ at 95\% confidence. finally, we report thatthe crab nebula, an important polarization calibration source at microwavefrequencies, has 8.7\% polarization with an angle of $150.7^\circ \pm0.6^\circ$ when smoothed with a $5'$ gaussian beam.

1405.7876	clash-x: a comparison of lensing and x-ray techniques for measuring the  mass profiles of galaxy clusters	we present profiles of temperature (tx), gas mass, and hydrostatic massestimated from new and archival x-ray observations of clash clusters. wecompare measurements derived from xmm and chandra observations with one anotherand compare both to gravitational lensing mass profiles derived with clash hstand ground-based lensing data. radial profiles of chandra and xmm electrondensity and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differencesin hydrostatic masses inferred from x-ray observations arise from differencesin tx measurements. encouragingly, cluster txs are consistent with one anotherat ~100-200 kpc radii but xmm tx systematically decline relative to chandra txat larger radii. the angular dependence of the discrepancy suggests additionalinvestigation on systematics such as the xmm point spread function correction,vignetting and off-axis responses. we present the clash-x mass-profilecomparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independentcircular-velocity profiles. ratios of chandra hse mass profiles to clashlensing profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 mpc range.however, the mean mass biases inferred from the wl and sawlens data aredifferent. e.g., the weighted-mean value at 0.5 mpc is &lt;b&gt; = 0.12 for the wlcomparison and &lt;b&gt; = -0.11 for the sawlens comparison. the ratios of xmm hsemass profiles to clash lensing profiles show a pronounced radial dependence inthe 0.3-1.0 mpc range, with a weighted mean mass bias of value rising to&lt;b&gt;~0.3 at ~1 mpc for the wl comparison and &lt;b&gt; of 0.25 for sawlens comparison.the enclosed gas mass profiles from both chandra and xmm rise to a value 1/8times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at 0.5 mpc and remainconstant outside of that radius, suggesting that [8xmgas] profiles may be anexcellent proxy for total-mass profiles at &gt;0.5 mpc in massive galaxy clusters.

1412.7909	clash: extreme emission line galaxies and their implication on selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we utilize the clash (cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble)observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies(eelgs). the selections are carried out in two central bands: f105w (y105) andf125w (j125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by thepresence of [o iii] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79,respectively. the multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalentwidths of emission lines. thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame[o iii] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. our samples includea number of eelgs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, andthe extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies.these eelgs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshiftgalaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxieswhen the s/n ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. we predictthat the fraction of eelgs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannotbe neglected.

0806.0374	the nature of ucds: internal dynamics from an expanded sample and  homogeneous database	we have obtained high-resolution spectra of 23 ultra-compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) in the fornax cluster with -10.4&gt;m_v&gt;-13.5 mag (10^6&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8), usingflames/giraffe at the vlt. this is the largest homogeneous data set of ucdinternal dynamics assembled to date. we derive dynamical m/l ratios for 15 ucdscovered by hst imaging. in the m_v-sigma plane, ucds with m_v&lt;-12 mag areconsistent with the extrapolated faber-jackson relation for luminousellipticals, while fainter ucds are closer to the extrapolated globular cluster(gc) relation. at a given metallicity, fornax ucds have on average 30-40% lowerm/l ratios than virgo ucds, suggesting possible differences in age or darkmatter content between fornax and virgo ucds. for our sample of fornax ucds wefind no significant correlation between m/l ratio and mass. we combine our datawith available m/l ratio measurements of compact stellar systems with10^4&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8, and normalise all m/l estimates to solar metallicity. we findthat ucds (m &gt; 2*10^6 m_*) have m/l ratios twice as large as gcs (m &lt; 2*10^6m_*). we show that stellar population models tend to under-predict dynamicalm/l ratios of ucds and over-predict those of gcs. considering the scalingrelations of stellar spheroids, ucds align well along the 'fundamentalmanifold', constituting the small-scale end of the galaxy sequence. thealignment for ucds is especially clear for r_e &gt;~ 7 pc, which corresponds todynamical relaxation times that exceed a hubble time. in contrast, gcs exhibita broader scatter and do not appear to align along the manifold. we argue thatucds are the smallest dynamically un-relaxed stellar systems, with m &gt; 2*10^6m_* and 7&lt;r_e&lt;100 pc. future studies should aim at explaining the elevated m/lratios of ucds and the environmental dependence of their properties.

astro-ph;0103501	the globular cluster system of ngc 1316 (fornax a)	we have studied the globular cluster system of the merger galaxy ngc 1316 infornax, using ccd bvi photometry. a clear bimodality is not detected from thebroadband colours. however, dividing the sample into red (presumably metal-rich) and blue (metal-poor) subpopulations at b-i=1.75, we find that theyfollow strikingly different angular distributions. the red clusters show astrong correlation with the galaxy elongation, but the blue ones are circularlydistributed. no systematic difference is seen in their radial profile and bothare equally concentrated.  we derive an astonishingly low specific frequency for ngc 1316 of onlysn=0.9, which confirms with a larger field a previous finding by grillmair etal. (1999). assuming a "normal" sn of ~4 for early-type galaxies, we usestellar population synthesis models to estimate in 2 gyr the age of thisgalaxy, if an intermediate-age population were to explain the low sn weobserve. this value agrees with the luminosity-weighted mean age of ngc 1316derived by kuntschner &amp; davies (1998) and mackie &amp; fabbiano (1998).  by fitting t5 functions to the globular cluster luminosity function (gclf),we derived the following turnover magnitudes: b=24.69 +/- 0.15, v=23.87 +/-0.20 and i=22.72 +/- 0.14. they confirm that ngc 1316, in spite of its outlyinglocation, is at the same distance as the core of the fornax cluster.

(1996). thenear-ir data unveils many features of lsbgs not seen before in the optical.first, a high fraction of the observed lsbgs are very luminous in the near-ir,indicating that they have a well developed old stellar population, and thatolder lsbgs are more frequent in the universe than data from optical bandssuggested. second, the near-ir morphologies are often quite different than seenin the optical. third, we find significant trends between the near-irmorphologies of the galaxies and their ratio of hi mass to near-ir luminosity.fourth, we find no trend in disk surface brightness with absolute magnitude,but significant correlations when the bulge surface brightness is used.finally, we find that the formation of a bulge requires a galaxy to have atotal baryonic mass above ~ 10**10 msun. a wide variety of other correlationsare explored for the sample. the strongest of our correlations are with theratio of hi mass to total baryonic mass, mhi/mbaryonic, which tracks theevolutionary state of the galaxies as they convert gas into stars, and whichranges from 0.05 up to nearly 1 for the galaxies in our sample. we see alsotrends between mhi/mbaryonic and central surface density, suggesting thatincreased star formation efficiency with increasing gas surface densitystrongly drives the conversion of gas into stars.

astro-ph;0505248	discovery of a galaxy cluster in the foreground of the wide-separation  quasar pair um425	we report the discovery of a cluster of galaxies in the field of um425, apair of quasars separated by 6.5arcsec. based on this finding, we revisit thelong-standing question of whether this quasar pair is a binary quasar or awide-separation lens. previous work has shown that both quasars are at z=1.465and show broad absorption lines. no evidence for a lensing galaxy has beenfound between the quasars, but there were two hints of a foreground cluster:diffuse x-ray emission observed with chandra, and an excess of faint galaxiesobserved with the hubble space telescope. here we show, via vlt spectroscopy,that there is a spike in the redshift histogram of galaxies at z=0.77. weestimate the chance of finding a random velocity structure of such significanceto be about 5%, and thereby interpret the diffuse x-ray emission as originatingfrom z=0.77, rather than the quasar redshift. the mass of the cluster, asestimated from either the velocity dispersion of the z=0.77 galaxies or thex-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, would be consistent with thetheoretical mass required for gravitational lensing. the positional offsetbetween the x-ray centroid and the expected location of the mass centroid isabout 40kpc, which is not too different from offsets observed in lower redshiftclusters. however, um425 would be an unusual gravitational lens, by virtue ofthe absence of a bright primary lensing galaxy. unless the mass-to-light ratioof the galaxy is at least 80 times larger than usual, the lensing hypothesisrequires that the galaxy group or cluster plays a uniquely important role inproducing the observed deflections.  based on observations performed with the very large telescope at the europeansouthern observatory, paranal, chile.

astro-ph;0509759	the morphological demographics of galaxies in the acs hubble ultra deep  parallel fields	we present a morphological analysis of distant field galaxies using the deepacs images from the public parallel nicmos observations of the hubble ultradeep field obtained in the f435w (b), f606w (v), f775w (i) and f850lp (z)filters. we morphologically segregate galaxies using a combination of visualclassification and objective machine based selection. we use the asymmetry (a)and central concentration (c) parameters to characterize galaxies up toz_ab&lt;25mag. we take advantage of the multicolor dataset and estimate redshiftsfor our sample using the bayesian photometric redshift (bpz) which enables usto investigate the evolution of their morphological demographics with redshift.using a template fitting model and a maximum likelihood approach, we computethe star-formation rate (sfr) for galaxies up to z~1.3 and its contributionsfrom different morphological types. we report that spirals are the mainproviders to the total sfr. the e/s0s contribution flattens out at z~1 whilethe irr/pec populations continuously rise to match the spirals contribution atz~1.0. we use the i-z and v-i color-magnitude diagrams to constrain thegalaxies' formation histories and find that e/s0s show both a population ofluminous red galaxies in place at z~1.2 and a bluer and fainter populationresembling those of irr/pec at similar redshifts.

astro-ph;0601394	bulge evolution in face-on spirals and low surface brightness galaxies	it is an observational fact that bulges of spiral galaxies contain a highfraction of old and metal-rich stars. following this observational fact, wehave investigated colors of 21 bulges hosted by a selected sample of highsurface brightness spirals and low surface brightness galaxies observed in band r optical bands and in j and ks near-ir bands. using structural parametersderived from these observations we obtain evidence that bulges could be formedby pure disk evolution (secular evolution), in agreement with the suggestion bysome authors. the color profiles, especially the near-ir ones show null oralmost null color gradients, supporting the hypothesis that the disk stellarpopulations are similar to those present in the bulge, and/or some bulges canbe understood as disks with enhanced stellar density (or pseudobulges). in theoptical, half of the galaxies present an inverse color gradient, givingadditional evidence in favor of secular evolution for the sample investigated.the comparison of the observed colors with those obtained fromspectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution suggests that bulges of theselected sample have solar and subsolar metallicity, and are independent of thecurrent stellar formation rate. also, we obtain evidence suggesting thatgalaxies hosting small bulges tend to be systematically metal poor compared tothose with larger bulges. these results are being checked more carefully withhigh s/n spectroscopy.

astro-ph;0602263	the old globular cluster system of the dirr galaxy ngc1427a in the  fornax cluster	we present a study of the old globular cluster (gc) population of the dwarfirregular galaxy ngc 1427a using multi-wavelength vlt observations in u, b, v,i, h_alpha, j, h, and ks bands under excellent observing conditions. we appliedcolor and size selection criteria to select old gc candidates and made use ofarchival acs images taken with the hubble space telescope to rejectcontaminating background sources and blended objects from the gc candidates'list. the h_alpha observations were used to check for contamination due tocompact, highly reddened young star clusters whose colors and sizes could mimicthose of old gcs. after accounting for contamination we obtain a total numberof 38+/-8 gc candidates with colors consistent with an old (~10 gyr) andmetal-poor (z &lt; 0.4xz_solar) population as judged by simple stellar populationmodels. our contamination analysis indicates that the density distribution ofgcs in the outskirts of the fornax central cd galaxy ngc1399 may not bespherically symmetric. we derive a present-day specific frequency s_n of1.6+/-0.23 for ngc 1427a, a value significantly larger than what is observed inthe local group dwarf irregular galaxies and comparable with the values foundfor the same galaxy types in the virgo and fornax clusters. assuming auniversal globular cluster luminosity function turnover magnitude, we derive adistance modulus to ngc 1427a of 31.01+/-0.21 mag which places it3.2+/-2.5(statistic)+/-1.6(systematic) mpc in front of the fornax central cdgalaxy ngc 1399. the implications of this result for the relationship betweenngc 1427a and the cluster environment are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0603244	the physical nature of lyman alpha emitting galaxies at z=3.1	we selected 40 candidate lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) at z ~=3.1 withobserved frame equivalent widths &gt;150a and inferred emission line fluxes&gt;2.5x10^-17 ergs/cm^2/s from deep narrow-band and broad-band musyc images ofthe extended chandra deep field south. covering 992 sq. arcmin, this is thelargest ``blank field'' surveyed for laes at z ~3, allowing an improvedestimate of the space density of this population of 3+-1x10^-4 h_70^3/mpc^3.spectroscopic follow-up of 23 candidates yielded 18 redshifts, all at z ~=3.1.over 80% of the laes are dimmer in continuum magnitude than the typical lymanbreak galaxy spectroscopic limit of r= 25.5 (ab), with a median continuummagnitude r ~=27 and very blue continuum colors, (v-z) ~=0. over 80% of thelaes have the right uvr colors to be selected as lyman break galaxies, but only10% also have r&lt;=25.5. stacking the ubvrizjk fluxes reveals that laes havestellar masses ~=5x10^8 h_70^-2 m_sun and minimal dust extinction, a_v &lt; ~ 0.1.inferred star formation rates are ~=6 h_70^-2 m_sun/yr, yielding a cosmic starformation rate density of 2x10^-3 h_70 m_sun/yr/mpc^3. none of our laecandidates show evidence for rest-frame emission line equivalent widthsew_rest&gt;240a which might imply a non-standard imf. one candidate is detected bychandra, implying an agn fraction of 2+-2% for lae candidate samples. insummary, laes at z ~ 3 have rapid star formation, low stellar mass, little dustobscuration and no evidence for a substantial agn component.

astro-ph;0603588	cosmological constraints from the red-sequence cluster survey	[abridged] we present a first cosmological analysis of a refined clustercatalog from the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs). the input cluster sample isderived from 72.07 square degrees of imaging data [...] the catalog contains956 clusters over 0.35&lt;z&lt;0.95, limited by cluster richness and richness error.the calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked againstpublicly available sloan digital sky survey imaging [...] we analyze thecluster sample via a general self-calibration technique including scatter inthe mass-richness relation [...]. we fit simultaneously for omega_m andsigma_8, and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness tomass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the richness-mass relation.the principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (orlack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster massobservables) and available results on both from independent measures. from anunconstrained analysis, omega_m and sigma_8 are 0.31+0.11-0.10 and0.67+0.18-0.13 respectively. an analysis including gaussian priors on the slopeand zeropoint of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results:0.30+0.12-0.11 and 0.70+0.27-0.15. both analyses are in good agreement with thecurrent literature. the parameters describing the mass-richness relation in theunconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and agree with existingfollow-up data on both the rcs-1 and other cluster samples. our resultsdirectly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with muchlarger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probesof cosmology.

astro-ph;0606165	the dwarf galaxy population in nearby groups. the data	we used v and i ccd photometry to search for low-surface brightness dwarfgalaxies (lsbd) in the central (&lt;0.5 h^-1 mpc) region of the groups ngc 6868,ngc 5846, hcg 42 and the poor cluster ic 4765. using the parameters given bythe exponential profile fit, we identified 80 lsbd candidates with magnitudes17 &lt; v &lt; 22 mag and with colors v-i &lt; 1.5 mag at the limiting isophote of 25.8v mag/arcsec^2. the galaxies have mu0 &gt; 22.5 v mag/arcsec^2, h &gt; 1.5 arcsec,and diameters larger than 1.2 h^-1 kpc. twenty of the eighty galaxies areextended lsb galaxies that were detected only on smoothed images, after maskingall high surface brightness objects. the completeness in the detection is ~80%for galaxies with v&lt;=20 and 22.5&lt;mu0&lt;24.5 v mag/arcsec^2, and below 50% atfainter magnitudes and central surface brightnesses. in this last bin, thecompleteness increases to ~80% when we search for galaxies in smoothed imagesinstead. the detected lsbd galaxies are highly concentrated towards the centerof the four groups in the inner 250 h^-1 kpc. the best fit power-law slope ofthe surface density distribution is, on average, beta ~ -1.5 (r &lt; 250 h^-1kpc), in agreement with the values found for satellites dwarfs around isolatede/s0 galaxies and in x-ray groups. the lsbd galaxies in the mv-mu0 plane doesnot show a clear correlation, suggesting that the correlation noted by otherstudies could be produced by selection effects. the lsbd dwarf galaxies followa well defined color-magnitude relation, extending for more than ten magnitudes(from bright ellipticals to faint dwarfs). a similar well definedcolor-magnitude relation from giants to dwarfs is known to be valid for galaxyclusters but it is the first time that it is demonstrated in the sparseenvironments of groups.

astro-ph;0612612	the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc): deep near-infrared  imaging and the selection of distant galaxies	we present deep near-infrared jhk imaging of four 10'x10' fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the multiwavelength survey byyale-chile (musyc) with ispi on the ctio 4m telescope. the typical point sourcelimiting depths are j~22.5, h~21.5, and k~21 (5sigma; vega). the effectiveseeing in the final images is ~1.0". we combine these data with musyc ubvrizimaging to create k-selected catalogs that are unique for their uniform size,depth, filter coverage, and image quality. we investigate the rest-frameoptical colors and photometric redshifts of galaxies that are selected usingcommon color selection techniques, including distant red galaxies (drgs),star-forming and passive bzks, and the rest-frame uv-selected bm, bx, and lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs). these techniques are effective at isolating largesamples of high redshift galaxies, but none provide complete or uniform samplesacross the targeted redshift ranges. the drg and bm/bx/lbg criteria identifypopulations of red and blue galaxies, respectively, as they were designed todo. the star-forming bzks have a very wide redshift distribution, a wide rangeof colors, and may include galaxies with very low specific star formationrates. in comparison, the passive bzks are fewer in number, have a differentdistribution of k magnitudes, and have a somewhat different redshiftdistribution. by combining these color selection criteria, it appears possibleto define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit overspecific redshift ranges. however, the redshift dependence of both thecompleteness and sampled range of rest-frame colors poses an ultimate limit tothe usefulness of these techniques.

0809.2786	revisiting the effect of h2, hd and lih molecules in the cooling of  primordial gas	we use a non-equilibrium chemical network to revisit and study the effect ofh_{2}, hd and lih molecular cooling on a primordial element of gas. we solveboth the thermal and chemical equations for a gas element with an initialtemperature t\approx 1000k and a gas number density in the rangen_{tot}=1-10^{4} cm^{-3}. at low densities, n_{tot}&lt;10^{2} cm^{-3}, the gasreaches temperatures \sim 100k and the main coolant is h_{2}, but at higherdensities, n_{tot}&gt;10^{2} cm^{-3}, the hd molecule dominates the gastemperature evolution. the effect of lih is negligible in all cases. we studiedthe effect of d abundance on the gas cooling. the d abundance was set initiallyto be in the range n_{d}/n_{h}=10^{-7}-10^{-4.5}, withn_{hd}/n_{h}={d^{+}}/n_{h}=10^{-10}. the simulations show that atn_{tot}&gt;10^{2} cm^{-3} the hd cooling dominates the temperature evolution for dabundances greater than 10^{-5}n_{h}. this number decrease at higher densities.furthermore, we studied the effect of electrons and ionized particules on thegas temperature. we followed the gas temperature evolution withn_{h_{+}}/n_{h}=10^{-4}-10^{-1} and n_{d^{+}}/n_{h^{+}}=10^{-5}. the gastemperature reached lower values at high ionization degree because electrons,h^{+} and d^{+} are catalizers in the formation paths of the h_{2} and hdmolecules, which are the main coolers at low temperatures. finaly, we studiedthe effect of an ob star, with t_{eff}=4\times 10^{4}k, would have on gascooling. it is very difficult for a gas with n_{tot} in the range between 1-100cm^{-3} to drop its temperature if the star is at a distance less than 100 pc.
