hep-ph;9510287	supersymmetry: where it is and how to find it	we present a pedagogical, but by no means complete, review of weak scalesupersymmetry phenomenology. after a general introduction to the new particlesthat must be present in any supersymmetric framework, we describe how to writedown their interactions with one another as well as with the particles of thestandard model. we then elucidate the assumptions underlying the minimalsupersymmetric model as well as the more restrictive minimal supergravity gutmodel with the radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry. these models serveto guide our thinking about the implications of supersymmetry for experiments.to facilitate our study of signatures of supersymmetric particles at highenergy colliders, we describe the decay patterns of sparticles as well as theirproduction mechanisms in $e^+e^-$ and hadron-hadron collisions. we then discusshow sparticles may be searched for in on-going experiments at the tevatron andat lep. we review phenomenological constraints on supersymmetric particlemasses from non-observation of any signals in these experiments, and alsobriefly discuss constraints from low energy experiments and from cosmology.next, we study new strategies by which supersymmetric particles may be searchedfor at supercolliders, and also what we can learn about their properties(masses, spins, couplings) in these experiments. a determination of sparticleproperties, we will see, may provide us with clues about the nature of physicsat the ultra-high scale. after a brief discussion of possible extensions of theminimal framework and the implications for phenomenology, we conclude with ouroutlook for the future.

hep-ph;9512383	signals for minimal supergravity at the cern large hadron collider ii:  multilepton channels	we use isajet to perform a detailed study of the multilepton signals expectedfrom cascade decays of supersymmetric particle produced at the cern lhc. ouranalysis is performed within the framework of the minimal supergravity modelwith gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. wedelineate the regions of parameter space where jets plus missing energy plus 1,2 (opposite sign and same-sign dileptons), and 3 isolated lepton events shouldbe visible above standard model backgrounds. we find that if any $\eslt$ signalat the lhc is to be attributed to gluino and/or squark production, and if$m_{\tg} \alt 1$~tev, then several of these signals must be simultaneouslyobservable. furthermore, assuming $10\,\fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, wefind that the reach for supersymmetry in the 1$\ell + \jets +\eslt$ channelextends to $m_{\tg}\sim 2300\ (1600)$ gev for $m_{\tq}\sim m_{\tg}$ ($m_{\tq}\sim 1.5m_{\tg}$), and exceeds the corresponding reach in the $0\ell+\eslt$channel. we show that measurements of the various topological cross sections,jet and $b$-hadron multiplicities in these events, together with the chargeasymmetry for single lepton and same-sign dilepton events, and flavor asymmetryfor opposite sign dilepton events, serve to narrow the allowed range ofunderlying sugra parameter values. we also delineate parameter regions wheresignals with clean isolated dilepton (from slepton production) and trileptonevents (from chargino/neutralino production) are visible at the lhc, andexamine the extent to which these signals can be separated from other susysources.

hep-ph;9809223	probing minimal supergravity at the cern lhc for large $\tan\beta$	for large values of the minimal supergravity model parameter $\tan\beta$, thetau lepton and the bottom quark yukawa couplings become large, leading toreduced masses of $\tau$-sleptons and $b$-squarks relative to their first andsecond generation counterparts, and to enhanced decays of charginos andneutralinos to $\tau$-leptons and $b$-quarks. we evaluate the reach of the cernlhc $pp$ collider for supersymmetry in the msugra model parameter space. wefind that values of $m_{\tg}\sim 1500-2000$ gev can be probed with just 10fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity for $\tan\beta$ values as high as 45, sothat msugra cannot escape the scrutiny of lhc experiments by virtue of having alarge value of $\tan\beta$. we also perform a case study of an msugra model at$\tan\beta =45$ where $\tz_2\to \tau\ttau_1$ and $\tw_1\to \ttau_1\nu_\tau$with $\sim 100%$ branching fraction. in this case, at least within oursimplistic study, we show that a di-tau mass edge, which determines the valueof $m_{\tz_2}-m_{\tz_1}$, can still be reconstructed. this information can beused as a starting point for reconstructing susy cascade decays on anevent-by-event basis, and can provide a strong constraint in determining theunderlying model parameters. finally, we show that for large $\tan\beta$ therecan be an observable excess of $\tau$ leptons, and argue that $\tau$ signalsmight serve to provide new information about the underlying model framework.

hep-ph;9903370	the reach of fermilab tevatron upgrades for su(5) supergravity models  with non-universal gaugino masses	we explore the reach of luminosity upgrades of the fermilab tevatron colliderfor su(5) supergravity models in which non-universal gut-scale gaugino massesarise via a vacuum expectation value for the auxiliary component of asuperfield that transforms as a 24, 75 or 200 dimensional representation ofsu(5). this results in a different pattern of sparticle masses and mixingangles from what is expected in the minimal supergravity model (msugra) withuniversal gut scale gaugino masses. we find that the resulting signal crosssections, and hence the reach of the tevatron, are sensitive to the gauginomasses at the gut scale. in the 24 model, the large splitting amongst the twolightest neutralinos leads to susy events containing many isolated leptons,including events with a real leptonic z boson plus jets plus missing energysignal which is visible over much of parameter space. in contrast, in the 75and 200 models, the reach via leptonic susy signals is greatly reduced relativeto msugra, and the signal is usually visible only via the canonical $\eslt+$jets channel.

1210.3019	post-lhc7 fine-tuning in the msugra/cmssm model with a 125 gev higgs  boson	the recent discovery of a 125 gev higgs-like resonance at lhc, coupled withthe lack of evidence for weak scale supersymmetry (susy), have severelyconstrained susy models such as msugra/cmssm. as lhc probes deeper into susymodel parameter space, the little hierarchy problem -- how to reconcile the zand higgs boson mass scale with the scale of susy breaking -- will becomeincreasingly exacerbated unless a sparticle signal is found. we evaluate twodifferent measures of fine-tuning in the msugra/cmssm model. the more stringentof these, \delta_{hs}, includes effects that arise from the high scale originof the msugra parameters while the second measure, \delta_{ew}, is determinedonly by weak scale parameters: hence, it is universal to any model with thesame particle spectrum and couplings. our results incorporate the latestconstraints from lhc7 sparticle searches, lhcb limits from b_s -&gt;\mu^+\mu^- andalso require a light higgs scalar with m_h ~123-127 gev. we present fine-tuningcontours in the m_0 vs. m_{1/2} plane for several sets of a_0 and tan(\beta)values. we also present results for \delta_{hs} and \delta_{ew} from a scanover the entire viable model parameter space. we find a \delta_{hs} &gt; 10^3, orat best 0.1% fine-tuning. for the less stringent electroweak fine tuning, wefind \delta_{ew} &gt; 10^2, or at best 1% fine-tuning. two benchmark points arepresented that have the lowest values of \delta_{hs} and \delta_{ew}. ourresults provide a quantitative measure for ascertaining whether or not theremaining msugra/cmssm model parameter space is excessively fine-tuned, and socould provide impetus for considering alternative susy models.

1212.2655	radiative natural supersymmetry: reconciling electroweak fine-tuning and  the higgs boson mass	models of natural supersymmetry seek to solve the little hierarchy problem bypositing a spectrum of light higgsinos &lt;~ 200-300 gev and light top squarks &lt;~600 gev along with very heavy squarks and tev-scale gluinos. such models havelow electroweak fine-tuning and satisfy the lhc constraints. however, in thecontext of the mssm, they predict too low a value of m(h), are frequently inconflict with the measured b\to s\gamma branching fraction and the relicdensity of thermally produced higgsino-like wimps falls well below dark matter(dm) measurements. we propose "radiative natural susy" (rns) which can berealized within the mssm (avoiding the addition of extra exotic matter) andwhich maintains features such as gauge coupling unification and radiativeelectroweak symmetry breaking. the rns model can be generated from susy guttype models with non-universal higgs masses (nuhm). allowing for high scalesoft susy breaking higgs mass m_{h_u}&gt; m_0 leads to automatic cancellationsduring renormalization group (rg) running, and to radiatively-induced lowfine-tuning at the electroweak scale. coupled with large mixing in the topsquark sector, rns allows for fine-tuning at the 3-10% level with tev-scale topsquarks and a 125 gev light higgs scalar h. the model allows for at least apartial solution to the susy flavor, cp and gravitino problems sincefirst/second generation scalars (and the gravitino) may exist in the 10-30 tevregime. we outline some possible signatures for rns at the lhc and at a lineare^+e^- collider. if the strong cp problem is solved by the peccei-quinnmechanism, then rns naturally accommodates mixed axion-higgsino cold darkmatter, where the light higgsino-like wimps - which in this case make up only afraction of the measured relic abundance - should be detectable at upcomingwimp detectors.

1306.3148	leaving no stone unturned in the hunt for susy naturalness: a snowmass  whitepaper	imposing electroweak scale naturalness constraints (low \delta_{ew}) on susymodels leads to mass spectra characterized by light higgsinos ~100-300 gev,highly mixed top-squarks and gluinos at the 1-5 tev scale and allows for m_h~125 gev. first and second generation squarks can easily live at the 5-20 tevscale, thus providing at least a partial solution to the susy flavor/cpproblems. for such models at the lhc, gluino pair production is followed bycascade decays to t- and b-quark rich final states along with multileptons. thereach of lhc14 with 300 fb^{-1} is computed to be around m_{\tg} 1.8 tev.however, the small magnitude of the \mu-parameter-- a necessary condition fornaturalness-- leads to a unique hadronically quite same-sign diboson (w^\pmw^\pm) signature from wino pair production. in low \delta_{ew} models withunified gaugino masses, this signature yields a somewhat higher reach up tom_{\tg} 2.1 tev. the smallness of |\mu| implies that the ilc should be ahiggsino factory in addition to a higgs factory, and a complete search for susynaturalness seems possible for \sqrt{s} 600 gev. since a thermalunder-abundance of higgsino-like wimp dark matter (dm) is expected, there isample room for an axion dm contribution. a thorough search for higgsino-likewimps can be made by next generation wimp detectors, such as those withton-scale noble liquid targets.

1306.4183	snowmass whitepaper: exploring natural susy via direct and indirect  detection of higgsino-like wimps	supersymmetric models with low electroweak fine-tuning contain lighthiggsinos with mass not too far from m_h\simeq 125 gev, while other sparticlescan be much heavier. in the r-parity conserving mssm, the lightest neutralinois then a higgsino-like wimp (albeit with non-negligible gaugino components),with thermal relic density well below measured values. this leaves room foraxions (or other, perhaps not as well motivated, stable particles) to functionas co-dark matter particles. the local wimp abundance is then expected to bebelow standard estimates, and direct and indirect detection rates must beaccordingly rescaled. we calculate rescaled direct and indirect higgsino-likewimp detection rates in susy models that fulfil the electroweak naturalnesscondition. in spite of the rescaling, we find that ton-scale noble liquiddetectors can probe the entire higgsino-like wimp parameter space, so thatthese experiments should either discover wimps or exclude the concept ofelectroweak naturalness in r-parity conserving natural susy models. prospectsfor spin-dependent or indirect detection are more limited due in part to therescaling effect.

1310.4858	radiatively-driven natural supersymmetry at the lhc	radiatively-driven natural supersymmetry (rns) potentially reconciles the zand higgs boson masses close to 100 gev with gluinos and squarks lying beyondthe tev scale. requiring no large cancellations at the electroweak scale inconstructing m_z=91.2 gev while maintaining a light higgs scalar with m_h 125gev implies a sparticle mass spectrum including light higgsinos with mass100-300 gev, electroweak gauginos in the 300-1200 gev range, gluinos at 1-4 tevand top/bottom squarks in the 1-4 tev range (probably beyond lhc reach), whilefirst/second generation matter scalars can exist in the 5-30 tev range (farbeyond lhc reach). we investigate several characteristic signals for rns atlhc14. gluino pair production yields a reach up to m_{\tg} 1.7 tev for 300fb^{-1}. wino pair production -- pp\to\tw_2\tz_4 and \tw_2\tw_2 -- leads to aunique same-sign diboson (ssdb) signature accompanied by modest jet activityfrom daughter higgsino decays; this signature provides the best reach up tom_{\tg} 2.1 tev within this framework. wino pair production also leads to finalstates with (wz\to 3\ell)+\eslt as well as 4\ell+\eslt which give confirmatorysignals up to m_{\tg} 1.4 tev. directly produced light higgsinos yield a clean,soft trilepton signature (due to very low visible energy release) which can bevisible, but only for a not-too-small a \tz_2-\tz_1 mass gap. the clean ssdbsignal -- as well as the distinctive mass shape of the dilepton massdistribution from \tz_{2,3}\to\tz_1\ell\ell decays if this is accessible --will mark the presence of light higgsinos which are necessary for natural susy.while an e^+e^- collider operating with \sqrt{s} 600 gev should unequivocallyreveal the predicted light higgsinos, the rns model with m_{1/2}&gt; 1 tev mayelude all lhc14 search strategies even while maintaining a high degree ofelectroweak naturalness.

0802.3384	collider signals and neutralino dark matter detection in  relic-density-consistent models without universality	we present brief synopses of supersymmetric models where either theneutralino composition or its mass is adjusted so that thermal relicneutralinos from the big bang saturate the measured abundance of cold darkmatter in the universe. we first review minimal supergravity (msugra), and thenexamine its various one-parameter extensions where we relax the assumeduniversality of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. our goal is tocorrelate relic-density-allowed parameter choices with expected phenomena indirect, indirect and collider dark matter search experiments. for everynon-universal model, we first provide plots to facilitate the selection of``dark-matter allowed'' parameter space points, and then present salientfeatures of each model with respect to searches at tevatron, lhc and ilc andalso direct and indirect dark matter searches. we present benchmark scenariosthat allow one to compare and contrast the non-universal models with oneanother and with the paradigm msugra framework. we show that many implicationsabout sparticle properties and collider signals drawn from the analysis of therelic density constraint within msugra do not carry over to simpleone-parameter extensions of the msugra framework. we find that in manyrelic-density-consistent models, there is one (or more) detectable edge in theinvariant mass distribution of same-flavour, opposite sign dileptons in susycascade decay events at the lhc. finally, we scan the parameter space of thesevarious models, requiring consistency with the lep2 constraint on the charginomass, and with the observed relic density, and examine prospects for direct andindirect dark matter detection. we find that in a large number of cases themechanism that causes the early universe neutralino annihilation rate to belarge (so as to produce the measured relic density) also enhances the directdetection rate, and often also the rates for indirect detection of neutralinodark matter.

0803.0001	heavy-flavour tagging and the supersymmetry reach of the cern large  hadron collider	the branching fraction for the decays of gluinos to third generation quarksis expected to be enhanced in classes of supersymmetric models where eitherthird generation squarks are lighter than other squarks, or in mixed-higgsinodark matter models constructed to be in concordance with the measured densityof cold dark matter. in such scenarios, gluino production events at the cernlarge hadron collider should be rich in top and bottom quark jets. requiringb-jets in addition to missing transverse energy should, therefore, enhance thesupersymmetry signal relative to standard model backgrounds from v + jet, vvand qcd backgrounds (v=w, z). we quantify the increase in the supersymmetryreach of the lhc from b-tagging in a variety of well-motivated models ofsupersymmetry. we also explore ``top-tagging'' at the lhc. we find that whilethe efficiency for this turns out to be too low to give an increase in reachbeyond that obtained via b-tagging, top-tagging can indeed provide aconfirmatory signal if gluinos are not too heavy. finally, we explore theprospects for detecting the direct production of third generation squarks inmodels with an inverted squark mass hierarchy. this is signalled by b-jets +missing transverse energy events harder than in the standard model, but softerthan those from the production of gluinos and heavier squarks. we find thatwhile these events can be readily separated from sm background (for thirdgeneration squark masses ~300-500 gev), the contamination from the much heaviergluinos and squarks remains formidable if these are also accessible.

1409.7058	monojet plus soft dilepton signal from light higgsino pair production at  lhc14	naturalness arguments imply the existence of higgsinos lighter than 200-300gev. however, because these higgsinos are nearly mass degenerate, they releasevery little visible energy in their decays, and (even putting aside triggeringissues) signals from electroweak higgsino pair production typically remainburied under standard model backgrounds. prospects for detecting higgsino pairproduction via events with monojets or mono-photons from initial stateradiation are also bleak because of signal-to-background rates typically at the1% level. here, we consider the possibility of reducing backgrounds byrequiring the presence of soft daughter leptons from higgsino decays in monojetevents. we find that lhc14 experiments with an integrated luminosity of 300fb^{-1} should be sensitive to light higgsinos at the 5\sigma level for \mu &lt;170 gev with a s/b ~ 8.5%. for an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb^{-1} (whichshould be possible at a high luminosity lhc) the corresponding sensitivity to\mu extends to over 200 gev though the systematic uncertainty would have to becontrolled to considerably better than 5%. the corresponding reach frommeasurements of the rate asymmetry between monojet events with same flavour vs.opposite flavour dileptons is ~10-15 gev smaller, but does not suffer thesystematic uncertainty from the normalization of the background.

1501.06357	natural susy with a bino- or wino-like lsp	in natural susy models higgsinos are always light because \mu^2 cannot bemuch larger than m_z^2, while squarks and gluinos may be very heavy. unlessgluinos are discovered at lhc13, the commonly assumed unification of gauginomass parameters will imply correspondingly heavy winos and binos, resulting ina higgsino-like lsp and small inter-higgsino mass splittings. the small visibleenergy release in higgsino decays makes their pair production difficult todetect at the lhc. relaxing gaugino mass universality allows for relativelylight winos and binos without violating lhc gluino mass bounds and withoutaffecting naturalness. in the case where the bino mass m_1&lt;~ \mu, then oneobtains a mixed bino-higgsino lsp with instead sizable w_1-z_1 and z_2-z_1 massgaps. the thermal neutralino abundance can match the measured dark matterdensity in contrast to models with a higgsino-like lsp where wimps (weaklyinteracting massive particles) are underproduced by factors of 10-15. ifinstead m_2&lt;~ \mu, then one obtains a mixed wino-higgsino lsp with largez_2-z_1 but small w_1-z_1 mass gaps with still an under-abundance ofthermally-produced wimps. portions of the light wino parameter space mayalready be excluded by the icecube upper bound on the spin-dependentneutralino-nucleon cross section. we discuss dark matter detection in otherdirect and indirect detection experiments and caution that the bounds fromthese must be interpreted with care. finally, we show that lhc13 experimentsshould be able to probe these non-universal mass scenarios via a variety ofchannels including multi-lepton + etmiss events, wz+etmiss events, wh+etmissevents and w^\pm w^\pm +etmiss events from electroweak chargino and neutralinoproduction.

0805.1905	dark matter and the lhc	an abundance of astrophysical evidence indicates that the bulk of matter inthe universe is made up of massive, electrically neutral particles that formthe dark matter (dm). while the density of dm has been precisely measured, theidentity of the dm particle (or particles) is a complete mystery. in fact,within the laws of physics as we know them (the standard model, or sm), none ofthe particles have the right properties to make up dm. remarkably, many newphysics extensions of the sm -- designed to address theoretical issues with theelectroweak symmetry breaking sector -- require the introduction of newparticles, some of which are excellent dm candidates. as the lhc era begins,there are high hopes that dm particles, along with their associated new matterstates, will be produced in pp collisions. we discuss how lhc experiments,along with other dm searches, may serve to determine the identity of dmparticles and elucidate the associated physics. most of our discussion centersaround theories with weak-scale supersymmetry, and allows for several differentdm candidate particles.

1506.07151	supersymmetry: aspirations and prospects	the realization in the early 1980s that weak scale supersymmetry stabilizesthe higgs sector of the spectacularly successful standard model led severalauthors to explore whether low energy supersymmetry could play a role inparticle physics. among these were richard arnowitt, ali chamseddine and prannath who constructed a viable {\em locally} supersymmetric grand unified theory(gut), laying down the foundation for supergravity gut models of particlephysics. supergravity models continue to be explored as one of the mostpromising extensions of the standard model. after a quick overview of some ofthe issues and aspirations of early researchers working to bring supersymmetryinto the mainstream of particle physics, we re-examine early arguments thatseemed to imply that superpartners would be revealed in experiments at lep2 orat the tevatron. our purpose is to assess whether the absence of anysuperpartners in searches at lhc8 presents a crisis for supersymmetry. towardthis end, we re-evaluate fine-tuning arguments that lead to upper bounds on(some) superpartner masses. we conclude that phenomenologically viablesuperpartner spectra that could arise within a high scale model tuned no worsethan a few percent are perfectly possible. while no viable underlying model ofparticle physics that leads to such spectra has yet emerged, we show that the(supergravity-based) radiatively-driven natural supersymmetry (rns) frameworkserves as a surrogate for a phenomenological analysis of an underlying theorywith modest fine-tuning. we outline the phenomenological implications of thisframework, with emphasis on those lhc and electron-positron collider signaturesthat might point to the underlying natural origin of gauge and higgs bosonmasses. we conclude that the supergravity gut paradigm laid down in 1982 byarnowitt, chamseddine and nath, and others, remains a vibrant possibility.

1507.06726	same-sign higgsino production at the cern lhc: how not to hunt for  natural supersymmetry	we examine the prospects for detecting light charged higgsinos that areexpected to be a necessary feature of natural susy models via $pp\to{\widetilde w}^\pm{\widetilde w}_1^\pm jj+x$ processes arising dominantly from$w^\pm w^\pm$ fusion at lhc13. the signal will be a pair of same-sign leptons($e$ or $\mu$) in events with two relatively forward, hemispherically-separatedjets with a large rapidity gap. we find that even though the higgsinos have afull-strength $su(2)$ gauge couplings to $w$-bosons, the lhc13 cross sectionfor the production of same sign higgsino pairs is smaller than 0.02 fb overmost of the interesting range of natural susy parameters, even before leptonicbranching fractions of the chargino are included. this cross section isstrongly suppressed because the two neutral majorana higgsinos can be combinedinto a single dirac neutralino if the bino and the winos are much heavier thanthe higgsinos, as is the case in natural susy models: in this limit, higgsinocouplings to $w$-bosons exhibit an emergent (approximate) $u(1)_{\rm ino}$global symmetry that suppresses same sign higgsino production by vector bosonfusion. we conclude that this channel is not a viable way to search for naturalsusy even at the high luminosity upgrade of the large hadron collider.

hep-ph;0010068	can precision measurements of slepton masses probe right handed  neutrinos?	in a supersymmetric model, the presence of a right handed neutrino with alarge yukawa coupling $f_{\nu}$ would affect slepton masses via itscontribution to the renormalization group evolution between the grandunification and weak scales. assuming a hierarchichal pattern of neutrinomasses, these effects are large for only the third generation of sleptons. weconstruct mass combinations to isolate the effect of $f_{\nu}$ from masscorrections already expected from tau yukawa couplings. we then analyze thesize of these effects, assuming that the super-kamiokande data constrain 0.033ev $\alt m_{\nu_{\tau}} \alt 0.1$ ev and that neutrino masses arise via asee-saw mechanism. we also explore whether these effects might be detectable inexperiments at future $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. we find that $m_{\tnu_{\tau}}$needs to be measured with a precision of about 2-3% to measure the effect of$f_{\nu}$ if the neutrino and top yukawa couplings unify at the grandunification scale. in a simple case study, we find a precision of only 6-10%might be attainable after several years of operation. if the neutrino yukawacoupling is larger, or in more complicated models of neutrino masses, adetermination of $\ttau_1$ and $\tnu_{\tau}$ masses might provide a signal of ayukawa interaction of neutrinos.

hep-ph;0102156	aspects of supersymmetric models with a radiatively driven inverted mass  hierarchy	a promising way to reconcile naturalness with a decoupling solution to thesusy flavor and cp problems is suggested by models with a radiatively driveninverted mass hierarchy (rimh). the rimh models arise naturally within thecontext of susy so(10) grand unified theories. in their original form, rimhmodels suffer from two problems: 1.) obtaining the radiative breakdown ofelectroweak symmetry, and 2.) generating the correct masses for thirdgeneration fermions. the first problem can be solved by the introduction ofso(10) d-term contributions to scalar masses. we show that correct fermionmasses can indeed be obtained, but at the cost of limiting the magnitude of thehierarchy that can be generated. we go on to compute predictions for theneutralino relic density as well as for the rate for the decay $b\to s\gamma$,and show that these yield significant constraints on model parameter space. weshow that only a tiny corner of model parameter space is accessible to fermilabtevatron searches, assuming an integrated luminosity of 25~$fb^{-1}$. we alsoquantify the reach of the cern lhc collider for this class of models, and findvalues of $m_{\tg}\sim 1600$ gev to be accessible assuming just 10 fb$^{-1}$ ofintegrated luminosity. in an appendix, we list the two loop renormalizationgroup equations for the mssm plus right handed neutrino model that we have usedin our analysis.

hep-ph;0604253	collider and dark matter searches in models with mixed modulus-anomaly  mediated susy breaking	we investigate the phenomenology of supersymmetric models where moduli fieldsand the weyl anomaly make comparable contributions to susy breaking effects inthe observable sector of fields. this mixed modulus-anomaly mediatedsupersymmetry breaking (mm-amsb) scenario is inspired by models of stringcompactification with fluxes, which have been shown to yield a de sitter vacuum(as in the recent construction by kachru {\it et al}). the phenomenologydepends on the so-called modular weights which, in turn, depend on the locationof various fields in the extra dimensions. we find that the model with zeromodular weights gives mass spectra characterized by very light top squarksand/or tau sleptons, or where m_1\sim -m_2 so that the bino and wino areapproximately degenerate. the top squark mass can be in the range required bysuccessful electroweak baryogenesis. the measured relic density of cold darkmatter can be obtained via top squark co-annihilation at low \tan\beta, tauslepton co-annihilation at large \tan\beta or via bino-wino coannihilation.then, we typically find low rates for direct and indirect detection ofneutralino dark matter. however, essentially all the wmap-allowed parameterspace can be probed by experiments at the cern lhc, while significant portionsmay also be explored at an e^+e^- collider with \sqrt{s}=0.5--1 tev. we alsoinvestigate a case with non-zero modular weights. in this case,co-annihilation, a-funnel annihilation and bulk annihilation of neutralinos areall allowed. results for future colliders are qualitatively similar, butprospects for indirect dark matter searches via gamma rays and anti-particlesare somewhat better.
