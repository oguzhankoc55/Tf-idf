0706.2325	the monitor project: jw 380 -- a 0.26, 0.15 msol pre main sequence  eclipsing binary in the orion nebula cluster	we report the discovery of a low-mass (0.26 +/- 0.02, 0.15 +/- 0.01 msol)pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary with a 5.3 day orbital period. jw 380 wasdetected as part of a high-cadence time-resolved photometric survey (themonitor project) using the 2.5m isaac newton telescope and wide field camerafor a survey of a single field in the orion nebula cluster (onc) region in vand i bands. the star is assigned a 99 per cent membership probability fromproper motion measurements, and radial velocity observations indicate asystemic velocity within 1 sigma of that of the onc. modelling of the combinedlight and radial velocity curves of the system gave stellar radii of 1.19 +0.04-0.18 rsol and 0.90 +0.17 -0.03 rsol for the primary and secondary, with asignificant third light contribution which is also visible as a third peak inthe cross-correlation functions used to derive radial velocities. the massesand radii appear to be consistent with stellar models for 2-3 myr age fromseveral authors, within the present observational errors. these observationsprobe an important region of mass-radius parameter space, where there arecurrently only a handful of known pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary systemswith precise measurements available in the literature.

0903.1892	circumstellar environment and effective temperature of the young  substellar eclipsing binary 2mass j05352184-0546085	we present new spitzer irac/pu/mips photometry from 3.6 to 24 um, and newgemini gmos photometry at 0.48 um, of the young brown dwarf eclipsing binary2mass j05352184-0546085, located in the orion nebula cluster. no excess diskemission is detected: the measured fluxes at lambda &lt; 8 um are within 1 sigma(&lt; 0.1 mjy) of a bare photosphere, and the 3 sigma upper limit at 16 um is amere 0.04 mjy above the bare photospheric level. together with the knownproperties of the system, this implies the absence of optically thick disksaround the individual components. it also implies that if any circumbinary diskis present, it must either be optically thin and extremely tenuous (10^{-10}msun) if it extends in to within ~0.1 au of the binary (the approximate tidaltruncation radius), or it must be optically thick with a large inner hole, &gt;0.6-10 au in radius depending on degree of flaring. the consequence in allcases is that disk accretion is likely to be negligible or absent. thissupports the recent proposal that the strong halpha emission in the primary(more massive) brown dwarf results from chromospheric activity, and therebybolsters the hypothesis that the surprising teff inversion observed between thecomponents is due to strong magnetic fields on the primary. our data also setconstraints on the teff of the components independent of spectral type, andthereby on models of the aforementioned magnetic field effects. we discuss theconsequences for the derived fundamental properties of young brown dwarfs andvery low-mass stars in general. specifically, if very active isolated youngbrown dwarfs and very low-mass stars suffer the same activity/field relatedeffects as the 2m0535-05 primary, the low-mass stellar/substellar imf currentlyderived from standard evolutionary tracks may be substantially in error.

1004.2263	spitzer space telescope observations of the carina nebula: the steady  march of feedback-driven star formation	we report the first results of imaging the carina nebula with spitzer/irac,providing a catalog of point sources and ysos based on sed fits. we discussseveral aspects of the extended emission, including dust pillars that resultwhen a clumpy molecular cloud is shredded by massive star feedback. there arefew "extended green objects" (egos) normally taken as signposts of outflowactivity, and none of the hh jets detected optically are seen as egos. apopulation of "extended red objects" tends to be found around ob stars, somewith clear bow-shocks. these are dusty shocks where stellar winds collide withflows off nearby clouds. finally, the relative distributions of o stars andsubclusters of ysos as compared to dust pillars shows that while some ysos arelocated within pillars, many more stars and ysos reside just outside pillarheads. we suggest that pillars are transient phenomena, part of a continuousoutwardly propagating wave of star formation driven by massive star feedback.as pillars are destroyed, they leave newly formed stars in their wake, whichare then subsumed into the young ob association. altogether, the currentgeneration of ysos shows no strong deviation from a normal imf. the number ofysos suggests a roughly constant star-formation rate over the past 3myr,implying that star formation in pillars constitutes an important mechanism toconstruct unbound ob associations. accelerated pillars may give birth to o-typestars that, after several myr, could appear to have formed in isolation.

1005.2128	a search for star-disk interaction among the strongest x-ray flaring  stars in the orion nebula cluster	the chandra orion ultradeep project observed hundreds of young, low-massstars undergoing highly energetic x-ray flare events. the 32 most powerfulcases have been modeled with the result that the magnetic structuresresponsible for these flares can be many stellar radii in extent. in thispaper, we model the observed spectral energy distributions of these 32 stars inorder to determine, in detail for each star, whether there is circumstellardisk material situated in sufficient proximity to the stellar surface forinteraction with the large magnetic loops inferred from the observed x-rayflares. our spectral energy distributions span the wavelength range 0.3-8 um(plus 24 um for some stars), allowing us to constrain the presence of dustycircumstellar material out to &gt;10 au from the stellar surface in most cases.for 24 of the 32 stars in our sample the available data are sufficient toconstrain the location of the inner edge of the dusty disks. six of these (25%)have spectral energy distributions consistent with inner disks within reach ofthe observed magnetic loops. another four stars may have gas disks interior tothe dust disk and extending within reach of the magnetic loops, but we cannotconfirm this with the available data. the remaining 14 stars (58%) appear tohave no significant disk material within reach of the large flaring loops.thus, up to ~40% of the sample stars exhibit energetic x-ray flares thatpossibly arise from a magnetic star-disk interaction, and the remainder areevidently associated with extremely large, free-standing magnetic loopsanchored only to the stellar surface.

1008.1265	a multi-color optical survey of the orion nebula cluster. ii. the h-r  diagram	we present a new analysis of the stellar population of the orion nebulacluster (onc) based on multi-band optical photometry and spectroscopy. we studythe color-color diagrams in bvi, plus a narrow-band filter centered at 6200a,finding evidences that intrinsic color scales valid for main-sequence dwarfsare incompatible with the onc, while a better agreement is found employingsynthetic intrinsic colors obtained constraining the typical lower surfacegravity of young stars. we refine these model colors even further, empirically,by comparison with a sample of onc stars with no accretion and no extinction.we consider the stars with known spectral types from the literature, and add 65newly classified stars from slit spectroscopy and 182 m-type from narrow-bandphotometry; in this way we isolate a sample of about 1000 stars with knownspectral type. we introduce a new method to self-consistently derive reddeningand accretion excess from the location of each star in the bvi color-colordiagram. this enables us to accurately determine the extinction of the oncmembers. we adopt a lower distance for the onc than previously assumed, basedon recent parallax measurements. with a careful choice also of the spectraltype-temperature transformation, we produce the new h-r diagram of the oncpopulation, more populated than previous works. with respect to previous works,we find higher luminosity for late-type stars and a lower luminosity for earlytypes. we determine the age distribution of the population, peaking at 2-3 myr,a higher age than previously estimated. we study the distribution of themembers in the mass-age plane, and find that taking into account selectioneffects due to incompleteness removes an apparent correlation between mass andage. we derive the imf for low- and intermediate-mass members of the onc, whichturns out to be model-dependent, and shows a turn-over at ~&lt;0.2msun.

1008.2304	high resolution spectroscopy during eclipse of the young substellar  eclipsing binary 2mass 0535-0546. i. primary spectrum: cool spots versus  opacity uncertainties	we present high-resolution keck optical spectra of the very young substellareclipsing binary 2mass j05352184-0546085, obtained during eclipse of thelower-mass (secondary) brown dwarf. the observations yield the spectrum of thehigher-mass (primary) brown dwarf alone, with negligible (~1.6%) contaminationby the secondary. we perform a simultaneous fine-analysis of the tio-epsilonband and the red lobe of the ki doublet, using state-of-the-art phoenix dustyand cond synthetic spectra. comparing the effective temperature and surfacegravity derived from these fits to the {\it empirically} determined surfacegravity of the primary (logg=3.5) then allows us to test the model spectra aswell as probe the prevailing photospheric conditions. we find that: (1) fits totio-epsilon alone imply teff=2500 \pm 50k; (2) at this teff, fits to ki implylogg=3.0, 0.5 dex lower than the true value; and (3) at the true logg, ki fitsyield teff=2650 \pm 50k, ~150k higher than from tio-epsilon alone. on the onehand, these are the trends expected in the presence of cool spots covering alarge fraction of the primary's surface (as theorized previously to explain theobserved teff reversal between the primary and secondary). specifically, ourresults can be reproduced by an unspotted stellar photosphere with teff=2700kand (empirical) logg=3.5, coupled with axisymmetric cool spots that are 15%cooler (2300k), have an effective logg=3.0 (0.5 dex lower than photospheric),and cover 70% of the surface. on the other hand, the trends in our analysis canalso be reproduced by model opacity errors: there are lacks in the synthetictio-epsilon opacities, at least for higher-gravity field dwarfs. stringentlydiscriminating between the two possibilities requires combining the presentresults with an equivalent analysis of the secondary (predicted to berelatively unspotted compared to the primary).

1009.1919	the exotic eclipsing nucleus of the ring planetary nebula suwt2	suwt2 is a planetary nebula (pn) consisting of a bright ionized thin ringseen nearly edge-on. it has a bright (v=12) central star, too cool to ionizethe pn, which we discovered to be an eclipsing binary. a spectrum from iue didnot reveal a uv source. we present extensive ground-based photometry andspectroscopy of the central binary collected over the ensuing two decades,resulting in the determination that the orbital period of the eclipsing pair is4.9 d, and consists of two nearly identical a1 v stars, each of mass ~2.7m_sun. the physical parameters of the a stars, combined with evolutionarytracks, show that both are in the short-lived "blue-hook" evolutionary phasethat occurs between the main sequence and the hertzsprung gap, and that the ageof the system is about 520 myr. one puzzle is that the stars' rotationalvelocities are different from each other, and considerably slower thansynchronous with the orbital period. it is possible that the center-of-massvelocity of the eclipsing pair is varying with time, suggesting that there isan unseen third orbiting body in the system. we propose a scenario in which thesystem began as a hierarchical triple, consisting of a ~2.9 m_sun star orbitingthe close pair of a stars. upon reaching the agb stage, the primary engulfedthe pair into a common envelope, leading to a rapid contraction of the orbitand catastrophic ejection of the envelope into the orbital plane. in thispicture, the exposed core of the initial primary is now a white dwarf of ~0.7m_sun, orbiting the eclipsing pair, which has already cooled below thedetectability possible by iue at our derived distance of 2.3 kpc and areddening of e(b-v)=0.40. the suwt2 system may be destined to perish as a typeia supernova.

1011.0424	solar flares and coronal mass ejections: a statistically determined  flare flux-cme mass correlation	in an effort to examine the relationship between flare flux and correspondingcme mass, we temporally and spatially correlate all x-ray flares and cmes inthe lasco and goes archives from 1996 to 2006. we cross-reference 6,733 cmeshaving well-measured masses against 12,050 x-ray flares having positioninformation as determined from their optical counterparts. for a given flare,we search in time for cmes which occur 10-80 minutes afterward, and we furtherrequire the flare and cme to occur within +/-45 degrees in position angle onthe solar disk. there are 826 cme/flare pairs which fit these criteria.comparing the flare fluxes with cme masses of these paired events, we find cmemass increases with flare flux, following an approximately log-linear, brokenrelationship: in the limit of lower flare fluxes, log(cme mass)~0.68*log(flareflux), and in the limit of higher flare fluxes, log(cme mass)~0.33*log(flareflux). we show that this broken power-law, and in particular the flatter slopeat higher flare fluxes, may be due to an observational bias against cmesassociated with the most energetic flares: halo cmes. correcting for this biasyields a single power-law relationship of the form log(cme mass)~0.70*log(flareflux). this function describes the relationship between cme mass and flare fluxover at least 3 dex in flare flux, from ~10^-7 to 10^-4 w m^-2.

1103.5171	the color-period diagram and stellar rotational evolution - new rotation  period measurements in the open cluster m34	we present results from a 5-month photometric survey for stellar rotationperiods combined with a 4-year radial-velocity survey for membership andbinarity in the 220myr open cluster m34. we report surface rotation periods for120 stars, 83 of which are late-type cluster members. a comparison to previouswork serves to illustrate the importance of high cadence long baselinephotometric observations and membership information. the new m34 periods areless biased against slow rotation and cleaned for non-members. the rotationperiods of the cluster members span more than an order of magnitude from 0.5day up to 11.5 days, and trace two distinct rotational sequences - fast (c) andmoderate-to-slow (i) - in the color-period diagram. the sequences represent twodifferent states in the rotational evolution of the late-type cluster members.we use the color-period diagrams for m34 and for younger and older clusters toestimate the timescale for the transition from the c to the i sequence and find~&lt;150myr, ~150-300myr, and ~300-600myr for g, early-mid k, and late k dwarfs,respectively. the small number of stars in the gap between c and i suggest aquick transition. we estimate a lower limit on the maximum spin-down rate(dp/dt) during this transition to be ~0.06 days/myr and ~0.08 days/myr forearly and late k dwarfs, respectively. we compare the i sequence rotationperiods in m34 and the hyades for g and k dwarfs and find that k dwarfs spindown slower than the skumanich rate. we determine a gyrochronology age of240myr for m34. we measure the effect of cluster age uncertainties on thegyrochronology age for m34 and find the resulting error to be consistent withthe error estimate for the technique. we use the m34 i sequence to redeterminethe coefficients in the expression for rotational dependence on color used ingyrochronology (abridged).

1105.1387	apsidal motion of the massive, benchmark eclipsing binary v578 mon	v578 mon is a system of two early b-type stars in the rosette nebulastar-forming region (ngc 2244), and is one of only nine eclipsing binaries withcomponent masses greater than 10 m\odot whose physical parameters have beendetermined with an accuracy of better than 3%. it is therefore a benchmarksystem for evolutionary and stellar structure models of newly formed massivestars. combining our multi-band light curves spanning 40 yr with previous lightcurve data from the literature, we fit a model light curve that for the firsttime includes the effects of apsidal motion of the system. we measure anapsidal period of 33.48+0.10-0.06 yr. as a consequence of incorporating theapsidal motion into the modeling of the system's orbital parameters, wedetermine an updated eccentricity of e = 0.07755+0.00022-0.00027, which differssignificantly from the value previously reported in the literature. evidently,the inclusion of apsidal motion in the light curve modeling significantlyaffects the eccentricity determination. incorporating these key parameters intoa comprehensive model of the system's physical parameters-including internalstructure constraints- will bring v578 mon to the next level of benchmarkprecision and utility.

1105.2027	eclipsing binary science via the merging of transit and doppler  exoplanet survey data - a case study with the marvels pilot project and  superwasp	exoplanet transit and doppler surveys discover many binary stars during theiroperation that can be used to conduct a variety of ancillary science.specifically, eclipsing binary stars can be used to study the stellarmass-radius relationship and to test predictions of theoretical stellarevolution models. by cross-referencing 24 binary stars found in the marvelspilot project with superwasp photometry, we find two new eclipsing binaries,tyc 0272-00458-1 and tyc 1422-01328-1, which we use as case studies to developa general approach to eclipsing binaries in survey data. tyc 0272-00458-1 is asingle-lined spectroscopic binary for which we calculate a mass of thesecondary and radii for both components using reasonable constraints on theprimary mass through several different techniques. for a primary mass of m_1 =0.92 +/- 0.1 m_solar, we find m_2 = 0.610 +/- 0.036 m_solar, r_1 = 0.932 +/-0.076 r_solar and r_2 = 0.559 +/- 0.102 r_solar, and find that both stars havemasses and radii consistent with model predictions. tyc 1422-01328-1 is atriple-component system for which we can directly measure the masses and radiiof the eclipsing pair. we find that the eclipsing pair consists of an evolvedprimary star (m_1 = 1.163 +/- 0.034 m_solar, r_1 = 2.063 +/- 0.058 r_solar) anda g-type dwarf secondary (m_2 = 0.905 +/- 0.067 m_solar, r_2 = 0.887 +/- 0.037r_solar). we provide the framework necessary to apply this analysis to muchlarger datasets.

1106.1468	spectral energy distributions of young stars in ic 348: the role of  disks in angular momentum evolution of young, low-mass stars	theoretical work suggests that a young star's angular momentum and rotationrate may be strongly influenced by magnetic interactions with its circumstellardisk. a generic prediction of these 'disk-locking' (dl) theories is that adisk-locked star will be forced to co-rotate with the keplerian angularvelocity of the inner edge of the disk. these theories have also beeninterpreted to suggest a correlation between young stars' rotation periods andthe structural properties of their disks, such that slowly rotating starspossess close-in disks that enforce the star's slow rotation, whereas rapidlyrotating stars possess anemic or evacuated inner disks that are unable to brakethe stars and they spin up as they contract. to test these expectations, wemodel the seds of 33 young stars in ic 348 with known rotation periods andinfrared excesses indicating the presence of disks. for each star, we match theobserved spectral energy distribution, typically sampling 0.6-8.0 \mum, to agrid of 200,000 pre-computed star+disk radiative transfer models, from which weinfer the disk's inner-truncation radius (r_trunc). we then compare thisr_trunc to the disk's co-rotation radius (r_co), calculated from the star'srotation period. we do not find obvious differences in the disk r_trunc of slowvs. rapid rotators. this holds true both at the level of whether close-in diskmaterial is present at all, and in analyzing the precise location of the innerdisk edge relative to the r_co amongst the subset of stars with close-in diskmaterial. one interpretation is that dl is unimportant for the ic 348 stars inour sample. alternatively, if dl does operate, then it must operate on both theslow and rapid rotators, potentially producing both spin-up and spin-downtorques, and the transition from the disk-locked state to the disk-releasedstate must occur more rapidly than the stellar contraction timescale.

0704.0307	periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary uz tau e	close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes intheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from thecircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks hasbeen unclear. in binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of theouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting inaccretion that varies with the binary period. this accretion may manifestitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. here we present asearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopicbinary uz tau e. we present bvri photometry spanning three years; we find thatthe brightness of uz tau e is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16+/- 0.04 days. this is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. thebrightness of uz tau e shows significant random variability, but the overallperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more thanhalf the binary orbital period. the variability of the h-alpha line is not asclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic componentis not ruled out. the photometric variations are in good agreement withpredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar tothose of uz tau e, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur fromcircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending thetimescale over which they might form planets.

1112.2211	time-series photometry of stars in and around the lagoon nebula. i.  rotation periods of 290 low-mass pre-main-sequence stars in ngc 6530	we have conducted a long-term, wide-field, high-cadence photometricmonitoring survey of ~50,000 stars in the lagoon nebula \ion{h}{2} region. thisfirst paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in ngc 6530, theyoung cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog ofinfrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, andx-ray luminosities. the distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadlyuniform for 0.5 &lt; p &lt; 10 d; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. weobserve no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find thatstars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. the stars' x-rayluminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level($\log l_x / l_{\rm bol} \approx -3.3$). however, we find a significantpositive correlation between $l_x / l_{\rm bol}$ and co-rotation radius,suggesting that the observed x-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugalstripping of the stellar coronae. the period-mass relationship in ngc 6530 isbroadly similar to that of the orion nebula cluster (onc), but the slope of therelationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the onc and otheryoung clusters. we show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for theslowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and weargue that ngc 6530 may be slightly younger than the onc, making it aparticularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution inyoung, low-mass stars.

1112.2670	refined metallicity indices for m dwarfs using the slowpokes catalog of  wide, low-mass binaries	we report the results from spectroscopic observations of 113 ultra-wide,low-mass binary systems, composed largely of m0--m3 dwarfs, from the slowpokescatalog of common proper motion pairs identified in the sloan digital skysurvey. radial velocities of each binary member were used to confirm that theyare co-moving and, consequently, to further validate the high fidelity of theslowpokes catalog. ten stars appear to be spectroscopic binaries based on broador split spectral features, supporting previous findings that wide binaries arelikely to be hierarchical systems. we measured the h{\alpha} equivalent widthof the stars in our sample and found that components of 81% of the observedpairs has similar h{\alpha} levels. the difference in h{\alpha} equivalentwidth amongst components with similar masses was smaller than the range ofh{\alpha} variability for individual objects. we confirm that the lepine et al.{\zeta}(cah2+cah3, tio5) index traces iso-metallicity loci for most of oursample of m dwarfs. however, we find a small systematic bias in {\zeta},especially in the early-type m dwarfs. we use our sample to recalibrate thedefinition of {\zeta}. while representing a small change in the definition, thenew {\zeta} is a significantly better predictor of iso-metallicity for thehigher mass m dwarfs.

1112.2711	the initial mass function of the orion nebula cluster across the  h-burning limit	we present a new census of the orion nebula cluster (onc) over a large fieldof view (&gt;30'x30'), significantly increasing the known population of stellarand substellar cluster members with precisely determined properties. we developand exploit a technique to determine stellar effective temperatures fromoptical colors, nearly doubling the previously available number of objects witheffective temperature determinations in this benchmark cluster. our techniqueutilizes colors from deep photometry in the i-band and in two medium-bandfilters at lambda~753 and 770nm, which accurately measure the depth of amolecular feature present in the spectra of cool stars. from these colors wecan derive effective temperatures with a precision corresponding to better thanone-half spectral subtype, and importantly this precision is independent of theextinction to the individual stars. also, because this technique utilizes onlyphotometry redward of 750nm, the results are only mildly sensitive to opticalveiling produced by accretion. completing our census with previously availabledata, we place some 1750 sources in the hertzsprung-russel diagram and assignmasses and ages down to 0.02 solar masses. at faint luminosities, we detect alarge population of background sources which is easily separated in ourphotometry from the bona fide cluster members. the resulting initial massfunction of the cluster has good completeness well into the substellar massrange, and we find that it declines steeply with decreasing mass. this suggestsa deficiency of newly formed brown dwarfs in the cluster compared to thegalactic disk population.

1211.6140	very low-mass stellar and substellar companions to solar-like stars from  marvels iii: a short-period brown dwarf candidate around an active g0iv  subgiant	we present an eccentric, short-period brown dwarf candidate orbiting theactive, slightly evolved subgiant star tyc 2087-00255-1, which has effectivetemperature t_eff = 5903+/-42 k, surface gravity log (g) = 4.07+/-0.16 (cgs),and metallicity [fe/h] = -0.23+/-0.07. this candidate was discovered using datafrom the first two years of the multi-object apo radial velocity exoplanetslarge-area survey (marvels), which is part of the third phase of sloan digitalsky survey. from our 38 radial velocity measurements spread over a two-yeartime baseline, we derive a keplerian orbital fit with semi-amplitudek=3.571+/-0.041 km/s, period p=9.0090+/-0.0004 days, and eccentricitye=0.226+/-0.011. adopting a mass of 1.16+/-0.11 msun for the subgiant hoststar, we infer that the companion has a minimum mass of 40.0+/-2.5 m_jup.assuming an edge-on orbit, the semimajor axis is 0.090+/-0.003 au. the hoststar is photometrically variable at the \sim1% level with a period of\sim13.16+/-0.01 days, indicating that the host star spin and companion orbitare not synchronized. through adaptive optics imaging we also found a pointsource 643+/-10 mas away from tyc 2087-00255-1, which would have a mass of 0.13msun if it is physically associated with tyc 2087-00255-1 and has the same age.future proper motion observation should be able to resolve if this tertiaryobject is physically associated with tyc 2087-00255-1 and make tyc 2087-00255-1a triple body system. core ca ii h and k line emission indicate that the hostis chromospherically active, at a level that is consistent with the inferredspin period and measured v_{rot}*sin i, but unusual for a subgiant of thist_eff. this activity could be explained by ongoing tidal spin-up of the hoststar by the companion.

1306.3157	a cautionary tale: marvels brown dwarf candidate reveals itself to be a  very long period, highly eccentric spectroscopic stellar binary	we report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopicbinary star system (tyc 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that wehad initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. at themoderate resolving power of the marvels spectrograph and the spectrographs usedfor subsequent radial-velocity (rv) measurements (r ~ &lt;30,000), this particularstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an rv signal that would beinduced by a brown dwarf companion (msin(i)~50 m_jup) to a solar-type primary.at least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a singlestar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), itsrelatively long period (p~238 days), and the approximately perpendicularorientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189degrees). as a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two setsof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the rv measurements basedon centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by anorbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit(e~0.3). only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does thetrue, double-lined nature and large rv amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. thediscovery of this binary system is an important lesson for rv surveys searchingfor substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, asurvey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives fora range of orbital parameters. finally, for surveys like marvels that lack theresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor thepeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width orshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vettingprocess.

1306.3503	constraining explosion type of young supernova remnants using 24 micron  emission morphology	determination of the explosion type of supernova remnants (snrs) can bechallenging, as snrs are hundreds to thousands of years old and supernovae(sne) are classified based on spectral properties days after explosion.previous studies of thermal x-ray emission from milky way and large magellaniccloud (lmc) snrs have shown that type ia and core-collapse (cc) snrs havestatistically different symmetries, and thus these sources can be typed basedon their x-ray morphologies. in this paper, we extend the same technique, amultipole expansion technique using power ratios, to infrared (ir) images ofsnrs to test whether they can be typed using the symmetry of their warm dustemission as well. we analyzed archival spitzer space telescope multibandimaging photometer (mips) 24 micron observations of the previously used x-raysample, and we find that the two classes of snrs separate according to their irmorphologies. the type ia snrs are statistically more circular and mirrorsymmetric than the cc snrs, likely due to the different circumstellarenvironments and explosion geometries of the progenitors. broadly, our workindicates that the ir emission retains information of the explosive origins ofthe snr and offers a new method to type snrs based on ir morphology.

1308.4728	an observational correlation between stellar brightness variations and  surface gravity	surface gravity is one of a star's basic properties, but it is difficult tomeasure accurately, with typical uncertainties of 25-50 per cent if measuredspectroscopically and 90-150 per cent photometrically. asteroseismologymeasures gravity with an uncertainty of about two per cent but is restricted torelatively small samples of bright stars, most of which are giants. theavailability of high-precision measurements of brightness variations for&gt;150,000 stars provides an opportunity to investigate whether the variationscan be used to determine surface gravities. the fourier power of granulation ona star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity; if brightnessvariations on timescales of hours arise from granulation, then such variationsshould correlate with surface gravity. here we report an analysis of archivaldata that reveals an observational correlation between surface gravity and theroot-mean-square brightness variations on timescales of less than eight hoursfor stars with temperatures of 4500-6750k, log of surface gravities of 2.5-4.5(cgs units), and having overall brightness variations &lt;3 parts per thousand. astraightforward observation of optical brightness variations therefore allows adetermination of the surface gravity with a precision of &lt;25 percent forinactive sun-like stars at main-sequence to giant stages of evolution.

1310.7152	radial velocity variations of photometrically quiet, chromospherically  inactive kepler stars: a link between rv jitter and photometric flicker	we compare stellar photometric variability, as measured from kepler lightcurves by basri et al. (2011), with measurements of radial velocity (rv)root-mean-square (rms) variations of all california planet search overlapstars. we newly derive rotation periods from the kepler light curves for all ofthe stars in our study sample. the rv variations reported herein range fromless than 4 m/s to 135 m/s, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometricvariability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the rv program forchromospherically "quiet" stars. despite the small size of our sample, we findwith high statistical significance that the rv rms manifests strongly in thefourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in rv have agreater number of frequency components in the light curve. we also find thatspot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict theobserved rv variations by factors of ~2--1000, likely because the low levelphotometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included insimple spot models. the stars best fit by these models tend to have simplerlight curves, dominated by a single relatively high amplitude component ofvariability. finally, we demonstrate that the rv rms behavior of our sample canbe explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagramintroduced by bastien et al. (2013). we use this diagram to derive the surfacegravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved offthe main-sequence. more generally, we find that the stars with the largest rvrms are those that have evolved onto the "flicker floor" sequence in thatdiagram, characterized by relatively low amplitude but highly complexphotometric variations which grow as the stars evolve to become subgiants.

1310.7585	spitzer and z' secondary eclipse observations of the highly irradiated  transiting brown dwarf kelt-1b	we present secondary eclipse observations of the highly irradiated transitingbrown dwarf kelt-1b. these observations represent the first constraints on theatmospheric dynamics of a highly irradiated brown dwarf, and the atmospheres ofirradiated giant planets at high surface gravity. using the spitzer spacetelescope, we measure secondary eclipse depths of 0.195+/-0.010% at 3.6um and0.200+/-0.012% at 4.5um. we also find tentative evidence for the secondaryeclipse in the z' band with a depth of 0.049+/-0.023%. these measured eclipsedepths are most consistent with an atmosphere model in which there is a strongsubstellar hotspot, implying that heat redistribution in the atmosphere ofkelt-1b is low. while models with a more mild hotspot or even with dayside heatredistribution are only marginally disfavored, models with complete heatredistribution are strongly ruled out. the eclipse depths also prefer anatmosphere with no tio inversion layer, although a model with tio inversion ispermitted in the dayside heat redistribution case, and we consider thepossibility of a day-night tio cold trap in this object. for the first time, wecompare the irac colors of brown dwarfs and hot jupiters as a function ofeffective temperature. importantly, our measurements reveal that kelt-1b has a[3.6]-[4.5] color of 0.07+/-0.11, identical to that of isolated brown dwarfs ofsimilarly high temperature. in contrast, hot jupiters generally show redder[3.6]-[4.5] colors of ~0.4, with a very large range from ~0 to ~1. evidently,despite being more similar to hot jupiters than to isolated brown dwarfs interms of external forcing of the atmosphere by stellar insolation, kelt-1b hasan atmosphere most like that of other brown dwarfs. this suggests that surfacegravity is very important in controlling the atmospheric systems of substellarmass bodies.

1312.5928	stellar granulation as the source of high-frequency flicker in kepler  light curves	a large fraction of cool, low-mass stars exhibit brightness fluctuations thatarise from a combination of convective granulation, acoustic oscillations,magnetic activity, and stellar rotation. much of the short-timescalevariability takes the form of stochastic noise, whose presence may limit theprogress of extrasolar planet detection and characterization. in order to laythe groundwork for extracting useful information from these quasi-randomsignals, we focus on the origin of the granulation-driven component of thevariability. we apply existing theoretical scaling relations to predict thestar-integrated variability amplitudes for 508 stars with photometric lightcurves measured by the kepler mission. we also derive an empirical correctionfactor that aims to account for the suppression of convection in f-dwarf starswith magnetic activity and shallow convection zones. so that we can makepredictions of specific observational quantities, we performed monte carlosimulations of granulation light curves using a lorentzian power spectrum.these simulations allowed us to reproduce the so-called "flicker floor" (i.e.,a lower bound in the relationship between the full light-curve range and powerin short-timescale fluctuations) that was found in the kepler data. the montecarlo model also enabled us to convert the modeled fluctuation variance into aflicker amplitude directly comparable with observations. when the magneticsuppression factor described above is applied, the model reproduces theobserved correlation between stellar surface gravity and flicker amplitude.observationally validated models like these provide new and complementaryevidence for a possible impact of magnetic activity on the properties ofnear-surface convection.

1403.1872	testing the asteroseismic mass scale using metal-poor stars  characterized with apogee and kepler	fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can beinferred using asteroseismology. cool stars with convective envelopes haveturbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp pulsations. theproperties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass andradius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. stellar properties derivedusing these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities.because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysicalpriors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic massestimates in the low-metallicity regime. we identify nine metal-poor red giants(including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from asample observed by both the kepler space telescope and the sloan digital skysurvey-iii apogee spectroscopic survey. we compare masses inferred usingasteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. although oursample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismicparameters from the apokasc catalog, produce masses that are systematicallyhigher (&lt;{\delta}m&gt;=0.17+/-0.05 msun) than astrophysical expectations. themagnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical correctionsto the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. usingalternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematicshifts at the 0.04 msun level. we also compare published asteroseismic analyseswith scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the frequencyof maximum power as a constraint. upcoming apokasc observations will provide alarger sample of ~100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismiccharacterization of galactic stellar populations.

1403.1907	multiplicity in early stellar evolution	observations from optical to centimeter wavelengths have demonstrated thatmultiple systems of two or more bodies is the norm at all stellar evolutionarystages. multiple systems are widely agreed to result from the collapse andfragmentation of cloud cores, despite the inhibiting influence of magneticfields. surveys of class 0 protostars with mm interferometers have revealed avery high multiplicity frequency of about 2/3, even though there areobservational difficulties in resolving close protobinaries, thus supportingthe possibility that all stars could be born in multiple systems. near-infraredadaptive optics observations of class i protostars show a lower binaryfrequency relative to the class 0 phase, a declining trend that continuesthrough the class ii/iii stages to the field population. this loss ofcompanions is a natural consequence of dynamical interplay in small multiplesystems, leading to ejection of members. we discuss observational consequencesof this dynamical evolution, and its influence on circumstellar disks, and wereview the evolution of circumbinary disks and their role in defining binarymass ratios. special attention is paid to eclipsing pms binaries, which allowfor observational tests of evolutionary models of early stellar evolution. manystars are born in clusters and small groups, and we discuss how interactions indense stellar environments can significantly alter the distribution of binaryseparations through dissolution of wider binaries. the binaries and multipleswe find in the field are the survivors of these internal and externaldestructive processes, and we provide a detailed overview of the multiplicitystatistics of the field, which form a boundary condition for all models ofbinary evolution. finally we discuss various formation mechanisms for massivebinaries, and the properties of massive trapezia.

(2013). although surfacegravity is crucial for stellar classification, it is the mean stellar densitywhich is most useful when studying transiting exoplanets, due to its directimpact on the transit light curve shape. indeed, an accurate and independentmeasure of the stellar density can be leveraged to infer subtle properties of atransiting system, such as the companion's orbital eccentricity viaasterodensity profiling. we here calibrate flicker to the mean stellar densityof 439 kepler targets with asteroseismology, allowing us to derive a newempirical relation given by$\log_{10}(\rho_{\star}\,[\mathrm{kg}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}]) = 5.413 - 1.850\log_{10}(f_8\,[\mathrm{ppm}])$. the calibration is valid for stars with$4500$k$&lt;t_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;6500$k, $k_p&lt;14$ and flicker estimates correspondingto stars with $3.25&lt;\log g_{\star}&lt;4.43$. our relation has a model error in thestellar density of 31.7% and so has $\sim8$ times lower precision than thatfrom asteroseismology but is applicable to a sample $\sim40$ times greater.flicker therefore provides an empirical method to enable asterodensityprofiling on hundreds of planetary candidates from present and future missions.

1404.1967	detailed abundances of planet-hosting wide binaries. i. did planet  formation imprint chemical signatures in the atmospheres of hd 20782/81?	using high-resolution echelle spectra obtained with magellan/mike, we presenta chemical abundance analysis of both stars in the planet-hosting wide binarysystem hd20782 + hd20781. both stars are g dwarfs, and presumably coeval,forming in the same molecular cloud. therefore we expect that they shouldpossess the same bulk metallicities. furthermore, both stars also host giantplanets on eccentric orbits with pericenters $\lesssim 0.2\,$ au. weinvestigate if planets with such orbits could lead to the host stars ingestingmaterial, which in turn may leave similar chemical imprints in theiratmospheric abundances. we derived abundances of 15 elements spanning a rangeof condensation temperatures ($t_{c}\approx 40-1660\,$ k). the two stars arefound to have a mean element-to-element abundance difference of $0.04\pm0.07\,$dex, which is consistent with both stars having identical bulk metallicities.in addition, for both stars, the refractory elements ($t_{c} &gt; 900\,$ k)exhibit a positive correlation between abundance (relative to solar) and$t_{c}$, with similar slopes of $\approx$ $1\times10^{-4}\,$ dex k$^{-1}$. themeasured positive correlations are not perfect; both stars exhibit a scatter of$\approx$ $5\times10^{-5}\,$ dex k$^{-1}$ about the mean trend, and certainelements (na, al, sc) are similarly deviant in both stars. these findings arediscussed in the context of models for giant planet migration that predict theaccretion of h-depleted rocky material by the host star. we show that a simplesimulation of a solar-type star accreting material with earth-like compositionpredicts a positive---but imperfect---correlation between refractory elementalabundances and $t_{c}$. our measured slopes for hd 20782/81 are consistent withwhat is predicted for the ingestion of 10--20 earths by both stars.

1405.0739	a strict test of stellar evolution models: the absolute dimensions of  massive benchmark eclipsing binary v578 mon	we determine the absolute dimensions of the eclipsing binary v578 mon, adetached system of two early b-type stars (b0v + b1v, p$=$2.40848 d) in thestar-forming region ngc 2244 of the rosette nebula. from the light curveanalysis of 40 yr of photometry and the analysis of hermes spectra, we findradii of $5.41\pm0.04$ rsun and $4.29\pm 0.05$ rsun, and temperatures of $30000\pm 500$~k and $ 25750\pm 435$ k respectively. we find that ourdisentangled component spectra for v578 mon agree well previous spectraldisentangling from the literature. we also reconfirm the previous spectroscopicorbit of v578 mon finding that masses of $ 14.54\pm 0.08$ msun and $ 10.29\pm0.06$ msun are fully compatible with the new analysis. we compare the absolutedimensions to the rotating models of the geneva and utrecht groups and themodels of granada group. we find all three sets of models marginally reproducethe absolute dimensions of both stars with a common age within uncertainty forgravity-effective temperature isochrones. however - there are some apparent agediscrepancies for the corresponding mass-radius isochrones. models with largerconvective overshoot $&gt;0.35$ worked best. combined with our previouslydetermined apsidal motion of $0.07089^{+0.00021}_{-0.00013}$ deg cycle$^{-1}$,we compute the internal structure constants (tidal love number) for thenewtonian and general relativistic contribution to the apsidal motion,$\log{k_2}=-1.975\pm0.017$ and $\log{k_2}=-3.412\pm0.018$ respectively. we findthe relativistic contribution to the apsidal motion of be small $&lt;4\%$. we findthat the prediction of $\log{k_{\rm 2,theo}}=-2.005\pm0.025$ of the granadamodels fully agrees with our observed $\log{k_2}$.

1405.0940	larger planet radii inferred from stellar "flicker" brightness  variations of bright planet host stars	most extrasolar planets have been detected by their influence on their parentstar, typically either gravitationally (the doppler method) or by the small dipin brightness as the planet blocks a portion of the star (the transit method).therefore, the accuracy with which we know the masses and radii of extrasolarplanets depends directly on how well we know those of the stars, the latterusually determined from the measured stellar surface gravity, logg. recent workhas demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations ("flicker") ofstars can be used to measure logg to a high accuracy of ~0.1-0.2 dex (bastienet al. 2013). here, we use flicker measurements of 289 bright (kepmag&lt;13)candidate planet-hosting stars with teff=4500-6650 k to re-assess the stellarparameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties.this re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars, anastrophysical bias exists that contaminates the stellar sample with evolvedstars: nearly 50% of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants. as a result,the stellar radii, and hence the radii of the planets orbiting these stars, areon average 20-30% larger than previous measurements had suggested.

1406.3788	empirical tests of pre-main-sequence stellar evolution models with  eclipsing binaries	we examine the performance of standard pms stellar evolution models againstthe accurately measured properties of a benchmark sample of 26 pms stars in 13eb systems. we provide a definitive compilation of all fundamental propertiesfor the ebs. we also provide a definitive compilation of the various pms modelsets. in the h-r diagram, the masses inferred for the individual stars by themodels are accurate to better than 10% above 1 msun, but below 1 msun they arediscrepant by 50-100%. we find evidence that the failure of the models to matchthe data is linked to the triples in the eb sample; at least half of the ebspossess tertiary companions. excluding the triples, the models reproduce thestellar masses to better than ~10% in the h-r diagram, down to 0.5 msun, belowwhich the current sample is fully contaminated by tertiaries. we considerseveral mechanisms by which a tertiary might cause changes in the eb propertiesand thus corrupt the agreement with stellar model predictions. we show that theenergies of the tertiary orbits are comparable to that needed to potentiallyexplain the scatter in the eb properties through injection of heat, perhapsinvolving tidal interaction. it seems from the evidence at hand that thismechanism, however it operates in detail, has more influence on the surfaceproperties of the stars than on their internal structure, as the lithiumabundances are broadly in good agreement with model predictions. the ebs thatare members of young clusters appear individually coeval to within 20%, butcollectively show an apparent age spread of ~50%, suggesting true age spreadsin young clusters. however, this apparent spread in the eb ages may also be theresult of scatter in the eb properties induced by tertiaries.

1407.0718	accurate atmospheric parameters at moderate resolution using spectral  indices: preliminary application to the marvels survey	studies of galactic chemical and dynamical evolution in the solarneighborhood depend on the availability of precise atmospheric parameters(teff, [fe/h] and log g) for solar-type stars. many large-scale spectroscopicsurveys operate at low to moderate spectral resolution for efficiency inobserving large samples, which makes the stellar characterization difficult dueto the high degree of blending of spectral features. while most surveys usespectral synthesis, in this work we employ an alternative method based onspectral indices to determine the atmospheric parameters of a sample of nearbyfgk dwarfs and subgiants observed by the marvels survey at moderate resolvingpower (r~12,000). we have developed three codes to automatically normalize theobserved spectra, measure the equivalent widths of the indices and, through thecomparison of those with values calculated with pre-determined calibrations,derive the atmospheric parameters of the stars. the calibrations were builtusing a sample of 309 stars with precise stellar parameters obtained from theanalysis of high-resolution feros spectra. a validation test of the method wasconducted with a sample of 30 marvels targets that also have reliableatmospheric parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. ourapproach was able to recover the parameters within 80 k for teff, 0.05 dex for[fe/h] and 0.15 dex for log g, values that are lower or equal to the typicalexternal uncertainties found between different high-resolution analyzes. anadditional test was performed with a subsample of 138 stars from the elodiestellar library and the literature atmospheric parameters were recovered within125 k for teff, 0.10 dex for [fe/h] and 0.29 dex for log g. these results showthat the spectral indices are a competitive tool to characterize stars with theintermediate resolution spectra.

1409.5137	an improved determination of the lithium depletion boundary age of  blanco 1 and a first look on the effects of magnetic activity	the lithium depletion boundary (ldb) is a robust method for accuratelydetermining the ages of young clusters, but most pre-main-sequence models usedto derive ldb ages do not include the effects of magnetic activity on stellarproperties. in light of this, we present results from our spectroscopic studyof the very low-mass members of the southern open cluster blanco 1 using thegemini-north telescope, program ids: gn-2009b-q-53 and gn-2010b-q-96. weobtained gmos spectra at intermediate resolution for cluster candidate memberswith $i$$\approx$13--20 mag. from our sample of 43 spectra, we find 14 probablecluster members by considering proximity to the cluster sequence in an$i/i-k\rm_s$ color-magnitude diagram, agreement with the cluster's systemicradial velocity, and magnetic activity as a youth indicator. we systematicallyanalyze the h$\alpha$ and li features and update the ldb age of blanco 1 to be$126^{+13}_{-14}$ myr. our new ldb age for blanco 1 shows remarkable coevalitywith the benchmark pleiades open cluster. using available empirical activitycorrections, we investigate the effects of magnetic activity on the ldb age ofblanco 1. accounting for activity, we infer a corrected ldb age of$114^{+9}_{-10}$ myr. this work demonstrates the importance of accounting formagnetic activity on ldb inferred stellar ages, suggesting the need tore-investigate previous ldb age determinations.

1410.4971	the impact of chromospheric activity on observed initial mass functions	using recently established empirical calibrations for the impact ofchromospheric activity on the radii, effective temperatures, and estimatedmasses of active low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, we reassess the shape of theinitial mass function (imf) across the stellar/substellar boundary in the uppersco star-forming region (age 5-10 myr). we adjust the observed effectivetemperatures to warmer values using the observed strength of the chromospherich$\alpha$ emission, and redetermine the estimated masses of objects usingpre--main-sequence evolutionary tracks in the h-r diagram. the effect of theactivity-adjusted temperatures is to shift the objects to higher masses by3-100%. while the slope of the resulting imf at substellar masses is notstrongly changed, the peak of the imf does shift from ~0.06 to ~0.11 msun.moreover, for objects with masses &lt;~0.2 msun, the ratio of brown dwarfs tostars changes from ~80% to ~33%. these results suggest that activitycorrections are essential for studies of the substellar mass function, if themasses are estimated from spectral types or from effective temperatures.

1504.05249	slowpokes-ii: 100,000 wide binaries identified in sdss without proper  motions	we present the slowpokes-ii catalog of low-mass visual binaries identifiedfrom the sloan digital sky survey by matching photometric distances. thecandidate pairs are vetted by comparing the stellar density at their respectivegalactic positions to monte carlo realizations of a simulated milky way. inthis way, we are able to identify large numbers of bona fide wide binarieswithout the need of proper motions. 105,537 visual binaries with angularseparations of $\sim$1-20", are identified, each with a probability of chancealignment of $\lesssim$5%. this is the largest catalog of bona fide widebinaries to date, and it contains a diversity of systems---in mass, massratios, binary separations, metallicity, and evolutionary states---that shouldfacilitate follow-up studies to characterize the properties of m dwarfs andwhite dwarfs. there is a subtle but definitive suggestion of multiplepopulations in the physical separation distribution, supporting earlierfindings. we suggest that wide binaries are comprised of multiple populations,most likely representing different formation modes. there are 141 m7 or laterwide binary candidates, representing a 7-fold increase in the number currentlyknown. these binaries are too wide to have been formed via the ejectionmechanism. finally, we find that ~6% of spectroscopically confirmed m dwarfsare not included in the sdss star catalog; they are misclassified as extendedsources due to the presence of a nearby or partially resolved companion. theslowpokes-ii catalog is publicly available to the entire community on the worldwide web via the filtergraph data visualization portal.

0805.1040	stellar rotation in m35: mass-period relations, spin-down rates, and  gyrochronology	we present the results of a 5 month photometric time-series survey forstellar rotation over a 40'x40' field on the 150 myr open cluster m35. wereport rotation periods for 441 stars and determine their cluster membershipand binarity based on a decade-long radial-velocity survey, proper-motionmeasurements, and multi-band photometric observations. we find that 310 of thestars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of m35. theirdistribution of rotation periods span more than two orders of magnitude from~0.1-15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the time-span ofthe survey. with an age between the zero-age main-sequence and the hyades, andwith ~6 times more rotation periods than measured in the pleiades, m35 permitdetailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. nearly 80%of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color-period plane,defining clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). them35 color-period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transitionbetween the two rotational states for g and k dwarfs, respectively. thesetimescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, andoffer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentumtransport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. a comparison to the hyades,confirm the skumanich (1972) spindown-dependence for g dwarfs on one rotationalstate, but suggest that k dwarfs spin down more slowly. the locations of therotational sequences in the m35 color-period diagram support the use ofrotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. we usesuch gyrochronology to determine "gyro-ages" for m35. we use the m35 data toevaluate new color dependencies for the rotational isochrones.

1505.01850	a disk-based dynamical mass estimate for the young binary ak sco	we present spatially and spectrally resolved atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) observations of gas and dust in the diskorbiting the pre-main sequence binary ak sco. by forward-modeling the diskvelocity field traced by co j=2-1 line emission, we infer the mass of thecentral binary, $m_\ast = 2.49 \pm 0.10~m_\odot$, a new dynamical measurementthat is independent of stellar evolutionary models. assuming the disk andbinary are co-planar within $\sim$2{\deg}, this disk-based binary massmeasurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocitymonitoring of the combined stellar spectra. these alma results are alsocompared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location ofthe binary in the hertzsprung-russell diagram, using several common pre-mainsequence model grids. these models predict stellar masses that are marginallyconsistent with our dynamical measurement (at $\sim 2\,\sigma$), but aresystematically high (by $\sim$10%). these same models consistently predict anage of $18\pm1$ myr for ak sco, in line with its membership in the uppercentaurus-lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host agas-rich disk. as alma accumulates comparable data for large samples ofpre-main sequence stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamicalmass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful forefforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.

1505.04708	target selection for the sdss-iii marvels survey	we present the target selection process for the multi-object apo radialvelocity exoplanets large-area survey (marvels), which is part of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) iii. marvels is a medium-resolution ($r \sim 11000$)multi-fiber spectrograph capable of obtaining radial velocities for 60 objectsat a time in order to find brown dwarfs and giant planets. the survey wasconfigured to target dwarf stars with effective temperatures approximatelybetween $4500$ and $6250 \, \mbox{k}$. for the first 2 years marvels relied onlow-resolution spectroscopic pre-observations to estimate the effectivetemperature and $\log(g)$ for candidate stars and then selected suitable dwarfstars from this pool. ultimately, the pre-observation spectra provedineffective at filtering out giant stars; many giants were incorrectlyclassified as dwarfs, resulting in a giant contamination rate of $\sim$30\% forthe first phase of the marvels survey. thereafter, the survey instead applied areduced proper motion cut to eliminate giants and used the infrared flux methodto estimate effective temperatures, using only extant photometric andproper-motion catalog information. the target selection method introduced heremay be useful for other surveys that need to rely on extant catalog data forselection of specific stellar populations.

1510.01647	impact of declining proposal success rates on scientific productivity	over the last decade proposal success rates in the fundamental sciences havedropped significantly. astronomy and related fields funded by nasa and nsf areno exception. data across agencies show that this is not principally the resultof a decline in proposal merit (the proportion of proposals receiving highrankings is largely unchanged), nor of a shift in proposer demographics(seniority, gender, and institutional affiliation have all remained unchanged),nor of an increase (beyond inflation) in the average requested funding perproposal, nor of an increase in the number of proposals per investigator in anyone year. rather, the statistics are consistent with a scenario in which agencybudgets for competed research are flat or decreasing in inflation-adjusteddollars, the overall population of investigators has grown, and a largerproportion of these investigators are resubmitting meritorious but unfundedproposals. this white paper presents statistics which support this conclusion,as well as recent research on the time cost of proposal writing versus that ofproducing publishable results. we conclude that an aspirational proposalsuccess rate of 30-35% would still provide a healthily competitive environmentfor researchers, would more fully utilize the scientific capacity of thecommunity's facilities and missions, and provide relief to the funding agencieswho face the logistics of ever-increasing volumes of proposals.

1512.03745	recurring occultations of rw aurigae by coagulated dust in the tidally  disrupted circumstellar disk	we present photometric observations of rw aurigae, a classical t taurisystem, that reveal two remarkable dimming events. these events are similar tothat which we observed in 2010-2011, which was the first such deep dimmingobserved in rw aur in a century's worth of photometric monitoring. we suggestedthe 2010-2011 dimming was the result of an occultation of the star by itstidally disrupted circumstellar disk. in 2012-2013, the rw aur system dimmed by~0.7 mag for ~40 days and in 2014/2015 the system dimmed by ~2 mag for &gt;250days. the ingress/egress duration measurements of the more recent events agreewell with those from the 2010-2011 event, providing strong evidence that thenew dimmings are kinematically associated with the same occulting source.therefore, we suggest that both the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 dimming events,measured using data from the kilodegree extremely little telescope and thekutztown university observatory, are also occultations of rw aur a by tidallydisrupted circumstellar material. recent hydrodynamical simulations of theeccentric fly-by of rw aur b suggest the occulting body to be a bridge ofmaterial connecting rw aur a and b. these simulations suggest the possibilityof additional occultations, supported by the observations presented in thiswork. the color evolution of the dimmings suggest that the tidally strippeddisk material includes dust grains ranging in size from small grains at theleading edge, typical of star forming regions, to large grains, ices or pebblesproducing grey or nearly grey extinction deeper within the occulting material.it is not known whether this material represents arrested planet building priorto the tidal disruption event, or perhaps accelerated planet building as aresult of the disruption event, but in any case the evidence suggests thepresence of advanced planet building material in the space between rw aur a andb.

0806.3089	surprising dissimilarities in a newly formed pair of 'identical twin'  stars	the mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants ofits basic physical properties--radius, temperature, luminosity--and how thoseproperties evolve with time. thus, two stars born at the same time, from thesame natal material, and with the same mass are 'identical twins,' and as suchmight be expected to possess identical physical attributes. we have discoveredin the orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system.each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical towithin 2 percent. here we report that these twin stars have surfacetemperatures that differ by ~300k (~10%), and luminosities that differ by ~50%,both at high confidence level. preliminary results indicate that the stars'radii also differ, by 5-10%. these surprising dissimilarities suggest that oneof the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in itsformation relative to its sibling. such a delay could only have been detectedin a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system3 such as that reportedhere. our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronisation of youngbinary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formationmodels.

1601.00036	vision: a six-telescope fiber-fed visible light beam combiner for the  navy precision optical interferometer	visible-light long baseline interferometry holds the promise of advancing anumber of important applications in fundamental astronomy, including the directmeasurement of the angular diameters and oblateness of stars, and the directmeasurement of the orbits of binary and multiple star systems. to advance, thefield of visible-light interferometry requires development of instrumentscapable of combining light from 15 baselines (6 telescopes) simultaneously. thevisible imaging system for interferometric observations at npoi (vision) is anew visible light beam combiner for the navy precision optical interferometer(npoi) that uses single-mode fibers to coherently combine light from up to sixtelescopes simultaneously with an image-plane combination scheme. it features aphotometric camera for calibrations and spatial filtering from single-modefibers with two andor ixon electron multiplying ccds. this paper presents thevision system, results of laboratory tests, and results of commissioning on-skyobservations. a new set of corrections have been determined for the powerspectrum and bispectrum by taking into account non-gaussian statistics and readnoise present in electron-multipying ccds to enable measurement of visibilitiesand closure phases in the vision post-processing pipeline. the post-processingpipeline has been verified via new on-sky observations of the o-type supergiantbinary $\zeta$ orionis a, obtaining a flux ratio of $2.18\pm0.13$ mag with aposition angle of $223.9\pm1.0^{\circ}$ and separation $40.6\pm1.8$ mas over570-750 nm, in good agreement with expectations from the previously publishedorbit.

astro-ph;0010657	a 10-micron search for inner-truncated disks among pre-main-sequence  stars with photometric rotation periods	we use mid-ir (primarily 10 $\mu$m) photometry as a diagnostic for thepresence of disks with inner cavities among 32 pre-main sequence stars in orionand taurus-auriga for which rotation periods are known and which do not showevidence for inner disks at near-ir wavelengths. disks with inner cavities arepredicted by magnetic disk-locking models that seek to explain the regulationof angular momentum in t tauri stars. only three stars in our sample showevidence for excess mid-ir emission. while these three stars may possesstruncated disks consistent with magnetic disk-locking models, the remaining 29stars in our sample do not. apparently, stars lacking near-ir excesses ingeneral do not possess truncated disks to which they are magnetically coupled.  we discuss the implications of this result for the hypothesis ofdisk-regulated angular momentum. evidently, young stars can exist as slowrotators without the aid of present disk-locking, and there exist very youngstars already rotating near breakup velocity whose subsequent angular momentumevolution will not be regulated by disks. moreover, we question whether disks,when present, truncate in the manner required by disk-locking scenarios.finally, we discuss the need for rotational evolution models to take fullaccount of the large dispersion of rotation rates present at 1 myr, which mayallow the models to explain the rotational evolution of low-mass pre-mainsequence stars in a way that does not depend upon braking by disks.

astro-ph;0403159	x-ray properties of pre--main-sequence stars in the orion nebula cluster  with known rotation periods	we re-analyze all archival chandra/acis observations of the orion nebulacluster (onc) to study the x-ray properties of a large sample ofpre--main-sequence (pms) stars with optically determined rotation periods. ourgoal is to elucidate the origins of x-rays in pms stars by seeking outconnections between the x-rays and the mechanisms most likely driving theirproduction--rotation and accretion. in our sample x-ray luminosity issignificantly correlated with stellar rotation, in the sense of decreasinglx/lbol with more rapid rotation, suggesting that these stars are in the"super-saturated" regime of the rotation-activity relationship. however, wealso find that stars with optical rotation periods are significantly biased tohigh lx. this is not the result of magnitude bias in the opticalrotation-period sample but rather to the diminishingly small amplitude ofoptical variations in stars with low lx. evidently, there exists in the onc apopulation of stars whose rotation periods are unknown and that possess loweraverage x-ray luminosities than those of stars with known rotation periods.these stars may sample the linear regime of the rotation-activity relationship.accretion also manifests itself in x-rays, though in a somewhatcounterintuitive fashion: while stars with spectroscopic signatures ofaccretion show harder x-ray spectra than non-accretors, they show lower x-rayluminosities and no enhancement of x-ray variability. we interpret thesefindings in terms of a common origin for the x-ray emission observed from bothaccreting and non-accreting stars, with the x-rays from accreting stars simplybeing attenuated by magnetospheric accretion columns. this suggests that x-raysfrom pms stars have their origins primarily in chromospheres, not accretion.

astro-ph;0411178	opening the treasure chest: a newborn star cluster emerges from its dust  pillar in carina	we present detailed observations of the treasure chest, a compact nebula atthe head of a dust pillar in the southern carina nebula. this object is ofinterest because it is an example of a dense young cluster containing at leastone massive star, the formation of which may have been triggered by feedbackfrom the very massive stars in the carina nebula, and possibly eta car itself.we investigate both the nebular and stellar content of the object. near-iremission-line images reveal a cavity inside the head of the dust pillar, whichcontains a dense cluster of young stars, while the observed spectrum of thenebula is consistent with an h ii region ionized by an o9.5 v star. aftersubtracting contamination of field stars within the carina nebula itself, wecompare the cluster's color magnitude diagram with pre-main-sequence isochronesto derive a likely cluster age less than about 0.1 myr. this is in reasonableagreement with the dynamical age of a few times 10^4 yr for the expandingnebular cavity, indicating extreme youth. stars in the treasure chest clusterare highly reddened, with extinction values as large as a_v=50. two-thirds ofcluster members show strong infrared excess colors indicative of circumstellardisks, which may prove to be among the highest fraction yet seen for a youngcluster. all evidence suggests that the treaure chest is an extremely youngcluster that is just now breaking out of its natal cloud into the surroundingmassive star forming region, and is a good target for more detailed study.

astro-ph;0608154	an observational study of tidal synchronization in solar-type binary  stars in the open clusters m35 and m34	we present rotation periods for the solar-type primary stars in 13 close (a~&lt;5 au) single-lined spectroscopic binaries with known orbital periods (p) andeccentricities (e). all binaries are members of the open clusters m35 (150myr)and m34 (250myr). the binary orbital parameters and the rotation periods of theprimary stars were determined from time-series spectroscopy and time-seriesphotometry, respectively. knowledge of the ages, orbital periods, andeccentricities of these binaries combined with the rotation periods and massesof their primary stars makes them particularly interesting systems for studyingthe rates of tidal circularization and synchronization. our sample of 13binaries includes six with orbital periods shortward of 13 days (a ~&lt; 0.12 au).the stars in these binaries orbit sufficiently close that their spins andorbits have evolved toward synchronization and circularization due to tidalinteractions. we investigate the degree of tidal synchronization in each binaryby comparing the angular rotation velocity of the primary stars to the angularvelocity expected if the primary star was synchronized (e=0) or pseudo-synchronized (e&gt;0) with the orbital motion. of the six closest binaries twowith circular orbits are not synchronized, one being subsynchronous and onebeing supersynchronous, and the primary stars in two binaries with eccentricorbits are rotating more slowly than pseudosynchronism. the remaining twobinaries have reached the equilibrium state of both a circularized orbit andsynchronized rotation. as a set, the six binaries present a challenging casestudy for tidal evolution theory, which in particular does not predictsubsynchronous rotation in such close systems.

0809.3289	a survey for a coeval, comoving group associated with hd 141569	we present results of a search for a young stellar moving group associatedwith the star hd 141569, a nearby, isolated herbig aebe primary member of a5+/-3 myr-old triple star system on the outskirts of the sco-cen complex. ourspectroscopic survey identified a population of 21 li-rich, &lt;30 myr-old starswithin 30 degrees of hd 141569 which possess similar proper motions with thestar. the spatial distribution of these li-rich stars, however, is notsuggestive of a moving group associated with the hd 141569 triplet, but ratherthis sample appears cospatial with upper scorpius and upper centaurus lupus. weapply a modified moving cluster parallax method to compare the kinematics ofthese youthful stars with upper scorpius and upper centaurus lupus. eight newpotential members of upper scorpius and five new potential members of uppercentaurus lupus are identified. a substantial moving group with an identifiablenucleus within 15 degrees (~30 pc) of hd 141569 is not found in this sample.evidently, the hd 141569 system formed ~5 myr ago in relative isolation, tensof parsecs away from the recent sites of star formation in theophiucus-scorpius-centaurus region.

astro-ph;9808267	magnetic accretion and photopolarimetric variability in classical t  tauri stars	we employ a monte carlo radiation transfer code to investigate the multi-wavelength photopolarimetric variability arising from a spotted t tauri starsurrounded by a dusty circumstellar disk. our aim is to assess the ability ofthe magnetic accretion model to explain the observed photopolarimetricvariability of classical t tauri stars, and to identify potentially usefulobservational diagnostics of t tauri star/disk/spot parameters. we model arange of spot sizes, spot latitudes, inner disk truncation radii, and systeminclination angles, as well as multiple disk and spot geometries. we find thatthe amplitude, morphology, and wavelength dependence of the photopolarimetricvariability predicted by our models are generally consistent with existingobservations; a flared disk geometry is required to reproduce the largestobserved polarization levels and variations. our models can further explainstochastic polarimetric variability if unsteady accretion is invoked, in whichcase irregular -- but correlated -- photometric variability is predicted, inagreement with observations.  potentially useful observational diagnostics of system parameters of interestare discussed. we also investigate the reliability of modeling spot parametersvia analytic fits to multi-band photometric variations.

0810.1054	fundamental properties of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs	precise measurements of the fundamental properties of low-mass stars andbrown dwarfs are key to understanding the physics underlying their formationand evolution. while there has been great progress over the last decade instudying the bulk spectrophotometric properties of low-mass objects, directdetermination of their masses, radii, and temperatures have been very sparse.thus, theoretical predictions of low-mass evolution and ultracool atmospheresremain to be rigorously tested. the situation is alarming given that suchmodels are widely used, from the determination of the low-mass end of theinitial mass function to the characterization of exoplanets. an increasingnumber of mass, radius, and age determinations are placing critical constraintson the physics of low-mass objects. a wide variety of approaches are beingpursued, including eclipsing binary studies, astrometric-spectroscopic orbitalsolutions, interferometry, and characterization of benchmark systems. inparallel, many more systems suitable for concerted study are now being found,thanks to new capabilities spanning both the very widest (all-sky surveys) andvery narrowest (diffraction-limited adaptive optics) areas of the sky. thiscool stars 15 splinter session highlighted the current successes andlimitations of this rapidly growing area of precision astrophysics.
