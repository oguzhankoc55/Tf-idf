0901.2121	topological entanglement and clustering of jain hierarchy states	we obtain the clustering properties and part of the structure of zeroes ofthe jain states at filling $\frac{k}{2k+1}$: they are a direct product of avandermonde determinant (which has to exist for any fermionic state) and abosonic polynomial at filling $\frac{k}{k+1}$ which vanishes when $k+1$particles cluster together. we show that all jain states satisfy a "squeezingrule" (they are "squeezed polynomials") which severely reduces the dimension ofthe hilbert space necessary to generate them. the squeezing rule also provesthe clustering conditions that these states satisfy. we compute the topologicalentanglement spectrum of the jain $\nu={2/5}$ state and compare it to both thecoulomb ground-state and the non-unitary gaffnian state. all three states havevery similar "low energy" structure. however, the jain state entanglement"edge" state counting matches both the coulomb counting as well as twodecoupled u(1) free bosons, whereas the gaffnian edge counting misses some ofthe "edge" states of the coulomb spectrum. the spectral decomposition as wellas the edge structure is evidence that the jain state is universally equivalentto the ground state of the coulomb hamiltonian at $\nu={2/5}$. the evidence ismuch stronger than usual overlap studies which cannot meaningfullydifferentiate between the jain and gaffnian states. we compute the entanglementgap and present evidence that it remains constant in the thermodynamic limit.we also analyze the dependence of the entanglement gap and overlap as we drivethe composite fermion system through a phase transition.

0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0908.3808	photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey fields	we present the photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey (snls)fields. the snls aims at measuring the distances to sne ia at (0.3&lt;z&lt;1) usingmegacam, the 1 deg^2 imager on the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). theuncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates thesystematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the darkenergy equation of state. the photometric calibration of the snls requiresobtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science fieldstars in each survey band (sdss-like ugriz bands) with respect to standardswith known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the ubvrilandolt standards used to calibrate the nearby sne from the literaturenecessary to produce cosmological constraints. the spatial non-uniformities ofthe imager photometric response are mapped using dithered observations of densestellar fields. photometric zero-points against landolt standards are obtained.the linearity of the instrument is studied. we show that the imager filters andphotometric response are not uniform and publish correction maps. we presentmodels of the effective passbands of the instrument as a function of theposition on the focal plane. we define a natural magnitude system for megacam.we show that the systematics affecting the magnitude-to-flux relations can bereduced if we use the spectrophotometric standard star bd +17 4708 instead ofvega as a fundamental flux standard. we publish ugriz catalogs of tertiarystandards for all the snls fields.

0909.3316	the eso/vlt 3rd year type ia supernova data set from the supernova  legacy survey	we present 139 spectra of 124 type ia supernovae (sneia) that were observedat the eso/vlt during the first three years of the canada-france-hawaitelescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). this homogeneous data set isused to test for redshift evolution of sneia spectra, and will be used in thesnls 3rd year cosmological analyses.  spectra have been reduced and extracted with a dedicated pipeline that usesphotometric information from deep cfht legacy survey (cfht-ls) reference imagesto trace, at sub-pixel accuracy, the position of the supernova on thespectrogram as a function of wavelength. it also separates the supernova andits host light in 60% of cases. the identification of the supernova candidatesis performed using a spectrophotometric snia model.  a total of 124 sneia, roughly 50% of the overall snls spectroscopic sample,have been identified using the eso/vlt during the first three years of thesurvey. their redshifts range from z=0.149 to z=1.031. the average redshift ofthe sample is z=0.63+/-0.02. this constitutes the largest snia spectral set todate in this redshift range. the spectra are presented along with theirbest-fit spectral snia model and a host model where relevant. in the lattercase, a host subtracted spectrum is also presented. we produce average spectrafor pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z&lt;0.5 and z&gt;=0.5sneia. we find that z&lt;0.5 spectra have deeper intermediate mass elementabsorptions than z&gt;= 0.5 spectra. the differences with redshift are consistentwith the selection of brighter and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.

0912.0523	the entanglement gap and a new principle of adiabatic continuity	we give a complete definition of the entanglement gap separating low-energy,topological levels, from high-energy, generic ones, in the "entanglementspectrum" of fractional quantum hall (fqh) states. by removing the magneticlength inherent in the fqh problem - a procedure which we call taking the"conformal limit", we find that the entanglement spectrum of an incompressibleground-state of a generic (i.e. coulomb) lowest landau level hamiltonianre-arranges into a low-(entanglement) energy part separated by a full gap fromthe high energy entanglement levels. as previously observed, the counting ofthese levels starts off as the counting of modes of the edge theory of the fqhstate, but quickly develops finite-size effects which we show can also serve asa fingerprint of the fqh state. as the sphere manifold where the fqh residesgrows, the level spacing of the states at the same angular momentum goes tozero, suggestive of the presence of relativistic gapless edge-states. by usingthe adiabatic continuity of the low entanglement energy levels, we investigatewhether two states are topologically connected.

1002.1249	gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (snls)	the observed brightness of type ia supernovae is affected by gravitationallensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, whichintroduces an additional dispersion into the hubble diagram. we look forevidence of lensing in the supernova legacy survey 3-year data set. weinvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the hubble diagram andthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution offoreground galaxies. a deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, andwell established mass luminosity relations are used. we find evidence of alensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. the current result is limited bythe number of sne, their redshift distribution, and the other sources ofscatter in the hubble diagram. separating the galaxy population into a red anda blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signaldetection. on the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, theprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the massluminosity relations have little effect. we show that for the full supernovalegacy survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type ia sne and ~200photometrically identified type ia sne), there is an 80% probability ofdetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1006.2254	real-time analysis and selection biases in the supernova legacy survey	the supernova legacy survey (snls) has produced a high-quality, homogeneoussample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) out to redshifts greater than z=1. in itsfirst four years of full operation (to june 2007), the snls discovered morethan 3000 transient candidates, 373 of which have been confirmedspectroscopically as sne ia. use of these sne ia in precision cosmologycritically depends on an analysis of the observational biases incurred in thesnls survey due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying sn ia population.this paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures,and uses detailed monte carlo simulations to examine the effects of malmquistbias and spectroscopic sampling. such sampling effects are found to becomeapparent at z~0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of thespectroscopically confirmed sn ia sample towards brighter values for z&gt;0.75. wedescribe our approach to correct for these selection biases in our three-yearsnls cosmological analysis (snls3), and present a breakdown of the systematicuncertainties involved.

1102.2218	bulk-edge correspondence in the entanglement spectra	li and haldane conjectured and numerically substantiated that theentanglement spectrum of the reduced density matrix of ground-states oftime-reversal breaking topological phases (fractional quantum hall states)contains information about the counting of their edge modes when theground-state is cut in two spatially distinct regions and one of the regions istraced out. we analytically substantiate this conjecture for a series of fqhstates defined as unique zero modes of pseudopotential hamiltonians by findinga one to one map between the thermodynamic limit counting of two differententanglement spectra: the particle entanglement spectrum, whose counting ofeigenvalues for each good quantum number is identical (up to accidentaldegeneracies) to the counting of bulk quasiholes, and the orbital entanglementspectrum (the li-haldane spectrum). as the particle entanglement spectrum isrelated to bulk quasihole physics and the orbital entanglement spectrum isrelated to edge physics, our map can be thought of as a mathematically soundmicroscopic description of bulk-edge correspondence in entanglement spectra. byusing a set of clustering operators which have their origin in conformal fieldtheory (cft) operator expansions, we show that the counting of the orbitalentanglement spectrum eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit must be identicalto the counting of quasiholes in the bulk. the latter equals the counting ofedge modes at a hard-wall boundary placed on the sample. moreover, we show thisto be true even for cft states which are likely bulk gapless, such as thegaffnian wavefunction.

1104.1443	supernova constraints and systematic uncertainties from the first 3  years of the supernova legacy survey	we combine high redshift type ia supernovae from the first 3 years of thesupernova legacy survey (snls) with other supernova (sn) samples, primarily atlower redshifts, to form a high-quality joint sample of 472 sne (123 low-$z$,93 sdss, 242 snls, and 14 {\it hubble space telescope}). sn data alone requirecosmic acceleration at &gt;99.9% confidence, including systematic effects. for thedark energy equation of state parameter (assumed constant out to at least$z=1.4$) in a flat universe, we find $w = -0.91^{+0.16}_{-0.20}(\mathrm{stat})^{+0.07}_{-0.14} (\mathrm{sys})$ from sne only, consistent with a cosmologicalconstant. our fits include a correction for the recently discoveredrelationship between host-galaxy mass and sn absolute brightness. we payparticular attention to systematic uncertainties, characterizing them using asystematics covariance matrix that incorporates the redshift dependence ofthese effects, as well as the shape-luminosity and color-luminosityrelationships. unlike previous work, we include the effects of systematic termson the empirical light-curve models. the total systematic uncertainty isdominated by calibration terms. we describe how the systematic uncertaintiescan be reduced with soon to be available improved nearby andintermediate-redshift samples, particularly those calibrated ontousno/sdss-like systems.

1104.1444	snls3: constraints on dark energy combining the supernova legacy survey  three year data with other probes	we present observational constraints on the nature of dark energy using thesupernova legacy survey three year sample (snls3) of guy et al. (2010) andconley et al. (2011). we use the 472 sne ia in this sample, accounting forrecently discovered correlations between sn ia luminosity and host galaxyproperties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertaintiesdirectly in the cosmological fits. combining the snls3 data with the full wmap7power spectrum, the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy powerspectrum, and a prior on the hubble constant h0 from shoes, in a flat universewe find omega_m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5% measure of thedark energy equation-of-state parameter w. the statistical and systematicuncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertaintiesdominated by the photometric calibration of the sn ia fluxes -- without thesecalibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. whenrelaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega_m=0.271+/-0.015,omega_k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. parameterizing the timeevolution of w as w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), gives w_0=-0.905+/-0.196,w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. all of our results are consistentwith a flat, w=-1 universe. the size of the snls3 sample allows various teststo be performed with the sne segregated according to their light curve and hostgalaxy properties. we find that the cosmological constraints derived from thesedifferent sub-samples are consistent. there is evidence that the coefficient,beta, relating sn ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at&gt;4sigma significance (in addition to the known sn luminosity--host relation);however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and iscurrently a sub-dominant systematic.

1105.4867	fractional chern insulator	chern insulators are band insulators exhibiting a nonzero hall conductancebut preserving the lattice translational symmetry. we conclusively show that apartially filled chern insulator at 1/3 filling exhibits a fractional quantumhall effect and rule out charge-density wave states that have not been ruledout by previous studies. by diagonalizing the hubbard interaction in theflat-band limit of these insulators, we show the following: the system isincompressible and has a 3-fold degenerate ground state whose momenta can becomputed by postulating an generalized pauli principle with no more than 1particle in 3 consecutive orbitals. the ground state density is constant, andequal to 1/3 in momentum space. excitations of the system are fractionalstatistics particles whose total counting matches that of quasiholes in thelaughlin state based on the same generalized pauli principle. the entanglementspectrum of the state has a clear entanglement gap which seems to remain finitein the thermodynamic limit. the levels below the gap exhibit counting identicalto that of laughlin 1/3 quasiholes. both the 3 ground states and excited statesexhibit spectral flow upon flux insertion. all the properties above disappearin the trivial state of the insulator - both the many-body energy gap and theentanglement gap close at the phase transition when the single-particlehamiltonian goes from topologically nontrivial to topologically trivial. thesefacts clearly show that fractional many-body states are possible in topologicalinsulators.

1106.4008	constraining type ia supernovae progenitors from three years of snls  data	while it is generally accepted that type ia supernovae are the result of theexplosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting mass in a binary system, thedetails of their genesis still elude us, and the nature of the binary companionis uncertain. kasen (2010) points out that the presence of a non-degeneratecompanion in the progenitor system could leave an observable trace: a fluxexcess in the early rise portion of the lightcurve caused by the ejecta impactwith the companion itself. this excess would be observable only under favorableviewing angles, and its intensity depends on the nature of the companion. wesearched for the signature of a non-degenerate companion in three years ofsupernova legacy survey data by generating synthetic lightcurves accounting forthe effects of shocking and comparing true and synthetic time series withkolmogorov-smirnov tests. our most constraining result comes from noting thatthe shocking effect is more prominent in rest-frame b than v band: we rule outa contribution from white dwarf-red giant binary systems to type ia supernovaexplosions greater than 10% at 2 sigma, and than 20% at 3 sigma level.

1107.2232	the structure of spinful quantum hall states: a squeezing perspective	we provide a set of rules to define several spinful quantum hall modelstates. the method extends the one known for spin polarized states. it isachieved by specifying an undressed root partition, a squeezing procedure andrules to dress the configurations with spin. it applies to both theexcitation-less state and the quasihole states. in particular, we show that thenaive generalization where one preserves the spin information during thesqueezing sequence, may fail. we give numerous examples such as the halperinstates, the non-abelian spin-singlet states or the spin-charge separatedstates. the squeezing procedure for the series (k=2,r) of spinless quantum hallstates, which vanish as r powers when k+1 particles coincide, is generalized tothe spinful case. as an application of our method, we show that the countingobserved in the particle entanglement spectrum of several spinful statesmatches the one obtained through the root partitions and our rules. thiscounting also matches the counting of quasihole states of the correspondingmodel hamiltonians, when the latter is available.

1111.2810	real-space entanglement spectrum of quantum hall states	we investigate the entanglement spectra arising from sharp real-spacepartitions of the system for quantum hall states. these partitions differ fromthe previously utilized orbital and particle partitions and revealcomplementary aspects of the physics of these topologically ordered systems. weshow, by constructing one to one maps to the particle partition entanglementspectra, that the counting of the real-space entanglement spectra levels fordifferent particle number sectors versus their angular momentum along thespatial partition boundary is equal to the counting of states for the systemwith a number of (unpinned) bulk quasiholes excitations corresponding to thesame particle and flux numbers. this proves that, for an ideal model statedescribed by a conformal field theory, the real-space entanglement spectralevel counting is bounded by the counting of the conformal field theory edgemodes. this bound is known to be saturated in the thermodynamic limit (and atfinite sizes for certain states). numerically analyzing several ideal modelstates, we find that the real-space entanglement spectra indeed display theedge modes dispersion relations expected from their corresponding conformalfield theories. we also numerically find that the real-space entanglementspectra of coulomb interaction ground states exhibit a series of branches,which we relate to the model state and (above an entanglement gap) to itsquasiparticle-quasihole excitations. we also numerically compute theentanglement entropy for the nu=1 integer quantum hall state with real-spacepartitions and compare against the analytic prediction. we find that theentanglement entropy indeed scales linearly with the boundary length for largeenough systems, but that the attainable system sizes are still too small toprovide a reliable extraction of the sub-leading topological entanglemententropy term.

0710.3896	verifying the cosmological utility of type ia supernovae: implications  of a dispersion in the ultraviolet spectra	we analyze the mean rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) spectrum of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and its dispersion using high signal-to-noise keck-i/lris-bspectroscopy for a sample of 36 events at intermediate redshift (z=0.5)discovered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey(snls). we introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in ourspectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the snls sne andtheir host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the uvspectral properties of a large sample of distant sne ia. although the mean snia spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history,precise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparablesample of high quality local spectra. within the high-redshift sample, wediscover significant uv spectral variations and exclude dust extinction as theprimary cause by examining trends with the optical sn color. althoughprogenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we seeare much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expectedpatterns. an interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength ofselected uv features with phase. we also demonstrate systematic differences inthe sn ia spectral features with sn light curve width in both the uv and theoptical. we show that these intrinsic variations could represent a statisticallimitation in the future use of high-redshift sne ia for precision cosmology.we conclude that further detailed studies are needed, both locally and atmoderate redshift where the rest-frame uv can be studied precisely, in orderthat future missions can confidently be planned to fully exploit sne ia ascosmological probes [abridged].

1202.5543	d-algebra structure of topological insulators	in the quantum hall effect, the density operators at different wave-vectorsgenerally do not commute and give rise to the girvin macdonald plazmann (gmp)algebra with important consequences such as ground-state center of massdegeneracy at fractional filling fraction, and w_{1 + \infty} symmetry of thefilled landau levels. we show that the natural generalization of the gmpalgebra to higher dimensional topological insulators involves the concept of ad-algebra formed by using the fully anti-symmetric tensor in d-dimensions. forinsulators in even dimensional space, the d-algebra is isotropic and closes forthe case of constant non-abelian f(k) ^ f(k) ... ^ f(k) connection (d-berrycurvature), and its structure factors are proportional to the d/2-chern number.in odd dimensions, the algebra is not isotropic, contains the weak topologicalinsulator index (layers of the topological insulator in one less dimension) anddoes not contain the chern-simons \theta form (f ^ a - 2/3 a ^ a ^ a in 3dimensions). the chern-simons form appears in a certain combination of theparallel transport and simple translation operator which is not an algebra. thepossible relation to d-dimensional volume preserving diffeomorphisms andparallel transport of extended objects is also discussed.

1204.5682	thin-torus limit of fractional topological insulators	we analytically and numerically analyze the one-dimensional "thin-torus"limit of fractional topological insulators in a series of simple modelsexhibiting exactly flat bands with local hopping. these models are theone-dimensional limit of two dimensional chern insulators, and the hubbard-typeinteractions projected into their lowest band take particularly simple forms.by exactly solving the many-body interacting spectrum of these models, we showthat, just like in the fractional quantum hall effect, the zero modes of thethin-torus limit are cdw states of occupation numbers satisfying generalizedpauli principles. as opposed to the fqh where the thin-torus cdw appear inorbital space, in the thin-torus fci states, the cdw states are in real-space.we show the counting of the quasihole excitations in the energy spectrum cannotdistinguish between a cdw state and a fqh state. however, by exactly computingthe entanglement spectrum for the thin-torus states, we show that it canqualitatively and quantitatively distinguish between a cdw and a fractionaltopological state such as the fci. we then discover a previously unknownseparation of energy scales of the full fqh energy spectrum in the thin toruslimit and find that chern insulator models exhibiting strong isotropic fcistates have a similar structure in their thin-torus limit spectrum. we close bynumerically computing the evolution of energy and entanglement spectra from thethin-torus to the isotropic limit. our results can also be interpreted as ananalysis of one-body, 1-dimensional topological insulators stabilized byinversion symmetry in the presence of interactions.

1205.1306	an efficient approach to obtaining large numbers of distant supernova  host galaxy redshifts	we use the wide-field capabilities of the 2df fibre positioner and theaaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope (aat) to obtainredshifts of galaxies that hosted supernovae during the first three years ofthe supernova legacy survey (snls). with exposure times ranging from 10 to 60ksec per galaxy, we were able to obtain redshifts for 400 host galaxies in twosnls fields, thereby substantially increasing the total number of snlssupernovae with host galaxy redshifts. the median redshift of the galaxies inour sample that hosted photometrically classified type ia supernovae (sne ia)is 0.77, which is 25% higher than the median redshift of spectroscopicallyconfirmed sne ia in the three-year sample of the snls. our results demonstratethat one can use wide-field fibre-fed multi-object spectrographs on 4mtelescopes to efficiently obtain redshifts for large numbers of supernova hostgalaxies over the large areas of sky that will be covered by futurehigh-redshift supernova surveys, such as the dark energy survey.

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1206.5773	gauge-fixed wannier wave-functions for fractional topological insulators	we propose an improved scheme to construct many-body trial wave functions forfractional chern insulators (fci), using one-dimensional localized wannierbasis. the procedure borrows from the original scheme on a continuum cylinder,but is adapted to finite-size lattice systems with periodic boundaries. itfixes several issues of the continuum description that made the overlap withthe exact ground states insignificant. the constructed lattice states aretranslationally invariant, and have the correct degeneracy as well as thecorrect relative and total momenta. our prescription preserves the (possible)inversion symmetry of the lattice model, and is isotropic in the limit of flatberry curvature. by relaxing the maximally localized hybrid wannier orbitalprescription, we can form an orthonormal basis of states which, upon gaugefixing, can be used in lieu of the landau orbitals. we find that the exactground states of several known fci models at nu=1/3 filling are well capturedby the lattice states constructed from the laughlin wave function. the overlapis higher than 0.99 in some models when the hilbert space dimension is as largeas 3x10^4 in each total momentum sector.

1207.6385	series of abelian and non-abelian states in c&gt;1 fractional chern  insulators	we report the observation of a new series of abelian and non-abeliantopological states in fractional chern insulators (fci). the states appear atbosonic filling nu= k/(c+1) (k, c integers) in several lattice models, infractionally filled bands of chern numbers c&gt;=1 subject to on-site hubbardinteractions. we show strong evidence that the k=1 series is abelian while thek&gt;1 series is non-abelian. the energy spectrum at both groundstate filling andupon the addition of quasiholes shows a low-lying manifold of states whosetotal degeneracy and counting matches, at the appropriate size, that of thefractional quantum hall (fqh) su(c) (color) singlet k-clustered states(including halperin, non-abelian spin singlet states and theirgeneralizations). the groundstate momenta are correctly predicted by the fqh tofci lattice folding. however, the counting of fci states also matches that of aspinless fqh series, preventing a clear identification just from the energyspectrum. the entanglement spectrum lends support to the identification of ourstates as su(c) color-singlets but offers new anomalies in the counting forc&gt;1, possibly related to dislocations that call for the development of newcounting rules of these topological states.

1212.4864	improved photometric calibration of the snls and the sdss supernova  surveys	we present a combined photometric calibration of the snls and the sdsssupernova survey, which results from a joint effort of the sdss and the snlscollaborations. we deliver fluxes calibrated to the hst spectrophotometric starnetwork for large sets of tertiary stars that cover the science fields of bothsurveys in all photometric bands. we also cross-calibrate directly the twosurveys and demonstrate their consistency. for each survey the flat-fielding isrevised based on the analysis of dithered star observations. the calibrationtransfer from the hst spectrophotometric standard stars to the multi-epochtertiary standard star catalogs in the science fields follows three differentpaths: observations of primary standard stars with the sdss pt telescope;observations of landolt secondary standard stars with snls megacam instrumentat cfht; and direct observation of faint hst standard stars with megacam. inaddition, the tertiary stars for the two surveys are cross-calibrated usingdedicated megacam observations of stripe 82. this overlap enables thecomparison of these three calibration paths and justifies using theircombination to improve the calibration accuracy. flat-field corrections haveimproved the uniformity of each survey as demonstrated by the comparison ofphotometry in overlapping fields: the rms of the difference between the twosurveys is 3 mmag in gri, 4 mmag in z and 8 mmag in u. we also find aremarkable agreement (better than 1%) between the sdss and the snls calibrationin griz. the cross-calibration and the introduction of direct calibrationobservations bring redundancy and strengthen the confidence in the resultingcalibration. we conclude that the surveys are calibrated to the hst with aprecision of about 0.4% in griz. this precision is comparable to the externaluncertainty affecting the color of the hst primary standard stars.

1306.5153	photometry of supernovae in an image series : methods and application to  the supernova legacy survey (snls)	we present a technique to measure lightcurves of time-variable point sourceson a spatially structured background from imaging data. the technique wasdeveloped to measure light curves of snls supernovae in order to infer theirdistances. this photometry technique performs simultaneous psf photometry atthe same sky position on an image series. we describe two implementations ofthe method: one that resamples images before measuring fluxes, and one whichdoes not. in both instances, we sketch the key algorithms involved and presentthe validation using semi-artificial sources introduced in real images in orderto assess the accuracy of the supernova flux measurements relative to that ofsurrounding stars. we describe the methods required to anchor these psf fluxesto calibrated aperture catalogs, in order to derive sn magnitudes. we find amarginally significant bias of 2 mmag of the after-resampling method, and nobias at the mmag accuracy for the non-resampling method. given surrounding starmagnitudes, we determine the systematic uncertainty of sn magnitudes to be lessthan 1.5 mmag, which represents about one third of the current photometriccalibration uncertainty affecting sn measurements. the sn photometry deliversseveral by-products: bright star psf flux mea- surements which have arepeatability of about 0.6%, as for aperture measurements; we measure relativeastrometric positions with a noise floor of 2.4 mas for a single-image brightstar measurement; we show that in all bands of the megacam instrument, starsexhibit a profile linearly broadening with flux by about 0.5% over the wholebrightness range.

1310.0470	two superluminous supernovae from the early universe discovered by the  supernova legacy survey	we present spectra and lightcurves of snls 06d4eu and snls 07d2bv, twohydrogen-free superluminous supernovae discovered by the supernova legacysurvey. at z = 1.588, snls 06d4eu is the highest redshift superluminous sn witha spectrum, at m_u = -22.7 is one of the most luminous sne ever observed, andgives a rare glimpse into the restframe ultraviolet where these supernovae putout their peak energy. snls 07d2bv does not have a host galaxy redshift, butbased on the supernova spectrum, we estimate it to be at z ~ 1.5. bothsupernovae have similar observer-frame griz lightcurves, which map to restframelightcurves in the u-band and uv, rising in ~ 20 restframe days or longer, anddeclining over a similar timescale. the lightcurves peak in the shortestwavelengths first, consistent with an expanding blackbody starting near 15,000k and steadily declining in temperature. we compare the spectra to theoreticalmodels, and identify lines of c ii, c iii, fe iii, and mg ii in the spectrum ofsnls 06d4eu and scp 06f6, and find that they are consistent with an expandingexplosion of only a few solar masses of carbon, oxygen, and other trace metals.thus the progenitors appear to be related to those suspected for sne ic. a highkinetic energy, 10^52 ergs, is also favored. normal mechanisms of poweringcore- collapse or thermonuclear supernovae do not seem to work for thesesupernovae. we consider models powered by 56ni decay and interaction withcircumstellar material, but find that the creation and spin-down of a magnetarwith a period of 2ms, magnetic field of 2 x 10^14 gauss, and a 3 solar massprogenitor provides the best fit to the data.

1402.0725	the brighter-fatter effect and pixel correlations in ccd sensors	we present evidence that spots imaged using astronomical ccds do not exactlyscale with flux: bright spots tend to be broader than faint ones, using thesame illumination pattern. we measure that the linear size of spots or stars,of typical size 3 to 4 pixels fwhm, increase linearly with their flux by up to$2\%$ over the full ccd dynamic range. this brighter-fatter effect affects bothdeep-depleted and thinned ccd sensors. we propose that this effect is a directconsequence of the distortions of the drift electric field sourced by chargesaccumulated within the ccd during the exposure and experienced by forthcominglight-induced charges in the same exposure. the pixel boundaries then becomeslightly dynamical: overfilled pixels become increasingly smaller than theirneighbors, so that bright star sizes, measured in number of pixels, appearlarger than those of faint stars. this interpretation of the brighter-fattereffect implies that pixels in flat-fields should exhibit statisticalcorrelations, sourced by poisson fluctuations, that we indeed directly detect.we propose to use the measured correlations in flat-fields to derive how pixelboundaries shift under the influence of a given charge pattern, which allows usto quantitatively predict how star shapes evolve with flux. this physical modelof the brighter-fatter effect also explains the commonly observed phenomenonthat the spatial variance of ccd flat-fields increases less rapidly than theiraverage.

1404.4658	the single-mode approximation for fractional chern insulators and the  fractional quantum hall effect on the torus	we analyze the collective magneto-roton excitations of bosonic laughlin$\nu=1/2$ fractional quantum hall (fqh) states on the torus and of their analogon the lattice, the fractional chern insulators (fcis). we show that, byapplying the appropriate mapping of momentum quantum numbers between the twosystems, the magneto-roton mode can be identified in fcis and that it containsthe same number of states as in the fqh case. further, we numerically test thesingle mode approximation to the magneto-roton mode for both the fqh and fcicase. this proves particularly challenging for the fci, because its eigenstateshave a lower translational symmetry than the fqh states. in spite of this, weconstruct the fci single-mode approximation such that it carries the samemomenta as the fqh states, allowing for a direct comparison between the twosystems. we show that the single-mode approximation captures well a dispersivesubset of the magneto-roton excitations both for the fqh and the fci case. wefind remarkable quantitative agreement between the two systems. for example,the many-body excitation gap extrapolates to almost the same value in thethermodynamic limit.

1406.6262	correlation lengths and topological entanglement entropies of unitary  and non-unitary fractional quantum hall wavefunctions	using the newly developed matrix product state (mps) formalism fornon-abelian fractional quantum hall (fqh) states, we address the question ofwhether a fqh trial wave function written as a correlation function in anon-unitary conformal field theory (cft) can describe the bulk of a gapped fqhphase. we show that the non-unitary gaffnian state exhibits clear signatures ofa pathological behavior. as a benchmark we compute the correlation length ofmoore-read state and find it to be finite in the thermodynamic limit. bycontrast, the gaffnian state has infinite correlation length in (at least) thenon-abelian sector, and is therefore gapless. we also compute the topologicalentanglement entropy of several non-abelian states with and without quasiholes.for the first time in fqh the results are in excellent agreement in alltopological sectors with the cft prediction for unitary states. for thenon-unitary gaffnian state in finite size systems, the topological entanglemententropy seems to behave like that of the composite fermion jain state at equalfilling.

0803.3441	sifto: an empirical method for fitting sne ia light curves	we present sifto, a new empirical method for modeling type ia supernovae (sneia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. we make use ofhigh-redshift sn observations when training the model, allowing us to extend itbluer than rest frame u. this increases the utility of our high-redshift snobservations by allowing us to use more of the available data. we find thatwhen the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription,applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description.sifto therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies differentstretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter andthe stretch in the rest-frame b band. we compare sifto to other publishedlight-curve models by applying them to the same set of sn photometry, anddemonstrate that sifto and salt2 perform better than the alternatives whenjudged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. wefurther demonstrate that when sifto and salt2 are trained on the same data setthe cosmological results agree.

1501.01577	evidence for self-interaction of charge distribution in charge-coupled  devices	charge-coupled devices (ccds) are widely used in astronomy to carry out avariety of measurements, such as for flux or shape of astrophysical objects.the data reduction procedures almost always assume that ther esponse of a givenpixel to illumination is independent of the content of the neighboring pixels.we show evidence that this simple picture is not exact for several ccd sensors.namely, we provide evidence that localized distributions of charges (resultingfrom star illumination or laboratory luminous spots) tend to broaden linearlywith increasing brightness by up to a few percent over the whole dynamic range.we propose a physical explanation for this "brighter-fatter" effect, whichimplies that flatfields do not exactly follow poisson statistics: the varianceof flatfields grows less rapidly than their average, and neighboring pixelsshow covariances, which increase similarly to the square of the flatfieldaverage. these covariances decay rapidly with pixel separation. we observe theexpected departure from poisson statistics of flatfields on ccd devices andshow that the observed effects are compatible with coulomb forces induced bystored charges that deflect forthcoming charges. we extract the strength of thedeflections from the correlations of flatfield images and derive the evolutionof star shapes with increasing flux. we show for three types of sensors thatwithin statistical uncertainties,our proposed method properly bridgesstatistical properties of flatfields and the brighter-fatter effect.

1506.03455	parafermionic phases with symmetry-breaking and topological order	parafermions are the simplest generalizations of majorana fermions thatrealize topological order. we propose a less restrictive notion of topologicalorder in 1d open chains, which generalizes the seminal work by fendley [j.stat. mech., p11020 (2012)]. the first essential property is that thegroundstates are mutually indistinguishable by local, symmetric probes, and thesecond is a generalized notion of zero edge modes which cyclically permute thegroundstates. these two properties are shown to be topologically robust, andapplicable to a wider family of topologically-ordered hamiltonians than hasbeen previously considered. an an application of these edge modes, we formulatea new notion of twisted boundary conditions on a closed chain, which guaranteesthat the closed-chain groundstate is topological, i.e., it originates from thetopological manifold of degenerate states on the open chain. finally, wegeneralize these ideas to describe symmetry-breaking phases with aparafermionic order parameter. these exotic phases are condensates ofparafermion multiplets, which generalizes cooper pairing in superconductors.the stability of these condensates are investigated on both open and closedchains.

0805.2366	lsst: from science drivers to reference design and anticipated data  products	(abridged) we describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned inthe optical, the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst). a vast array ofscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and lsst willhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. the lsst design isdriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, takingan inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, andmapping the milky way. lsst will be a wide-field ground-based system designedto obtain multiple images covering the sky visible from cerro pach\'{o}n innorthern chile. the telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primarymirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 gigapixel camera. this systemcan image about 10,000 square degrees of sky in three clear nights using pairsof 15-second exposures twice per night, with typical 5$\sigma$ depth for pointsources of $r\sim24.5$ (ab). the project is in the construction phase and willbegin regular survey operations by 2022. the survey area will be containedwithin 30,000 deg$^2$ with $\delta&lt;+34.5^\circ$, and will be imaged multipletimes in six bands, $ugrizy$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. about90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey modewhich will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summedover all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield acoadded map to $r\sim27.5$. the remaining 10\% of the observing time will beallocated to projects such as a very deep and fast time domain survey. the goalis to make lsst data products, including a relational database of about 32trillion observations of 40 billion objects, available to the public andscientists around the world.

1506.08212	the dice calibration project: design, characterization, and first  results	we describe the design, operation, and first results of a photometriccalibration project, called dice (direct illumination calibration experiment),aiming at achieving precise instrumental calibration of optical telescopes. theheart of dice is an illumination device composed of 24 narrow-spectrum,high-intensity, light-emitting diodes (led) chosen to cover theultraviolet-to-near-infrared spectral range. it implements a point-like sourceplaced at a finite distance from the telescope entrance pupil, yielding a flatfield illumination that covers the entire field of view of the imager. thepurpose of this system is to perform a lightweight routine monitoring of theimager passbands with a precision better than 5 per-mil on the relativepassband normalisations and about 3{\aa} on the filter cutoff positions. thelight source is calibrated on a spectrophotometric bench. as our fundamentalmetrology standard, we use a photodiode calibrated at nist. the radiantintensity of each beam is mapped, and spectra are measured for each led. allmeasurements are conducted at temperatures ranging from 0{\deg}c to 25{\deg}cin order to study the temperature dependence of the system. the photometric andspectroscopic measurements are combined into a model that predicts the spectralintensity of the source as a function of temperature. we find that thecalibration beams are stable at the $10^{-4}$ level -- after taking the slighttemperature dependence of the led emission properties into account. we showthat the spectral intensity of the source can be characterised with a precisionof 3{\aa} in wavelength. in flux, we reach an accuracy of about 0.2-0.5%depending on how we understand the off-diagonal terms of the error budgetaffecting the calibration of the nist photodiode. with a routine 60-mncalibration program, the apparatus is able to constrain the passbands at thetargeted precision levels.

0805.3983	clustering of supernova ia host galaxies	for the first time the cross-correlation between type ia supernova hostgalaxies and surrounding field galaxies is measured using the supernova legacysurvey sample. over the z=0.2 to 0.9 redshift range we find that supernovahosts are correlated an average of 60% more strongly than similarly selectedfield galaxies over the 3-100 arcsec range and about a factor of 3 morestrongly below 10 arcsec. the correlation errors are empirically establishedwith a jackknife analysis of the four snls fields. the hosts are morecorrelated than the field at a significance of 99% in the fitted amplitude andslope, with the point-by-point difference of the two correlation functionshaving a reduced $\chi^2$ for 8 degrees of freedom of 4.3, which has aprobability of random occurrence of less than 3x10^{-5}. the correlation angleis 1.5+/-0.5 arcsec, which deprojects to a fixed co-moving correlation lengthof approximately 6.5+/- 2/h mpc. weighting the field galaxies with the mass andstar formation rate supernova frequencies of the simple a+b model produces goodagreement with the observed clustering. we conclude that these supernovaclustering differences are primarily the expected outcome of the dependence ofsupernova rates on galaxy masses and stellar populations with their clusteringenvironment.

1510.07670	entanglement spectroscopy and its application to the quantum hall  effects	the entanglement spectroscopy, initially introduced by li and haldane in thecontext of the fractional quantum hall effects, has stimulated an extensiverange of studies. the entanglement spectrum is the spectrum of the reduceddensity matrix, when we partition the system into two. for many quantumsystems, it unveils a unique feature: computed from the bulk ground state wavefunction, the entanglement spectrum give access to the physics of edgeexcitations. using this property, the entanglement spectroscopy has proved tobe a highly valuable tool to diagnose topological ordering. these lecturesintend to provide an overview of the entanglement spectroscopy, mainly in thecontext of the fractional quantum hall effect. we introduce the basic conceptsthrough the case of the quantum spin chains. we discuss the connection with theentanglement entropy and the matrix product state representation. we show howthe entanglement spectrum can be computed for non-interacting topologicalphases and how it reveals the edge excitation from the ground state. we thenpresent an extensive review of the entanglement spectra applied to thefractional quantum hall phases, showing how much information is encoded withinthe ground state and how different partitions probe different type ofexcitations. finally, we discuss the application of this tool to study thefractional chern insulators.

0807.1034	pairing in ultracold fermi gases in the lowest landau level	we study a rapidly rotating gas of unpolarized spin-1/2 ultracold fermions inthe two-dimensional regime when all atoms reside in the lowest landau level.due to the presence of the spin degree of freedom both s-wave and p-waveinteractions are allowed at ultralow temperatures. we investigate the phasediagram of this system as a function of the filling factor in the lowest landaulevel and in terms of the ratio between s- and p-wave interaction strengths. weshow that the presence of attractive interactions induces a wide regime ofphase separation with formation of maximally compact droplets that are eitherfully polarized or composed of spin-singlets. in the regime with no phaseseparation, we give evidence for fractional quantum hall states. most notably,we find two distinct singlet states at the filling nu =2/3 for differentinteractions. one of these states is accounted for by the composite fermiontheory while the other one is a paired state for which we identify twocompeting descriptions with different topological structure. this paired statemay be an abelian liquid of composite spin-singlet bose molecules with laughlincorrelations. alternatively, it may be a known non-abelian paired state,indicated by good overlaps with the corresponding trial wavefunction. by finetuning of the scattering lengths it is possible to create the non-abeliancritical haldane-rezayi state for nu =1/2 and the permanent state of moore andread for nu =1. for purely repulsive interactions, we also find evidence for agapped halperin state at nu=2/5.

astro-ph;0211444	the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae as a function of host galaxy  morphology	(abridged) we present new results on the hubble diagram of distant type iasupernovae (sne ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. this makesit possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitlycomparing sne residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with thelarger sample. the cosmological parameters derived from these sne ia hosted bypresumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for acosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and theinternal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (a_b&lt;0.2).thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely tosystematically dim distant sne ia in a manner that would produce a spuriouscosmological constant. we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant snediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) using the combination ofhst stis imaging, keck esi spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.we compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 sne ia. the scatter observed in thesne ia hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. we findthe scatter in the sne ia hubble diagram is smallest for sne occurring inearly-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.moreover, sne residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 magbrighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those inlate-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in thelate-type systems.

astro-ph;0309368	new constraints on $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from an  independent set of eleven high-redshift supernovae observed with hst	we report measurements of $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from elevensupernovae at z=0.36-0.86 with high-quality lightcurves measured using wfpc-2on the hst. this is an independent set of high-redshift supernovae thatconfirms previous supernova evidence for an accelerating universe. combinedwith earlier supernova cosmology project data, the new supernovae yield aflat-universe measurement of the mass density $\omega_m=0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$(statistical) $\pm0.04$ (identified systematics), or equivalently, acosmological constant of $\omega_\lambda=0.75^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ (statistical)$\pm0.04$ (identified systematics). when the supernova results are combinedwith independent flat-universe measurements of $\omega_m$ from cmb and galaxyredshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of$w=-1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ (statistical) $\pm0.09$ (identified systematic), if wis assumed to be constant in time. the new data offer greatly improved colormeasurements of the high-redshift supernovae, and hence improved host-galaxyextinction estimates. these extinction measurements show no anomalous negativee(b-v) at high redshift. the precision of the measurements is such that it ispossible to perform a host-galaxy extinction correction directly for individualsupernovae without any assumptions or priors on the parent e(b-v) distribution.our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that darkenergy is required with $p(\omega_\lambda&gt;0)&gt;0.99$, a result consistent withprevious and current supernova analyses which rely upon the identification of alow-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinctiondistribution.

astro-ph;0605455	rates and properties of type ia supernovae as a function of mass and  star-formation in their host galaxies	(abridged) we show that type ia supernovae (sne ia) are formed within bothvery young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on thestellar mass and mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of their host galaxies.models where the sn ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass areruled out with 99% confidence. our analysis is based on 100spectroscopically-confirmed sne ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,all from the supernova legacy survey (snls) and distributed over 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.75.using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and sfrs for the sn iahost galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions withthe galaxy spectral synthesis code, pegase.2. we show that the sn ia rate perunit mass is proportional to the specific sfr of the parent galaxies -- morevigorously star-forming galaxies host more sne ia per unit stellar mass,broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing sn ia rate in later-type galaxiesseen in the local universe. following earlier suggestions for a simple"two-component" model approximating the sn ia rate, we find bivariate lineardependencies of the sn ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean sfrs ofthe host systems. we also demonstrate a dependence of distant sn ia light-curveshapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observedlocally. passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially hostfaster-declining/dimmer sne ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are onlyfound in systems with ongoing star-formation. we model the light-curve widthdistribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and anold component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.

0809.4407	photometry assisted spectral extraction (phase) and identification of  snls supernovae	aim: we present new extraction and identification techniques for supernova(sn) spectra developed within the supernova legacy survey (snls) collaboration.  method: the new spectral extraction method takes full advantage ofphotometric information from the canada-france-hawai telescope (cfht) discoveryand reference images by tracing the exact position of the supernova and thehost signals on the spectrogram. when present, the host spatial profile ismeasured on deep multi-band reference images and is used to model the hostcontribution to the full (supernova + host) signal. the supernova is modelledas a gaussian function of width equal to the seeing. a chi-square minimisationprovides the flux of each component in each pixel of the 2d spectrogram. for ahost-supernova separation greater than &lt;~ 1 pixel, the two components arerecovered separately and we do not use a spectral template in contrast to morestandard analyses. this new procedure permits a clean extraction of thesupernova separately from the host in about 70% of the 3rd year eso/vlt spectraof the snls. a new supernova identification method is also proposed. it usesthe salt2 spectrophotometric template to combine the photometric and spectraldata. a galaxy template is allowed for spectra for which a separate extractionof the supernova and the host was not possible.  result: these new techniques have been tested against more standardextraction and identification procedures. they permit a secure type andredshift determination in about 80% of cases. the present paper illustratestheir performances on a few sample spectra.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.

0810.5129	dark energy constraints and correlations with systematics from cfhtls  weak lensing, snls supernovae ia and wmap5	we combine measurements of weak gravitational lensing from the cfhtls-widesurvey, supernovae ia from cfht snls and cmb anisotropies from wmap5 to obtainjoint constraints on cosmological parameters, in particular, the dark energyequation of state parameter w. we assess the influence of systematics in thedata on the results and look for possible correlations with cosmologicalparameters.  we implement an mcmc algorithm to sample the parameter space of a flat cdmmodel with a dark-energy component of constant w. systematics in the data areparametrised and included in the analysis. we determine the influence ofphotometric calibration of snia data on cosmological results by calculating theresponse of the distance modulus to photometric zero-point variations. the weaklensing data set is tested for anomalous field-to-field variations and asystematic shape measurement bias for high-z galaxies.  ignoring photometric uncertainties for snls biases cosmological parameters byat most 20% of the statistical errors, using supernovae only; the parameteruncertainties are underestimated by 10%. the weak lensing field-to-fieldvariance pointings is 5%-15% higher than that predicted from n-bodysimulations. we find no bias of the lensing signal at high redshift, within theframework of a simple model. assuming a systematic underestimation of thelensing signal at high redshift, the normalisation sigma_8 increases by up to8%. combining all three probes we obtain -0.10&lt;1+w&lt;0.06 at 68% confidence(-0.18&lt;1+w&lt;0.12 at 95%), including systematic errors. systematics in the dataincrease the error bars by up to 35%; the best-fit values change by less than0.15sigma.
