0906.1394	discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highly magnetic rrat  j1819-1458	we report on the discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highmagnetic field rotating radio transient j1819-1458. using a 30ks chandra acis-sobservation, we found significant evidence for extended x-ray emission with apeculiar shape: a compact region out to 5.5", and more diffuse emissionextending out to ~13" from the source. the most plausible interpretation is anebula somehow powered by the pulsar, although the small number of countsprevents a conclusive answer on the nature of this emission. rrat j1819-1458'sspin-down energy loss rate (edot~3x10^{32} erg/s) is much lower than that ofother pulsars with observed spin-down powered pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), andimplies a rather high x-ray efficiency of eta_{x} = l_(pwn; 0.5-8kev)/edot~0.2at converting spin-down power into the pwn x-ray emission. this suggests theneed of an additional source of energy rather than the spin-down power alone,such as the high magnetic energy of this source. furthermore, this chandraobservation allowed us to refine the positional accuracy of rrat j1819-1458 toa radius of ~0.3", and confirms the presence of x-ray pulsations and the ~1kevabsorption line, previously observed in the x-ray emission of this source.

0907.0054	new limits on radio emission from x-ray dim isolated neutron stars	we have carried out a search for radio emission at 820 mhz from six x-ray dimisolated neutron stars with the robert c. byrd green bank radio telescope. notransient or pulsed emission was found using fast folding, fast fouriertransform, and single-pulse searches. the corresponding flux limits are about0.01 mjy for pulsed emission, depending on the integration time for theparticular source and assuming a duty cycle of 2%, and 20 mjy for singledispersed pulses. these are the most sensitive limits to date on radio emissionfrom x-ray dim isolated neutron stars. there is no evidence for isolated radiopulses, as seen in a class of neutron stars known as rotating radio transients.our results imply that either the radio luminosities of these objects are lowerthan those of any known radio pulsars, or they could simply be long-periodnearby radio pulsars with high magnetic fields beaming away from the earth. totest the latter possibility, we would need around 40 similar sources to providea 1 sigma probability of at least one of them beaming toward us. we also give adetailed description of our implementation of the fast folding algorithm.

0908.3813	timing observations of rotating radio transients	we present radio timing measurements of six rotating radio transient (rrat)sources discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey. these provide fournew phase-connected timing solutions and two updated ones, making a total ofseven of the original 11 reported rrats now with high-precision rotational andastrometric parameters. three of these seven rrats have magnetic fields greaterthan 10^13 g, with spin-down properties similar to those of the magnetars andx-ray detected isolated neutron stars. another two of these rrats have longperiods and large characteristic ages, and lie near the `death-line' for radiopulsar emission. the remaining two rrats with timing solutions have propertiestypical of the bulk of the pulsar population. the new solutions offer insightsinto what might be responsible for the unusual emission properties. wedemonstrate that the rrats have significantly longer periods and highermagnetic fields than normal radio pulsars, and find no correlation with otherspin-down parameters. these solutions also provide precise positions, whichwill facilitate follow-up studies at high energies, crucial for relating thesesources with other neutron star populations.

0908.3819	upper limits on x-ray emission from two rotating radio transients	x-ray emission from the enigmatic rotating radio transients (rrats) offers avital clue to understanding these objects and how they relate to the greaterneutron star population. an x-ray counterpart to j1819-1458 is known, and itsproperties are similar to those of other middle-aged (0.1 myr) neutron stars.we have searched for x-ray emission with chandra/acis at the positions of tworrats with arcsecond (or better) localisation, j0847-4316 and j1846-0257.despite deep searches (especially for j1847-0257) we did not detect anyemission with 0.3-8 kev count-rate limits of 1 counts/ks and 0.068 counts/ks,respectively, at 3sigma confidence. assuming thermal emission similar to thatseen from j1819-1458 (a blackbody with radius of approximately 20 km), wederive effective temperature limits of 77 ev and 91 ev for the nominal valuesof the distances and column densities to both sources, although both of thosequantities are highly uncertain and correlated. if we instead fix thetemperature of the emission (a blackbody with kt=0.14 kev), we deriveunabsorbed luminosity limits in the 0.3-8 kev range of 1e32 erg/s and 3e32erg/s. these limits are considerably below the luminosity of j1819-1458 (4e33erg/s), suggesting that rrats j0847-4316 and j1846-0257 have cooled beyond thepoint of visibility (plausible given the differences in characteristic age).however, as we have not detected x-ray emission, it may also be that theemission from rrats j0847-4316 and j1846-0257 has a different character fromthat of j1819-1458. the two non-detections may prove a counterpoint toj1819-1458, but more detections are certainly needed before we can begin toderive general x-ray emission properties for the rrat populations.

0912.3944	constraining pulsar emission physics through radio/gamma-ray correlation  of crab giant pulses	to constrain the giant pulse (gp) emission mechanism and test the model oflyutikov (2007) of gp emission, we are carrying out a campaign of simultaneousobservations of the crab pulsar between gamma-rays (fermi) and radiowavelengths. the correlation between times of arrival of radio gps andhigh-energy photons, whether it exists or not, will allow us to choose betweendifferent origins of gp emission and further constrain the emission physics.our foremost goal was testing whether radio gps are due to changes in thecoherence of the radio emission mechanism, variations in the pair creation ratein the pulsar magnetosphere, or changes in the beaming direction. accomplishingthis goal requires an enormous number of simultaneous radio gps andgamma-photons. thus, we organized a radio observations campaign using the 42-fttelescope at the jodrell bank observatory (uk), the 140-ft telescope, and the100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope (gbt) at the green bank observatory(wv). while the observations with the two first ones are ongoing, here wepresent the preliminary results of 20 hrs of observations with the gbt at thehigh frequency of 8.9 ghz. these particular observations were aimed to probethe model of gp emission by lyutikov (2007) which predicts that gps atfrequencies &gt; 4 ghz should be accompanied by gamma-ray photons of energies of1-100 gev.

1001.1483	observations and modelling of relativistic spin precession in psr  j1141-6545	observations of the binary pulsar psr j1141-6545 using the parkes radiotelescope over 9.3 years show clear time-variations in pulse width, shape andpolarization. we interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precessionof the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.over the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more thana factor of three. large variations have also been observed in the 1400-mhzmean flux density. the pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 aprilusing digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variationsin both linear and circular polarization. position angle variations, bothacross the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with majordifferences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. modellingof the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of thepulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 degand that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course ofour observations. at the start of our observations, the line-of-sight impactparameter was about 4 deg in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to 0deg around early 2007, consistent with the observed pulse width variations. wehave therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam, showing thatit is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis. the derivedprecessional parameters imply that the pre-supernova star had a mass of about 2msun and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small. with thereversal in the rate of change of the impact parameter, we predict that overthe next decade we will see a reversed "replay" of the variations observed inthe past decade.

0708.1149	discovery of pulsations and a possible spectral feature in the x-ray  emission from rotating radio transient j1819-1458	psr j1819-1458 is a rotating radio transient (rrat) source with an inferredsurface dipole magnetic field strength of 5e13 g and a 4.26-s spin period. wepresent xmm-newton observations of the x-ray counterpart of this source, cxouj181939.1-145804, in which we identify pulsations and a possible spectralfeature. the x-ray pulsations are at the period predicted by the radioephemeris, providing an unambiguous identification with the radio source andconfirmation of its neutron star nature. the x-ray pulse has a 0.3-5 kev pulsedfraction of 34% and is aligned with the expected phase of the radio pulse. thex-ray spectrum is fit well by an absorbed blackbody with kt = 0.14 kev with theaddition of an absorption feature at 1 kev, with total absorbed flux of 1.5e-13ergs/cm^2/s (0.3-5 kev). this absorption feature is well modeled by a gaussianor resonant cyclotron scattering model, but its significance is dependent onthe choice of continuum model. we find no evidence for any x-ray bursts oraperiodic variability on timescales of 6 ms to the duration of the observationand can place the most stringent limit to date of &lt; 3e-9 ergs/cm^2/s on theabsorbed 0.3-5 kev flux of any bursts.

1009.5873	a 6.5-ghz multibeam pulsar survey	a survey of the galactic plane in the region $-60\degree \leq l \leq30\degree$, $|b| \leq 0.25\degree$ was carried out using the seven-beam parkesmethanol multibeam (mmb) receiver, which operates at a frequency of 6.5 ghz.three pulsars were discovered, and 16 previously known pulsars detected. inthis paper we present two previously-unpublished discoveries, both withextremely high dispersion measures, one of which is very close, in angulardistance, to the galactic centre. the survey data also contain the first knowndetection, at radio frequencies, of the radio magnetar psr j1550-5418. oursurvey observation was made 46 days prior to that previously published andplaces constraints on the beginning of pulsed radio emission from the source.  the detection of only three previously undiscovered pulsars argues that thereare few pulsars in the direction of the inner galaxy whose flux densityspectrum is governed by a flat power law. however, these pulsars would belikely to remain undetected at lower frequencies due to the large amount ofscatter broadening which affects pulsars with high values of dispersionmeasure. surveys with future telescopes at high observing frequencies will,therefore, play an important role in the discovery of pulsars at the galacticcentre. by simulating pulsar surveys of the galaxy with phase 1 ska atfrequencies of 1.4 ghz and 10 ghz, we find that high-frequency observations arethe only way to discover and observe the galactic-centre pulsar population.

1011.5809	on the nature and evolution of the unique binary pulsar j1903+0327	(abridged) psr j1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e = 0.44)95-day orbit with a (~ 1msun) companion poses a challenge to our understandingof stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. here we describeoptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed toexplain formation of this system. radio timing measurements of threepost-keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of amillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidencelimit) (...). optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart showthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore itsbinary companion (...) the optical detection also provides a measurement of thesystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measuredfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in thegalaxy. we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of thegalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre. thus anexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster orthe galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. we suggestthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbitwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion,forming a millisecond pulsar. the former donor star then disappears, either dueto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion ofthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case ofa very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formedmillisecond pulsar.

1101.1434	correlation of fermi photons with high-frequency radio giant pulses from  the crab pulsar	to constrain the giant pulse (gp) emission mechanism and test the model oflyutikov (2007) for gp emission, we have carried out a campaign of simultaneousobservations of the crab pulsar at gamma-ray (fermi) and radio (green banktelescope) wavelengths. over 10 hours of simultaneous observations we obtaineda sample of 2.1x10^4 giant pulses, observed at a radio frequency of 9 ghz, and77 fermi photons, with energies between 100 mev and 5 gev. the majority of gpscame from the interpulse (ip) phase window. we found no change in the gpgeneration rate within 10-120 s windows at lags of up to +-40 min of observedgamma-ray photons. the 95% upper limit for a gamma-ray flux enhancement inpulsed emission phase window around all gps is 4 times the average pulsedgamma-ray flux from the crab. for the subset of ip gps, the enhancement upperlimit, within the ip emission window, is 12 times the average pulsed gamma-rayflux. these results suggest that gps, at least high-frequency ip gps, are dueto changes in coherence of radio emission rather than an overall increase inthe magnetospheric particle density.

1107.4014	the impact of a stochastic gravitational-wave background on pulsar  timing parameters	gravitational waves are predicted by einstein's theory of general relativityas well as other theories of gravity. the rotational stability of the fastestpulsars means that timing of an array of these objects can be used to detectand investigate gravitational waves. simultaneously, however, pulsar timing isused to estimate spin period, period derivative, astrometric, and binaryparameters. here we calculate the effects that a stochastic background ofgravitational waves has on pulsar timing parameters through the use ofsimulations and data from the millisecond pulsars psr j0437--4715 and psrj1713+0747. we show that the reported timing uncertainties becomeunderestimated with increasing background amplitude by up to a factor of$\sim10$ for a stochastic gravitational-wave background amplitude of $a=5\times10^{-15}$, where $a$ is the amplitude of the characteristic strain spectrum atone-year gravitational wave periods. we find evidence for prominentlow-frequency spectral leakage in simulated data sets including a stochasticgravitational-wave background. we use these simulations along with independentvery long baseline interferometry (vlbi) measurements of parallax to set a2--sigma upper limit of $a\le9.1\times 10^{-14}$. we find that differentsupermassive black hole assembly scenarios do not have a significant effect onthe calculated upper limits. we also test the effects that ultralow--frequency(10$^{-12}$--10$^{-9}$ hz) gravitational waves have on binary pulsar parametermeasurements and find that the corruption of these parameters is less thanthose due to $10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$ hz gravitational waves.

1202.0808	practical methods for continuous gravitational wave detection using  pulsar timing data	gravitational waves (gws) are tiny ripples in the fabric of space-timepredicted by einstein's general relativity. pulsar timing arrays (ptas) arewell poised to detect low frequency ($10^{-9}$ -- $10^{-7}$ hz) gws in the nearfuture. there has been a significant amount of research into the detection of astochastic background of gws from supermassive black hole binaries (smbhbs).recent work has shown that single continuous sources standing out above thebackground may be detectable by ptas operating at a sensitivity sufficient todetect the stochastic background. the most likely sources of continuous gws inthe pulsar timing frequency band are extremely massive and/or nearby smbhbs. inthis paper we present detection strategies including various forms of matchedfiltering and power spectral summing. we determine the efficacy andcomputational cost of such strategies. it is shown that it is computationallyinfeasible to use an optimal matched filter including the poorly constrainedpulsar distances with a grid based method. we show that an earth-term-matchedfilter constructed using only the correlated signal terms is bothcomputationally viable and highly sensitive to gw signals. this technique isonly a factor of two less sensitive than the computationally unrealizableoptimal matched filter and a factor of two more sensitive than a power spectralsumming technique. we further show that a pairwise matched filter, taking thepulsar distances into account is comparable to the optimal matched filter forthe single template case and comparable to the earth-term-matched filter formany search templates. finally, using simulated data optimal quality, we placea theoretical minimum detectable strain amplitude of $h&gt;2\times 10^{-15}$ fromcontinuous gws at frequencies on the order $\sim1/t_{\rm obs}$.

1208.1228	two millisecond pulsars discovered by the palfa survey and a shapiro  delay measurement	we present two millisecond pulsar discoveries from the palfa survey of thegalactic plane with the arecibo telescope. psr j1955+2527 is an isolated pulsarwith a period of 4.87 ms, and psr j1949+3106 has a period of 13.14 ms and is ina 1.9-day binary system with a massive companion. their timing solutions, basedon 4 years of timing measurements with the arecibo, green bank, nan\c{c}ay andjodrell bank telescopes, allow precise determination of spin and astrometricparameters, including precise determinations of their proper motions. for psrj1949+3106, we can clearly detect the shapiro delay. from this we measure thepulsar mass to be 1.47(+0.43/-0.31) solar masses, the companion mass to be0.85(+0.14/-0.11) solar masses and the orbital inclination to be i =79.9(+1.6/-1.9) degrees, where uncertainties correspond to +/- 1-\sigma\confidence levels. with continued timing, we expect to also be able to detectthe advance of periastron for the j1949+3106 system. this effect, combined withthe shapiro delay, will eventually provide very precise mass measurements forthis system and a test of general relativity.

1208.1273	four highly dispersed millisecond pulsars discovered in the arecibo  palfa galactic plane survey	we present the discovery and phase-coherent timing of four highly dispersedmillisecond pulsars (msps) from the arecibo palfa galactic plane survey: psrsj1844+0115, j1850+0124, j1900+0308, and j1944+2236. three of the four pulsarsare in binary systems with low-mass companions, which are most likely whitedwarfs, and which have orbital periods on the order of days. the fourth pulsaris isolated. all four pulsars have large dispersion measures (dm &gt; 100 pccm-3), are distant (&gt; 3.4 kpc), faint at 1.4 ghz (&lt; 0.2 mjy), and are fullyrecycled (with spin periods p between 3.5 and 4.9 ms). the three binaries alsohave very small orbital eccentricities, as expected for tidally circularized,fully recycled systems with low-mass companions. these four pulsars have dm/pratios that are among the highest values for field msps in the galaxy. thesediscoveries bring the total number of confirmed msps from the palfa survey tofifteen. the discovery of these msps illustrates the power of palfa for findingweak, distant msps at low-galactic latitudes. this is important for accurateestimates of the galactic msp population and for the number of msps that thesquare kilometer array can be expected to detect.

1208.6576	radio and x-ray observations of the intermittent pulsar j1832+0029	we report on radio and x-ray observations of psr 1832+0029, a 533-ms radiopulsar discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey. from radioobservations taken with the parkes, lovell and arecibo telescopes, we show thatthis pulsar exhibits two spindown states akin to psrs b1931+24 reported bykramer et al. and j1841-0500 reported by camilo et al. unlike psr b1931+24,which switches between "on" and "off" states on a 30--40 day time-scale, psr1832+0029 is similar to psr j1841-0500 in that it spends a much longer periodof time in the off-state. so far, we have fully sampled two off-states. thefirst one lasted between 560 and 640 days and the second one lasted between 810and 835 days. from our radio timing observations, the ratio of on/off spindownrates is $1.77 \pm 0.03$. chandra observations carried out during both the on-and off-states of this pulsar failed to detect any emission. our resultschallenge but do not rule out models involving accretion onto the neutron starfrom a low-mass stellar companion. in spite of the small number of intermittentpulsars currently known, difficulties in discovering them and in quantifyingtheir behavior imply that their total population could be substantial.

1302.1790	discovery of the optical counterparts to four energetic fermi  millisecond pulsars	in the last few years, over 43 millisecond radio pulsars have been discoveredby targeted searches of unidentified gamma-ray sources found by the fermigamma-ray space telescope. a large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are incompact binaries with low-mass companions. these systems often show eclipses ofthe pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks becausethe pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. in this paper, we report onthe optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsarcompanions. all four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity atthe known orbital periods from radio timing. light curve modelling of ourexploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on thecompanion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about10-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed toincrease the companion's dayside temperature. this value compares well with therange observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights aboutthe energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. inaddition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiatedpulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. our analysis alsosuggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are onlypartially filling their roche lobe. some of these sources are relatively brightand represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. these measurementscould enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars inthese systems.

1302.2914	the double pulsar: evidence for neutron star formation without an iron  core-collapse supernova	the double pulsar system psr j0737-3039a/b is a double neutron star binary,with a 2.4-hour orbital period, which has allowed measurement of relativisticorbital perturbations to high precision. the low mass of the second-formedneutron star, as well as the low system eccentricity and proper motion, pointto a different evolutionary scenario compared to most other known doubleneutron star systems. we describe analysis of the pulse profile shape over 6years of observations, and present the resulting constraints on the systemgeometry. we find the recycled pulsar in this system, psr j0737-3039a, to be anear-orthogonal rotator, with an average separation between its spin andmagnetic axes of 90 +/- 11 +/- 5 deg. furthermore, we find a mean 95% upperlimit on the misalignment between its spin and orbital angular momentum axes of3.2 deg, assuming that the observed emission comes from both magnetic poles.this tight constraint lends credence to the idea that the supernova that formedthe second pulsar was relatively symmetric, possibly involving electron-captureonto an o-ne-mg core.

1305.4865	vlbi astrometry of psr j2222-0137: a pulsar distance measured to 0.4%  accuracy	the binary pulsar j2222-0137 is an enigmatic system containing a partiallyrecycled millisecond pulsar and a companion of unknown nature. whilst the loweccentricity of the system favors a white dwarf companion, an unusual doubleneutron star system is also a possibility, and optical observations will beable to distinguish between these possibilities. in order to allow the absoluteluminosity (or upper limit) of the companion object to be properly calibrated,we undertook astrometric observations with the very long baseline array toconstrain the system distance via a measurement of annual geometric parallax.with these observations, we measure the parallax of the j2222-0137 system to be3.742 +0.013 -0.016 milliarcseconds, yielding a distance of 267.3 +1.2 -0.9 pc,and measure the transverse velocity to be 57.1 +0.3 -0.2 km/s. fixing theseparameters in the pulsar timing model made it possible to obtain a measurementof shapiro delay and hence the system inclination, which shows that the systemis nearly edge-on (sin i = 0.9985 +/- 0.0005). furthermore, we were able todetect the orbital motion of j2222-0137 in our vlbi observations and measurethe longitude of ascending node. the vlbi astrometry yields the most accuratedistance obtained for a radio pulsar to date, and is furthermore the mostaccurate parallax for any radio source obtained at "low" radio frequencies(below ~5 ghz, where the ionosphere dominates the error budget). using theastrometric results, we show the companion to j2222-0137 will be easilydetectable in deep optical observations if it is a white dwarf. finally, wediscuss the implications of this measurement for future ultra-high-precisionastrometry, in particular in support of pulsar timing arrays.

1307.1200	on the detectability of extragalactic fast radio transients	recent discoveries of highly dispersed millisecond radio bursts by thorntonet al. in a survey with the parkes radio telescope at 1.4 ghz point towards anemerging population of sources at cosmological distances whose origin iscurrently unclear. here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lowerradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts couldbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 ghz. using asource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometricluminosities $\sim 8 \times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unitcomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density asa function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found bythornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate andredshift probed by a given survey. the non-detection of any such events inarecibo 1.4 ghz survey data by deneva et al., and the allen telescope arraysurvey by simeon et al. is consistent with our model. ongoing surveys in the1--2 ghz band should result in further discoveries. at lower frequencies,assuming a typical radio spectral index $\alpha=-1.4$, the predicted peak fluxdensities are 10s of jy. as a result, surveys of such a population with currentfacilities would not necessarily be sensitivity limited and could be carriedout with small arrays to maximize the sky coverage. we predict that sources mayalready be present in 350-mhz surveys with the green bank telescope. surveys at150 mhz with 30 deg$^2$ fields of view could detect one source per hour above30 jy.

1308.4956	psr j1723-2837: an eclipsing binary radio millisecond pulsar	we present a study of psr j1723-2837, an eclipsing, 1.86 ms millisecondbinary radio pulsar discovered in the parkes multibeam survey. radio timingindicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, alow-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. the eclipsefraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the roche lobe sizeinferred for the companion. the timing behavior is significantly affected byunmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital periodderivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations.we have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archivalultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry.doppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association withthe pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.5,corresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 msun and an orbitalinclination angle range of between 30 and 41 degrees, assuming a pulsar massrange of 1.4-2.0 msun. spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of g for thecompanion and an inferred roche-lobe-filling distance that is consistent withthe distance estimated from radio dispersion. the features of psr j1723-2837indicate that it is likely a "redback" system. unlike the five other galacticredbacks discovered to date, psr j1723-2837 has not been detected as agamma-ray source with fermi. this may be due to an intrinsic spin-downluminosity that is much smaller than the measured value if the unmeasuredcontribution from proper motion is large.

1309.0776	searching for pulsars using image pattern recognition	in this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (ai) program thatidentifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition withdeep neural nets---the pics (pulsar image-based classification system) ai. theai mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferencesby looking for patterns from candidate. the information from each pulsarcandidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up tothousands pixel of image data. the ai takes these data from each candidate asits input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,the pics ai teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a setof human-labeled candidates through machine learning. the deep neural networksin this ai system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types ofpulsars as well as their harmonic signals. the trained ai's performance hasbeen validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.in this completely independent test, pics ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-relatedcandidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. the first non-pulsarcandidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. in otherwords, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. the performance of thissystem can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. this aisystem has been integrated into the palfa survey pipeline and has discoveredsix new pulsars to date.

1309.1982	modeling the non-recycled fermi gamma-ray pulsar population	we use fermi gamma-ray space telescope detections and upper limits onnon-recycled pulsars obtained from the large area telescope (lat) to constrainhow the gamma-ray luminosity l depends on the period p and the periodderivative \dot{p}. we use a bayesian analysis to calculate a best-fitluminosity law, or dependence of l on p and \dot{p}, including differentmethods for modeling the beaming factor. an outer gap (og) magnetospheregeometry provides the best-fit model, which is l \propto p^{-a} \dot{p}^{b}where a=1.36\pm0.03 and b=0.44\pm0.02, similar to but not identical to thecommonly assumed l \propto \sqrt{\dot{e}} \propto p^{-1.5} \dot{p}^{0.5}. givenupper limits on gamma-ray fluxes of currently known radio pulsars and using theog model, we find that about 92% of the radio-detected pulsars have gamma-raybeams that intersect our line of sight. by modeling the misalignment of radioand gamma-ray beams of these pulsars, we find an average gamma-ray beamingsolid angle of about 3.7{\pi} for the og model, assuming a uniform beam. usinglat-measured diffuse fluxes, we place a 2{\sigma} upper limit on the averagebraking index and a 2{\sigma} lower limit on the average surface magnetic fieldstrength of the pulsar population of 3.8 and 3.2 x 10^{10} g, respectively. wethen predict the number of non-recycled pulsars detectable by the lat based onour population model. using the two-year sensitivity, we find that the lat iscapable of detecting emission from about 380 non-recycled pulsars, including150 currently identified radio pulsars. using the expected five-yearsensitivity, about 620 non-recycled pulsars are detectable, including about 220currently identified radio pulsars. we note that these predictionssignificantly depend on our model assumptions.

1401.0535	a millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system	gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds ofyears and are common in our galaxy. they show complex orbital interactions,which can constrain the compositions, masses, and interior structures of thebodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements areavailable. a triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide suchmeasurements, but the only previously known such system, b1620-26 (with amillisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit ofseveral decades), shows only weak interactions. here we report precision timingand multi-wavelength observations of psr j0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in ahierarchical triple system with two other stars. strong gravitationalinteractions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13)msun, where msun is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertaintyin the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)msun and 0.4101(3) msun), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (bothapproximately 39.2 degrees). the unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circularorbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from thoseof known stellar systems. the gravitational field of the outer white dwarfstrongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and thesystem will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strongequivalence principle of general relativity.

1404.1120	interstellar scintillation of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039	we report here a series of observations of the interstellar scintillation(iss) of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039 over the course of 18 months. as inearlier work (coles et al., 2005) the basic phenomenon is the variation in theiss caused by the changing transverse velocities of each pulsar, the ionizedinterstellar medium (iism), and the earth. the transverse velocity of thebinary system can be determined both by vlbi and timing observations. theorbital velocity and inclination is almost completely determined from timingobservations, but the direction of the orbital angular momentum is not known.since the earth's velocity is known, and can be compared with the orbitalvelocity by its effect on the timescale of the iss, we can determine theorientation $\omega$ of the pulsar orbit with respect to equatorial coordinates($\omega = 65\pm2$ deg). we also resolve the ambiguity ($i= 88.7$ or $91.3$deg) in the inclination of the orbit deduced from the measured shapiro delay byour estimate $i=88.1\pm0.5$ deg. this relies on analysis of the iss over bothfrequency and time and provides a model for the location, anisotropy,turbulence level and transverse phase gradient of the iism. we find that theiism can be well-modeled during each observation, typically of a few orbitalperiods, but its turbulence level and mean velocity vary significantly over the18 months.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1405.7953	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iii. precursor survey and population  synthesis	the pulsar arecibo l-band feed array (palfa) survey uses the alfa 7-beamreceiver to search both inner and outer galactic sectors visible from arecibo($32^{\circ}\lesssim \ell \lesssim 77^{\circ}$ and $168^{\circ}\lesssim \ell  \lesssim 214^{\circ}$) close to the galactic plane ($|b|\lesssim5^{\circ}$)for pulsars. in this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region withpalfa, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in$\ell$ and $|b|\lesssim1^{\circ}$) and detected 45 pulsars. for both galacticmillisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detectionswith simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate thenumber of observable pulsars in the galaxy. we place 95\% confidence intervalsof 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9,000 to100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk.these are consistent with previous estimates. given the most likely populationsize in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars,respectively) we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, whencomplete, the full palfa survey should have detected $1,000\substack{+330 \\-230}$ normal pulsars and $30\substack{+200 \\ -20}$ millisecond pulsars.identical estimation techniques predict that $490\substack{+160 \\ -115}$normal pulsars and $12\substack{+70 \\ -5}$ millisecond pulsars would bedetected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the palfa survey had detected283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively.

astro-ph;0312071	an increased estimate of the merger rate of double neutron stars from  observations of a highly relativistic system	the merger of close binary systems containing two neutron stars shouldproduce a burst of gravitational waves, as predicted by the theory of generalrelativity. a reliable estimate of the double-neutron-star merger rate in thegalaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectorswill be successful in detecting such bursts. present estimates of this rate arerather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries withmerger times less than the age of the universe. here we report the discovery ofa 22-ms pulsar, psr j0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativisticdouble-neutron-star binary with an orbital period of 2.4 hours. this systemwill merge in about 85 myr, a time much shorter than for any other knownneutron-star binary. together with the relatively low radio luminosity of psrj0737-3039, this timescale implies an order-of-magnitude increase in thepredicted merger rate for double-neutron-star systems in our galaxy (and in therest of the universe).

astro-ph;0312101	the cosmic coalescence rates for double neutron star binaries	this manuscript is an updated version of kalogera et al. (2004) published inapj letters to correct our calculation of the galactic dns in-spiral rate. thedetails of the original erratum submitted to apj letters are given in page 6 ofthis manuscript.  we report on the newly increased event rates due to the recent discovery ofthe highly relativistic binary pulsar j0737--3039 (burgay et al. 2003). using arigorous statistical method, we present the calculations reported by burgay etal., which produce a in-spiral rate for galactic double neutron star (dns)systems that is higher by a factor of 5-7 compared to estimates made prior tothe new discovery. our method takes into account known pulsar-survey selectioneffects and biases due to small-number statistics. this rate increase hasdramatic implications for gravitational wave detectors. for the initial laserinterferometer gravitational-wave observatory (ligo) detectors, the mostprobable detection rates for dns in-spirals are one event per 10-630 yr; at 95%confidence, we obtain rates up to one per 3 yr. for the advanced ligodetectors, the most probable rates are 10-500 events per year. thesepredictions, for the first time, bring the expectations for dns detections bythe initial ligo detectors to the astrophysically relevant regime. we also useour models to predict that the large-scale parkes multibeam pulsar survey withacceleration searches could detect an average of four binary pulsars similar tothose known at present.

astro-ph;0405364	the parkes multibeam pulsar survey: iv. discovery of 180 pulsars and  parameters for 281 previously known pulsars	the parkes multibeam pulsar survey has led to the discovery of more than 700pulsars. in this paper, we provide timing solutions, flux densities and pulseprofiles for 180 of these new discoveries. two pulsars, psrs j1736-2843 andj1847-0130 have rotational periods p &gt; 6s and are therefore among the slowestrotating radio pulsars known. conversely, with p = 1.8ms, psr j1843-1113 hasthe third shortest period of pulsars currently known. this pulsar and psrj1905+0400 (p = 3.8ms) are both solitary. we also provide orbital parametersfor a new binary system, psr j1420-5625, which has p = 34ms, an orbital periodof 40 days and a minimum companion mass of 0.4 solar masses. the 10 degree-widestrip along the galactic plane that was surveyed is known to contain 264 radiopulsars that were discovered prior to the multibeam pulsar survey. we haveredetected almost all of these pulsars and provide new dispersion measurevalues and flux densities at 20cm for the redetected pulsars.

astro-ph;0408228	the parkes multibeam pulsar survey: v. finding binary and millisecond  pulsars	the parkes multibeam pulsar survey is the most successful survey of thegalactic plane ever performed, finding over 600 pulsars in the initialprocessing. we report on reprocessing of all 40,000 beams with a number ofalgorithms, including conventional frequency-domain searches and anacceleration search for fast binary pulsars. the very large volume of resultscoupled with the need to distinguish new candidates from known pulsars andtheir many harmonics, often with multiple detections from different searchalgorithms, necessitated the development of a new graphical selection tooltightly linked to a web-based results database. we discuss and demonstrate thebenefits of these software systems which are specifically designed for largesurvey projects. the results of this processing have been encouraging; we havediscovered 128 new pulsars including 11 binary and 15 millisecond pulsars, inaddition to those previously found in the survey, we have thus far discovered737 pulsars. in this paper we discuss the discoveries of psr j1744-3922, a 172ms mildly recycled pulsar in a 4.6 hr orbit that exhibits nulling behaviour,not previously observed in recycled or binary objects; psr j1802-2124, anintermediate mass binary pulsar (imbp) and psr j1801-1417, a solitarymillisecond pulsar.

astro-ph;0409204	probing the eclipse of j0737-3039a with scintillation	we have examined the interstellar scintillations of the pulsars in the doublepulsar binary system. near the time of the eclipse of pulsar a by themagnetosphere of b, the scintillations from both pulsars should be highlycorrelated because the radiation is passing through the same interstellarplasma. we report confirmation of this effect using 820 and 1400 mhzobservations made with the green bank telescope. the correlation allows us toconstrain the projected relative position of the two pulsars at closestapproach to be 4000 +/- 2000 km, corresponding to an inclination that is only0.29 +/-0.14 degrees away from 90 degrees. it also produces a two-dimensionalmap of the spatial correlation of the interstellar scintillation. this showsthat the interstellar medium in the direction of the pulsars is significantlyanisotropic. when this anisotropy is included in the orbital fitting, thetransverse velocity of the center of mass is reduced from the previouslypublished value of 141 +/- 8.5 km/s to 66 +/- 15 km/s.

astro-ph;0410045	the dynamic radio sky	transient radio sources are necessarily compact and usually are the locationsof explosive or dynamic events, therefore offering unique opportunities forprobing fundamental physics and astrophysics. in addition, short-durationtransients are powerful probes of intervening media owing to dispersion,scattering and faraday rotation that modify the signals. while radio astronomyhas an impressive record obtaining high time resolution, usually it is achievedin quite narrow fields of view. consequently, the dynamic radio sky is poorlysampled, in contrast to the situation in the x-ray and gamma-ray bands. the skahas the potential to change this situation, opening up new parameter space inthe search for radio transients. we summarize the wide variety of known andhypothesized radio transients and demonstrate that the ska offers considerablepower in exploring this parameter space. requirements on the ska to search theparameter space include the abilities to (1) make targeted searches usingbeamforming capability; (2) conduct blind, all-sky surveys with dense samplingof the frequency-time plane in wide fields; (3) sample the sky with multiplefields of view from spatially well-separated sites in order to discriminatecelestial and terrestrial signals; (4) utilize as much of the ska's aggregatecollecting area as possible in blind surveys, thus requiring a centrallycondensed configuration; and (5) localize repeating transient sources to highangular precision, requiring a configuration with long baselines, thusrequiring collecting area in both a centrally condensed "core" array andsufficient area on long baselines.

astro-ph;0502393	an expanding radio nebula produced by a giant flare from the magnetar  sgr 1806-20	soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) are "magnetars", a small class of slowly spinningneutron stars with extreme surface magnetic fields, ~10^15 gauss. on 2004december 27, a giant flare was detected from the magnetar sgr 1806-20, thethird such event ever recorded. this burst of energy was detected by a varietyof instruments and even caused an ionospheric disturbance in the earth's upperatmosphere recorded around the globe. here we report the detection of a fadingradio afterglow produced by this outburst, with a luminosity 500 times largerthan the only other detection of a similar source. from day 6 to day 19 afterthe flare from sgr 1806-20, a resolved, linearly polarized, radio nebula wasseen, expanding at approximately a quarter the speed of light. to create thisnebula, at least 4x10^43 ergs of energy must have been emitted by the giantflare in the form of magnetic fields and relativistic particles. thecombination of spatially resolved structure and rapid time evolution allows astudy in unprecedented detail of a nearby analog to supernovae and gamma-raybursts.

astro-ph;0504019	discovery of 10 pulsars in an arecibo drift-scan survey	we present the results of a 430-mhz survey for pulsars conducted during theupgrade to the 305-m arecibo radio telescope. our survey covered a total of1147 square degrees of sky using a drift-scan technique. we detected 33pulsars, 10 of which were not known prior to the survey observations. thehighlight of the new discoveries is psr j0407+1607, which has a spin period of25.7 ms, a characteristic age of 1.5 gyr and is in a 1.8-yr orbit about alow-mass (&gt;0.2 msun) companion. the long orbital period and small eccentricity(e = 0.0009) make the binary system an important new addition to the ensembleof binary pulsars suitable to test for violations of the strong equivalenceprinciple. we also report on our initially unsuccessful attempts to detectoptically the companion to j0407+1607 which imply that its absolute visualmagnitude is &gt; 12.1. if, as expected on evolutionary grounds, the companion isan he white dwarf, our non-detection imples a cooling age of least 1 gyr.

astro-ph;0508320	arecibo timing and single-pulse observations of 17 pulsars	we report on timing and single-pulse observations of 17 pulsars discovered atthe arecibo observatory. the highlights of our sample are the recycled pulsarsj1829+2456, j1944+0907 and the drifting subpulses observed in psr j0815+0939.for the double neutron star binary j1829+2456, in addition to improving uponour existing measurement of relativistic periastron advance, we have nowmeasured the pulsar's spin period derivative. this new result sets an upperlimit on the transverse speed of 120 km/s and a lower limit on thecharacteristic age of 12.4 gyr. from our measurement of proper motion of theisolated 5.2-ms pulsar j1944+0907, we infer a transverse speed of 188 +/- 65km/s. this is higher than that of any other isolated millisecond pulsar. anestimate of the speed, using interstellar scintillation, of 235 +/- 45 km/sindicates that the scattering medium along the line of sight is non-uniform. wediscuss the drifting subpulses detected from three pulsars in the sample, inparticular the remarkable drifting subpulse properties of the 645-ms pulsarj0815+0939. drifting is observed in all four components of the pulse profile,with the sense of drift varying among the different components. this unusual`bi-drifting'' behaviour challenges standard explanations of the driftingsubpulse phenomenon.

astro-ph;0509732	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. i. survey strategy and first  discoveries	we report results from the initial stage of a long-term pulsar survey of thegalactic plane using the arecibo l-band feed array (alfa), a seven-beamreceiver operating at 1.4 ghz with 0.3 ghz bandwidth. the search targetsgalactic latitudes |b| &lt; 5 deg in the longitude ranges 32 deg &lt; l &lt; 77 deg and168 deg &lt; l &lt; 77 deg. data discussed here were collected over a 100 mhzpassband centered on 1.42 ghz using a spectrometer that recorded 256 channelsevery 64 microsec. in a preliminary, standard period-dm analysis, we havedetected 29 previously known pulsars and discovered 11 new ones. one of these,with a period of 69 ms and a low characteristic age of 82 kyr, is a plausiblecandidate for association with the unidentified egret source 3eg j1928+1733.another is a non-recycled pulsar in a relativistic binary with orbital periodof 3.98 hr. we also search the data for isolated dispersed pulses, a techniquethat yielded discovery of an extremely sporadic radio emitter with a spinperiod of 1.2 s. simulations we have carried out indicate that about 1000 newpulsars will be found in the alfa survey. in addition to providing a largesample for use in population analyses and for probing the magnetoionicinterstellar medium, the survey maximizes the chances of finding rapidlyspinning millisecond pulsars and pulsars in compact binary systems. our searchalgorithms will exploit the multiple data streams from alfa to discriminatebetween radio frequency interference and celestial signals, including pulsarsand possibly new classes of transient radio sources.

astro-ph;0511523	the young, highly relativistic binary pulsar j1906+0746	we report the discovery of psr j1906+0746, a young 144-ms pulsar in a highlyrelativistic 3.98-hr orbit with an eccentricity of 0.085 and expectedgravitational wave coalescence time of 300 myr. the new pulsar was found duringprecursor survey observations with the arecibo 1.4-ghz feed array system andretrospectively detected in the parkes multibeam plane pulsar survey data. fromradio follow-up observations with arecibo, jodrell bank, green bank, andparkes, we have measured the spin-down and binary parameters of the pulsar andits basic spectral and polarization properties. we also present evidence forpulse profile evolution, which is likely due to geodetic precession, arelativistic effect caused by the misalignment of the pulsar spin and totalangular momentum vectors. our measurements show that psr j1906+0746 is a youngobject with a characteristic age of 112 kyr. from the measured rate of orbitalperiastron advance 7.57+/-0.03 deg/yr, we infer a total system mass of2.61+/-0.02 msun. while these parameters suggest that the psr j1906+0746 binarysystem might be a younger version of the double pulsar system, intensivesearches for radio pulses from the companion have so far been unsuccessful. itis therefore not known whether the companion is another neutron star or amassive white dwarf. regardless of the nature of the companion, a simplecalculation suggests that the galactic birth rate of binaries similar to psrj1906+0746 is 60/myr. this implies that psr j1906+0746 will make a significantcontribution to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems.

astro-ph;0511587	transient radio bursts from rotating neutron stars	the `radio sky' is relatively unexplored for transient signals, although thepotential of radio-transient searches is high, as demonstrated recently by thediscovery of a previously unknown type of source which varies on timescales ofminutes to hours. here we report a new large-scale search for radio sourcesvarying on much shorter timescales. this has revealed 11 objects characterizedby single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30 ms. the averagetime intervals between bursts range from 4 minutes to 3 hours, with radioemission typically detectable for &lt; 1 s per day. from an analysis of the burstarrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4 - 7 s for tenof the 11 sources, suggesting a rotating neutron star origin. despite the smallnumber of sources presently detected, their ephemeral nature implies a totalgalactic population which significantly exceeds that of the regularly pulsingradio pulsars. five of the ten sources have periods greater than 4 s, andperiod derivatives have been measured for three of the sources, with one havinga very high inferred magnetic field of 5e13 g, suggesting that this newpopulation is related to other classes of isolated neutron stars observed atx-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths.

astro-ph;0607640	the parkes multibeam pulsar survey: vi. discovery and timing of 142  pulsars and a galactic population analysis	[abridged] we present the discovery and follow-up observations of 142 pulsarsfound in the parkes 20-cm multibeam pulsar survey of the galactic plane. thesenew discoveries bring the total number of pulsars found by the survey to 742.in addition to tabulating spin and astrometric parameters, along with pulsewidth and flux density information, we present orbital characteristics for 13binary pulsars which form part of the new sample. combining these results fromanother recent parkes multibeam survey at high galactic latitudes, we have asample of 1008 normal pulsars which we use to carry out a determination oftheir galactic distribution and birth rate. we infer a total galacticpopulation of 30000 +/- 1100 potentially detectable pulsars (i.e. those beamingtowards us) having 1.4-ghz luminosities above 0.1 mjy kpc squared. using apulsar current analysis, we derive the birth rate of this population to be 1.4+/- 0.2 pulsars per century. an important conclusion from our work is that theinferred radial density function of pulsars depends strongly on the assumeddistribution of free electrons in the galaxy. as a result, any analyses usingthe most recent electron model of cordes &amp; lazio predict a dearth of pulsars inthe inner galaxy. we show that this model can also bias the inferred pulsarscale height with respect to the galactic plane. combining our results withother parkes multibeam surveys we find that the population is best described byan exponential distribution with a scale height of 330 pc.

astro-ph;0609417	tests of general relativity from timing the double pulsar	the double pulsar system, psr j0737-3039a/b, is unique in that both neutronstars are detectable as radio pulsars. this, combined with significantly highermean orbital velocities and accelerations when compared to other binarypulsars, suggested that the system would become the best available testbed forgeneral relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-fieldregime. here we report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests ofgeneral relativity. use of the theory-independent mass ratio of the two starsmakes these tests uniquely different from earlier studies. by measuringrelativistic corrections to the keplerian description of the orbital motion, wefind that the ``post-keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted byeinstein's theory of general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, themost precise test yet obtained. we also show that the transverse velocity ofthe system's center of mass is extremely small. combined with the system'slocation near the sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitationaltheories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar-systemtests. it also implies that the second-born pulsar may have formed differentlyto the usually assumed core-collapse of a helium star.

astro-ph;9912409	the gamma ray pulsar population	we apply a likelihood analysis to pulsar detections, pulsar upper limits, anddiffuse background measurements from the osse and egret instruments on thecompton gamma ray observatory to constrain the luminosity law for gamma-raypulsars and some properties of the gamma-ray pulsar population. we find thatthe dependence of luminosity on spin period and dipole magnetic field is muchsteeper at osse than at egret energies (50-200 kev and &gt;100 mev, respectively),suggesting that different emission mechanisms are responsible for low- andhigh-energy gamma-ray emission. incorporating a spin-down model and assuming apulsar spatial distribution, we estimate the fraction of the galactic gamma-raybackground due to unidentified pulsars and find that pulsars may be animportant component of the osse diffuse flux, but are most likely not importantat egret energies. using measurements of the diffuse background flux from theseinstruments, we are able to place constraints on the braking index, initialspin period, and magnetic field of the galactic pulsar population. we are alsoable to constrain the pulsar birthrate to be between 1/(25 yr) and 1/(500 yr).our results are based on a large gamma-ray beam, but they do not scale in asimple way with beam size. with our assumed beam size, the implied gamma-rayefficiency for the egret detections is no more than 20%. we estimate that about20 of the 169 unidentified egret sources are probably gamma-ray pulsars. we useour model to predict the pulsar population that will be seen by futuregamma-ray instruments and estimate that glast will detect roughly 750 gamma-raypulsars as steady sources, only 120 of which are currently known radio pulsars.
