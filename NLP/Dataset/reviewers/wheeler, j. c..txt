0901.2075	sn 2005cs in m51 ii. complete evolution in the optical and the  near-infrared	we present the results of the one year long observational campaign of thetype ii-plateau sn 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). this extensive dataset makes sn 2005cs the best observedlow-luminosity, 56ni-poor type ii-plateau event so far and one of the bestcore-collapse supernovae ever. the optical and near-infrared spectra shownarrow p-cygni lines characteristic of this sn family, which are indicative ofa very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. theoptical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactivetail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. numerous unfilteredobservations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity tomonitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. in addition tooptical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (togetherwith already published uv observations) allow us to construct for the firsttime a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. finally,comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, weinfer for sn 2005cs a 56ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejectedmass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.

0904.0261	looking into the fireball: rotse-iii and swift observations of early grb  afterglows	we report on a complete set of early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) obtained with the rotse-iii telescope network from march 2005 throughjune 2007. this set is comprised of 12 afterglows with early optical andswift/xrt observations, with a median rotse-iii response time of 45 s after thestart of gamma-ray emission (8 s after the gcn notice time). these afterglowsspan four orders of magnitude in optical luminosity, and the contemporaneousx-ray detections allow multi-wavelength spectral analysis. excluding x-rayflares, the broadband synchrotron spectra show that the optical and x-rayemission originate in a common region, consistent with predictions of theexternal forward shock in the fireball model. however, the fireball model isinadequate to predict the temporal decay indices of the early afterglows, evenafter accounting for possible long-duration continuous energy injection. wefind that the optical afterglow is a clean tracer of the forward shock, and weuse the peak time of the forward shock to estimate the initial bulk lorentzfactor of the grb outflow, and find 100&lt;gamma_0&lt;1000, consistent withexpectations.

0908.4274	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  hubble diagram and cosmological parameters	we present measurements of the hubble diagram for 103 type ia supernovae(sne) with redshifts 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.42, discovered during the first season (fall2005) of the sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey. these datafill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift sn ia surveys. wecombine the sdss-ii measurements with new distance estimates for published sndata from the essence survey, the supernova legacy survey, the hubble spacetelescope, and a compilation of nearby sn ia measurements. combining the snhubble diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the sdssluminous red galaxy sample and with cmb temperature anisotropy measurementsfrom wmap, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and omega_m, assuming aspatially flat cosmological model (fwcdm) with constant dark energy equation ofstate parameter, w. for the fwcdm model and the combined sample of 288 sne ia,we find w = -0.76 +- 0.07(stat) +- 0.11(syst), omega_m = 0.306 +- 0.019(stat)+- 0.023(syst) using mlcs2k2 and w = -0.96 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.12(syst), omega_m= 0.265 +- 0.016(stat) +- 0.025(syst) using the salt-ii fitter. we trace thediscrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame uv modelcombined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; thesedifferences mostly affect the distance estimates for the snls and hstsupernovae. we present detailed discussions of systematic errors for bothlight-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies inrest-frame $u$-band. for the salt-ii approach, we also see strong evidence forredshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta). restricting theanalysis to the 136 sne ia in the nearby+sdss-ii samples, we find much betteragreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties.

0908.4276	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  constraints on non-standard cosmological models	we use the new sne ia discovered by the sdss-ii supernova survey togetherwith additional supernova datasets as well as observations of the cosmicmicrowave background and baryon acoustic oscillations to constrain cosmologicalmodels. this complements the analysis presented by kessler et al. in that wediscuss and rank a number of the most popular non-standard cosmology scenarios.when this combined data-set is analyzed using the mlcs2k2 light-curve fitter,we find that more exotic models for cosmic acceleration provide a better fit tothe data than the lambda-cdm model. for example, the flat dgp model is rankedhigher by our information criteria tests than the standard model. when thedataset is instead analyzed using the salt-ii light-curve fitter, the standardcosmological constant model fares best. our investigation also includesinhomogeneous lemaitre-tolman-bondi (ltb) models. while our ltb models can bemade to fit the supernova data as well as any other model, the extra parametersthey require are not supported by our information criteria analysis.

0909.5564	vlt spectropolarimetry of the fast expanding type ia sn2006x	using vlt-fors1 we performed optical spectropolarimetric observations of thetype ia sn2006x on 7 pre-maximum epochs (day -10 to day -1) and onepost-maximum epoch (+39 days). the sn shows strong continuum interstellarpolarization reaching about 8% at 4000a, characterized by a wavelengthdependency that is substantially different from that of the milky-way dustmixture. several sn features, like siii 6355a and the caii ir triplet, presenta marked evolution. the caii near-ir triplet shows a pronounced polarization(~1.4%) already on day -10 in correspondence with a strong high-velocityfeature (hvf). the siii polarization peaks on day -6 at about 1.1% anddecreases to 0.8% on day -1. by day +39 no polarization signal is detected forthe siii line, while the caii ir triplet shows a marked re-polarization at thelevel of 1.2%. as in the case of another strongly polarized sn (2004dt), nopolarization was detected across the oi 7774a absorption. the fast-expandingsn2006x lies on the upper edge of the relation between peak polarization anddecline rate, and it confirms previous speculations about a correlation betweendegree of polarization, expansion velocity, and hvf strength. the polarizationof caii detected in our last epoch, the most advanced ever obtained for a typeia sn, coincides in velocity with the outer boundary of the ca synthesizedduring the explosion (15,000-17,000 km/s) in delayed-detonation models. thissuggests a large scale chemical inhomogeneity as produced by off-centerdetonations, a rather small amount of mixing, or a combination of both effects.in contrast, the absence of polarization at the inner edge of the ca-rich layer(8000-10,000 km/s) implies a substantial amount of mixing in these deeperregions.

0910.2193	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  consistency and constraints with other intermediate-redshift datasets	we present an analysis of the luminosity distances of type ia supernovae fromthe sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey in conjunction withother intermediate redshift (z&lt;0.4) cosmological measurements includingredshift-space distortions from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey(2dfgrs), the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect seen by the sdss, and thelatest baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) distance scale from both the sdss and2dfgrs. we have analysed the sdss-ii sn data alone using a variety of"model-independent" methods and find evidence for an accelerating universe at&gt;97% level from this single dataset. we find good agreement between thesupernova and bao distance measurements, both consistent with alambda-dominated cdm cosmology, as demonstrated through an analysis of thedistance duality relationship between the luminosity (d_l) and angular diameter(d_a) distance measures. we then use these data to estimate w within thisrestricted redshift range (z&lt;0.4). our most stringent result comes from thecombination of all our intermediate-redshift data (sdss-ii sne, bao, isw andredshift-space distortions), giving w = -0.81 +0.16 -0.18(stat) +/- 0.15(sys)and omega_m=0.22 +0.09 -0.08 assuming a flat universe. this value of w, andassociated errors, only change slightly if curvature is allowed to vary,consistent with constraints from the cosmic microwave background. we alsoconsider more limited combinations of the geometrical (sn, bao) and dynamical(isw, redshift-space distortions) probes.

0910.5597	type ii-p supernovae from the sdss-ii supernova survey and the  standardized candle method	we apply the standardized candle method (scm) for type ii plateau supernovae(sne ii-p), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a sn to its luminosityduring the plateau, to 15 sne ii-p discovered over the three season run of thesloan digital sky survey - ii supernova survey. the redshifts of these sne -0.027 &lt; z &lt; 0.144 - cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature;in particular, our sne ii-p sample contains nearly as many sne in the hubbleflow (z &gt; 0.01) as all of the current literature on the scm combined. we findthat the sdss sne have a very small intrinsic i-band dispersion (0.22 mag),which can be attributed to selection effects. when the scm is applied to thecombined sdss-plus-literature set of sne ii-p, the dispersion increases to 0.29mag, larger than the scatter for either set of sne separately. we show that thestandardization cannot be further improved by eliminating sne with positiveplateau decline rates, as proposed in poznanski et al. (2009). we thoroughlyexamine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the scm to beuseful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the fe iivelocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompassthe intrinsic variations of type ii-p sne will be needed.

0707.2237	spectropolarimetry of the type ib/c sn 2005bf	we present spectropolarimetric observations of the peculiar type ib/c sn2005bf, in mcg+00-27-005, from 3600-8550\aa. the sn was observed on 2005 april30.9, 18 days after the first b-band light-curve maximum and 6 days before thesecond b-band light-curve maximum. the degree of the interstellar polarization,determined from depolarized emission lines in the spectrum, is found to belarge with $p_{max}(isp)=1.6%$ and $\theta(isp)=149$\fdg$7\pm4.0$, but this maybe an upper limit on the real value of the isp. after isp subtraction,significant polarization is observed over large wavelength regions, indicatinga significant degree of global asymmetry, $\gtrsim 10%$. polarizations of 3.5%and 4% are observed for absorption components of ca ii h&amp;k and ir triplet, and1.3% for he i 5876\aa and fe ii. on the $q-u$ plane clear velocity-dependentloop structure is observed for the he i 5876\aa line, suggestive of departuresfrom an axial symmetry and possible clumping of the sn ejecta. weak highvelocity components of $\mathrm{h\alpha}$, $\mathrm{h\beta}$ and$\mathrm{h\gamma}$ are observed, with velocities of -15 000\kms. the low degreeof polarization observed at h$\beta$ suggests that the polarization observedfor the other balmer lines ($\sim 0.4%$ above the background polarization) mayrather be due to blending of $\mathrm{h\alpha}$ and $\mathrm{h\gamma}$ withpolarized si ii and fe ii lines, respectively. we suggest a model in which ajet of material, that is rich in $\mathrm{^{56}ni}$, has penetrated the c-ocore, but not the he mantle. the jet axis is tilted with respect to the axis ofthe photosphere. this accounts for the lack of significant polarization of o i7774\aa, the delayed excitation and, hence, observability of he i and,potentially, the varied geometries of he and ca.

1002.0581	grb 081008: from burst to afterglow and the transition phase in between	we present a multi-wavelength study of grb 081008, at redshift 1.967, byswift, rotse-iii and grond. compared to other swift grbs, grb 081008 has atypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during theprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. theearly x-ray emission seen by the swift/xrt was dominated by the softening tailof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after theswift/bat detections. optical observations that started shortly after the firstactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. we interpretthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the earlyburst activities. a second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-raypulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve andthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. wesuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injectioninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch ofburst activities. these early observations thus provide a potential probe forthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. the later lightcurve of grb081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and x-ray. thetemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral breakwithin optical. however, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.we discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

1008.0651	the unification of asymmetry signatures of type ia supernovae	we present a compilation of the geometry measures acquired using optical andir spectroscopy and optical spectropolarimetry to probe the explosion geometryof type ia sne. polarization measurements are sensitive to asymmetries in theplane of the sky, whereas line profiles in nebular phase spectra are expectedto trace asymmetries perpendicular to the plane of the sky. the combination ofthese two measures can overcome their respective projection effects, completelyprobing the 3d structures of these events. for 9 normal type ia sne, we findthat the polarization of \ion{si}{2} $\lambda 6355$ at 5 days before maximum($p_{si\,ii}$) is well correlated with its velocity evolution ($\dot{\rmv}_{si\,ii}$), implying $\dot{\rm v}_{si\,ii}$ is predominantly due to theasymmetry of the sne. we find only a weak correlation between the polarizationof \ion{si}{2} and the reported velocities (${\rm v}_{neb}$) for peak emissionof optical \ion{fe}{2} and \ion{ni}{2} lines in nebular spectra. our sample isbiased, with polarization measurements being only available for normal snewhich subsequently exhibited positive (i.e. redshifted) ${\rm v}_{neb}$. inunison these indicators are consistent with an off-centre delayed detonation,in which the outer layers are dominated by a spherical oxygen layer, mixed withan asymmetric distribution of intermediate mass elements. the combination ofspectroscopic and spectropolarimetric indicators suggests a single geometricconfiguration for normal type ia sne, with some of the diversity of observedproperties arising from orientation effects.

1111.0596	improved distance determination to m51 from supernovae 2011dh and 2005cs	the appearance of two recent supernovae, sn 2011dh and 2005cs, both in m51,provides an opportunity to derive an improved distance to their host galaxy bycombining the observations of both sne. we apply the expanding photospheremethod to get the distance to m51 by fitting the data of these two snesimultaneously. in order to correct for the effect of flux dilution, we usecorrection factors (zeta) appropriate for standard type ii-p sne atmospheresfor 2005cs, but find zeta ~ 1 for the type iib sn 2011dh, which may be due tothe reduced h-content of its ejecta. the epm analysis resulted in d_m51 = 8.4+/- 0.7 mpc. based on this improved distance, we also re-analyze the hstobservations of the proposed progenitor of sn 2011dh. we confirm that theobject detected on the pre-explosion hst-images is unlikely to be a compactstellar cluster. in addition, its derived radius (~ 277$ r_sun) is too largefor being the real (exploded) progenitor of sn 2011dh. the supernova-baseddistance, d = 8.4 mpc, is in good agreement with other recent distanceestimates to m51.

1206.1858	vlt spectropolarimetry of the type ia sn2005ke - a step towards  understanding subluminous events	we performed optical spectropolarimetric observations of the subluminous typeia sn2005ke at 3 epochs (days -8, -7, and +76). the explosion properties arederived by comparing the data to explosion and radiation transfer models. thesn shows polarimetric properties that are very similar to the only othersubluminous event for which spectropolarimetry is available, i.e. sn1999by. thedata present a very marked dominant axis, which is shared by both the continuumand lines such as siii 6355, suggesting that the relatively large, globalasymmetry is common to the photosphere and the line-forming region. the maximumpolarization degree observed in the siii 6355 absorption reaches 0.39+/-0.08%.at variance with what is seen in core-normal type ia, sn2005ke displayssignificant continuum polarization, which grows from the blue to the red andpeaks at about 7000 a, reaching ~0.7%. the properties of the polarization andflux spectra can be understood within the framework of a subluminousdelayed-detonation (dd), or pulsating dd scenario, or wd mergers. thedifference in appearance with respect to core-normal sne ia is caused by lowphotospheric temperatures in combination with layers of unburned c, and moremassive layers of the products of explosive c and o burning. the comparativelyhigh level of continuum polarization is explained in terms of a significantglobal asymmetry (~15%), which is well reproduced by an oblate ellipsoidalgeometry. our results suggest that sn2005ke arose either from asingle-degenerate system in which the wd is especially rapidly rotating, closeto the break-up velocity, or from a double-degenerate merger. based on thecurrent polarization data, we cannot distinguish between these twopossibilities.

1302.0166	spectropolarimetry of the type ia supernova 2012fr	spectropolarimetry provides the means to probe the 3d geometries ofsupernovae at early times. we report spectropolarimetric observations of thetype ia supernova 2012fr at four epochs: -11, -5, +2 and +24 days, with respectto b-lightcurve maximum. sn 2012fr is a normal type ia sn, similar to sne1990n, 2000cx and 2005hj (that all exhibit low velocity decline rates for theprincipal si ii line). the sn displays high velocity components at -11 daysthat are highly polarized. the polarization of these features decreases as theybecome weaker from -5 days. at +2 days, the polarization angles of the lowvelocity components of silicon and calcium are identical and oriented at 90degrees relative to the high velocity ca component. in addition to having verydifferent velocities, the high and low velocity ca components have orthogonaldistributions in the plane of the sky. the continuum polarization for the sn atall four epochs is low &lt;0.1%. we conclude that the low level of continuumpolarization is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. thesimple axial symmetry evident from the polarization angles of the high velocityand low velocity ca components, along with the presence of high velocitycomponents of si and ca, are consistent with the pulsating delayed detonationmodel. we predict that, during the nebular phase, sn 2012fr will displayblue-shifted emission lines of fe-group elements.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1308.4660	multidimensional simulations of rotating pair instability supernovae	we study the effects of rotation on the dynamics, energetics and ni-56production of pair instability supernova explosions by performing rotatingtwo-dimensional ("2.5-d") hydrodynamics simulations. we calculate the evolutionof eight low metallicity (z = 10^-3, 10^-4 zsun) massive (135-245 msun) pisnprogenitors with initial surface rotational velocities 50% that of the criticalkeplerian value using the stellar evolution code mesa. we allow for both theinclusion and the omission of the effects of magnetic fields in the angularmomentum transport and in chemical mixing, resulting in slowly-rotating andrapidly-rotating final carbon-oxygen cores, respectively. increased rotationfor carbon-oxygen cores of the same mass and chemical stratification leads toless energetic pisn explosions that produce smaller amounts of ni-56 due to theeffect of the angular momentum barrier that develops and slows the dynamicalcollapse. we find a non-monotonic dependence of ni-56 production on rotationalvelocity in situations when smoother composition gradients form at the outeredge of the rotating cores. in these cases, the pisn energetics are determinedby the competition of two factors: the extent of chemical mixing in the outerlayers of the core due to the effects of rotation in the progenitor evolutionand the development of angular momentum support against collapse. our 2.5-dpisn simulations with rotation are the first presented in the literature. theyreveal hydrodynamic instabilities in several regions of the exploding star andincreased explosion asymmetries with higher core rotational velocity.

0801.3297	a measurement of the rate of type-ia supernovae at redshift $z\approx$  0.1 from the first season of the sdss-ii supernova survey	we present a measurement of the rate of type ia supernovae (sne ia) from thefirst of three seasons of data from the sdss-ii supernova survey. for thismeasurement, we include 17 sne ia at redshift $z\le0.12$. assuming a flatcosmology with $\omega_m = 0.3=1-\omega_\lambda$, we find a volumetric sn iarate of $[2.93^{+0.17}_{-0.04}({\rm systematic})^{+0.90}_{-0.71}({\rmstatistical})] \times 10^{-5} {\rm sne} {\rm mpc}^{-3} h_{70}^3 {\rmyear}^{-1}$, at a volume-weighted mean redshift of 0.09. this result isconsistent with previous measurements of the sn ia rate in a similar redshiftrange. the systematic errors are well controlled, resulting in the most precisemeasurement of the sn ia rate in this redshift range. we use a maximumlikelihood method to fit sn rate models to the sdss-ii supernova survey data incombination with other rate measurements, thereby constraining models for theredshift-evolution of the sn ia rate. fitting the combined data to a simplepower-law evolution of the volumetric sn ia rate, $r_v \propto (1+z)^{\beta}$,we obtain a value of $\beta = 1.5 \pm 0.6$, i.e. the sn ia rate is determinedto be an increasing function of redshift at the $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ level.fitting the results to a model in which the volumetric sn rate,$r_v=a\rho(t)+b\dot \rho(t)$, where $\rho(t)$ is the stellar mass density and$\dot \rho(t)$ is the star formation rate, we find $a = (2.8 \pm 1.2) \times10^{-14} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1} \mathrm{year}^{-1}$, $b =(9.3^{+3.4}_{-3.1})\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1}$.

1401.2991	interaction between the broad-lined type ic supernova 2012ap and  carriers of diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are absorption features observed inoptical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated withcarbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. however, because thecentral wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronictransitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remaineduncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. here we report onunusually strong dibs in optical spectra of the broad-lined type ic supernovasn 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)timescales. the 4428 and 6283 angstrom dib features get weaker with time,whereas the 5780 angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. these nonuniformchanges suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of thedibs and that the dib carriers possess high ionization potentials, such assmall cations or charged fullerenes. we conclude that moderate-resolutionspectra of supernovae with dib absorptions obtained within weeks of outburstcould reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of theirprogenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of dibcarriers.

1405.3970	early observations and analysis of the type ia sn 2014j in m82	we present optical and near infrared (nir) observations of the nearby type iasn 2014j. seventeen optical and twenty-three nir spectra were obtained from 10days before ($-$10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum $b$-bandbrightness. the relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns ofdevelopment can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of thisperiod. carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify ci$\lambda$ 1.0693 in the nir spectra. we find that mgii lines with highoscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other mgii lines. weshow that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in opticaldepths due to oscillator strengths. the spectra of sn 2014j show it is a normalsn ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal andhigh-velocity subclasses. the velocities for oi, mgii, siii, sii, caii and feiisuggest that sn 2014j has a layered structure with little or no mixing. thatresult is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models. we alsoreport photometric observations, obtained from $-$10d to +29d, in the $ubvrijh$and $k_s$ bands. sn 2014j is about 3 magnitudes fainter than a normal sn ia atthe distance of m82, which we attribute to extinction in the host. the templatefitting package snoopy is used to interpret the light curves and to derivephotometric parameters. using $r_v$ = 1.46, which is consistent with previousstudies, snoopy finds that $a_v = 1.80$ for $e(b-v)_{host}=1.23 \pm 0.01$ mag.the maximum $b$-band brightness of $-19.19 \pm 0.10$ mag was reached onfebruary 1.74 ut $ \pm 0.13$ days and the supernova had a decline parameter of$\delta m_{15}=1.11 \pm 0.02$ mag.

1406.7640	a wolf-rayet-like progenitor of supernova sn 2013cu from spectral  observations of a wind	the explosive fate of massive stripped wolf-rayet (w-r) stars is a key openquestion in stellar physics. an appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient w-rstars are the progenitors of some h-poor supernova (sn) explosions of typesiib, ib, and ic. a blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent withthose of some w-r stars, has been recently identified at the location of asn~ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined tohave been the progenitor. similar previous works have so far only resulted innondetections. comparison of early photometric observations of type icsupernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii&lt;10^12 cm, as expected for some w-r stars. however, the hallmark signature ofw-r stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. here,we report the detection of strong emission lines in an early-time spectrum ofsn 2013cu (iptf13ast; type iib) obtained ~15.5 hr after explosion ("flashspectroscopy"). we identify w-r-like wind signatures suggesting a progenitor ofthe wn(h) subclass. the extent of this dense wind may indicate increased massloss from the progenitor shortly prior to its explosion, consistent with recenttheoretical predictions.

1407.0136	properties of extragalactic dust inferred from linear polarimetry of  type ia supernovae	aims: the aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to investigate the properties ofextragalactic dust and compare them to what is seen in the galaxy; 2) toaddress in an independent way the problem of the anomalous extinction curvesreported for reddened type ia supernovae (sn) in connection to the environmentsin which they explode. methods: the properties of the dust are derived from thewavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddenedtype ia sn: 1986g, 2006x, 2008fp, and 2014j. [...] results: all four objectsare characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios(r_v) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized byvery blue polarization peaks. in all cases the polarization position angle iswell aligned with the local spiral structure. while sn~1986g is compatible withthe most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the galaxy,sn2006x, 2008fp, and 2014j show unprecedented behaviours. the observeddeviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to therelatively large amounts of reddening characterizing the objects in the sample.conclusions: the dust responsible for the polarization of these four sn is mostlikely of interstellar nature. the polarization properties can be interpretedin terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. the anomalousbehaviour is apparently associated with the properties of the galacticenvironment in which the sn explode, rather than with the progenitor systemfrom which they originate. for the extreme case of sn2014j, we cannot excludethe contribution of light scattered by local material; however, the observedpolarization properties require an ad hoc geometrical dust distribution.

1408.1606	the broad-lined type ic sn 2012ap and the nature of relativistic  supernovae lacking a gamma-ray burst detection	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations of sn 2012ap,a broad-lined type ic supernova in the galaxy ngc 1729 that produced arelativistic and rapidly decelerating outflow without a gamma-ray burstsignature. photometry and spectroscopy follow the flux evolution from -13 to+272 days past the b-band maximum of -17.4 +/- 0.5 mag. the spectra aredominated by fe ii, o i, and ca ii absorption lines at ejecta velocities of20,000 km/s that change slowly over time. other spectral absorption lines areconsistent with contributions from photospheric he i, and hydrogen may also bepresent at higher velocities (&gt; 27,000 km/s). we use these observations toestimate explosion properties and derive a total ejecta mass of 2.7 msolar, akinetic energy of 1.0x10^{52} erg, and a 56ni mass of 0.1-0.2 msolar. nebularspectra (t &gt; 200d) exhibit an asymmetric double-peaked [oi] 6300,6364 emissionprofile that we associate with absorption in the supernova interior, althoughtoroidal ejecta geometry is an alternative explanation. sn 2012ap joins sn2009bb as another exceptional supernova that shows evidence for a centralengine (e.g., black-hole accretion or magnetar) capable of launching anon-negligible portion of ejecta to relativistic velocities without acoincident gamma-ray burst detection. defining attributes of their progenitorsystems may be related to notable properties including above-averageenvironmental metallicities of z &gt; zsolar, moderate to high levels ofhost-galaxy extinction (e(b-v) &gt; 0.4 mag), detection of high-velocity helium atearly epochs, and a high relative flux ratio of [ca ii]/[o i] &gt; 1 at nebularepochs. these events support the notion that jet activity at various energyscales may be present in a wide range of supernovae.

1409.8331	spectroscopy of superluminous supernova host galaxies. a preference of  hydrogen-poor events for extreme emission line galaxies	superluminous supernovae (slsne) are very bright explosions that were onlydiscovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarfgalaxies. understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellarexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover theelusive progenitors of slsne and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. inthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study superluminoussupernova host galaxies, focusing on the sample for which we have obtainedspectroscopy. we show that slsne-i and slsne-r (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% inour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as extreme emission linegalaxies (eelgs). the probability of this happening by chance is negligible andwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the slsnphenomenon are related. in contrast, slsne-ii (hydrogen-rich) occur in moremassive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. therefore, ifslsne-ii constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likelydifferent from those of h-poor slsne. gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are, on average,not found in as extreme environments as h-poor slsne. we propose that h-poorslsne result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlierthan grbs. this might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in thesesystems. slsne present a novel method of selecting candidate eelgs independentof their luminosity.

astro-ph;0010614	preliminary spectral analysis of the type ii supernova 1999em	we have calculated fast direct spectral model fits to two early-time spectraof the type-ii plateau sn 1999em, using the synow synthetic spectrum code. thefirst is an extremely early blue optical spectrum and the second a combined hstand optical spectrum obtained one week later. spectroscopically this supernovaappears to be a normal type ii and these fits are in excellent agreement withthe observed spectra. our direct analysis suggests the presence of enhancednitrogen. we have further studied these spectra with the full nlte generalmodel atmosphere code phoenix. while we do not find confirmation for enhancednitrogen (nor do we rule it out), we do require enhanced helium. an even moreintriguing possible line identification is complicated balmer and he i lines,which we show falls naturally out of the detailed calculations with a shallowdensity gradient. we also show that very early spectra such as those presentedhere combined with sophisticated spectral modeling allows an independentestimate of the total reddening to the supernova, since when the spectrum isvery blue, dereddening leads to changes in the blue flux that cannot bereproduced by altering the ``temperature'' of the emitted radiation. theseresults are extremely encouraging since they imply that detailed modeling ofearly spectra can shed light on both the abundances and total extinction of sneii, the latter improving their utility and reliability as distance indicators.

astro-ph;0205337	the axially symmetric ejecta of supernova 1987a	extensive early observations proved that the ejecta of supernova 1987a (sn1987a) are aspherical. fifteen years after the supernova explosion, the hubblespace telescope has resolved the rapidly expanding ejecta. the late-time imagesand spectroscopy provide a geometrical picture that is consistent with earlyobservations and suggests a highly structured, axially symmetric geometry. wepresent here a new synthesis of the old and new data. we show that the bochumevent, presumably a clump of $^{56}$ni, and the late-time image, the locus ofexcitation by $^{44}$ti, are most naturally accounted for by sharing a commonposition angle of about 14\degree, the same as the mystery spot and earlyspeckle data on the ejecta, and that they are both oriented along the axis ofthe inner circumstellar ring at 45\degree to the plane of the sky. we alsodemonstrate that the polarization represents a prolate geometry with the sameposition angle and axis as the early speckle data and the late-time image andhence that the geometry has been fixed in time and throughout the ejecta. thebochum event and the doppler kinematics of the [ca ii]/[o ii] emission inspatially resolved hst spectra of the ejecta can be consistently integratedinto this geometry. the radioactive clump is deduced to fall approximatelyalong the axis of the inner circumstellar ring and therefore to be redshiftedin the north whereas the [ca ii]/[o ii] 7300 \aa emission is redshifted in thesouth. we present a jet-induced model for the explosion and argue that such amodel can account for many of the observed asymmetries. in the jet models, theoxygen and calcium are not expected to be distributed along the jet, butprimarily in an expanding torus that shares the plane and northern blue shiftof the inner circumstellar ring.

astro-ph;0207272	aspherical supernovae explosions	core collapse supernovae(sn) are the final stages of evolution in massivestars during which the central region collapses. recent explosion scenariosassumed that the ejection is due to energy deposition by neutrinos into theenvelope but detailed models do not produce powerful explosions. there is newand mounting evidence for an asphericity and, in particular, for axial symmetryin several sne which may be hard to reconcile within the spherical picture.this evidence includes the observed high polarization and its variation withtime, pulsar kicks, high velocity iron-group and intermediate-mass elementsmaterial observed in remnants, direct observations of the debris of sn1987aetc. some of the new evidence is discussed in more detail. to be in agreementwith the observations, any successful mechanism must invoke some sort of axialsymmetry for the explosion. we consider jet-induced/dominated explosions ofcore collapse sne. our study is based on detailed 3-d hydrodynamical andradiation transport models we find that the observations can be explained bylow velocity, massive jets which stall well within the sn envelope. suchoutflows may be produced by mhd- mechanisms, convective dominated accretiondisks on the central object or asymmetric neutrino emissions. asymmetricdensity/chemical distributions and, for sn2002ap, off-center energy depositionshave been identified as crucial for the interpretation of the polarization.

astro-ph;0207320	the faint optical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 020124: implications  for the nature of dark gamma-ray bursts	we present ground-based optical observations of grb 020124 starting 1.6 hoursafter the burst, as well as subsequent very large array (vla) and hubble spacetelescope (hst) observations. the optical afterglow of grb 020124 is one of thefaintest afterglows detected to date, and it exhibits a relatively rapid decay,$f_\nu\propto t^{-1.60\pm 0.04}$, followed by further steepening. in addition,a weak radio source was found coincident with the optical afterglow. the hstobservations reveal that a positionally coincident host galaxy must be thefaintest host to date, r&gt;29.5 mag. the afterglow observations can be explainedby several models requiring little or no extinction within the host galaxy,a_v~0-0.9 mag. these observations have significant implications for thestatistics of the so-called dark bursts (bursts for which no optical afterglowis detected), which are usually attributed to dust extinction within the hostgalaxy. the faintness and relatively rapid decay of the afterglow of grb020124, combined with the low inferred extinction indicate that some darkbursts are intrinsically dim and not dust obscured. thus, the diversity in theunderlying properties of optical afterglows must be observationally determinedbefore substantive inferences can be drawn from the statistics of dark bursts.

astro-ph;0208008	discovery of grb 020405 and its late red bump	we present the discovery of grb 020405 made with the inter-planetary network(ipn). with a duration of 60 s, the burst appears to be a typical long durationevent. we observed the 75-square acrminute ipn error region with the mountstromlo observatory's 50-inch robotic telescope and discovered a transientsource which subsequently decayed and was also associated with a variable radiosource. we identify this source as the afterglow of grb 020405. subsequentobservations by other groups found varying polarized flux and established aredshift of 0.690 to the host galaxy. motivated by the low redshift wetriggered observations with wfpc2 on-board the hubble space telescope (hst).modeling the early ground-based data with a jet model, we find a clear redexcess over the decaying optical lightcurves that is present between day 10 andday 141 (the last hst epoch). this `bump' has the spectral and temporalfeatures expected of an underlying supernova (sn). in particular, the red colorof the putative sn is similar to that of the sn associated with grb 011121, atlate time. restricting the sample of grbs to those with z&lt;0.7, a total of fivebursts, red bumps at late times are found in grb 970228, grb 011121, and grb020405. it is possible that the simplest idea, namely that all long durationgrbs have underlying sne with a modest dispersion in their properties(especially peak luminosity), is sufficient to explain the non detections.

astro-ph;0211189	grb 021004: a massive progenitor star surrounded by shells	we present spectra of the optical transient of grb021004 obtained with thehobby-eberly telescope starting 15.48, 20.31 hours, and 4.84 days after theburst and a spectrum obtained with the h. j. smith 2.7 m telescope starting14.31 hours after the burst. grb021004 is the first afterglow whose spectrum isdominated by absorption lines from high ionization species with multiplevelocity components separated by up to 3000 km/s. we argue that these lines arelikely to come from shells around a massive progenitor star. the highvelocities and high ionizations arise from a combination of acceleration andflash-ionization by the burst photons and the wind velocity and steadyionization by the progenitor. we also analyze the broad-band spectrum and thelight curve. we distinguish six components along the line of sight: (1) thez~2.293 absorption lines arise from the wind of a massive star. for a mass lossrate of ~6 x 10^{-5} solar masses per year, this component also provides theexternal medium to create the afterglow light. (2) a second shell producesabsorption lines with a relative velocity of 560 km/s, and this is associatedwith the shell created by the fast massive star wind blowing a bubble in thepreceding slow wind at a radial distance of order 10 pc. (3) more distantclouds within the host galaxy lie between 30-2500 pc, where they have beenionized by the burst. (4-6) the massive star wind has clumps with radii andover-densities of 0.022, 0.063, and 0.12 parsecs and 50%, 10%, and 10%respectively. the immediate progenitor of the burster could either be a wc-typewolf-rayet star or a highly evolved star whose original mass was just too smallfor it to become a wn-type wolf-rayet star.

(hypernovae being a tentativelydefined class of sne with very broad absorption features: these featuressuggest a large velocity of the ejected material and possibly a large explosionkinetic energy.) comparison with spectra of other hypernovae shows that thespectrum of sn 2003dh obtained on 2003 may 8 and 9, i.e., 34-35 rest-frame daysafter the grb (for z=0.1685), are similar to those of sn 1997ef obtained ~34-42days after the fiducial time of explosion of that sn. the match with sn 1998bwspectra is not as good (at rest 7300-8000 a, but again spectra obtained ~33-43days after grb 980425 are preferred. this indicates that the sn may haveintermediate properties between sne 1997ef and 1998bw. based on the analogywith the other hypernovae, the time of explosion of sn 2003dh is thenconstrained to be between -8 and +2 days of the grb. the si and o p-cygni linesof sn 2003dh seem comparable to those of sn 1997ef, which suggests that theejected mass in sn 2003dh may match that in sn 1997ef. polarization wasmarginally detected at optical wavelengths. this is consistent withmeasurements of the late afterglow, implying that it mostly originated in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0306470	near infrared spectra of type ia supernovae	we report near infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations of twelve``branch-normal'' type ia supernovae (sne ia) which cover the wavelength regionfrom 0.8-2.5 microns. our sample more than doubles the number of sne ia withpublished nir spectra within three weeks of maximum light. the epochs ofobservation range from thirteen days before maximum light to eighteen daysafter maximum light. a detailed model for a type ia supernovae is used toidentify spectral features. the doppler shifts of lines are measured to obtainthe velocity and, thus, the radial distribution of elements.  the nir is an extremely useful tool to probe the chemical structure in thelayers of sne ia ejecta. this wavelength region is optimal for examiningcertain products of the sne ia explosion that may be blended or obscured inother spectral regions. we identify spectral features from mgii, caii, siii,feii, coii, niii and possibly mnii. we find no indications for hydrogen, heliumor carbon in the spectra. the spectral features reveal important clues aboutthe physical characteristics of sne ia. we use the features to derive upperlimits for the amount of unburned matter, to identify the transition regionsfrom explosive carbon to oxygen burning and from partial to complete siliconburning, and to estimate the level of mixing during and after the explosion.

astro-ph;0309639	sn 2003du: signatures of the circumstellar environment in a normal type  ia supernova?	we present observations of the type ia supernova 2003du and report thedetectionof an unusual, high-velocity component in the ca ii infrared triplet,similar tofeatures previously observed in sn 2000cx and sn 2001el. this featureexhibits a large expansion velocity (~18,000 km/s) which is nearly constantbetween -7 and +2 days relative to maximum light, and disappears shortlythereafter. otherthan this feature, the spectral evolution and light curveresemble those of a normal sn ia.  we find that the ca ii feature can plausibly be caused by a dense shellformed when circumstellar material of solar abundance is overrun by the rapidlyexpanding outermost layers of the sn ejecta. model calculations show that theoptical and infrared spectra are remarkably unaffected by the circumstellarinteraction. in particular, no hydrogen lines are detectable in eitherabsorption or emission. the only qualitatively different features are thestrong, high-velocity feature in the ca ii ir-triplet, and a somewhat weaker oi feature near 7,300 aa. the morphology and time evolution of these featuresprovide an estimate for the amount of accumulated matter and an indication ofthe mixing in the dense shell. we apply these diagnostic tools to sn 2003du andinfer that about 2 x 10^{-2} m_sun of solar abundance material may haveaccumulated in a circumstellar shell prior to the observations. furthermore,the early light curve data imply that the circumstellar material was originallyvery close to the progenitor system, perhaps from an accretion disk, roche lobeor common envelope.

astro-ph;0601614	low carbon abundance in type ia supernovae	we investigate the quantity and composition of unburned material in the outerlayers of three normal type ia supernovae (sne ia): 2000dn, 2002cr and 20 04bw.pristine matter from a white dwarf progenitor is expected to be a mixture ofoxygen and carbon in approximately equal abundance. using near-infrared (nir,0.7-2.5 microns) spectra, we find that oxygen is abundant while carbon isseverely depleted with low upper limits in the outer third of the ejected mass.strong features from the oi line at rest wavelength = 0.7773 microns areobserved through a wide range of expansion velocities approx. 9,000 - 18,000km/s. this large velocity domain corresponds to a physical region of thesupernova with a large radial depth. we show that the ionization of c and owill be substantially the same in this region. ci lines in the nir are expectedto be 7-50 times stronger than those from oi but there is only marginalevidence of ci in the spectra and none of cii. we deduce that for these threenormal sne ia, oxygen is more abundant than carbon by factors of 100 - 1,000.mgii is also detected in a velocity range similar to that of oi. the presenceof o and mg combined with the absence of c indicates that for these sne ia,nuclear burning has reached all but the extreme outer layers; any unburnedmaterial must have expansion velocities greater than 18,000 km/s. this resultfavors deflagration to detonation transition (dd) models over pure deflagrationmodels for sne ia.

astro-ph;9601023	new perspectives on type ic supernovae	the type ic supernovae are probably "nearly-nude" core collapse events. theyare thus of special interest in terms of their evolutionary origin, but also asthe source of potential clues to the explosion process that may not be obtainedfrom other supernovae. study of type ic shows that they are distinct from typeia, even those of the dimmer, redder variety. type ic also suggest that thehistorical classification scheme based on spectra cannot encompass the physicalfeatures of these and closely related events. the type ic probably all have avery small outer layer of helium, but not enough to make them merely a versionof type ib. they probably require another evolutionary channel. similar spectranear maximum light belie a variety of late-time light curve behavior. someevents classified as type ic, eg sn 1962l, 1983v, 1990b, and 1990u, follow arelatively slow evolution after maximum light, decaying about 3.0 magnitudes inv during the first 150 days after maximum. these events seem to belong to ageneral category that includes sn 1993j and the type ib sn 19983n. their lightcurves decline more rapidly than the expected late-time co-56 decay with fulltrapping, but less rapidly than type ia. the late time light curve of theseevents seems to be independent of the velocity of the ejecta and hence impliesthe trapping of gamma-rays in a manner that is independent of the mass thatparticipates in the homologous expansion. other type ic, sne 1983i, 1987m, and1994i, show steeper decline than even type ia.

astro-ph;9601024	three-dimensional combustion in type ia supernovae	turbulent combustion is three-dimensional. turbulence in a type ia supernovais driven on large scales by the buoyancy of burning products. the turbulentcascade penetrates down to very small scales, and makes the rate ofdeflagration independent of the microphysics. the competition between theturbulent cascade and the freeze-out of turbulent motions due to stellarexpansion determines the largest scale participating in the cascade. this setsthe bulk rate of a deflagration in a supernova. the freeze-out limits the bulkrate of deflagration to a value that makes a powerful explosion impossible.two-dimensional simulations cannot capture these essential elements ofturbulent combustion, even in principle. a powerful delayed detonationexplosion can take place if the burning makes a transition to a detonation. adeflagration to detonation transition (ddt) can occur in a layer of mixed coldfuel and hot burning products created either inside an active turbulent burningregion by a high intensity of turbulence, or by mixing cold fuel with ashes ofa dead deflagration front during the global pulsation of a star, or by both.

astro-ph;9602156	polarization of sn 1987a revisited	the conventional picture for the origin of the polarization of a supernova isbased on a model of thomson or resonance scattering of photons travelingthrough an aspherical supernova atmosphere. positive detection of intrinsicpolarization in sn 1987a is then interpretated as evidence of an asymmetricalsupernova atmosphere. we show here a different view based on the scattering ofthe supernova light by a dusty circumstellar material (csm), or the ``lightecho'' effect. at a given epoch after the explosion, the observed photonsconsist of both those propagating directly from the supernova and thosescattered by dust particles in the csm. polarized light can be produced if thedistribution of the dust particles is aspherical. the model can reproduce boththe time evolution of the observed broad band polarization of sn 1987a andmajor features of the polarization spectra. it is also successful in providinga natural model for the early infrared light curve, in particular the observed30 day delay of the ir maximum compared to the maximum of the bolometric lightcurve.

astro-ph;9609070	maximum brightness and post-maximum decline of light curves of sn~ia: a  comparison of theory and observations	we compare the observed correlations between the maximum brightness,postmaximum decline rate and color at maximum light of type ia supernovae (snia) with model predictions.  the observations are based on a total of 40 sn ia with 29 sn of the calantololo supernova search and 11 local sn which cover a range of 2 mag in theabsolute visual brightness.  the observed correlations are not tight, one dimensional relations.supernovae with the same postmaximum decline or the same color have a spread invisual magnitude of about 0.7 mag. the dispersion in the color-magnituderelation may result from uncertainties in the distance determinations or theinterstellar reddening within the host galaxy. the dispersion in the declinerate-magnitude relation suggests that an intrinsic spread in the supernovaproperties exists that cannot be accounted for by any single relation betweenvisual brightness and postmaximum decline.  theoretical correlations are derived from a grid of models which encompassesdelayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations, the merging scenario andhelium detonations.  we find that the observed correlations can be understood in terms ofexplosions of chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs.  our models show an intrinsic spread in the relations of about 0.5 mag in themaximum brightness and about 0.1 mag in the b-v color.  our study provides strong evidence against the mechanism of helium detonationfor subluminous, red sn ia.

astro-ph;9805095	the qse-reduced \alpha network	examination of the process of silicon burning, the burning stage that leadsto the production of the iron peak nuclei, reveals that the nuclear evolutionis dominated by large groups of nuclei in mutual equilibrium. thesequasi-equilibrium (qse) groups form well in advance of the global nuclearstatistical equilibrium (nse). we present an improved ``minimal'' nuclearnetwork, which takes advantage of quasi-equilibrium in order to calculate thenuclear evolution and energy generation while further reducing thecomputational cost compared to a conventional \alpha-chain network. duringsilicon burning, the resultant \emph{qse-reduced} \alpha network is twice asfast as the full \alpha network it replaces and requires the tracking of onlyhalf as many abundance variables, without significant loss of accuracy. whenthe qse-reduced \alpha network is used in combination with a conventional\alpha network stretching from he to si, the combined \alpha7 network providesan accurate approximation for all of the burning stages from he burning to nse,while tracking only 7 abundances. these reductions in computational cost andthe number of species evolved make the \alpha7 network well suited forinclusion within hydrodynamic simulations, particularly those inmulti-dimension.

astro-ph;9808086	aspherical explosion models for sn 1998bw/grb 980425	the recent discovery of the unusual supernova sn1998bw and its apparentcorrelation with the gamma-ray burst grb 980425 has raised new issuesconcerning both the grb and supernovae. although the spectra resemble those oftypeic supernovae, there are distinct differences at early times and sn1998bwappeared to be unusually bright and red at maximum light. the apparentexpansion velocities inferred by the doppler shift of (unidentified) absorptionfeatures appeared to be high, making sn1998bw a possible candidate for a"hypernova" with explosion energies between 20 and 50e51 erg and ejecta massesin excess of 6 - 15 m_o. based on light curve calculations for asphericalexplosions and guided by the polarization observations of "normal" snic andrelated events, we present an alternative picture that allows sn1998bw to havean explosion energy and ejecta mass consistent with core collapse supernovae(although at the 'bright' end). we show that the lc of sn1998bw can beunderstood as result of an aspherical explosion along the rotational axis of abasically spherical, non-degenerate c/o core of massive star with an explosionenergy of 2foe and a total ejecta mass of 2 m_o if it is seen from highinclinations with respect to the plane of symmetry. in this model, the highexpansion velocities are a direct consequence of an aspherical explosion which,in turn, produces oblate iso-density contours. it suggests that the fundamentalcore-collapse explosion process itself is strongly asymmetric.

astro-ph;9904419	jet-induced explosions of core collapse supernovae	we numerically studied the explosion of a supernova caused by supersonic jetspresent in its center. the jets are assumed to be generated by amagneto-rotational mechanism when a stellar core collapses into a neutron star.we simulated the process of the jet propagation through the star, jetbreakthrough, and the ejection of the supernova envelope by the lateral shocksgenerated during jet propagation. the end result of the interaction is a highlynonspherical supernova explosion with two high-velocity jets of material movingin polar directions, and a slower moving, oblate, highly distorted ejectacontaining most of the supernova material. the jet-induced explosion isentirely due to the action of the jets on the surrounding star and does notdepend on neutrino transport or re-acceleration of a stalled shock. the jetmechanism can explain the observed high polarization of type ib,c and type iisupernovae, pulsar kicks, very high velocity material observed in supernovaremnants, indications that radioactive material was carried to thehydrogen-rich layers in sn1987a, and some others observations that are verydifficult or impossible to explain by the neutrino energy deposition mechanism.the breakout of the jet from a compact, hydrogen- deficient core may accountfor the gamma-ray bursts and radio outburst associated with sn1998bw/grb980425.

astro-ph;9908226	influence of the stellar population on type ia supernovae: consequences  for the determination of omega	the influence of the metallicity at the main sequence on the chemicalstructure of the exploding white dwarf, the nucleosynthesis during theexplosion and the light curves of an individual type ia supernovae have beenstudied. detailed calculations of the stellar evolution, the explosion, andlight curves of delayed detonation models are presented.  detailed stellar evolution calculations with a main sequence mass of 7 m_ohave been performed to test the influence of the metallicity z on the structureof the progenitor. a change of z influences the central helium burning and,consequently, the size of the c/o core which becomes a c/o white dwarf and itsc/o ratio. subsequently, the white dwarf may grow to the chandrasekhar mass andexplode as a type ia supernovae. consequently, the c/o structure of theexploding white dwarf depends on z. since c and o are the fuel for thethermonuclear explosion, z indirectly changes the energetics of the explosion.  in our example, changing z from pop i to pop ii causes a change in the zeropoint of the maximum brightness/decline relation by about $0.1^m$ and a changein the rise time by about 1 day. combined with previous studies, we provide arelation between a change of the rise time in sneia and the off-set in thebrightness/decline relation. we find that dm = dt where dm is the offset in therelation and dt is the change of the rise time in days.  this relation provides a way to detect and test for evolutionary effects, andto estimate the possible consequences for the determination of the cosmologicalconstant. however, due to uncertainties in the time evolution of the propertiesof the progenitors, we cannot predict whether evolution becomes important atz=0.5, 1 or 2. this question has to be answered by observations.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.
