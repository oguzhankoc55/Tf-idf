0812.4925	measuring interstellar magnetic fields by radio synchrotron emission	radio synchrotron emission, its polarization and its faraday rotation arepowerful tools to study the strength and structure of interstellar magneticfields. the total intensity traces the strength and distribution of totalmagnetic fields. total fields in gas-rich spiral arms and bars of nearbygalaxies have strengths of 20-30 $\mu$gauss, due to the amplification ofturbulent fields, and are dynamically important. in the milky way, the totalfield strength is about 6 $\mu$g near the sun and several 100 $\mu$g infilaments near the galactic center. -- the polarized intensity measures orderedfields with a preferred orientation, which can be regular or anisotropicfields. ordered fields with spiral structure exist in grand-design, barred,flocculent and even in irregular galaxies. the strongest ordered fields arefound in interarm regions, sometimes forming "magnetic spiral arms" between theoptical arms. halo fields are x-shaped, probably due to outflows. -- thefaraday rotation of the polarization vectors traces coherent regular fieldswhich have a preferred direction. in some galaxies faraday rotation revealslarge-scale patterns which are signatures of dynamo fields. however, in mostgalaxies the field has a complicated structure and interacts with local gasflows. in the milky way, diffuse polarized radio emission and faraday rotationof the polarized emission from pulsars and background sources show manysmall-scale and large-scale magnetic features, but the overall field structurein our galaxy is still under debate.

0906.2013	searching for dark matter in messier 33	among various approaches for indirect detection of dark matter, synchrotronemission due to secondary electrons/positrons produced in galactic wimpsannihilation is raising an increasing interest. in this paper we propose a newmethod to derive bounds in the mchi - &lt;sigmaa*v&gt; plane by using radio continuumobservations of messier 33, paying particular attention to a low emitting radiocavity. the comparison of the expected radio emission due to the galactic darkmatter distribution with the observed one provides bounds which are comparableto those obtained from a similar analysis of the milky way. remarkably, thepresent results are simply based on archival data and thus largely improvableby means of specifically tailored observations. the potentiality of the methodcompared with more standard searches is discussed by considering the optimisticsituation of a vanishing flux (within the experimental sensitivity) measuredinside the cavity by a high resolution radio telescope like alma. under thebest conditions our technique is able to produce bounds which are comparable tothe ones expected after five years of fermi lat data taking for an hadronicannihilation channel. furthermore, it allows to test the hypothesis that spacetelescopes like pamela and fermi lat are actually observing electrons andpositrons due to galactic dark matter annihilation into leptons.

0908.2985	cosmic rays and the magnetic field in the nearby starburst galaxy ngc  253: ii. the magnetic field structure	(shortened) we observed ngc 253 with the vla in d-configuration and theeffelsberg 100-m telescope using radio continuum polarimetry. observations at6.2 cm and 3.6 cm were combined to calculate the rm distribution and to correctfor faraday rotation. the large-scale magnetic field consists of a disk (r,phi) and halo (r, z) component. the disk component can be described as anaxisymmetric spiral field pointing inwards with a pitch angle of 25+/-5 degreewhich is symmetric with respect to the plane (even parity). the halo fieldshows a prominent x-shape centered on the nucleus similar to that of otheredge-on galaxies. we propose a model where the halo field lines are along acone with an opening angle of 90 +/- 30 degree and are pointing away from thedisk in both the northern and southern halo (even parity). the x-shaped halofield follows the lobes seen in halpha and soft x-ray emission. dynamo actionand a disk wind can explain the x-shaped halo field. the nuclearstarburst-driven superwind may further amplify and align the halo field bycompression of the lobes of the expanding superbubbles. the disk wind is apromising candidate for the origin of the gas in the halo and for the expulsionof small-scale helical fields as requested for efficient dynamo action.

0909.0282	transport of cosmic rays in the nearby starburst galaxy ngc 253	radio halos require the coexistence of extra-planar cosmic rays and magneticfields. because cosmic rays are injected and accelerated by processes relatedto star formation in the disk, they have to be transported from the disk intothe halo. a vertical large-scale magnetic field can significantly enhance thistransport. we observed ngc 253 using radio continuum polarimetry with theeffelsberg and vla telescopes. the radio halo of ngc 253 has a dumbbell shapewith the smallest vertical extension near the center. with an estimate for theelectron lifetime, we measured the cosmic-ray bulk speed as 300+/-30 km/s whichis constant over the extent of the disk. this shows the presence of a "diskwind" in ngc 253. we propose that the large-scale magnetic field is thesuperposition of a disk (r,phi) and a halo (r,z) component. the disk field isan inward-pointing spiral with even parity. the conical (even) halo fieldappears in projection as an x-shaped structure, as observed in other edge-ongalaxies. interaction by compression in the walls of the superbubbles mayexplain the observed alignment between the halo field and the lobes of hothalpha- and soft x-ray emitting gas. the disk wind is a good candidate for thetransport of small-scale helical fields, required for efficient dynamo action,and as a source for the neutral hydrogen observed in the halo.

0909.3001	evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies in the frame of hierarchical  structure formation cosmology: future tests with the ska	results from simulations of hierarchical structure formation cosmologyprovide a tool to develop an evolutionary model of regular magnetic fieldscoupled to galaxy formation and evolution. we use the dynamo theory to derivethe timescales of amplification and ordering of magnetic fields in disk andpuffy galaxies. galaxies similar to the milky way formed their disks at$z\approx10$ and regular fields of $\mu$g strength and a few kpc coherencelength were generated within 2 gyr (at $z\approx3$), but field ordering up tothe coherence scale of the galaxy size took another 6 gyr (at $z\approx0.5$).giant galaxies formed their disk already at $z\approx10$, allowing moreefficient dynamo generation of strong regular fields (with kpc coherencelength) already at $z\approx4$. dwarf galaxies should have hosted fullycoherent fields at $z\approx1$. this evolutionary scenario and number ofpredictions of the model can be tested by measurements of polarized synchrotronemission and faraday rotation with the planned square kilometre array. thismodel is used to simulate the evolution of regular fields in disk galaxies andthe polarized radio sky as part of the square kilometer array design studies(skads).

1002.1776	the westerbork sings survey iii. global magnetic field topology	a sample of large northern spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings)galaxies was recently observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt) at 1300-1760 mhz. in paper ii of this series, we described sensitiveobservations of the linearly polarized radio continuum emission in thiswsrt-sings galaxy sample. here we explore the systematic patterns of azimuthalmodulation of both the faraday depth and the polarized intensity and theirvariation with galaxy inclination. a self-consistent and fully general modelfor both the locations of net polarized emissivity at 1-2 ghz frequencies andthe global magnetic field topology of nearby galaxies emerges. net polarizedemissivity is concentrated into two zones located above and below the galaxymid-plane, with the back-side zone suffering substantial depolarization (by afactor of 4-5) relative to the front-side zone in its propagation through theturbulent mid-plane. the field topology, which characterizes the thick-diskemission zone is in all cases an axisymmetric spiral with a quadrupoledependence on height above the mid-plane. the front-side emission is affectedby only mild dispersion (10's of rad/m2) from the thermal plasma in the galaxyhalo, while the back-side emission is affected by additional strong dispersion(100's of rad/m2) from an axisymmetric spiral field in the galaxy mid-plane.the field topology in the upper halo of galaxies is a mix of two distincttypes: a simple extension of the axisymmetric spiral quadrupole field of thethick disk and a radially directed dipole field. the dipole component might bea manifestation of (1) a circumnuclear, bipolar outflow, (2) an in situgenerated dipole field, or (3) evidence of a non-stationary global halo.

1003.1135	small-scale dynamo action during the formation of the first stars and  galaxies. i. the ideal mhd limit	we explore the amplification of magnetic seed fields during the formation ofthe first stars and galaxies. during gravitational collapse, turbulence iscreated from accretion shocks, which may act to amplify weak magnetic fields inthe protostellar cloud. numerical simulations showed that such turbulence issub-sonic in the first star-forming minihalos, and highly supersonic in thefirst galaxies with virial temperatures larger than 10^4 k. we investigate themagnetic field amplification during the collapse both for kolmogorov andburgers-type turbulence with a semi-analytic model that incorporates theeffects of gravitational compression and small-scale dynamo amplification. wefind that the magnetic field may be substantially amplified before theformation of a disk. on scales of 1/10 of the jeans length, saturation occursafter ~10^8 yr. although the saturation behaviour of the small-scale dynamo isstill somewhat uncertain, we expect a saturation field strength of the order~10^{-7} n^{0.5} g in the first star-forming halos, with n the number densityin cgs units. in the first galaxies with higher turbulent velocities, themagnetic field strength may be increased by an order of magnitude, andsaturation may occur after 10^6 to 10^7 yr. in the kolmogorov case, themagnetic field strength on the integral scale (i.e. the scale with mostmagnetic power) is higher due to the characteristic power-law indices, but thedifference is less than a factor of 2 in the saturated phase. our results thusindicate that the precise scaling of the turbulent velocity with length scaleis of minor importance. they further imply that magnetic fields will besignificantly enhanced before the formation of a protostellar disk, where theymay change the fragmentation properties of the gas and the accretion rate.

1101.2631	optimum frequency band for radio polarisation observations	polarised radio synchrotron emission from interstellar, intracluster andintergalactic magnetic fields is affected by frequency-dependent faradaydepolarisation. the maximum polarised intensity depends on the physicalproperties of the depolarising medium. new-generation radio telescopes likelofar, ska and its precursors need a wide range of frequencies to cover thefull range of objects. the optimum frequency of maximum polarised intensity(pi) is computed for the cases of depolarisation in magneto-ionic media byregular magnetic fields (differential faraday rotation) or by turbulentmagnetic fields (internal or external faraday dispersion), assuming that thefaraday spectrum of the medium is dominated by one component or that the mediumis turbulent. polarised emission from bright galaxy disks, spiral arms andcores of galaxy clusters are best observed at wavelengths below a fewcentimeters (at frequencies beyond about 10 ghz), halos of galaxies andclusters around decimeter wavelengths (at frequencies below about 2 ghz).intergalactic filaments need observations at meter wavelengths (frequenciesbelow 300 mhz). sources with extremely large intrinsic $|rm|$ or rm dispersioncan be searched with mm-wave telescopes. measurement of the pi spectrum allowsus to derive the average faraday rotation measure $|rm|$ or the faradaydispersion within the source, as demonstrated for the case of the spiral galaxyngc 6946. periodic fluctuations in pi at low frequencies are a signature ofdifferential faraday rotation. internal and external faraday dispersion can bedistinguished by the different slopes of the pi spectrum at low frequencies. awide band around the optimum frequency is important to distinguish betweenvarieties of depolarisation effects.

1101.4647	magnetic fields in local group dwarf irregulars	we wish to clarify whether strong magnetic fields can be effectivelygenerated in typically low-mass dwarf galaxies and to assess the role of dwarfgalaxies in the magnetization of the universe. we performed a search for radioemission and magnetic fields in an unbiased sample of 12 local group (lg)irregular and dwarf irregular galaxies with the 100m effelsberg telescope at2.64 and 4.85ghz. magnetic fields in lg dwarfs are three times weaker than inthe normal spirals (&lt;4.2+-1.8mug). the production of total magnetic fieldsappears to be regulated mainly by the star-formation surface density, with thepower-law exponent of 0.30+-0.04, or by the gas surface density (with theexponent 0.47+-0.09). in addition, we find systematically stronger fields inobjects of higher global star-formation rate. the dwarf galaxies follow asimilar far-infrared relationship (with a slope of 0.91+-0.08) to thatdetermined for high surface brightness spiral galaxies. the magnetic fieldstrength in dwarf galaxies does not correlate with their maximum rotationalvelocity, indicating a small-scale rather than a large-scale dynamo process. ifmagnetization of the universe by galactic outflows is coeval with its metalenrichment, we show that more massive objects (such as lyman break galaxies)can efficiently magnetize the intergalactic medium with a magnetic fieldstrength of about 0.8ng out to a distance of 160-530kpc at redshifts 5-3,respectively. several times weaker fields and shorter magnetization distancesare expected from primordial dwarf galaxies. we also predict that moststar-forming local dwarfs might have magnetized their surroundings up to about0.1mug within about 5kpc distance. strong magnetic fields (&gt;6mug) are observedonly in dwarfs of extreme characteristics while typical lg dwarfs areunsuitable objects for the efficient supply of magnetic fields to theintergalactic medium.

1102.3558	magnetic fields during primordial star formation	recent fermi observations provide a lower limit of 10^{-15} g for themagnetic field strength in the intergalactic medium (igm). this is consistentwith theoretical expectations based on the biermann battery effect, whichpredicts such igm fields already at redshifts z~10. during gravitationalcollapse, such magnetic fields can be amplified by compression and byturbulence, giving rise to the small-scale dynamo. on scales below the jeanslength, the eddy turnover timescale is much shorter than the free-falltimescale, so that saturation can be reached during collapse. this scenario hasbeen tested and confirmed with magneto-hydrodynamical simulations following thecollapse of a turbulent, weakly magnetized cloud. based on a spectral analysis,we confirm that turbulence is injected on the jeans scale. for the powerspectrum of the magnetic field, we obtain the kazantsev slope which ischaracteristic for the small-scale dynamo. a calculation of the critical lengthscales for ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation shows that these scalesare always small enough to allow significant amplification of the magneticfield by small-scale eddies. we discuss potential implications for theprotostellar accretion disk, with particular focus on the magneto-rotationalinstability, which may change the morphology of the disk and reduce theaccretion rate by a factor of a few.

1205.0578	an observational test for correlations between cosmic rays and magnetic  fields	we derive the magnitude of fluctuations in total synchrotron intensity in themilky way and m33, from both observations and theory under various assumptionabout the relation between cosmic rays and interstellar magnetic fields. giventhe relative magnitude of the fluctuations in the galactic magnetic field (theratio of the rms fluctuations to the mean magnetic field strength) suggested byfaraday rotation and synchrotron polarization, the observations areinconsistent with local energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magneticfields. our analysis of relative synchrotron intensity fluctuations indicatesthat the distribution of cosmic rays is nearly uniform at the scales of theorder of and exceeding $100\p$, in contrast to strong fluctuations in theinterstellar magnetic field at those scales. a conservative upper limit on theratio of the the fluctuation magnitude in the cosmic ray number density to itsmean value is 0.2--0.4 at scales of order 100\,pc. our results are consistentwith a mild anticorrelation between cosmic-ray and magnetic energy densities atthese scales, in both the milky way and m33. energy equipartition betweencosmic rays and magnetic fields may still hold, but at scales exceeding 1\,kpc.therefore, we suggest that equipartition estimates be applied to the observedsynchrotron intensity smoothed to a linear scale of kiloparsec order (in spiralgalaxies) to obtain the cosmic ray distribution and a large-scale magneticfield. then the resulting cosmic ray distribution can be used to derive thefluctuating magnetic field strength from the data at the original resolution.the resulting random magnetic field is likely to be significantly stronger thanexisting estimates.

1301.5391	the equipartition magnetic field formula in starburst galaxies:  accounting for pionic secondaries and strong energy losses	equipartition arguments provide an easy way to find a characteristic scalefor the magnetic field from radio emission, by assuming the energy densities incosmic rays and magnetic fields are the same. yet most of the cosmic raycontent in star-forming galaxies is in protons, which are invisible in radioemission. therefore, the argument needs assumptions about the proton spectrum,typically that of a constant proton/electron ratio. in some environments,particularly starburst galaxies, the reasoning behind these assumptions doesnot necessarily hold: secondary pionic positrons and electrons may beresponsible for most of the radio emission, and strong energy losses can alterthe proton/electron ratio. we derive an equipartition expression that shouldwork in a hadronic loss-dominated environment like starburst galaxies.surprisingly, despite the radically different assumptions from the classicalequipartition formula, numerically the results for starburst magnetic fieldsare similar. we explain this fortuitous coincidence using the energetics ofsecondary production and energy loss times. we show that these processes causethe proton/electron ratio to be ~100 for ghz-emitting electrons in starbursts.

1301.7508	characterizing magnetized turbulence in m51	we use previously published high-resolution synchrotron polarization data toperform an angular dispersion analysis with the aim of charactering magnetizedturbulence in m51. we first analyze three distinct regions (the center of thegalaxy, and the northwest and southwest spiral arms) and can clearly discernthe turbulent correlation length scale from the width of the magnetizedturbulent correlation function for two regions and detect the imprint ofanisotropy in the turbulence for all three. furthermore, analyzing the galaxyas a whole allows us to determine a two-dimensional gaussian model for themagnetized turbulence in m51. we measure the turbulent correlation scalesparallel and perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field to be,respectively, delta_{para} = 98 +/- 5 pc and delta_{perp} = 54 +/- 3 pc, whilethe turbulent to ordered magnetic field strength ratio is found to be bt/b0 =1.01 +/- 0.04. these results are consistent with those of fletcher et al.(2011), who performed a faraday rotation dispersion analysis of the same data,and our detection of anisotropy is consistent with current magnetizedturbulence theories.

1302.5663	magnetic fields in galaxies	most of the visible matter in the universe is ionized, so that cosmicmagnetic fields are quite easy to generate and due to the lack of magneticmonopoles hard to destroy. magnetic fields have been measured in or aroundpractically all celestial objects, either by in-situ measurements ofspacecrafts or by the electromagnetic radiation of embedded cosmic rays, gas ordust. the earth, the sun, solar planets, stars, pulsars, the milky way, nearbygalaxies, more distant (radio) galaxies, quasars and even intergalactic spacein clusters of galaxies have significant magnetic fields, and even largervolumes of the universe may be permeated by "dark" magnetic fields. informationon cosmic magnetic fields has increased enormously as the result of the rapiddevelopment of observational methods, especially in radio astronomy. in themilky way, a wealth of magnetic phenomena was discovered, which are only partlyrelated to objects visible in other spectral ranges. the large-scale structureof the milky way's magnetic field is still under debate. the available data forexternal galaxies can well be explained by field amplification and ordering viathe dynamo mechanism. the measured field strengths and the similarity of fieldpatterns and flow patterns of the diffuse ionized gas give strong indicationthat galactic magnetic fields are dynamically important. they may affect theformation of spiral arms, outflows and the general evolution of galaxies. inspite of our increasing knowledge on magnetic fields, many important questionson the origin and evolution of magnetic fields, their first occurrence in younggalaxies, or the existence of large-scale intergalactic fields remainedunanswered. the present upgrades of existing instruments and several radioastronomy projects have defined cosmic magnetism as one of their key scienceprojects.

1306.6652	a new interpretation of the far-infrared - radio correlation and the  expected breakdown at high redshift	(abrigded) observations of galaxies up to z 2 show a tight correlationbetween far-infrared and radio continuum emission. we explain the far-infrared- radio continuum correlation by relating star formation and magnetic fieldstrength in terms of turbulent magnetic field amplification, where turbulenceis injected by supernova explosions from massive stars. we calculate theexpected amount of turbulence in galaxies based on their star formation rates,and infer the expected magnetic field strength due to turbulent dynamoamplification. we estimate the timescales for cosmic ray energy losses viasynchrotron emission, inverse compton scattering, ionization and bremsstrahlungemission, probing up to which redshift strong synchrotron emission can bemaintained. we find that the correlation between star formation rate andmagnetic field strength in the local universe can be understood as a result ofturbulent magnetic field amplification. if the typical gas density in theinterstellar medium increases at high z, we expect an increase of the magneticfield strength and the radio emission, as indicated by current observations.such an increase would imply a modification of the far-infrared - radiocorrelation. we expect a breakdown when inverse compton losses start dominatingover synchrotron emission. for a given star formation surface density, wecalculate the redshift where the breakdown occurs, yielding z (sigma_sfr/0.0045m_solar kpc^{-2} yr^{-1})^{1/(6-alpha/2)}. in this relation, the parameter\alpha describes the evolution of the characteristic ism density in galaxies as(1+z)^\alpha. both the possible raise of the radio emission at high redshiftand the final breakdown of the far-infrared -- radio correlation at a criticalredshift will be probed by the square kilometre array (ska) and itspathfinders, while the typical ism density in galaxies will be probed withalma.

1307.7991	how cosmic-ray electron propagation affects radio-far-infrared  correlations in m31 and m33	we investigate the effect of propagation of cosmic-ray electrons (cre) on thenonthermal (synchrotron) - far-infrared correlations in m31 and m33. thethermal (th) and nonthermal (nth) emission components of the radio continuumemission at 1.4 ghz and one higher frequency are compared with dust emissionfrom m31 and m33 using spitzer data. in both galaxies the th emission islinearly correlated with the emission from warm dust (24 \mu m, 70 \mu m), butthe power laws of the nth-fir correlations have exponents b &lt; 1 that increasewith increasing frequency. furthermore, the values of b for m33 aresignificantly smaller (b ~ 0.4) than those for m31 (b ~ 0.6). we interpret thedifferences in b as differences in the diffusion length of the cre. we estimatethe diffusion length in two ways: (1) by smoothing the nth emission at thehigher frequency until the correlation with nth emission at 1.4 ghz has b = 1,and (2) by smoothing the th emission until the correlation with the nthemission at the same frequency has b = 1, assuming that the th emissionrepresents the source distribution of the cre. our smoothing experiments showthat m31 only has a thin nth disk with a scale height of h = 0.3-0.4 kpc at 1.4ghz, whereas m33 has a similar thin disk as well as a thick disk with scaleheight h_thick ~ 2 kpc. in the thin disks, the (deprojected) diffusion lengthat 1.4 ghz is ~ 1.5 kpc, yielding a diffusion coefficient of ~ 2 10^28 cm^2/s.the structure, strength and regularity of the magnetic field in a galaxy aswell as the existence of a thick disk determine the diffusion of the cre, andhence, the power-law exponent of the nth-fir correlations.

1402.1711	the radio continuum-star formation rate relation in wsrt sings galaxies	we study the spatially resolved radio continuum-star formation rate (rc-sfr)relation using state-of-the-art star-formation (sf) tracers in a sample of 17things galaxies. we use hybrid sigma_sfr maps (galex fuv plus spitzer 24 mu),rc maps at 22/18 cm from the wsrt sings survey, and h-alpha maps to correct forthermal rc emission. we compare azimuthally averaged radial profiles of the rcand fuv/mir-based sigma_sfr maps and study pixel-by-pixel correlations at fixedlinear scales of 1.2 and 0.7 kpc. the ratio of the integrated sfrs from the rcemission to that of the fuv/mir-based sf tracers is r_int = 0.78 +/- 0.38,consistent with condon's relation. we find a tight correlation between theradial profiles of the radio and fuv/mir-based sigma_sfr for the entire extentof the disk. the ratio r of the azimuthally averaged radio to fuv/mir-basedsigma_sfr agrees with the integrated ratio with only small quasi-randomfluctuations as function of radius. pixel-by-pixel plots show a tightcorrelation in log-log diagrams of radio to fuv/mir-based sigma_sfr, with atypical standard deviation of a factor of two. averaged over our sample we find(sigma_sfr)_rc ~ (sigma_sfr)_hyb^{0.63+/-0.25} implying that data points withhigh sigma_sfr are relatively radio dim, whereas the reverse is true for lowsigma_sfr. we interpret this as a result of spectral ageing of cre, which issupported by the radio spectral index: data points dominated by young cre arerelatively radio dim, those dominated by old cre are relatively radio bright.the ratio of radio to fuv/mir-based integrated sfr is independent of globalgalaxy parameters, suggesting that we can use rc emission as a universal sftracer for galaxies, if we restrict ourselves to global or azimuthally averagedmeasurements. a magnetic field-sfr relation, b ~ sfr_hyb^{0.30+/-0.02}, holdingboth globally and locally, can explain our results.

1403.6148	enhancement of magnetic fields arising from galactic encounters	galactic encounters are usually marked by a substantial increase ofsynchrotron emission of the interacting galaxies compared to the typicalemission from similar isolated galaxies. this is believed to be associated withan increase of the star formation rate and the associated turbulent magneticfields. the regular magnetic field is usually believed to decrease. we considera simple, however rather realistic, mean-field galactic dynamo model where theeffects of small-scale generation are represented by random injections ofmagnetic field from star forming regions. we represent an encounter by theintroduction of large-scale streaming velocities and by an increase insmall-scale magnetic field injections. the latter describes the effect of anincrease of the star formation rate caused by the encounter. we demonstratethat large-scale streaming, with associated deviations in the rotation curve,can result in an enhancement of the anisotropic turbulent (ordered) magneticfield strength, mainly along the azimuthal direction, leading to a significanttemporary increase of the total magnetic energy during the encounter; therepresentation of an increase in star formation rate has an additional strongeffect. in contrast to expectations, the large-scale (regular) magnetic fieldstructure is not significantly destroyed by the encounter. it may be somewhatweakened for a relatively short period, and its direction after the encountermay be reversed. the encounter causes enhanced total and polarized emissionwithout increase of the regular magnetic field strength. the increase ofsynchrotron emission caused by the large-scale streaming can be comparable tothe effect of the increase of the star formation rate, depending on the choiceof parameters.the effects of the encounter on the total magnetic field energylast only slightly longer than the duration of the encounter (ca. 1 gyr).

1407.6998	do magnetic fields influence gas rotation in galaxies?	we aim to estimate the contribution of the radial component of the lorentzforce to the gas rotation in several types of galaxies. using typicalparameters for the exponential scale of synchrotron emission and the scalelength of hi gas, under the assumption of equipartition between the energies ofcosmic rays and total magnetic fields, we derive the lorentz force and compareit to the gravitational force in the radial component of the momentum equation.we distinguish the different contributions between the large-scale and thesmall-scale turbulent fields by reynolds averaging. we compare these findingswith a dynamical dynamo model. we find a possible reduction of circular gasvelocity in the very outer parts and an increase inside a radius of four timesthe synchrotron scale length. sufficiently localized radial reversals of themagnetic field may cause characteristic modulations in the gas rotation curvewith typical amplitudes of 10-20 km/s. it is unlikely that the magnetic fieldcontributes to the flat rotation in the outer parts of galaxies. if anything,it will \emph{impede} the gravitationally supported rotation, demanding for aneven higher halo mass to explain the observed rotation profile. we speculatethat this may have consequences for ram pressure stripping and the truncationof the stellar disc.

1503.02420	synchrotron spectral index and interstellar medium densities of  star-forming galaxies	the spectral index of synchrotron emission is an important parameter inunderstanding the properties of cosmic ray electrons (cres) and theinterstellar medium (ism). we determine the synchrotron spectral index($\alpha_{\rm nt}$) of four nearby star-forming galaxies, namely ngc 4736, ngc5055, ngc 5236 and ngc 6946 at sub-kpc linear scales. the $\alpha_{\rm nt}$ wasdetermined between 0.33 and 1.4 ghz for all the galaxies. we find the spectralindex to be flatter ($\gtrsim -0.7$) in regions with total neutral (atomic +molecular) gas surface density, $\sigma_{\rm gas} \gtrsim \rm 50~m_\odotpc^{-2}$, typically in the arms and inner parts of the galaxies. in regionswith $\sigma_{\rm gas} \lesssim \rm 50~m_\odot pc^{-2}$, especially in theinterarm and outer regions of the galaxies, the spectral index steepens sharplyto $&lt;-1.0$. the flattening of $\alpha_{\rm nt}$ is unlikely to be caused due tothermal free--free absorption at 0.33 ghz. our result is consistent with thescenario where the cres emitting at frequencies below $\sim0.3$ ghz aredominated by bremsstrahlung and/or ionization losses. for denser medium($\sigma_{\rm gas} \gtrsim \rm 200~m_\odot pc^{-2}$), having strong magneticfields ($\sim 30~\mu$g), $\alpha_{\rm nt}$ is seen to be flatter than $-0.5$,perhaps caused due to ionization losses. we find that, due to the clumpy natureof the ism, such dense regions cover only a small fraction of the galaxy($\lesssim5$ percent). thus, the galaxy-integrated spectrum may not showindication of such loss mechanisms and remain a power-law over a wide range ofradio frequencies (between $\sim 0.1$ to 10 ghz).

1504.07824	the formation of regular interarm magnetic fields in spiral galaxies	observations of regular magnetic fields in several nearby galaxies revealmagnetic arms situated between the material arms. the nature of these magneticarms is a topic of active debate. previously we found a hint that taking intoaccount the effects of injections of small-scale magnetic fields generated,e.g., by turbulent dynamo action, into the large-scale galactic dynamo canresult in magnetic arm formation. we now investigate the joint roles of anarm/interarm turbulent diffusivity contrast and injections of small-scalemagnetic field on the formation of large-scale magnetic field ("magnetic arms")in the interarm region. we use the relatively simple "no-$z$" model for thegalactic dynamo. this involves projection on to the galactic equatorial planeof the azimuthal and radial magnetic field components; the field componentorthogonal to the galactic plane is estimated from the solenoidality condition.we find that addition of diffusivity gradients to the effect of magnetic fieldinjections makes the magnetic arms much more pronounced. in particular, theregular magnetic field component becomes larger in the interarm space comparedto that within the material arms.the joint action of the turbulent diffusivitycontrast and small-scale magnetic field injections (with the possibleparticipation of other effects previously suggested) appears to be a plausibleexplanation for the phenomenon of magnetic arms.

1511.06673	chang-es vi: probing supernova energy deposition in spiral galaxies  through multi-wavelength relationships	how a galaxy regulates its sne energy into differentinterstellar/circumgalactic medium components strongly affects galaxyevolution. based on the jvla d-configuration c- (6 ghz) and l-band (1.6 ghz)continuum observations, we perform statistical analysis comparingmulti-wavelength properties of the chang-es galaxies. the high-quality jvladata and edge-on orientation enable us for the first time to include the halointo the energy budget for a complete radio-flux-limited sample. we find tightcorrelations of $l_{\rm radio}$ with the mid-ir-based sfr. the normalization ofour $i_{\rm 1.6ghz}/{\rm w~hz^{-1}}-{\rm sfr}$ relation is $\sim$2-3 times ofthose obtained for face-on galaxies, probably a result of enhanced irextinction at high inclination. we also find tight correlations between $l_{\rmradio}$ and the sne energy injection rate $\dot{e}_{\rm sn(ia+cc)}$, indicatingthe energy loss via synchrotron radio continuum accounts for $\sim0.1\%$ of$\dot{e}_{\rm sn}$, comparable to the energy contained in cr electrons. theintegrated c-to-l-band spectral index is $\alpha\sim0.5-1.1$ for non-agngalaxies, indicating a dominance by the diffuse synchrotron component. thelow-scatter $l_{\rm radio}-{\rm sfr}$/$l_{\rm radio}-\dot{e}_{\rm sn (ia+cc)}$relationships have super-linear logarithmic slopes at $\sim2~\sigma$ in l-band($1.132\pm0.067$/$1.175\pm0.102$) while consistent with linear in c-band($1.057\pm0.075$/$1.100\pm0.123$). the super-linearity could be naturallyreproduced with non-calorimeter models for galaxy disks. using chandra halox-ray measurements, we find sub-linear $l_{\rm x}-l_{\rm radio}$ relations.these results indicate that the observed radio halo of a starburst galaxy isclose to electron calorimeter, and a galaxy with higher sfr tends to distributean increased fraction of sne energy into radio emission (than x-ray).

astro-ph;0009455	radio continuum emission from m31 and m33	the radio emission from m31 (like hi, co, fir and h\alpha) is concentrated inthe '10 kpc ring', giving an impressive example that cosmic rays are producedin star-forming regions. m31 and m33 have similar strengths of the totalmagnetic field, but very different field structures: the field structure in m31is exceptionally regular while that in m33 is rather irregular compared withother spiral galaxies. in m33 the polarized intensity is highest between thespiral arms, similar to most spiral galaxies, while in m31 total and polarizedemission both emerge from the ring. star formation in m31 is probably too weakto tangle the regular field. the high regularity of the field in the m31 ringallows fast cosmic-ray propagation. as a consequence, there is no equipartitionbetween the energy densities of cosmic rays and total magnetic fields. faradayrotation measures show that the regular field in the ring is uni-directional,signature of the basic axisymmetric dynamo mode with a pitch angle of only -12degr. faraday rotation of polarized background sources shows that the regularfield and thermal gas in m31 extend to at least 25 kpc radius. the regularfield in m33 forms an open spiral, a mixture of axisymmetric and higher modes,with the largest pitch angle (\simeq 60 degr) observed in any spiral galaxy sofar. vertical filaments in the nw and se indicate interaction between the thinand the thick disk of m31. the total emission in the central region of m31follows the spiral and radial h\alpha filaments, while the polarized emissionis strongest on the inner edge of the southern spiral filament.

astro-ph;0012402	galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields	the current state of research of the galactic magnetic field is reviewedcritically. the average (equipartition) strength of the total field derivedfrom radio synchrotron data is 6 +/- 2 mug locally and about 10 +/- 3 mug at 3kpc galactic radius. these values agree well with the estimates using thelocally measured cosmic-ray energy spectrum and the radial variation of protonsderived from gamma-rays. optical and synchrotron polarization data yield astrength of the local regular field of 4 +/- 1 mug, but this value is an upperlimit if the field strength fluctuates within the beam or if anisotropic fieldsare present. pulsar rotation measures, on the other hand, give only 1.4 +/- 0.2mug, a lower limit if fluctuations in regular field strength and thermalelectron density are anticorrelated along the pathlength. the local regularfield may be part of a 'magnetic arm' between the optical arms. however, theglobal structure of the regular galactic field is not yet known. severallarge-scale field reversals in the galaxy were detected from rotation measuredata, but a similar phenomenon was not observed in external galaxies. thegalactic field may be young in terms of dynamo action so that reversals fromthe chaotic seed field are preserved, or a mixture of dynamo modes causes thereversals, or the reversals are signatures of large-scale anisotropic fieldloops. the galaxy is surrounded by a thick disk of radio continuum emission ofsimilar extent as in edge-on spiral galaxies. while the local field in the thindisk is of even symmetry with respect to the plane (quadrupole), the globalthick-disk field may be of dipole type. the galactic center region hosts highlyregular fields of up to milligauss strength which are oriented perpendicular tothe plane.

astro-ph;0307330	systematic bias in interstellar magnetic field estimates	faraday rotation of the polarization plane in magnetized thermal plasmaprovides one of the most efficient methods to deduce regular magnetic fieldsfrom radio astronomical observations. since the faraday rotation measure rm isproportional to an integral, along the line of sight, of magnetic fieldweighted with thermal electron density, rm is believed to yield the regularmagnetic field averaged over large volume. here we show that this is not thecase in a turbulent medium where fluctuations in magnetic field and electrondensity are not statistically independent, and so contribute to rm. forexample, in the case of pressure equilibrium, magnetic field can beanticorrelated with plasma density to produce a negative contribution. as aresult, the strength of the regular magnetic field obtained from rm can beunderestimated if the fluctuations in electron density and magnetic field areneglected. the anticorrelation also reduces the standard deviation of rm. wefurther discuss the effect of the positive correlations where the standardtreatment of rm leads to an overestimated magnetic field. because of theanisotropy of the turbulent magnetic field, the regular magnetic fieldsstrength, obtained from synchrotron emission using standard formulae, can beoverestimated. a positive correlation between cosmic-ray number density andmagnetic field leads to an overestimate of the strengths of the regular andtotal fields. these effects can explain the difference between the strengths ofthe regular galactic magnetic field as indicated by rm and synchrotronemissivity data and reconcile the magnetic field strength in the solar vicinitywith typical strength of regular magnetic fields in external galaxies.

astro-ph;0310287	magnetic fields in the milky way and other spiral galaxies	the average strength of the total magnetic field in the milky way, derivedfrom radio synchrotron data under the energy equipartition assumption, is 6\muglocally and \simeq 10\mug at 3 kpc galactic radius. optical and synchrotronpolarization data yield a strength of the local regular field of \simeq 4\mug(an upper limit if anisotropic fields are present), while pulsar rotationmeasures give \simeq 1.5\mug (a lower limit if small-scale fluctuations inregular field strength and in thermal electron density are anticorrelated). inspiral arms of external galaxies, the total [regular] field strength is up to\simeq 35\mug [\simeq 15\mug]. in nuclear starburst regions the total fieldreaches \simeq 50\mug. little is known about the global field structure in themilky way. the local regular field may be part of a ``magnetic arm'' betweenthe optical arms, a feature that is known from other spiral galaxies. unlikeexternal galaxies, rotation measure data indicate several global fieldreversals in the milky way, but some of these could be due to fielddistortions. the galaxy is surrounded by a thick radio disk of similar extentas around many edge-on spiral galaxies. while the regular field of the localdisk is of even symmetry with respect to the plane (quadrupole), the regularfield in the inner galaxy or in the halo may be of dipole type. the galacticcenter region hosts highly regular fields of up to milligauss strength whichare oriented perpendicular to the plane.

astro-ph;0401157	magnetic fields in merging spirals - the antennae	we present an extensive study of magnetic fields in a system of merginggalaxies. we obtained for ngc4038/39 (the antennae) radio total intensity andpolarization maps at 8.44, 4.86 and 1.49ghz using the vla in the c and dconfigurations. the radio thermal fraction was found to be about 50% at10.45ghz, higher than in normal spirals. the mean total magnetic fields in bothgalaxies are about two times stronger (20microg) than in normal spirals.however,the degree of field regularity is rather low, implying tangling of theregular component in regions with interaction-enhanced star formation. our datacombined with those in hi, halpha, x-rays and in far infrared allow us to studylocal interrelations between different gas phases and magnetic fields. wedistinguish several radio-emitting regions with different physical propertiesand at various evolutionary stages. the whole overlapping region shows acoherent magnetic field structure, probably tracing the line of collisionbetween the arms of merging spirals while the total radio emission revealshidden star formation nests. the southern part of it is a particularly intensemerger-triggered starburst. highly tangled magnetic fields reach therestrengths of 30microg, even larger than in both individual galaxies, possiblydue to compression of the original fields pulled out from the parent disks. inthe northeastern ridge, away from star-forming regions, the magnetic field ishighly coherent with a strong regular component of 10microg tracing gasshearing motions along the tidal tail. modelling faraday rotation data showthat we deal with a three-dimensionally curved structure of magnetic fields,becoming almost parallel to the sky plane in the southeastern part of theridge.

astro-ph;0507367	revised equipartition &amp; minimum energy formula for magnetic field  strength estimates from radio synchrotron observations	the commonly used classical equipartition or minimum-energy estimate of totalmagnetic fields strengths from radio synchrotron intensities is of limitedpractical use because it is based on the hardly known ratio k of the totalenergies of cosmic ray protons and electrons and also has inherent problems. wepresent a revised formula, using the number density ratio k for which we giveestimates. for particle acceleration in strong shocks k is about 40 andincreases with decreasing shock strength. our revised estimate for the fieldstrength gives larger values than the classical estimate for flat radio spectrawith spectral indices of about 0.5-0.6, but smaller values for steep spectraand total fields stronger than about 10 mug. in very young supernova remnants,for example, the classical estimate may be too large by up to 10x. on the otherhand, if energy losses of cosmic ray electrons are important, k increases withparticle energy and the equipartition field may be underestimatedsignificantly. our revised larger equipartition estimates in galaxy clustersand radio lobes are consistent with independent estimates from faraday rotationmeasures, while estimates from the ratio between radio synchrotron and x-rayinverse compton intensities generally give much weaker fields. this may beexplained e.g. by a concentration of the field in filaments. our revised fieldstrengths may also lead to major revisions of electron lifetimes in jets andradio lobes estimated from the synchrotron break frequency in the radiospectrum.

0705.4163	magnetism in the spiral galaxy ngc 6946: magnetic arms, depolarization  rings, dynamo modes and helical fields	the spiral galaxy ngc 6946 was observed in total intensity and linearpolarization in five radio bands between 3cm and 21cm. at the inner edge of theinner gas spiral arm the ordered magnetic field is only mildly compressed andturns smoothly, to become aligned along the gas arm. hence the field is notshocked and is probably connected to the warm, diffuse gas. at larger radii,two bright magnetic arms between the optical arms are visible in polarizedintensity. the field in the northern magnetic arm is almost totally aligned.faraday rotation measures (rm) in these arms are consistent with thesuperposition of two low azimuthal dynamo modes. three more magnetic arms arediscovered in the outer galaxy, located between hi arms. due to strong faradaydepolarization the galaxy is not transparent to polarized waves at 18cm and20cm. the large-scale asymmetry in depolarization with respect to the majoraxis may be another indication of large-scale helical fields. threedepolarization rings of almost zero polarization seen at 20cm are probablygenerated by differential faraday rotation in hii complexes in ngc 6946 of300-500 pc size. - in the gas/optical spiral arms, the total (mostly turbulent)magnetic field is amplified to \simeq 20\mug. its energy density is \simeq 10times larger than that of the ionized gas and is similar to that of theturbulent gas motions in the inner galaxy. the magnetic energy exceeds that ofthe turbulent energy in the outer galaxy.

astro-ph;0510708	examining the seyfert - starburst connection with arcsecond resolution  radio continuum observations	we compare the arcsecond-scale circumnuclear radio continuum propertiesbetween five seyfert and five starburst galaxies, concentrating on the searchfor any structures that could imply a spatial or causal connection between thenuclear activity and a circumnuclear starburst ring. no evidence is found inthe radio emission for a link between the triggering or feeding of nuclearactivity and the properties of circumnuclear star formation. conversely, thereis no clear evidence of nuclear outflows or jets triggering activity in thecircumnuclear rings of star formation. interestingly, the difference in theangle between the apparent orientation of the most elongated radio emission andthe orientation of the major axis of the galaxy is on average larger inseyferts than in starburst galaxies, and seyferts appear to have a largerphysical size scale of the circumnuclear radio continuum emission. theconcentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness parameters of radio continuum emissionin seyferts and starbursts are comparable, as are the radial profiles of radiocontinuum and near-infrared line emission. the circumnuclear star formation andsupernova rates do not depend on the level of nuclear activity. the radioemission usually traces the near-infrared br-gamma and h2 1-0 s(1) lineemission on large spatial scales, but locally their distributions aredifferent, most likely because of the effects of varying local magnetic fieldsand dust absorption and scattering.

astro-ph;0603531	magnetic field structure from synchrotron polarization	total magnetic fields in spiral galaxies, as observed through their totalsynchrotron emission, are strongest (up to \simeq 30\mu g) in the spiral arms.the degree of radio polarization is low; the field in the arms must be mostlyturbulent or tangled. polarized synchrotron emission shows that the resolvedregular fields are generally strongest in the interarm regions (up to \simeq15\mu g), sometimes forming 'magnetic arms' parallel to the optical arms. thefield structure is spiral in almost every galaxy, even in flocculent and brightirregular types which lack spiral arms. the observed large-scale patterns offaraday rotation in several massive spiral galaxies reveal coherent regularfields, as predicted by dynamo models. however, in most galaxies observed sofar no simple patterns of faraday rotation could be found. either many dynamomodes are superimposed and cannot be resolved by present-day telescopes, ormost of the apparently regular field is in fact anisotropic random, withfrequent reversals, due to shearing and compressing gas flows. in galaxies withmassive bars, the polarization pattern follows the gas flow. however, aroundstrong shocks in bars, the compression of the regular field is much lower thanthat of the gas; the regular field decouples from the cold gas and is strongenough to affect the flow of the diffuse warm gas. -- the average strength ofthe total magnetic field in the milky way is 6\mu g near the sun and increasesto 20-40\mu g in the galactic center region. the galactic field is mostlyparallel to the plane, except in the center region. rotation measure data frompulsars indicate several field reversals, unlike external galaxies, but somereversals could be due to distortions of the nearby field.

0810.2303	the integrated polarization of spiral galaxy disks	we present integrated polarization properties of nearby spiral galaxies at4.8 ghz, and models for the integrated polarization of spiral galaxy disks as afunction of inclination. spiral galaxies in our sample have observed integratedfractional polarization in the range &lt; 1% to 17.6%. at inclinations less than50 degrees, the fractional polarization depends mostly on the ratio of randomto regular magnetic field strength. at higher inclinations, faradaydepolarization associated with the regular magnetic field becomes moreimportant. the observed degree of polarization is lower (&lt;4%) for more luminousgalaxies, in particular those with l_{4.8} &gt; 2 x 10^{21} w/hz. the polarizationangle of the integrated emission is aligned with the apparent minor axis of thedisk for galaxies without a bar. in our axially symmetric models, thepolarization angle of the integrated emission is independent of wavelength.simulated distributions of fractional polarization for randomly oriented spiralgalaxies at 4.8 ghz and 1.4 ghz are presented. we conclude that polarizationmeasurements, e.g. with the ska, of unresolved spiral galaxies allowstatistical studies of the magnetic field in disk galaxies using large samplesin the local universe and at high redshift. as these galaxies behave asidealized background sources without internal faraday rotation, they can beused to detect large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium.

0810.3114	evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies and future observational tests  with the square kilometre array	aims. we investigate the cosmological evolution of large- and small-scalemagnetic fields in galaxies in the light of present models of formation andevolution of galaxies. methods. we use the dynamo theory to derive thetimescales of amplification and ordering of magnetic fields in disk and puffygalaxies. turbulence in protogalactic halos generated by thermal virializationcan drive an efficient turbulent dynamo. results from simulations ofhierarchical structure formation cosmology provide a tool to develop anevolutionary model of regular magnetic fields coupled with galaxy formation andevolution. results. the turbulent (small-scale) dynamo was able to amplify aweak seed magnetic field in halos of protogalaxies to a few mug strength withina few 10^8 yr. this turbulent field served as a seed to the mean-field(large-scale) dynamo. galaxies similar to the milky way formed their disks atz~10 and regular fields of mug strength and a few kpc coherence length weregenerated within 2 gyr (at z~3), but field-ordering on the coherence scale ofthe galaxy size required an additional 6 gyr (at z~0.5). giant galaxies formedtheir disks at z~10, allowing more efficient dynamo generation of strongregular fields (with kpc coherence length) already at z~4. however, the age ofthe universe is short for fully coherent fields in giant galaxies larger than15 kpc to have been achieved. dwarf galaxies should have hosted fully coherentfields at z~1. after a major merger, the strength of the turbulent field isenhanced by a factor of a few. conclusions. this evolutionary scenario can betested by measurements of polarized synchrotron emission and faraday rotationwith the planned ska. we predict an anticorrelation between galaxy size andratio between ordering scale and galaxy size (abridged).
