0902.2804	spitzer spectroscopy of the galactic supernova remnant g292.0+1.8:  structure and composition of the oxygen-rich ejecta	we present mid-infrared (5-40 micron) spectra of shocked ejecta in thegalactic oxygen-rich supernova remnant g292.0+1.8, acquired with the irsspectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope. the observations targetedtwo positions within the brightest oxygen-rich feature in g292.0+1.8. emissionlines of [ne ii] 12.8, [ne iii] 15.5, 36.0, [ne v] 24.3 and [o iv] 25.9 aredetected from the shocked ejecta. no discernible mid-ir emission from heavierspecies such as mg, si, s, ar or fe is detected in g292.0+1.8. we also detect abroad emission bump between 15 and 28 microns in spectra of the radiativelyshocked o-rich ejecta in g292.0+1.8. we suggest that this feature arises fromeither shock-heated mg2sio4 (forsterite) dust in the radiatively shocked o-richejecta, or collisional excitation of pahs in the blast wave of the snr. if theformer interpretation is correct, this would be the first mid-ir detection ofejecta dust in g292.0+1.8. a featureless dust continuum is also detected fromnon-radiative shocks in the circumstellar medium around g292.0+1.8. the mid-ircontinuum from these structures is well described by a two-component dustmodel. the temperature of the hot dust component (mass ~ 0.002 solar masses) is~ 115 k, while that of the cold component (&gt; = 3 solar masses) is ~ 35 k. weattribute the hot component to collisionally heated dust in the circumstellarshocks in g292.0+1.8, and attribute the cold component to dust heated by thehard fuv radiation from the circumstellar shocks. our models yield mid-ir linestrengths consistent with m(o)/m(ne) ~ 3, m(o)/m(si) &gt;~ 61 and m(o)/m(s) ~ 50.these ratios are difficult to reproduce with standard nucleosynthesis models ofwell-mixed sn ejecta (abridged).

0903.1440	the effect of a superoutburst on the white dwarf and disk of vw hydri as  observed with fuse	we have used fuse to obtain thirteen observations of the dwarf nova vw hyicovering the period from the end of a superoutburst through the followingnormal outburst of the system. here, we present the quiescent spectra. theycontain at least three components. the dominant component is the white dwarf(wd), which cools following the superoutburst. the amount of cooling dependssomewhat on the wd models used. for log g of 8.0, the temperature drops from24,000k just after the outburst to 20,000 k just before the normal outburst.for this model, and a distance of 65 pc, the wd radius is ~8 x 10**8 cm and vsin(i) is ~420 km/s. the fact that the derived radius is smaller than expectedfor a wd with log g=8 suggests a higher gravity wd or that vw hyi is somewhatfurther than 65 pc. either is possible given the current distance uncertaintyof +-20 pc. earlier suggestions that the wd photosphere shows evidence of cnoprocessed material are confirmed, but our analysis also shows that issuesremain in terms of analyzing the spectra of wds in such unusual physicalsituations. the second component is relatively featureless and shows modulationon the orbital (and just after outburst, the superhump) period. it is likelyassociated with the hot spot where material from the secondary encounters thedisk, rather than the boundary layer region between the inner disk and wd. thesecond component fades ~10 days after the superoutburst. there is also a thirdcomponent, clearly visible in broad emission lines of c iii 977, n iii 991,lyman beta and o vi 1032,1038, which appears to be accompanied by a flatcontinuum. the strength of the emission lines, which are almost surelyassociated with the accretion disk, appear relatively constant throughout theobservations.

0706.2663	chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33): x-ray imaging spectroscopy of  m33snr21, the brightest x-ray supernova remnant in m33	we present and interpret new x-ray data for m33snr21, the brightest x-raysupernova remnant (snr) in m33. the snr is in seen projection against (andappears to be interacting with) the bright hii region ngc592. data for thissource were obtained as part of the chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33) verylarge project. the nearly on-axis chandra data resolve the snr into a ~5"diameter (20 pc at our assumed m33 distance of 817+/-58 kpc) slightlyelliptical shell. the shell is brighter in the east, which suggests that it isencountering higher density material in that direction. the optical emission iscoextensive with the x-ray shell in the north, but extends well beyond thex-ray rim in the southwest. modeling the x-ray spectrum with an absorbed sedovmodel yields a shock temperature of 0.46(+0.01,-0.02) kev, an ionizationtimescale of n_e t = $2.1 (+0.2,-0.3) \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ s, andhalf-solar abundances (0.45 (+0.12, -0.09)). assuming sedov dynamics gives anaverage preshock h density of 1.7 +/- 0.3 cm$^{-3}$. the dynamical age estimateis 6500 +/- 600 yr, while the best fit $n_e t$ value and derived $n_e$ gives8200 +/- 1700 yr; the weighted mean of the age estimates is 7600 +/- 600 yr. weestimate an x-ray luminosity (0.25-4.5 kev) of (1.2 +/- 0.2) times $10^{37}$ergs s$^{-1}$ (absorbed), and (1.7 +/- 0.3) times $10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$(unabsorbed), in good agreement with the recent xmm-newton determination. nosignificant excess hard emission was detected; the luminosity $\le 1.2\times10^{35}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (2-8 kev) for any hard point source.

1004.2351	large amplitude variability from the persistent ultracompact x-ray  binary in ngc 1851	using archival rxte data, we show that the ultracompact x-ray binary in ngc1851 exhibits large amplitude x-ray flux varations of more than a factor of 10on timescales of days to weeks and undergoes sustained periods of months wherethe time-averaged luminosty varies by factors of two. variations of thismagnitude and timescale have not been reported previously in other ultracompactx-ray binaries. mass transfer in ultracompact binaries is thought to be drivenby gravitational radiation and the predicted transfer rates are so high thatthe disks of ultracompact binaries with orbits as short as that of this objectshould not be susceptible to ionization instabilities. therefore thevariability characteristics we observe were unexpected, and need to beunderstood. we briefly discuss a few alternatives for producing the observedvariations in light of the fact that the viscous timescale of the disk is oforder a week, comparable to the shorter time scale variation that is observedbut much less than the longer term variation. we also discuss the implicationsfor interpretation of observations of extragalactic binaries if the type ofvariability seen in the source in ngc 1851 is typical.

1007.0209	the geometry and ionization structure of the wind in the eclipsing  nova-like variables rw tri and ux uma	the uv spectra of nova-like variables are dominated by emission from theaccretion disk, modified by scattering in a wind emanating from the disk. herewe model the spectra of rw tri and ux uma, the only two eclipsing nova-likeswhich have been observed with the hubble space telescope in thefar-ultraviolet, in an attempt to constrain the geometry and the ionizationstructure of their winds. using our monte carlo radiative transfer code wecomputed spectra for simply-parameterized axisymmetric biconical outflow modelsand were able to find plausible models for both systems. these reproduce theprimary uv resonance lines - n v, si iv, and c iv - in the observed spectra inand out of eclipse. the distribution of these ions in the wind models issimilar in both cases as is the extent of the primary scattering regions inwhich these lines are formed. the inferred mass loss rates are 6% to 8% of themass accretion rates for the systems. we discuss the implication of our pointmodels for our understanding of accretion disk winds in cataclysmic variables.

1009.0280	steady x-ray synchrotron emission in the northeastern limb of sn 1006	we investigate time variations and detailed spatial structures of x-raysynchrotron emission in the northeastern limb of sn 1006, using two chandraobservations taken in 2000 and 2008. we extract spectra from a number of small(about 10") regions. after taking account of proper motion and isolating thesynchrotron from the thermal emission, we study time variations in thesynchrotron emission in the small regions. we find that there are no regionsshowing strong flux variations. our analysis shows an apparent flux decline inthe overall synchrotron flux of about 4% at high energies, but we suspect thatthis is mostly a calibration effect, and that flux is actually constant toabout 1%. this is much less than the variation found in other remnants where itwas used to infer magnetic-field strengths up to 1 mg. we attribute the lack ofvariability to the smoothness of the synchrotron morphology, in contrast to thesmall-scale knots found to be variable in other remnants. the smoothness is tobe expected for a type ia remnant encountering uniform material. finally wefind a spatial correlation between the flux and the cut-off frequency insynchrotron emission. the simplest interpretation is that the cut-off frequencydepends on the magnetic-field strength. this would require that the maximumenergy of accelerated electrons is not limited by synchrotron losses, but bysome other effect. alternatively, the rate of particle injection andacceleration may vary due to some effect not yet accounted for, such as adependence on shock obliquity.

1101.1250	dusty blastwaves of two young lmc supernova remnants: constraints on  postshock compression	we present results from mid-ir spectroscopic observations of two youngsupernova remnants (snrs) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) done with the{\it spitzer space telescope}. we imaged snrs b0509-67.5 and b0519-69.0 with{\it spitzer} in 2005, and follow-up spectroscopy presented here confirms thepresence of warm, shock heated dust, with no lines present in the spectrum. weuse model fits to {\it spitzer} irs data to estimate the density of thepostshock gas. both remnants show asymmetries in the infrared images, and weinterpret bright spots as places where the forward shock is running intomaterial that is several times denser than elsewhere. the densities we inferfor these objects depend on the grain omposition assumed, and we explore theeffects of differing grain porosity on the model fits. we also analyze archival{\it xmm-newton} rgs spectroscopic data, where both snrs show strong lines ofboth fe and si, coming from ejecta, as well as strong o lines, which may comefrom ejecta or shocked ambient medium. we use model fits to irs spectra topredict x-ray o line strengths for various grain models and values of the shockcompression ratio. for 0509-67.5, we find that compact (solid) grain modelsrequire nearly all o lines in x-ray spectra to originate in reverse-shockedejecta. porous dust grains would lower the strength of ejecta lines relative tothose arising in the shocked ambient medium. in 0519-69.0, we find significantevidence for a higher than standard compression ratio of 12, implying efficientcosmic-ray acceleration by the blast wave. a compact grain model is favoredover porous grain models. we find that the dust-to-gas mass ratio of theambient medium is significantly lower than what is expected in the ism.

1109.0204	time evolution of the reverse shock in sn 1006	the schweizer-middleditch star, located behind the sn 1006 remnant and nearits center in projection, provides the opportunity to study cold, expandingejecta within the sn 1006 shell through uv absorption. especially notable is anextremely sharp red edge to the si ii 1260 angstrom feature, which stems fromthe fastest moving ejecta on the far side of the sn 1006 shell--material thatis just encountering the reverse shock. comparing hst far-uv spectra obtainedwith cos in 2010 and with stis in 1999, we have measured the change in thisfeature over the intervening 10.5-year baseline. we find that the sharp rededge of the si ii feature has shifted blueward by 0.19 +/- 0.05 angstroms,which means that the material hitting the reverse shock in 2010 was movingslower by 44 +/- 11 km/s than the material that was hitting it in 1999, achange corresponding to - 4.2 +/- 1.0 km/s/yr. this is the first observationalconfirmation of a long-predicted dynamic effect for a reverse shock: that theshock will work its way inward through expanding supernova ejecta and encounterever slower material as it proceeds. we also find that the column density ofshocked si ii (material that has passed through the reverse shock) hasdecreased by 7 +/- 2% over the ten-year period. the decrease could indicatethat in this direction the reverse shock has been ploughing through a denseclump of si,leading to pressure and density transients.

1206.1054	dust in a type ia supernova progenitor: spitzer spectroscopy of kepler's  supernova remnant	characterization of the relatively poorly-understood progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae is of great importance in astrophysics, particularly giventhe important cosmological role that these supernovae play. kepler's supernovaremnant, the result of a type ia supernova, shows evidence for an interactionwith a dense circumstellar medium (csm), suggesting a single-degenerateprogenitor system. we present 7.5-38 $\mu$m infrared (ir) spectra of theremnant, obtained with the {\it spitzer space telescope}, dominated by emissionfrom warm dust. broad spectral features at 10 and 18 $\mu$m, consistent withvarious silicate particles, are seen throughout. these silicates were likelyformed in the stellar outflow from the progenitor system during the agb stageof evolution, and imply an oxygen-rich chemistry. in addition to silicate dust,a second component, possibly carbonaceous dust, is necessary to account for theshort-wavelength irs and irac data. this could imply a mixed chemistry in theatmosphere of the progenitor system. however, non-spherical metallic ironinclusions within silicate grains provide an alternative solution. models ofcollisionally-heated dust emission from fast shocks ($&gt;$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$)propagating into the csm can reproduce the majority of the emission associatedwith non-radiative filaments, where dust temperatures are $\sim 80-100$ k, butfail to account for the highest temperatures detected, in excess of 150 k. wefind that slower shocks (a few hundred km s$^{-1}$) into moderate densitymaterial ($n_{0} \sim 50-250$ cm$^{-3}$) are the only viable source of heatingfor this hottest dust. we confirm the finding of an overall density gradient,with densities in the north being an order of magnitude greater than those inthe south.

1211.6443	x-ray proper motions and shock speeds along the northwest rim of sn 1006	we report the results of an x-ray proper motion measurement for the nw rim ofsn1006, carried out by comparing chandra observations from 2001 and 2012. thenw limb has predominantly thermal x-ray emission, and it is the only locationin sn1006 with significant optical emission: a thin, balmer-dominated filament.for most of the nw rim, the proper motion is about 0.30 arcsec/yr, essentiallythe same as has been measured from the h-alpha filament. isolated regions ofthe nw limb are dominated by nonthermal emission, and here the proper motion ismuch higher, 0.49 arcsec/yr, close to the value measured in x-rays along themuch brighter ne limb, where the x-rays are overwhelmingly nonthermal. at the2.2 kpc distance to sn1006, the proper motions imply shock velocities of about3000 km/s and 5000 km/s in the thermal and nonthermal regions, respectively. alower velocity behind the h-alpha filament is consistent with the picture thatsn1006 is encountering denser gas in the nw, as is also suggested by itsoverall morphology. in the thermally-dominated portion of the x-ray shell, wealso see an offset in the radial profiles at different energies; the 0.5-0.6kev peak dominated by o vii is closer to the shock front than that of the 0.8-3kev emission--due to the longer times for heavier elements to reach ionizationstates where they produce strong x-ray emission.

1212.4575	the first reported infrared emission from the sn 1006 remnant	we report results of infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of thesn 1006 remnant, carried out with the spitzer space telescope. the 24 micronimage from mips clearly shows faint filamentary emission along the northwestrim of the remnant shell, nearly coincident with the balmer filaments thatdelineate the present position of the expanding shock. the 24 micron emissiontraces the balmer filaments almost perfectly, but lies a few arcsec within,indicating an origin in interstellar dust heated by the shock. subsequentdecline in the ir behind the shock is presumably due largely to graindestruction through sputtering. the emission drops far more rapidly thancurrent models predict, however, even for a higher proportion of small grainsthan would be found closer to the galactic plane. the rapid drop may result inpart from a grain density that has always been lower -- a relic effect from anearlier epoch when the shock was encountering a lower density -- but highergrain destruction rates still seem to be required. spectra from three positionsalong the nw filament from the irs instrument all show only a featurelesscontinuum, consistent with thermal emission from warm dust. the dust-to-gasmass ratio in the pre-shock interstellar medium is lower than that expected forthe galactic ism -- as has also been observed in the analysis of ir emissionfrom other snrs but whose cause remains unclear. as with other sn ia remnants,sn 1006 shows no evidence for dust grain formation in the supernova ejecta.

1402.1849	line-driven disk winds in active galactic nuclei: the critical  importance of ionization and radiative transfer	accretion disk winds are thought to produce many of the characteristicfeatures seen in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (agn) and quasi-stellarobjects (qsos). these outflows also represent a natural form of feedbackbetween the central supermassive black hole and its host galaxy. the mechanismfor driving this mass loss remains unknown, although radiation pressuremediated by spectral lines is a leading candidate. here, we calculate theionization state of, and emergent spectra for, the hydrodynamic simulation of aline-driven disk wind previously presented by proga &amp; kallman (2004). toachieve this, we carry out a comprehensive monte carlo simulation of theradiative transfer through, and energy exchange within, the predicted outflow.we find that the wind is much more ionized than originally estimated. this isin part because it is much more difficult to shield any wind regionseffectively when the outflow itself is allowed to reprocess and redirectionizing photons. as a result, the calculated spectrum that would be observedfrom this particular outflow solution would not contain the ultravioletspectral lines that are observed in many agn/qsos. furthermore, the wind is sohighly ionized that line-driving would not actually be efficient. this does notnecessarily mean that line-driven winds are not viable. however, our work doesillustrate that in order to arrive at a self-consistent model of line-drivendisk winds in agn/qso, it will be critical to include a more detailed treatmentof radiative transfer and ionization in the next generation of hydrodynamicsimulations.

1403.6601	novalike cataclysmic variables in the infrared	novalike cataclysmic variables have persistently high mass transfer rates andprominent steady state accretion disks. we present an analysis of infraredobservations of twelve novalikes obtained from the two micron all sky survey,the spitzer space telescope, and the wide-field infrared survey explorer allsky survey. the presence of an infrared excess at &gt;3-5 microns over theexpectation of a theoretical steady state accretion disk is ubiquitous in oursample. the strength of the infrared excess is not correlated with orbitalperiod, but shows a statistically significant correlation (but shallow trend)with system inclination that might be partially (but not completely) linked tothe increasing view of the cooler outer accretion disk and disk rim at higherinclinations. we discuss the possible origin of the infrared excess in terms ofemission from bremsstrahlung or circumbinary dust, with either mechanismfacilitated by the mass outflows (e.g., disk wind/corona, accretion streamoverflow, and so on) present in novalikes. our comparison of the relativeadvantages and disadvantages of either mechanism for explaining theobservations suggests that the situation is rather ambiguous, largelycircumstantial, and in need of stricter observational constraints.

1404.3218	a deep chandra acis survey of m83	we have obtained a series of deep x-ray images of the nearby galaxy m83 usingchandra, with a total exposure of 729 ks. combining the new data with earlierarchival observations totaling 61 ks, we find 378 point sources within the d25contour of the galaxy. we find 80 more sources, mostly background agn, outsideof the d25 contour. of the x-ray sources, 47 have been detected in a new radiosurvey of m83 obtained using the australia telescope compact array. of thex-ray sources, at least 87 seem likely to be supernova remnants (snrs), basedon a combination of their properties in x-rays and at other wavelengths. weattempt to classify the point source population of m83 through a combination ofspectral and temporal analysis. as part of this effort, we carry out an initialspectral analysis of the 29 brightest x-ray sources. the soft x-ray sources inthe disk, many of which are snrs, are associated with the spiral arms, whilethe harder x-ray sources, mostly x-ray binaries (xrbs), do not appear to be.after eliminating agn, foreground stars and identified snrs from the sample, weconstruct the cumulative luminosity function (clf) of xrbs brighter than 810$^{35}$ ergs/s. despite m83's relatively high star formation rate, the clfindicates that most of the xrbs in the disk are low mass xrbs.

1406.3031	spitzer observations of the type ia supernova remnant n103b: kepler's  older cousin?	we report results from spitzer observations of snr 0509-68.7, also known asn103b, a young type ia supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud thatshows interaction with a dense medium in its western hemisphere. our imagesshow that n103b has strong ir emission from warm dust in the post-shockenvironment. the post-shock gas density we derive, 45 cm$^{-3}$, is much higherthan in other type ia remnants in the lmc, though a lack of spatial resolutionmay bias measurements towards regions of higher than average density. thisdensity is similar to that in kepler's snr, a type ia interacting with acircumstellar medium. optical images show h$\alpha$ emission along the entireperiphery of the western portion of the shock, with [o iii] and [s ii] linesemitted from a few dense clumps of material where the shock has becomeradiative. the dust is silicate in nature, though standard silicate dust modelsfail to reproduce the "18 $\mu$m" silicate feature that peaks instead at 17.3$\mu$m. we propose that the dense material is circumstellar material lost fromthe progenitor system, as with kepler. if the csm interpretation is correct,this remnant would become the second member, along with kepler, of a class oftype ia remnants characterized by interaction with a dense csm hundreds ofyears post-explosion. a lack of n enhancement eliminates symbiotic agbprogenitors. the white dwarf companion must have been relatively unevolved atthe time of the explosion.

1406.3630	magnetic-field amplification in the thin x-ray rims of sn1006	several young supernova remnants (snrs), including sn1006, emit synchrotronx-rays in narrow filaments, hereafter thin rims, along their periphery. thewidths of these rims imply 50 to 100 $\mu$g fields in the region immediatelybehind the shock, far larger than expected for the interstellar mediumcompressed by unmodified shocks, assuming electron radiative losses limit rimwidths. however, magnetic-field damping could also produce thin rims. here wereview the literature on rim width calculations, summarizing the case formagnetic-field amplification. we extend these calculations to include anarbitrary power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on energy, $d\propto e^{\mu}$. loss-limited rim widths should shrink with increasing photonenergy, while magnetic-damping models predict widths almost independent ofphoton energy. we use these results to analyze chandra observations of sn 1006,in particular the southwest limb. we parameterize the full widths at halfmaximum (fwhm) in terms of energy as fwhm $\propto e^{m_e}_{\gamma}$. filamentwidths in sn1006 decrease with energy; $m_e \sim -0.3$ to $-0.8$, implyingmagnetic field amplification by factors of 10 to 50, above the factor of 4expected in strong unmodified shocks. for sn 1006, the rapid shrinkage rulesout magnetic damping models. it also favors short mean free paths (smalldiffusion coefficients) and strong dependence of $d$ on energy ($\mu \ge 1$).

1501.00030	a newly recognized very young supernova remnant in m83	as part of a spectroscopic survey of supernova remnant candidates in m83using the gemini-south telescope and gmos, we have discovered one object whosespectrum shows very broad lines at h$\alpha$, [o~i] 6300,6363, and [o~iii]4959,5007, similar to those from other objects classified as `late timesupernovae.' although six historical supernovae have been observed in m83 since1923, none were seen at the location of this object. hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 images show a nearly unresolved emission source, whilechandra and atca data reveal a bright x-ray source and nonthermal radio sourceat the position. objects in other galaxies showing similar spectra are onlydecades post-supernova, which raises the possibility that the supernova thatcreated this object occurred during the last century but was missed. usingphotometry of nearby stars from the hst data, we suggest the precursor was atleast 17 $\rm m_{sun}$, and the presence of broad h$\alpha$ in the spectrummakes a type ii supernova likely. the supernova must predate the 1983 vla radiodetection of the object. we suggest examination of archival images of m83 tosearch for evidence of the supernova event that gave rise to this object, andthus provide a precise age.

(1) wespectroscopically confirm 3 previously known or suspected cvs via the detectionof emission lines and find new evidence for dwarf nova eruptions in two ofthese. (2) only one other source in our spectroscopic sample exhibits marginalevidence for line emission, but predicted and observed cv numbers still agreeto within a factor of about 2-3. (3) we have discovered a hot (t_eff = 8700 k),low-mass (m = 0.05 m_sun) secondary star in a previously known 0.8 day binarysystem. this exotic object is probably the remnant of a subgiant that has beenstripped of its envelope and may represent the ``smoking gun'' of a recentdynamical encounter. (4) we have found a helium wd, the second to be opticallydetected in 47 tuc, and the first outside a millisecond-pulsar system. (5) wehave discovered a bs-wd binary system, the first known in any globular cluster.(6) we have found two additional candidate wd binary systems with putative mainsequence and subgiant companions. (7) we estimate the wd binary fraction in thecore of 47 tuc to be 15 +17/-9 (stat) +8/-7 (sys). (8) one bs in our sample mayexceed twice the cluster turn-off mass, but the uncertainties are large. takenas a whole, our study illustrates the wide range of stellar exotica that arelurking in the cores of gcs, most of which are likely to have undergonesignificant dynamical encounters.

1504.05590	the impact of accretion disk winds on the optical spectra of cataclysmic  variables	many high-state non-magnetic cataclysmic variables (cvs) exhibit blue-shiftedabsorption or p-cygni profiles associated with ultraviolet (uv) resonancelines. these features imply the existence of powerful accretion disk winds incvs. here, we use our monte carlo ionization and radiative transfer code toinvestigate whether disk wind models that produce realistic uv line profilesare also likely to generate observationally significant recombination line andcontinuum emission in the optical waveband. we also test whether outflows maybe responsible for the single-peaked emission line profiles often seen inhigh-state cvs and for the weakness of the balmer absorption edge (relative tosimple models of optically thick accretion disks). we find that a standard diskwind model that is successful in reproducing the uv spectra of cvs also leavesa noticeable imprint on the optical spectrum, particularly for systems viewedat high inclination. the strongest optical wind-formed recombination lines areh$\alpha$ and he ii $\lambda4686$. we demonstrate that a higher-density outflowmodel produces all the expected h and he lines and produces a recombinationcontinuum that can fill in the balmer jump at high inclinations. this modeldisplays reasonable verisimilitude with the optical spectrum of rw trianguli.no single-peaked emission is seen, although we observe a narrowing of thedouble-peaked emission lines from the base of the wind. finally, we show thateven denser models can produce a single-peaked h$\alpha$ line. on the basis ofour results, we suggest that winds can modify, and perhaps even dominate, theline and continuum emission from cvs.

1512.05730	second epoch hubble space telescope observations of kepler's supernova  remnant: the proper motions of balmer filaments	we report on the proper motions of balmer-dominated filaments in kepler'ssupernova remnant using high resolution images obtained with the hubble spacetelescope at two epochs separated by about 10 years. we use the improved propermotion measurements and revised values of shock velocities to derive a distanceto kepler of 5.1 [+0.8, -0.7] kpc. the main shock around the northern rim ofthe remnant has a typical speed of 1690 km/s and is encountering material withdensities of about 8 cm^-3. we find evidence for the variation of shockproperties over small spatial scales, including differences in the drivingpressures as the shock wraps around a curved cloud surface. we find that thebalmer filaments ahead of the ejecta knot on the northwest boundary of theremnant are becoming fainter and more diffuse. we also find that the balmerfilaments associated with circumstellar material in the interior regions of theremnant are due to shocks with significantly lower velocities and that thebrightness variations among these filaments trace the density distribution ofthe material, which may have a disk-like geometry.

0807.4155	ejecta, dust, and synchrotron radiation in b0540-69.3: a more crab-like  remnant than the crab	we present near and mid-infrared observations of the pulsar-wind nebula (pwn)b0540-69.3 and its associated supernova remnant made with the {\it spitzerspace telescope}. we report detections of the pwn with all four irac bands, the24 $\mu$m band of mips, and the infrared spectrograph (irs). we find noevidence of ir emission from the x-ray/radio shell surrounding the pwnresulting from the forward shock of the supernova blast wave. the flux of thepwn itself is dominated by synchrotron emission at shorter (irac) wavelengths,with a warm dust component longward of 20 $\mu$m. we show that this dustcontinuum can be explained by a small amount ($\sim 1-3 \times 10^{-3} \msun$)of dust at a temperature of $\sim 50-65$ k, heated by the shock wave generatedby the pwn being driven into the inner edge of the ejecta. this is evidentlydust synthesized in the supernova. we also report the detection of severallines in the spectrum of the pwn, and present kinematic information about thepwn as determined from these lines. kinematics are consistent with previousoptical studies of this object. line strengths are also broadly consistent withwhat one expects from optical line strengths. we find that lines arise fromslow ($\sim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) shocks driven into oxygen-rich clumps in the shellswept-up by an iron-nickel bubble, which have a density contrast of $\sim100-200$ relative to the bulk of the ejecta, and that faster shocks ($\sim 250$km s$^{-1}$) in the hydrogen envelope are required to heat dust grains toobserved temperatures. we infer from estimates of heavy-element ejectaabundances that the progenitor star was likely in the range of 20-25 $m_\odot$.

astro-ph;0110256	modelling the spectral signatures of accretion disk winds in cataclysmic  variables	bipolar outflows are known to be present in many disk-accreting astrophysicalsystems. in disk-dominated cataclysmic variables, these outflows areresponsible for most of the features in uv and fuv spectra. however, there havebeen very few attempts to model the features that appear in the spectra ofdisk-accreting cataclysmic variables quantitatively. the modelling that hasbeen attempted has been concentrated almost entirely on explaining the shape ofc iv.  here we describe a new hybrid monte carlo/sobolev code that allows asynthesis of the complete uv spectrum of a disk-dominated cataclysmic variable.a large range of azimuthally-symmetric wind geometries can be modelled. changesin line shape in eclipsing systems can also be studied. features in thesynthesized spectra include not only well-known resonance lines of o vi, nv, siiv, and c iv, but, with an appropriate choice of mass loss rate and windgeometry, many of the lines originating from excited lower states that areobserved in hut, fuse, and orfeus spectra. the line profiles of c iv resemblethose calculated by previous workers, when an identical geometry is assumed. wecompare the synthesized spectra to hut spectrum of z cam, showing that in thiscase a reasonably good ``fit'' to the spectrum can be obtained.

(2001). v36 has an orbital period of 0.4 or 0.8 days, blue optical colorsand is located within 1 arcsec of a chandra x-ray source. a few of theremaining cv candidates may represent chance superpositions or smc interlopers,but at least half are expected to be real cluster members with peculiar colors.however, only a few of these cv candidates are possible counterparts to chandrax-ray sources. thus it is not yet clear which, if any, of them are true cvs,rather than non-interacting ms/wd binaries or helium wds.

(200-400km/s). the most natural explanation for these spectra is that the continuumarises from a relatively massive, slowly rotating white dwarf, and that thelines are created by a combination of metals in the atmosphere and of absorbingmaterial along the line of sight to the white dwarf. if the white dwarf haslog{g}= 8.5, then the white dwarf cooled from ~25,000 k on 29 september to23,000 k in early november.

astro-ph;0307424	observations of the sw sextantis star dw ursae majoris with the far  ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer	we present an analysis of the first far-ultraviolet observations of the swsextantis-type cataclysmic variable dw ursae majoris, obtained in november 2001with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer. the time-averaged spectrum ofdw uma shows a rich assortment of emission lines (plus some contamination frominterstellar absorption lines including molecular hydrogen). accretion diskmodel spectra do not provide an adequate fit to the far-ultraviolet spectrum ofdw uma. we constructed a light curve by summing far-ultraviolet spectraextracted in 60-sec bins; this shows a modulation on the orbital period, with amaximum near photometric phase 0.93 and a minimum half an orbit later. no otherperiodic variability was found in the light curve data. we also extractedspectra in bins spanning 0.1 in orbital phase; these show substantial variationin the profile shapes and velocity shifts of the emission lines during anorbital cycle of dw uma. finally, we discuss possible physical models that canqualitatively account for the observed far-ultraviolet behavior of dw uma, inthe context of recent observational evidence for the presence of aself-occulting disk in dw uma and the possibility that the sw sex stars may bethe intermediate polars with the highest mass transfer rates and/or weakestmagnetic fields.

astro-ph;0310864	wz sge: hst spectroscopy of the cooling of the white dwarf after the  2001 outburst	following an outburst in 2001 july, the uv flux of wz sge has declined slowlytoward pre-outburst levels. here, we describe new 1150-1710 angstrom hst/stisspectra of wz sge obtained between 2002 april and 2003 march to follow thedecline. a combined analysis of these and spectra obtained in the fall of 2001show that if log g=8.5, then the white dwarf temperature decreased from 23,400k in 2001 october, shortly after the steady decline of the system began, to15,900 k 17 months later. the uv flux in 2003 march was still 2.4 times higherthan measured prior to the outburst and so the system was still recovering fromthe outburst. during this period, the shape of the spectrum and the flux fromthe system are consistent with a log g=8.5, 0.9 solar mass white dwarf at theastrometrically-determined distance to wz sge. although the spectrum from 2001september resembles that of a white dwarf with a temperature of 28,200 k, theimplied radius is smaller than in the remainder of the observations. if theentire white dwarf was visible in 2001 september, then either a secondcomponent, such as the disk emission, was distorting the spectrum, or morelikely, the temperature on the white dwarf photosphere was not uniform then.the metal lines in the spectra of wz sge have weakened with time. model fitsthat allow for material along the line of sight to the white dwarf photosphereare substantial improvements over models which assume all the lines arise fromthe photosphere. this obviates the need to explain very unusual abundanceratios in the photosphere and complicates the determination of the rotationrate of the white dwarf.

astro-ph;0405263	far ultraviolet observations of the dwarf nova vw hyi in quiescence	we present a 904-1183 a spectrum of the dwarf nova vw hydri taken with thefar ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer during quiescence, eleven days after anormal outburst, when the underlying white dwarf accreter is clearly exposed inthe far ultraviolet. however, model fitting show that a uniform temperaturewhite dwarf does not reproduce the overall spectrum, especially at the shortestwavelengths. a better approximation to the spectrum is obtained with a modelconsisting of a white dwarf and a rapidly rotating ``accretion belt''. thewhite dwarf component accounts for 83% of the total flux, has a temperature of23,000k, a v sin i = 400 km/s, and a low carbon abundance. the best-fitaccretion belt component accounts for 17% of the total flux, has a temperatureof about 48,000-50,000k, and a rotation rate vrot sin i around 3,000-4,000km/s. the requirement of two components in the modeling of the spectrum of vwhyi in quiescence helps to resolve some of the differences in interpretation ofultraviolet spectra of vw hyi in quiescence. however, the physical existence ofa second component (and its exact nature) in vw hyi itself is still relativelyuncertain, given the lack of better models for spectra of the inner disk in aquiescent dwarf nova.

astro-ph;0410292	time-resolved ultraviolet spectroscopy of the sw sex star dw uma:  confirmation of a hidden white dwarf and the uv counterpart to phase 0.5  absorption events	we present time-resolved, ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy of the sw sex star dwuma in the high state. we confirm that, shortward of 1500 \aa, the high-state,uv continuum level is lower than the white dwarf (wd)-dominated low-statelevel. we also do not see the wd contact phases in the high state eclipse lightcurves. these results confirm our earlier finding that the wd in this system ishidden from view in the high state. based on this, we caution that eclipsemapping of high-inclination sw sex stars in the high state may yield incorrector misleading results. in the context of dw uma, we demonstrate explicitly thatdistance estimates obtained by recent eclipse mapping studies cannot bereconciled with the wd-dominated low-state spectrum. we also show that thefluxes of the uv emission lines in the high state drop near orbital phase 0.5.this is the first detection of a uv counterpart to the class-defining phase 0.5absorption seen in the optical emission lines of sw sex stars.

astro-ph;0412501	the far ultraviolet spectrum of z cam in quiescence	we have obtained far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (905-1187 angstrom)spectra of the non-magnetic cataclysmic variable z cam during a period ofquiescence. the spectrum resembles that of a hot (57,000 k) metal-enrichedwhite dwarf. a high effective temperature is consistent with the expectationthat dwarf nova systems that show standstills, as z cam does, have higher thannormal time-averaged mass accretion rates. it is also consistent with currentestimates for the mass and distance to z cam. a white dwarf model in which 29%of the surface has a temperature of 72,000 k and the rest of the surface is at26,000 k also reproduces the spectral shape and the continuum flux level at thenominal distance and wd mass, and is a somewhat better statistical fit to thedata. a second component could be due to a rotating accretion belt, a remnantof an outburst that ended eleven days prior to the fuse observation, or ongoingaccretion. we favor the uniform temperature model for z cam, largely becausethe data do not require anything more complicated. we have compared thequiescent spectrum with an archival spectrum of z cam in standstill, obtainedwith orfeus. the standstill spectrum is described well by a disk accreting at arate of 7(-2,+4) 10**16 gm/s, where the errors depend on the assumedinclination.  the quiescent spectra cover a full orbital period and are time-resolved to500 s. no variability was observed in the continuum during the observation, butthe depth of many of the absorption lines increased between orbital phases 0.65and 0.81. we attribute this effect to absorption by material associated withthe accretion stream, which is easier to understand if the inclination is nearthe maximum allowed value of 68 degrees.

astro-ph;0504583	revealing the supernova remnant population of m33 with chandra	we present results of a search for supernova remnants (snrs) in archivalchandra images of m33. we have identified x-ray snrs by comparing the list ofchandra, x-ray sources in m33 with tabulations of snr candidates identifiedfrom (1) elevated [s ii]/halpha ratios in the optical, and (2) radio spectralindices. of the 98 optically known snrs in m33, 22 have been detected at &gt;3-sigma level in the soft band (0.35-1.1 kev). at least four of these snrcandidates are spatially extended based on a comparison of the data tosimulated images of point sources. aside from the optically matching snrs, wehave found one soft x-ray source in m33 which exhibits no optical emission andis coincident with a known radio source. the radio spectral index of thissource is consistent with particle acceleration in shocks, leading us tosuggest that it is a non-radiative snr. we have also found new opticalcounterparts to two soft x-ray snrs in m33. pending confirmation from opticalspectroscopy, the identification of these two optical counterparts increasesthe total number of known optically emitting snrs in m33 to 100. this bringsthe total number of identified snrs with x-ray counterparts, including thoseexclusively detected by the xmm-newton survey of m33, to 37 snrs. we find thatwhile there are a similar number of confirmed x-ray snrs in m33 and the lmcwith x-ray luminosities in excess of 1e35 ergs/s, nearly 40% of the lmc snrsare brighter than 1e36 ergs/s, while only 13% of the m33 sample exceed thisluminosity. the differences in luminosity distributions cannot be fullyexplained by uncertainty in spectral model parameters, and is not fullyaccounted for by abundance differences between the galaxies (abridged).

astro-ph;0512078	far-flung filaments of ejecta in the young supernova remnant g292.0+1.8	new optical images of the young snr g292.0+1.8, obtained from the 0.9-mtelescope at ctio, show a more extensive network of filaments than had beenknown previously. filaments emitting in [o iii] are distributed throughout muchof the 8 arcmin diameter shell seen in x-ray and radio images, including a fewat the very outermost shell limits. we have also detected four small complexesof filaments that show [s ii] emission along with [oiii]. in a single long-slitspectrum we find variations of almost an order of magnitude in the relativestrengths of oxygen and sulfur lines, which must result from abundancevariations. none of the filaments, with or without [s ii], shows any evidencefor hydrogen, so all appear to be fragments of pure sn ejecta. the [s ii]filaments provide the first evidence for undiluted products of oxygen burningin the ejecta from the supernova that gave rise to g292.0+1.8. some oxygenburning must have occurred, but the paucity of [s ii]-emitting filamentssuggests that either the oxygen burning was not extensive or that most of itsproducts have yet to be excited. most of the outer filaments exhibit radial,pencil-like morphologies that suggest an origin as rayleigh-taylor fingers ofejecta, perhaps formed during the explosion. simulations of core-collapsesupernovae predict such fingers, but these have never before been so clearlyobserved in a young snr. the total flux from the snr in [oiii] 5007 is 5.4 *10**-12 ergs/cm**2/s. using a distance of 6 kpc and an extinction correctioncorresponding to e(b-v) = 0.6 (lower than previous values but more consistentboth with our data and radio and x-ray estimates of nh), this leads to aluminosity of 1.6 * 10**35 ergs/s in the 5007 ang. line.

astro-ph;0602313	dust destruction in type ia supernova remnants in the large magellanic  cloud	we present first results from an extensive survey of magellanic cloudssupernova remnants (snrs) with the spitzer space telescope. we describe iracand mips imaging observations at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8, 24, and 70 microns of fourbalmer-dominated type ia snrs in the large magellanic cloud (lmc): dem l71(0505-67.9), 0509--67.5, 0519--69.0, and 0548-70.4. none was detected in thefour short-wavelength irac bands, but all four were clearly imaged at 24microns, and two at 70 microns. a comparison of these images to chandrabroadband x-ray images shows a clear association with the blast wave, and notwith internal x-ray emission associated with ejecta. our observations are welldescribed by 1-d shock models of collisionally heated dust emission, includinggrain size distributions appropriate for the lmc, grain heating by collisionswith both ions and electrons, and sputtering of small grains. model parametersare constrained by x-ray, optical, and far-ultraviolet observations. our modelscan reproduce observed 70/24 micron flux ratios only by including sputtering,destroying most grains smaller than 0.03-0.04 microns in radius. we infer totaldust masses swept up by the snr blast waves, before sputtering, of order 0.01solar masses, several times less than those implied by a dust/gas mass ratio of0.3 percent as often assumed for the lmc. substantial dust destruction hasimplications for gas-phase abundances.

astro-ph;0605266	fuse spectroscopy of the white dwarf in u geminorum	observations of u gem with fuse confirm that the wd is heated by the outburstand cools during quiescence. at the end of an outburst, the best uniformtemperature wd model fits to the data indicate a temperature of 41,000 - 47,000k, while in mid-quiescence, the temperature is 28,000 - 31,000 k, depending onthe gravity assumed for the wd. photospheric abundance patterns at the end ofthe outburst and in mid-quiescence show evidence of cno processing. improvedfits to the spectra can be obtained assuming there is a hotter, heated portionof the wd, presumably an accretion belt, with a temperature of 60,000 - 70,000k occupying 14-32% of the surface immediately after outburst. however, otherrelatively simple models for the second component fit the data just as well andthere is no obvious signature that supports the hypothesis that the secondcomponent arises from a separate region of the wd surface. hence, otherphysical explanations still must be considered to explain the time evolution ofthe spectrum of u gem in quiescence. strong orbital phase dependent absorption,most likely due to gas above the disk, was observed during the mid-quiescencespectrum. this material, which can be modeled in terms of gas with atemperature of 10,000-11,000 k and a density of 10**13 cm**-3, has a columndensity of ~2 10**21 cm**-2 at orbital phase 0.6-0.85, and is probably the samematerial that has been observed to cause dips in the lightcurve at x-raywavelengths in the past. the discrepancy described by naylor et al. (2005)between the radius of the wd derived on the one hand by the uv spectralanalysis and the distance to u gem, and on the other, by the orbital elementsand the gravitational redshift remains a serious problem.

astro-ph;0606175	the james webb space telescope	the james webb space telescope (jwst) is a large (6.6m), cold (50k),infrared-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the nextdecade. the observatory will have four instruments: a near-infrared camera, anear-infrared multi-object spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will coverthe wavelength range, 0.6 to 5.0 microns, while the mid-infrared instrumentwill do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 to 29 microns. the jwst sciencegoals are divided into four themes. the end of the dark ages: first light andreionization theme seeks to identify the first luminous sources to form and todetermine the ionization history of the early universe. the assembly ofgalaxies theme seeks to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars,metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved fromthe epoch of reionization to the present day. the birth of stars andprotoplanetary systems theme seeks to unravel the birth and early evolution ofstars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetarysystems. the planetary systems and the origins of life theme seeks to determinethe physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own,and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. toenable these observations, jwst consists of a telescope, an instrument package,a spacecraft and a sunshield. the telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments,some of which are deployed. the segments will be brought into optical alignmenton-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. the jwstoperations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and themajority of jwst observing time will be allocated to the internationalastronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.
