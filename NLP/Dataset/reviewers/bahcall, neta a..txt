0903.3230	clustering of low-redshift (z &lt;= 2.2) quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we present measurements of the quasar two-point correlation function,\xi_{q}, over the redshift range z=0.3-2.2 based upon data from the sdss. usinga homogeneous sample of 30,239 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts from thedr5 quasar catalogue, our study represents the largest sample used for thistype of investigation to date. with this redshift range and an areal coverageof approx 4,000 deg^2, we sample over 25 h^-3 gpc^3 (comoving) assuming thecurrent lcdm cosmology. over this redshift range, we find that theredshift-space correlation function, xi(s), is adequately fit by a singlepower-law, with s_{0}=5.95+/-0.45 h^-1 mpc and \gamma_{s}=1.16+0.11-0.16 whenfit over s=1-25 h^-1 mpc. using the projected correlation function we calculatethe real-space correlation length, r_{0}=5.45+0.35-0.45 h^-1 mpc and\gamma=1.90+0.04-0.03, over scales of rp=1-130 h^-1 mpc. dividing the sampleinto redshift slices, we find very little, if any, evidence for the evolutionof quasar clustering, with the redshift-space correlation length stayingroughly constant at s_{0} ~ 6-7 h^-1 mpc at z&lt;2.2 (and only increasing atredshifts greater than this). comparing our clustering measurements to thosereported for x-ray selected agn at z=0.5-1, we find reasonable agreement insome cases but significantly lower correlation lengths in others. we find thatthe linear bias evolves from b~1.4 at z=0.5 to b~3 at z=2.2, withb(z=1.27)=2.06+/-0.03 for the full sample. we compare our data to analyticalmodels and infer that quasars inhabit dark matter haloes of constant mass m ~2x 10^12 h^-1 m_sol from redshifts z~2.5 (the peak of quasar activity) to z~0.[abridged]

0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al. (2008) supernova sample, we find \omega_{tot} = 1.011 +/- 0.009and w = -0.99 +/- 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equationof state w.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0908.2598	the baryonic acoustic feature and large-scale clustering in the sdss lrg  sample	we examine the correlation function \xi of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) luminous red galaxy sample (lrg) at large scales (60&lt;s&lt;400 mpc/h) usingthe final data release (dr7; 105,831 lrgs between 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47). using mockcatalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and largerscale signal are consistent with lcdm at the 1.5\sigma level. the signal at155&lt;s&lt;200 mpc/h tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; thisslight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the lrgs. fittingdata to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain thepeak position at s_p=103.6+3.6-2.4 mpc/h when fitting the range 60&lt;s&lt;150 mpc/h(1\sigma uncertainties measured from the mocks. this redshift-space distances_p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r_s after taking intoaccount matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxyclustering bias. mock catalogs show that the probability that a dr7-sizedsample would not have an identifiable peak is at least 10%. as a consistencycheck of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s_p to obtain the distanced_v=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3) relative to the acoustic scale. we findr_s/d_v(z=0.278)=0.1394+-0.0049. this result is in excellent agreement withpercival et. al (2009), who examine roughly the same data set, but using thepower spectrum. comparison with other determinations in the literature are alsoin very good agreement. we have tested our results against a battery ofpossible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimatedsample variance.

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

0709.1153	cross-correlation weak lensing of sdss galaxy clusters i: measurements	this is the first in a series of papers on the weak lensing effect caused byclusters of galaxies in sloan digital sky survey. the photometrically selectedcluster sample, known as maxbcg, includes ~130,000 objects between redshift 0.1and 0.3, ranging in size from small groups to massive clusters. we split theclusters into bins of richness and luminosity and stack the surface densitycontrast to produce mean radial profiles. the mean profiles are detected over arange of scales, from the inner halo (25 kpc/h) well into the surrounding largescale structure (30 mpc/h), with a significance of 15 to 20 in each bin. thesignal over this large range of scales is best interpreted in terms of thecluster-mass cross-correlation function. we pay careful attention to sources ofsystematic error, correcting for them where possible. the resulting signals arecalibrated to the ~10% level, with the dominant remaining uncertainty being theredshift distribution of the background sources. we find that the profilesscale strongly with richness and luminosity. we find the signal within a givenrichness bin depends upon luminosity, suggesting that luminosity is moreclosely correlated with mass than galaxy counts. we split the samples byredshift but detect no significant evolution. the profiles are not welldescribed by power laws. in a subsequent series of papers we invert theprofiles to three-dimensional mass profiles, show that they are well fit by ahalo model description, measure mass-to-light ratios and provide a cosmologicalinterpretation.

1203.1088	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. vi. constraints on dark  energy and the evolution of massive galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the final lens sample from the sloandigital sky survey quasar lens search (sqls). the number distribution of acomplete subsample of 19 lensed quasars selected from 50,836 source quasars iscompared with theoretical expectations, with particular attention to theselection function. assuming that the velocity function of galaxies does notevolve with redshift, the sqls sample constrains the cosmological constant to\omega_\lambda=0.79^{+0.06}_{-0.07}(stat.)^{+0.06}_{-0.06}(syst.) for a flatuniverse. the dark energy equation of state is found to be consistent with w=-1when the sqls is combined with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) measurements or results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap). we also obtain simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters andredshift evolution of the galaxy velocity function, finding no evidence forredshift evolution at z&lt;1 in any combinations of constraints. for instance,number density evolution quantified as \nu_n=d\ln\phi_*/d\ln(1+z) and thevelocity dispersion evolution \nu_\sigma=d\ln\sigma_*/d\ln(1+z) are constrainedto \nu_n=1.06^{+1.36}_{-1.39}(stat.)^{+0.33}_{-0.64}(syst.) and\nu_\sigma=-0.05^{+0.19}_{-0.16}(stat.)^{+0.03}_{-0.03}(syst.) respectivelywhen the sqls result is combined with bao and wmap for flat models with acosmological constant. we find that a significant amount of dark energy ispreferred even after fully marginalizing over the galaxy evolution parameters.thus the statistics of lensed quasars robustly confirm the accelerated cosmicexpansion.

1310.0022	tracing mass and light in the universe: where is the dark matter?	how is mass distributed in the universe? how does it compare with thedistribution of light and stars? we address these questions by examining thedistribution of mass, determined from weak lensing observations, and starlight,around $&gt;10^5$ sdss maxbcg groups and clusters as a function of environment andscale, from deep inside clusters to large cosmic scales of $22 h^{-1}$ mpc. theobserved cumulative mass-to-light profile, $m/l (&lt; r)$, rises on small scales,reflecting the increasing $m/l$ of the central bright galaxy of the cluster,then flattens to a nearly constant ratio on scales above $\sim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc,where light follows mass on all scales and in all environments. a trend ofslightly decreasing $m/l (r)$ with scale is shown to be consistent with thevarying stellar population following the morphology-density relation. thissuggests that stars trace mass remarkably well even though they represent onlya few percent of the total mass. we determine the stellar mass fraction andfind it to be nearly constant on all scales above $\sim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc, with$m_{*}/m_{tot} \simeq 1.0\pm0.4\%$. we further suggest that most of the darkmatter in the universe is located in the large halos of individual galaxies($\sim 300$ kpc for $l^{*}$ galaxies); we show that the entire $m/l (r)$profile -- from groups and clusters to large-scale structure -- can beaccounted for by the aggregate masses of the individual galaxies (whose halosmay be stripped off but still remain in the clusters), plus gas. we use theobserved mass-to-light ratio on large scales to determine the mass density ofthe universe: $\omega_{m} = 0.24 \pm 0.02 \times b_{m/l}^{2} = 0.26 \pm 0.02.$

1401.3009	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: modeling of the luminosity and colour dependence in the  data release 10	we investigate the luminosity and colour dependence of clustering of cmassgalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey tenth data release. the halo occupation distribution framework isadopted to model the projected two-point correlation function measurements onsmall and intermediate scales (from $0.02$ to $60\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) and tointerpret the observed trends and infer the connection of galaxies to darkmatter halos. we find that luminous red galaxies reside in massive halos ofmass $m{\sim}10^{13}$--$10^{14}\,h^{-1}{\rm m_\odot}$ and more luminousgalaxies are more clustered and hosted by more massive halos. the strongsmall-scale clustering requires a fraction of these galaxies to be satellitesin massive halos, with the fraction at the level of 5--8 per cent anddecreasing with luminosity. the characteristic mass of a halo hosting onaverage one satellite galaxy above a luminosity threshold is about a factor$8.7$ larger than that of a halo hosting a central galaxy above the samethreshold. at a fixed luminosity, progressively redder galaxies are morestrongly clustered on small scales, which can be explained by having a largerfraction of these galaxies in the form of satellites in massive halos. ourclustering measurements on scales below $0.4\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$ allow us tostudy the small-scale spatial distribution of satellites inside halos. whilethe clustering of luminosity-threshold samples can be well described by anavarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, that of the reddest galaxies prefers asteeper or more concentrated profile. finally, we also use galaxy samples ofconstant number density at different redshifts to study the evolution ofluminous galaxies, and find the clustering to be consistent with passiveevolution in the redshift range of $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$.

1405.0537	gas loss in simulated galaxies as they fall into clusters	we use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulationsto gain insights on how galaxies lose their cold gas at low redshift as theymigrate from the field to the high density regions of clusters of galaxies. wefind that beyond three cluster virial radii, the fraction of gas-rich galaxiesis constant, representing the field. within three cluster-centric radii, thefraction of gas-rich galaxies declines steadily with decreasing radius,reaching $\mathbf{&lt;10%}$ near the cluster center. our results suggest thatgalaxies start to feel the impact of the cluster environment on their gascontent well beyond the cluster virial radius. we show that almost all gas-richgalaxies at the cluster virial radius are falling in for the first time atnearly radial orbits. furthermore, we find that almost no galaxy moving outwardat the cluster virial radius is gas-rich (with gas to baryon ratio greater than$\mathbf{1%}$). these results suggest that galaxies that fall into clusterslose their cold gas within a single radial round-trip.

1509.06376	detecting effects of filaments on galaxy properties in the sloan digital  sky survey iii	we study the effects of filaments on galaxy properties in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data release 12 using filaments from the `cosmic webreconstruction' catalogue (chen et al. 2015a), a publicly available filamentcatalogue for sdss. since filaments are tracers of medium-to-high densityregions, we expect that galaxy properties associated with the environment aredependent on the distance to the nearest filament. our analysis demonstrates ared galaxy or a high-mass galaxy tend to reside closer to filaments than a blueor low-mass galaxy. after adjusting the effect from stellar mass, on average,late-forming galaxies or large galaxies have a shorter distance to filamentsthan early-forming galaxies or small galaxies. for the main galaxy sample, allsignals are very significant ($&gt; 5\sigma$). for the lowz and cmass samples,most of the signals are significant (with $&gt; 3\sigma$). the filament effects weobserve persist until z = 0.7 (the edge of the cmass sample). comparing ourresults to those using the galaxy distances from redmapper galaxy clusters as areference, we find a similar result between filaments and clusters. ourfindings illustrate the strong correlation of galaxy properties with proximityto density ridges, strongly supporting the claim that density ridges are goodtracers of filaments.

astro-ph;0008401	discovery of a close pair of z = 4.25 quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we report the discovery of a pair of z = 4.25 quasars with a separation of 33arcseconds. the brighter of the two objects was identified as a high-redshiftquasar candidate from sloan digital sky survey multicolor imaging data, and theredshift was measured from a spectrum obtained with the hobby-eberly telescope.the slit orientation of this observation {\it by chance} included anotherquasar, approximately one magnitude fainter and having the same redshift as thetarget. this is the third serendipitous discovery of a z &gt; 4 quasar. thedifferences in the relative strengths and profiles of the emission linessuggest that this is a quasar pair and not a gravitational lens. the twoobjects are likely to be physically associated; the projected physicalseparation is approximately 210 $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc and the redshifts areidentical to $\approx$ 0.01, implying a radial physical separation of 950$h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc or less. the existence of this pair is strong circumstantialevidence that $z \sim 4$ quasars are clustered.

astro-ph;0011376	evolution of the cluster mass function: gpc^3 dark matter simulations	high-resolution n-body simulations of four popular cold dark mattercosmologies (lcdm, ocdm, qcdm, and tilted scdm), each containing 10^5 clustersof galaxies in a cubic gigaparsec volume, are used to determine the evolutionof the cluster mass function from z=3 to z=0. the large volume and highresolution of these simulations allow an accurate measure of the evolution ofcosmologically important (but rare) massive clusters at high redshift. thesimulated mass function is presented for cluster masses within several radiitypically used observationally (r=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mpc/h, both comoving andphysical) in order to enable direct comparison with current and futureobservations. the simulated evolution is compared with current observations ofmassive clusters at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8. the omega_m=1 tilted scdm model, whichexhibits very rapid evolution of the cluster abundance, produces too fewclusters at z&gt;0.3 and no massive clusters at z&gt;0.5, in stark contradiction withobservations. the omega_m=0.3 models- lcdm, ocdm, and qcdm- all exhibitconsiderably weaker evolution and are consistent with current data. among theselow density models, ocdm evolves the least. these trends are enhanced at highredshift and can be used to discriminate between flat and open low densitymodels. the simulated mass functions are compared with the press-schechterapproximation. standard press-schechter predicts too many low mass clusters atz=0, and too few clusters at higher redshift. we modify the approximation by asimple parameterization of the density contrast threshold for collapse, whichhas a redshift dependence. this modified press-schechter approximation providesa good fit to the simulated mass functions.

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0109366	antibias in clusters: the dependence of m/l on cluster temperature	we show that the observed mass-to-light ratio of galaxy clusters increaseswith cluster temperature as expected from cosmological simulations. contrary toprevious observational suggestions, we find a mild but robust increase of m/lfrom poor (t = 1 - 2 kev) to rich (t = 12 kev) clusters; over this range, themean m/l_v increases by a factor of about 2. the best fit relation satisfiesm/l_v = (170 +- 30) t(kev)^(0.3 +- 0.1) h at z=0, with a large scatter. thistrend confirms predictions from cosmological simulations which show that therichest clusters are antibiased, with a higher ratio of mass per unit lightthan average. the antibias increases with cluster temperature. the effect iscaused by the relatively older age of the high-density clusters, where lighthas declined more significantly than average since their earlier formationtime. combining the current observations with simulations, we find a globalvalue of m/l_v = 240 +- 50 h, and a corresponding mass density of the universeof omega_m = 0.17 +- 0.05.

astro-ph;0110259	detecting clusters of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i : monte  carlo comparison of cluster detection algorithms	we present a comparison of three cluster finding algorithms from imaging datausing monte carlo simulations of clusters embedded in a 25 deg^2 region ofsloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging data: the matched filter (mf; postmanet al. 1996), the adaptive matched filter (amf; kepner et al. 1999) and acolor-magnitude filtered voronoi tessellation technique (vtt). among the twomatched filters, we find that the mf is more efficient in detecting faintclusters, whereas the amf evaluates the redshifts and richnesses moreaccurately, therefore suggesting a hybrid method (hmf) that combines the two.the hmf outperforms the vtt when using a background that is uniform, but it ismore sensitive to the presence of a non-uniform galaxy background than is thevtt; this is due to the assumption of a uniform background in the hmf model. wethus find that for the detection thresholds we determine to be appropriate forthe sdss data, the performance of both algorithms are similar; we present theselection function for each method evaluated with these thresholds as afunction of redshift and richness. for simulated clusters generated with aschechter luminosity function (m_r^* = -21.5 and alpha = -1.1) both algorithmsare complete for abell richness &gt;= 1 clusters up to z ~ 0.4 for a samplemagnitude limited to r = 21. while the cluster parameter evaluation shows amild correlation with the local background density, the detection efficiency isnot significantly affected by the background fluctuations, unlike previousshallower surveys.

astro-ph;0110383	the alignment effect of brightest cluster galaxies in the sdss	one of the most vital observational clues for unraveling the origin ofbrightest cluster galaxies (bcg) is the observed alignment of the bcgs withtheir host cluster and its surroundings. we have examined the bcg-clusteralignment effect, using clusters of galaxies detected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we find that the bcgs are preferentially aligned with theprincipal axis of their hosts, to a much higher redshift (z &gt;~ 0.3) than probedby previous studies (z &lt;~ 0.1). the alignment effect strongly depends on themagnitude difference of the bcg and the second and third brightest clustermembers: we find a strong alignment effect for the dominant bcgs, while lessdominant bcgs do not show any departure from random alignment with respect tothe cluster. we therefore claim that the alignment process originates from thesame process that makes the bcg grow dominant, be it direct mergers in theearly stage of cluster formation, or a later process that resembles thegalactic cannibalism scenario. we do not find strong evidence for (or against)redshift evolution between 0&lt;z&lt;0.45, largely due to the insufficient samplesize (&lt; 200 clusters). however, we have developed a framework by which we canexamine many more clusters in an automated fashion for the upcoming sdsscluster catalogs, which will provide us with better statistics for systematicinvestigations of the alignment with redshift, richness and morphology of boththe cluster and the bcg.

astro-ph;0112482	the cut &amp; enhance method : selecting clusters of galaxies from the sdss  commissioning data	we describe an automated method, the cut &amp; enhance method (ce) for detectingclusters of galaxies in multi-color optical imaging surveys. this method usessimple color cuts, combined with a density enhancement algorithm, to up-weightpairs of galaxies that are close in both angular separation and color. themethod is semi-parametric since it uses minimal assumptions about clusterproperties in order to minimize possible biases. no assumptions are made aboutthe shape of clusters, their radial profile or their luminosity function. themethod is successful in finding systems ranging from poor to rich clusters ofgalaxies, of both regular and irregular shape. we determine the selectionfunction of the ce method via extensive monte carlo simulations which use boththe real, observed background of galaxies and a randomized background ofgalaxies. we use position shuffled and color shuffled data to perform the falsepositive test. we have also visually checked all the clusters detected by thece method. we apply the ce method to the 350 deg^2 of the sdss (sloan digitalsky survey) commissioning data and construct a sdss ce galaxy cluster catalogwith an estimated redshift and richness for each cluster. the ce method iscompared with other cluster selection methods used on sdss data such as thematched filter (postman et al. 1996, kim et al. 2001), maxbcg technique (anniset al. 2001) and voronoi tessellation (kim et al. 2001). the ce method can beadopted for cluster selection in any multi-color imaging surveys.

astro-ph;0204383	dynamical confirmation of sdss weak lensing scaling laws	galaxy masses can be estimated by a variety of methods; each applicable indifferent circumstances, and each suffering from different systematicuncertainties. confirmation of results obtained by one technique with analysisby another is particularly important. recent sdss weak lensing measurements ofthe projected-mass correlation function reveal a linear relation between galaxyluminosities and the depth of their dark matter halos (measured on 260 \hinvkpc scales). in this work we use an entirely independent dynamical method toconfirm these results. we begin by assembling a sample of 618 relativelyisolated host galaxies, surrounded by a total of 1225 substantially faintersatellites. we observe the mean dynamical effect of these hosts on the motionsof their satellites by assembling velocity difference histograms. dividing thesample by host properties, we find significant variations in satellite velocitydispersion with host luminosity. we quantify these variations using a simpledynamical model, measuring \mtsd a dynamical mass within 260 \hinv kpc. theappropriateness of this mass reconstruction is checked by conducting a similaranalysis within an n-body simulation. comparison between the dynamical andlensing mass-to-light scalings shows reasonable agreement, providing somequantitative confirmation for the lensing results.

astro-ph;0205490	the cluster mass function from early sdss data: cosmological  implications	the mass function of clusters of galaxies is determined from 400 deg^2 ofearly commissioning imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey; ~300 clustersin the redshift range z = 0.1 - 0.2 are used. clusters are selected using twoindependent selection methods: a matched filter and a red-sequence colormagnitude technique. the two methods yield consistent results. the cluster massfunction is compared with large-scale cosmological simulations. we find abest-fit cluster normalization relation of sigma_8*omega_m^0.6 = 0.33 +- 0.03(for 0.1 ~&lt; omega_m ~&lt; 0.4), or equivalently sigma_8 = (0.16/omega_m)^0.6. theamplitude of this relation is significantly lower than the previous canonicalvalue, implying that either omega_m is lower than previously expected (omega_m= 0.16 if sigma_8 = 1) or sigma_8 is lower than expected (sigma_8 = 0.7 ifomega_m = 0.3). the best-fit mass function parameters are omega_m = 0.19(+0.08,-0.07) and sigma_8 = 0.9 (+0.3,-0.2). high values of omega_m (&gt;= 0.4)and low sigma_8 (=&lt; 0.6) are excluded at &gt;~ 2 sigma.

astro-ph;0206146	two-dimensional topology of the sloan digital sky survey	we present the topology of a volume-limited sample of 11,884 galaxies,selected from an apparent-magnitude limited sample of over 100,000 galaxiesobserved as part of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the data currentlycover three main regions on the sky: one in the galactic north and one in thesouth, both at zero degrees declination, and one area in the north at higherdeclination. each of these areas covers a wide range of survey longitude but anarrow range of survey latitude, allowing the two dimensional genus to bemeasured.  the genus curves of the sdss sub-samples are similar, after appropriatelynormalizing these measurements for the different areas. we sum the genus curvesfrom the three areas to obtain the total genus curve of the sdss. the totalcurve has a shape similar to the genus curve derived from mock catalogs drawnfrom the hubble volume lambda cdm simulation and is similar to that of agaussian random field. likewise, comparison with the genus of the 2dfgrs, afternormalization for the difference in area, reveals remarkable similarity in thetopology of these samples.  we test for the effects of galaxy type segregation by splitting the sdss datainto thirds, based on the u^*- r^* colors of the galaxies, and measure thegenus of the reddest and bluest sub-samples. this red/blue split in u^*- r^* isessentially a split by morphology (strateva et al. 2001). we find that thegenus curve for the reddest galaxies exhibits a ``meatball'' shift of thetopology -- reflecting the concentration of red galaxies in high densityregions -- compared to the bluest galaxies and the full sample, in agreementwith predictions from simulations.

astro-ph;0210215	the galaxy luminosity function and luminosity density at redshift z=0.1	using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in fiveoptical bandpasses corresponding to the sdss bandpasses shifted to match theirrestframe shape at z=0.1. we denote the bands {0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r},{0.1}{i}, {0.1}{z}, with \lambda_{eff} = [3216, 4240, 5595, 6792, 8111]angstroms respectively. we use a maximum likelihood method which allows for ageneral form for the shape of the luminosity function, simple luminosity andnumber evolution, incorporates flux uncertainties, and accounts for the fluxlimits of the survey. we find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute abmagnitudes in a mpc^3 of [-14.10 \pm 0.15, -15.18 \pm 0.03, -15.90 \pm 0.03,-16.24 \pm 0.03, -16.56 \pm 0.02] in [{0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r}, {0.1}{i},{0.1}{z}], respectively, using \omega_0 =0.3, \omega_\lambda=0.7, and h=1, andusing petrosian magnitudes. similar results are obtained using sersic modelmagnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the petrosian apertures is not amajor correction. in the {0.1}{r} band, the best fit schechter function to ourresults has \phi_\ast = (1.49 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-2} h^3 mpc^{-3}, m_\ast -5\log_{10} h = -20.44 \pm 0.01, and \alpha = -1.05\pm 0.01. in solarluminosities, the luminosity density in {0.1}{r} is (1.84 \pm 0.04) h 10^8l_{{0.1}{r},\odot} mpc^{-3}. our results are consistent with other estimates ofthe luminosity density, from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey andthe millenium galaxy catalog. they represent a substantial change (\sim 0.5mag) from earlier sdss luminosity density results based on commissioning data,almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosityfunction model.

astro-ph;0301302	the morphological butcher-oemler effect in the sdss cut&amp;enhance galaxy  cluster catalog	we investigate the evolution of the fractions of late type cluster galaxiesas a function of redshift, using one of the largest, most uniform clustersamples available. the sample consists of 514 clusters of galaxies in the range0.02&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the sloan digital sky survey cut &amp; enhance galaxy clustercatalog. this catalog was created using a single automated cluster findingalgorithm on uniform data from a single telescope, with accurate ccdphotometry, thus, minimizing selection biases. we use four independent methodsto analyze the evolution of the late type galaxy fraction. specifically, weselect late type galaxies based on: restframe g-r color, u-r color, galaxyprofile fitting and concentration index. the first criterion corresponds to theone used in the classical butcher-oemler analyses. the last three criteria aremore sensitive to the morphological type of the galaxies. in all four cases, wefind an increase in the fraction of late type galaxies with increasingredshift, significant at the 99.9% level. the results confirm that clustergalaxies do change colors with redshift (the butcher-oemler effect) and, inaddition, they change their morphology to later-type toward higher redshift --indicating a morphological equivalent of the butcher-oemler effect. we alsofind a tendency of richer clusters to have lower fractions of late typegalaxies. the trend is consistent with a ram pressure stripping model, wherericher clusters have more effective ram pressure due to their highertemperature.

astro-ph;0305093	a large, uniform sample of x-ray emitting agn: selection approach and an  initial catalog from the rosat all-sky and sloan digital sky surveys	many open questions in x-ray astronomy are limited by the relatively smallnumber of objects in uniform optically-identified samples, especially when raresubclasses are considered, or subsets isolated to search for evolution orcorrelations between wavebands. we describe initial results of a program aimedto ultimately yield 10^4 x-ray source identifications--a sample about an orderof magnitude larger than earlier efforts. the technique employs x-ray data fromthe rosat all-sky survey (rass), and optical imaging and spectroscopic followupfrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). optical objects in the sdss catalogsare automatically cross-correlated with rass x-ray source positions; thenpriorities for follow-on sdss optical spectra of candidate counterparts areautomatically assigned using an algorithm based on the known fx/fopt ratios forvarious classes of x-ray emitters. sdss parameters for optical morphology,magnitude, colors, plus first radio data, serve as proxies for object class.  initial application of this approach to 1400 deg^2 of sky provides a catalogof 1200 spectroscopically confirmed quasars/agn that are probable rassidentifications. most of the ids are new, and only a few percent of the agn arelikely to be random superpositions. the magnitude and redshift ranges of thecounterparts extend over 15&lt;m&lt;21 and 0.03&lt;z&lt;3.6. although most ids are quasarsand sy 1s, a variety of other agn subclasses are also sampled. substantialnumbers of rare agn are found, including more than 130 narrow-line seyfert 1sand 45 bl lac candidates. these results already provide a sizeable set of newids, show utility of the sample in multi-waveband studies, and demonstrate thecapability of the rass/sdss approach to efficiently proceed towards the largesthomogeneously selected/observed sample of x-ray emitting agn. abridged abstract

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0309544	evolution of the cluster correlation function	we study the evolution of the cluster correlation function and itsrichness-dependence from z = 0 to z = 3 using large-scale cosmologicalsimulations. a standard flat lcdm model with \omega_m = 0.3 and, forcomparison, a tilted \omega_m = 1 model, tscdm, are used. the evolutionarypredictions are presented in a format suitable for direct comparisons withobservations. we find that the cluster correlation strength increases withredshift: high redshift clusters are clustered more strongly (in comovingscale) than low redshift clusters of the same mass. the increased correlationswith redshift, in spite of the decreasing mass correlation strength, is causedby the strong increase in cluster bias with redshift: clusters represent higherdensity peaks of the mass distribution as the redshift increases. therichness-dependent cluster correlation function, presented as thecorrelation-scale versus cluster mean separation relation, r_0 - d, is found tobe, remarkably, independent of redshift to z &lt;~ 2 for lcdm and z &lt;~ 1 for tcdm(for a fixed correlation function slope and cluster mass within a fixedcomoving radius). the non-evolving r_0 - d relation implies that both thecomoving clustering scale and the cluster mean separation increase withredshift for the same mass clusters so that the r_0 - d relation remainsessentially unchanged. the evolution of the r_0 - d relation from z ~ 0 to z ~3 provides an important new tool in cosmology; it can be used to breakdegeneracies that exist at z ~ 0 and provide precise determination ofcosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0411250	discovery of two gravitationally lensed quasars with image separations  of 3 arcseconds from the sloan digital sky survey	we report the discovery of two doubly-imaged quasars, sdssj100128.61+502756.9 and sdss j120629.65+433217.6, at redshifts of 1.838 and1.789 and with image separations of 2.86'' and 2.90'', respectively. theobjects were selected as lens candidates from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). based on the identical nature of the spectra of the two quasars in eachpair and the identification of the lens galaxies, we conclude that the objectsare gravitational lenses. the lenses are complicated; in both systems there areseveral galaxies in the fields very close to the quasars, in addition to thelens galaxies themselves. the lens modeling implies that these nearby galaxiescontribute significantly to the lens potentials. on larger scales, we havedetected an enhancement in the galaxy density near sdss j100128.61+502756.9.the number of lenses with image separation of ~3'' in the sdss already exceedsthe prediction of simple theoretical models based on the standardlambda-dominated cosmology and observed velocity function of galaxies.

astro-ph;0504510	detection of cosmic magnification with the sloan digital sky survey	we present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by thevariation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground largescale structure. to make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees ofphotometric observations from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containing\~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. our measurement of the galaxy-quasarcross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence andchange in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number countsthat is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. weshow that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, galactic dustextinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are wellcontrolled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. by weighting thequasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation ofquasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at &gt;4 sigmain all five sdss filters. our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scalesranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions based on the wmap concordance cosmology. as with galaxy-galaxylensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide usefulconstraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.

astro-ph;0601346	percolation galaxy groups and clusters in the sdss redshift survey:  identification, catalogs, and the multiplicity function	we identify galaxy groups and clusters in volume-limited samples of the sdssredshift survey, using a redshift-space friends-of-friends algorithm. weoptimize the friends-of-friends linking lengths to recover galaxy systems thatoccupy the same dark matter halos, using a set of mock catalogs created bypopulating halos of n-body simulations with galaxies. extensive tests withthese mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sightlinking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneouslyrecover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, andvelocity dispersion. we adopt a linking length combination that yields, forgalaxy groups with ten or more members: a group multiplicity function that isunbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiasedmedian relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associatedhalos; a spurious group fraction of less than ~1%; a halo completeness of morethan ~97%; the correct projected size distribution as a function ofmultiplicity; and a velocity dispersion distribution that is ~20% too low atall multiplicities. these results hold over a range of mock catalogs that usedifferent input recipes of populating halos with galaxies. we apply ourgroup-finding algorithm to the sdss data and obtain three group and clustercatalogs for three volume-limited samples that cover 3495.1 square degrees onthe sky. we correct for incompleteness caused by fiber collisions and surveyedges, and obtain measurements of the group multiplicity function, with errorscalculated from realistic mock catalogs. these multiplicity functionmeasurements provide a key constraint on the relation between galaxypopulations and dark matter halos.

astro-ph;9311061	resolving the beta-discrepancy for clusters of galaxies	previous comparisons of optical and x-ray observations of clusters ofgalaxies have lead to the so-called ``$\beta$ - discrepancy'' that haspersisted for the last decade. the standard hydrostatic-isothermal model forclusters predicts that the parameter $\beta_{spec} = \sigma_{r}^{2}/(kt/\mum_{p})$, which describes the ratio of energy per unit mass in galaxies to thatin the gas, should equal the parameter $\beta_{fit}$ (where $\rho_{gas}(r)\propto \rho_{gal}(r)^{\beta_{fit}}$) determined from the x-ray surfacebrightness distribution. the observations suggest an apparent discrepancy :$\beta_{spec} \sim 1.2$ (i.e., the galaxies are ``hotter'' than the gas) while$\beta_{fit} \sim 0.65$ (i.e., the gas is ``hotter'' and more extended than thegalaxies). here we show that the discrepancy is resolved when the actualobserved galaxy distribution in clusters is used, $\rho_{gal}(r) \proptor^{-2.4 \pm 0.2}$, instead of the previously assumed steeper kingapproximation, $\rho_{gal}(r) \propto r^{-3}$. using a large sample ofclusters, we find best-fit mean values of $\beta_{spec} = 0.94 \pm 0.08$ and$\beta_{fit}^{corrected} = 1.25 \times \beta_{fit} = 0.84 \pm 0.10$. theseresults resolve the $\beta$ - discrepancy and provide support for thehydrostatic cluster model.

astro-ph;9602149	the peculiar velocity function of galaxy clusters	the peculiar velocity function of clusters of galaxies is determined using anaccurate sample of cluster velocities based on tully-fisher distances of scgalaxies (giovanelli et al 1995b). in contrast with previous results based onsamples with considerably larger velocity uncertainties, the observed velocityfunction does not exhibit a tail of high velocity clusters. the resultsindicate a low probability of $\lesssim$\,5\% of finding clusters withone-dimensional velocities greater than $\sim$ 600 {\kms}. the root-mean-squareone-dimensional cluster velocity is 293$\pm$28 {\kms}. the observed clustervelocity function is compared with expectations from different cosmologicalmodels. the absence of a high velocity tail in the observed function is mostconsistent with a low mass-density ($\omega \sim$0.3) cdm model, and isinconsistent at $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ level with $\omega$= 1.0 cdm and hdm models.the root-mean-square one-dimensional cluster velocities in these modelscorrespond, respectively, to 314, 516, and 632 {\kms} (when convolved with theobservational uncertainties). comparison with the observed rms cluster velocityof 293$\pm$28 {\kms} further supports the low-density cdm model.

astro-ph;9611148	clusters and superclusters of galaxies	rich clusters of galaxies are the most massive virialized systems known. eventhough they contain only a small fraction of all galaxies, rich clustersprovide a powerful tool for the study of galaxy formation, dark matter,large-scale structure, and cosmology. superclusters, the largest known systemsof galaxies, extend to (approx) 100h^{-1} mpc in size and highlight thelarge-scale structure of the universe. this large-scale structure reflectsinitial conditions in the early universe and places strong contraints on modelsof galaxy formation and on cosmology. some of the questions that can beaddressed with clusters and superclusters of galaxies include: how did galaxiesand larger structures form and evolve? what is the amount, composition, anddistribution of matter in clusters and larger structures? how does the clustermass density relate to the matter density in the universe? what constraints canthe cluster and supercluster data place on cosmology? i will discuss in theselectures some of the properties of clusters and superclusters of galaxies thatcan be used to investigate these topics.

astro-ph;9706018	constraining omega with cluster evolution	we show that the evolution of the number density of rich clusters of galaxiesbreaks the degeneracy between omega (the mass density ratio of the universe)and sigma_{8} (the normalization of the power spectrum), sigma_{8}omega^{0.5}\simeq 0.5, that follows from the observed present-day abundance of richclusters. the evolution of high-mass (coma-like) clusters is strong in omega=1,low-sigma_{8} models (such as the standard biased cdm model with sigma_{8}\simeq 0.5), where the number density of clusters decreases by a factor of \sim10^{3} from z = 0 to z \simeq 0.5; the same clusters show only mild evolutionin low-omega, high-sigma_{8} models, where the decrease is a factor of \sim 10.this diagnostic provides a most powerful constraint on omega. usingobservations of clusters to z \simeq 0.5-1, we find only mild evolution in theobserved cluster abundance. we find omega = 0.3 \pm 0.1 and sigma_{8} = 0.85\pm 0.15 (for lambda = 0 models; for omega + lambda = 1 models, omega = 0.34\pm 0.13). these results imply, if confirmed by future surveys, that we live ina low-den sity, low-bias universe.

astro-ph;9709265	determining the amplitude of mass fluctuations in the universe	we present a method for determining the rms mass fluctuations on 8 h^-1 mpcscale, sigma8. the method utilizes the rate of evolution of the abundance ofrich clusters of galaxies. using the press-schechter approximation, we showthat the cluster abundance evolution is a strong function of sigma8: d log n/dz~ -1/sigma8^2; low sigma8 models evolve exponentially faster than high sigma8models, for a given mass cluster. for example, the number density of coma-likeclusters decreases by a factor of ~10^3$ from z = 0 to z ~ 0.5 for sigma8=0.5models, while the decrease is only a factor of ~5 for sigma8 ~ 1. the strongexponential dependence on sigma8 arises because clusters represent rarerdensity peaks in low sigma8 models. we show that the evolution rate at z &lt; 1 isinsensitive to the density parameter $\omega$ or to the exact shape of thepower spectrum. cluster evolution therefore provides a powerful constraint onsigma8. using available cluster data to z ~ 0.8, we find sigma8 = 0.83 +/-0.15. this amplitude implies a bias parameter b ~ 1/sigma8 = 1.2 +/- 0.2, i.e.,a nearly unbiased universe with mass approximately tracing light on largescales.

0810.4144	quasar clustering from sdss dr5: dependences on physical properties	using a homogenous sample of 38,208 quasars with a sky coverage of $4000 {\rmdeg^2}$ drawn from the sdss data release five quasar catalog, we study thedependence of quasar clustering on luminosity, virial black hole mass, quasarcolor, and radio loudness. at $z&lt;2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly onluminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\sim10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. these weak dependences areconsistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,virial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted anyclustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantitythat best correlates with clustering strength. however, the most luminous andmost massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\sim 2\sigma$ level)than the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase ofthe bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos. we do not observe a strongdependence of clustering strength on quasar colors within our sample. on theother hand, radio-loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio-quietquasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity (or virial black hole mass),consistent with local observations of radio galaxies and radio-loud type 2 agn.thus radio-loud quasars reside in more massive and denser environments in thebiased halo clustering picture. using the sheth et al.(2001) formula for thelinear halo bias, the estimated host halo mass for radio-loud quasars is $\sim10^{13} h^{-1}m_\odot$, compared to $\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1}m_\odot$ forradio-quiet quasar hosts at $z\sim 1.5$.
