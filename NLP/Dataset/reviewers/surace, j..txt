0903.0102	galaxy stellar mass assembly between 0.2&lt;z&lt;2 from the s-cosmos survey	we follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral typein the cosmos 2-deg^2 field. we derive the stellar mass functions and stellarmass densities from z=2 to z=0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at f(3.6micron) &gt; 1 microjy with accurate photometric redshifts(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i&lt;22.5). using a spectral classification, wefind that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly ofquiescent galaxies. their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex betweenz=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (delta t ~2.5 gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 andz~0.1 (delta t ~ 6 gyr). then, we add the morphological information and findthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(m)~11) have an ellipticalmorphology at z&lt;0.8. therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of starformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a spi/irrmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(m)~9.5), but this fraction is smallerthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. wealso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. we find that the mostmassive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phasefirst. finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomeslower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z&lt;1. as aconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the mostmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z&lt;1, which could explain theobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

0905.2518	resolved dust emission in a quasar at z=3.65	we present submillimetre observations of the z=3.653 quasar sdss160705+533558together with data in the optical and infrared. the object is unusually brightin the far-ir and submm with an ir luminosity of ~10^14 l_sun. we ascribe thisluminosity to a combination of agn and starburst emission, with the starburstforming stars at a rate of a few thousand solar masses per year. submillimetrearray (sma) imaging observations with a resolution ~1" show that the submm (850micron) emission is extended on scales of 10--35kpc and is offset from theoptical position by ~10 kpc. this morphology is dissimilar to that found insubmm galaxies, which are generally un- or marginally resolved on arcsecondscales, or submm-luminous agn where the agn lies at the peak of the submm ormolecular emission. the simplest explanation is that the object is in the earlystages of a merger between a gas rich galaxy, which hosts the starburst, and agas-poor agn-host galaxy, which is responsible for the quasar emission. it isalso possible that jet induced star formation might contribute to the unusualmorphology.

0906.5350	the palomar transient factory: system overview, performance and first  results	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a fully-automated, wide-field surveyaimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. the transientsurvey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the48-inch samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory; colors and light curvesfor detected transients are obtained with the automated palomar 60-inchtelescope. ptf uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-mtelescope time. with an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth ofapproximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in r (5 sigma, median seeing). four majorexperiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernovasearch; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day;3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in orion; and 4) a3-pi sr deep h-alpha survey. ptf provides automatic, realtime transientclassification and follow up, as well as a database including every sourcedetected in each frame. this paper summarizes the ptf project, includingseveral months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, theobserving plans and the data reduction strategy. we conclude by detailing thefirst 51 ptf optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.

0909.4303	deep spitzer 24mic cosmos imaging -- i. the evolution of luminous dusty  galaxies - confronting the models	we present the first results obtained from the identification of ~30,000sources in the 24mic observations of the cosmos field at s24&gt;~80mujy. usingaccurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolvewith unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-ir background across cosmicages. we find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originatefrom galaxies at z&lt;~1 and z&lt;~2 respectively, supporting the scenario wherehighly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z&gt;~2) contribute onlymarginally to the cib. assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection stronglyincreases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forminggalaxies have undergone with lookback time. nonetheless this rising trend showsa clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by thecomplexity of seds in the mid-ir. finally, we compare our results with thepredictions from different models of galaxy formation. we note thatsemi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributionsobserved at 24mic. furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit r-k colors muchbluer than observed and the predicted k-band fluxes are systematicallyunderestimated at z&gt;0.5. unless these discrepancies result from an incorrecttreatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicteddensity of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would pointto more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in thesimulations. the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonablywell the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although noneof them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts.

0910.5649	mid- and far-infrared luminosity functions and galaxy evolution from  multiwavelength spitzer observations up to z~2.5	[abridged]we exploit a large homogeneous dataset to derive a self-consistentpicture of ir emission based on the time-dependent 24, 15, 12 and 8micronmonochromatic and bolometric ir luminosity functions (lf) over the 0&lt;z&lt;2.5redshift range. our analysis is based on the combination of data from deepspitzer surveys in the vvds-swire and goods areas. to our limiting flux ofs(24)=400microjy our derived sample in vvds-swire includes 1494 sources, and666 and 904 sources brighter than s(24)=80microjy are catalogued in goods-s andgoods-n, respectively, for a total area of ~0.9 square degs. we obtain reliableoptical identifications and redshifts, providing us a rich and robust datasetfor our luminosity function determination. based on the multi-wavelengthinformation available, we constrain the lfs at 8, 12, 15 and 24micron. we alsoextrapolate total ir luminosities from our best-fit to the observed seds ofeach source, and use this to derive the bolometric lf and comoving volumeemissivity up to z~2.5. in the 0&lt;z&lt;1 interval, the bolometric ir luminositydensity evolves as (1+z)^3.8+/-0.4. although more uncertain at higher-z, ourresults show a flattening of the ir luminosity density at z&gt;1. the meanredshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: thebrighest ir galaxies appear to be forming stars earlier in cosmic time (z&gt;1.5),while the less luminous ones keep doing it at more recent epochs (z~1 forl(ir)&lt;10^11l_sun). our results suggest a rapid increase of the galaxy ircomoving volume emissivity back to z~1 and a constant average emissivity atz&gt;1. we also seem to find a difference in the evolution rate of the sourcenumber densities as a function of luminosity, a downsizing evolutionary patternsimilar to that reported from other samples of cosmic sources.

0910.5824	the optical spectra of spitzer 24 micron galaxies in the cosmos field:  ii. faint infrared sources in the zcosmos-bright 10k catalogue	we have used the zcosmos-bright 10k sample to identify 3244 spitzer/mips24-micron-selected galaxies with 0.06&lt; s(24um)&lt; 0.50 mjy and i(ab)&lt;22.5, over1.5 deg^2 of the cosmos field, and studied different spectral properties,depending on redshift. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3, we found that different reddening laws ofcommon use in the literature explain the dust extinction properties of around80% of our infrared (ir) sources, within the error bars. for up to 16% ofobjects, instead, the halpha/hbeta ratios are too high for their ir/uvattenuations, which is probably a consequence of inhomogenous dustdistributions. in only a few of our galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3 the ir emission couldbe mainly produced by dust heated by old rather than young stars. besides, theline ratios of ~22% of our galaxies suggest that they might bestar-formation/nuclear-activity composite systems. at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.7, we estimatedgalaxy metallicities for 301 galaxies: at least 12% of them are securely belowthe upper-branch mass-metallicity trend, which is consistent with the localrelation. finally, we performed a combined analysis of the hdeltaequivalent-width versus dn(4000) diagram for 1722 faint and bright 24umgalaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0, spanning two decades in mid-ir luminosity. we foundthat, while secondary bursts of star formation are necessary to explain theposition of the most luminous ir galaxies in that diagram, quiescent,exponentially-declining star formation histories can well reproduce thespectral properties of ~40% of the less luminous sources. our results suggest atransition in the possible modes of star formation at total ir luminositiesl(tir)=(3 +/-2)x10^11 lsun.

0911.4515	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field i: spectral energy distributions and luminosities	we present a large robust sample of 1503 reliable and unconfused 70micromselected sources from the multiwavelength data set of the cosmic evolutionsurvey (cosmos). using the spitzer irac and mips photometry, we estimate thetotal infrared luminosity, l_ir (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fittemplate from several different template libraries. the long wavelength 70 and160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of l_ir, accurate towithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. the 70 micron data point enables asignificant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24micron detection. the full sample spans a wide range in l_ir, l_ir ~ 10^8-10^14l_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. we identify a total of 687luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,ulirgs, and hylirgs) over the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;3.5 with a median redshiftof 0.5. presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each ofthe sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (fir). using sed fits we find possibleevidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.however, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peakof emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. we use theseseds, along with the deep radio and x-ray coverage of the field, to identify alarge sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that thefraction of agn increases strongly with l_ir, as it does in the local universe,and that nearly 70% of ulirgs and all hylirgs likely host a powerful agn.

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1006.4956	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field ii: the role of mergers in galaxy evolution	we analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 micronselected galaxies in the cosmos field spanning the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt; 3.5with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of10^8&lt;l_ir&lt;10^14l_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. in generalthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 m_sun, andluminous, with -25&lt;m_k&lt;-20. we find a strong correlation between the fractionof major mergers and l_ir, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being upto 50%. we also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with l_ir.minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity forsources with low luminosities. the precise fraction of mergers in any givenl_ir bin varies by redshift due to sources at z&gt;1 being difficult to classifyand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers canonly be considered lower limits. at z&lt;1, where the morphologicalclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ulirgpopulation (50-80%) and are important for the lirg population (25-40%). at z&gt;1the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ulirgs. although thegeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local(u)lirgs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.this is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at highredshift. we argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed andthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (u)lirgphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals(&lt;10^12 m_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

1104.3612	spitzer irac low surface brightness observations of the virgo cluster	we present 3.6 and 4.5 micron spitzer irac imaging over 0.77 square degreesat the virgo cluster core for the purpose of understanding the formationmechanisms of the low surface brightness intracluster light features.instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds that are hundreds of times higherthan the signal were carefully characterized and removed. we examine bothintracluster light plumes as well as the outer halo of the giant ellipticalm87. for two intracluster light plumes, we use optical colors to constraintheir ages to be greater than 3 &amp; 5 gyr, respectively. upper limits on the iracfluxes constrain the upper limits to the masses, and optical detectionsconstrain the lower limits to the masses. in this first measurement of mass ofintracluster light plumes we find masses in the range of 5.5 x 10^8 - 4.5 x10^9 and 2.1 x 10^8 - 1.5 x 10^9 solar masses for the two plumes for which wehave coverage. given their expected short lifetimes, and a constant productionrate for these types of streams, integrated over virgo's lifetime, they canaccount for the total icl content of the cluster implying that we do not needto invoke icl formation mechanisms other than gravitational mechanisms leadingto bright plumes. we also examined the outer halo of the giant elliptical m87.the color profile from the inner to outer halo of m87 (160 kpc) is consistentwith either a flat or optically blue gradient, where a blue gradient could bedue to younger or lower metallicity stars at larger radii. the similarity ofthe age predicted by both the infrared and optical colors (&gt; few gyr) indicatesthat the optical measurements are not strongly affected by dust extinction.

0710.0300	the contribution of very massive high-redshift swire galaxies to the  stellar mass function	(abridged) we selected high-z massive galaxies at 5.8 microns, in the swireelais-s1 field (1 sq. deg.). galaxies with the 1.6 microns stellar peakredshifted into the irac bands (z~1-3, called ``ir-peakers'') were identified.stellar masses were derived by means of spectro-photometric fitting and used tocompute the stellar mass function (mf) at z=1-2 and 2-3. a parametric fit tothe mf was performed, based on a bayesian formalism, and the stellar massdensity of massive galaxies above z=2 determined. we present the firstsystematic study of the very-massive tail of the galaxy stellar mass functionat high redshift. a total of 326 sources were selected. the majority of thesegalaxies have stellar masses in excess of 1e11 msun and lie at z&gt;1.5. theavailability of mid-ir data turned out to be a valuable tool to constrain thecontribution of young stars to galaxy seds, and thus their m(stars)/l ratio.the influence of near-ir data and of the chosen stellar library on the sedfitting are also discussed. a significant evolution is found not only forgalaxies with m~1e11 msun, but also in the highest mass bins considered. thecomoving number density of these galaxies was lower by more than a factor of 10at z=2-3, with respect to the local estimate. swire 5.8 micron peakers moremassive than 1.6x1e11 msun provide 30-50% of the total stellar mass density ingalaxies at z=2-3.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1108.4037	ultra steep spectrum radio sources in the lockman hole: servs  identifications and redshift distribution at the faintest radio fluxes	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources have been successfully used toselect powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z&gt;~2). typically restricted tolarge-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has graduallybecome possible to extend the uss search to sub-mjy levels, thanks to therecent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. here a firstdetailed analysis of the nature of the faintest uss sources is presented. byusing giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array radio observationsof the lockman hole at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz, a sample of 58 uss sources, with610 mhz integrated fluxes above 100 microjy, is assembled. deep infrared dataat 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the spitzer extragalactic representative volumesurvey (servs) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of thesesources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](ab)=19.8 mag.spectroscopic redshifts for 14 uss sources, together with photometric redshiftestimates, improved by the use of the deep servs data, for a further 19objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 andtailing off at high redshifts. the remaining 25 uss sources, with no redshiftestimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]&gt;22-23 mag, from local measurements), whichsuggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mjy usspopulation. the comparison with the square kilometre array design studiessimulated skies models indicate that fanaroff-riley type i radio sources andradio-quiet active galactic nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest usspopulation, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the usstechnique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at thesub-mjy level.

1208.5143	evidence for significant growth in the stellar mass of brightest cluster  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	using new and published data, we construct a sample of 160 brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) spanning the redshift interval 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 1.63. we use thissample, which covers 70% of the history of the universe, to measure the growthin the stellar mass of bcgs after correcting for the correlation between thestellar mass of the bcg and the mass of the cluster in which it lives. we findthat the stellar mass of bcgs increase by a factor of 1.8 between z=0.9 andz=0.2. compared to earlier works, our result is closer to the predictions ofsemi-analytic models. however, bcgs at z=0.9, relative to bcgs at z=0.2, arestill a factor of 1.5 more massive than the predictions of these models. starformation rates in bcgs at z~1 are generally to low to result in significantamounts of mass. instead, it is likely that most of the mass build up occursthrough mainly dry mergers in which perhaps half of the mass is lost to theintra-cluster medium of the cluster.

1301.7318	a herschel survey of the [n ii] 205 micron line in local luminous  infrared galaxies --- the [n ii] 205 micron emission as a star formation rate  indicator	we present, for the first time, a statistical study of [n ii] 205 mciron lineemission for a large sample of local luminous infrared galaxies using herschelspectral and photometric imaging receiver fourier transform spectrometer (spirefts) data. for our sample of galaxies, we investigate the correlation betweenthe [n ii] luminosity (lnii) and the total infrared luminosity (lir), as wellas the dependence of lnii/lir ratio on lir, far infrared colors (iras$f_{60}/f_{100}$) and the [o iii] 88 micron to [n ii] luminosity ratio. we findthat lnii correlates almost linearly with lir for non agn galaxies (all having$l_{ir} &lt; 10^{12} l_solar$) in our sample, which implies that lnii can serve asa sfr tracer which is particularly useful for high redshift galaxies which willbe observed with forthcoming submm spectroscopic facilities such as the atacamalarge millimeter/submillimeter array. our analysis shows that the deviationfrom the mean lnii-lir relation correlates with tracers of the ionizationparameter, which suggests the scatter in this relation is mainly due to thevariations in the hardness, and/or ionization parameter, of the ambientgalactic uv field among the sources in our sample.

1305.5865	dynamical modeling of galaxy mergers using identikit	we present dynamical models of four interacting systems: ngc 5257/8, themice, the antennae, and ngc 2623. the parameter space of the encounters areconstrained using the identikit model-matching and visualization tool.identikit utilizes hybrid n-body and test particle simulations to enable rapidexploration of the parameter space of galaxy mergers. the identikit-derivedmatches of these systems are reproduced with self-consistent collisionlesssimulations which show very similar results. the models generally reproduce theobserved morphology and \hi\ kinematics of the tidal tails in these systemswith reasonable properties inferred for the progenitor galaxies. the modelspresented here are the first to appear in the literature for ngc 5257/8 and ngc2623, and the mice and the antennae are compared with previously publishedmodels. based on the assumed mass model and our derived initial conditions, themodels indicate the four systems are currently being viewed 175-260 myr afterfirst passage and cover a wide range of merger stages. in some instances thereare mismatches between the models and the data (e.g., in the length of a tail);these are likely due to our adoption of a single mass model for all galaxies.despite the use of a single mass model, these results demonstrate the utilityof identikit in constraining the parameter space for galaxy mergers whenapplied to real data.

1307.2247	sn 2010jl: optical to hard x-ray observations reveal an explosion  embedded in a ten solar mass cocoon	(abridged) some supernovae (sne) may be powered by the interaction of the snejecta with a large amount of circumstellar matter (csm). here we outline amethod to measure the mass of the optically thick csm around such sne. wepresent observations of sn2010jl, including the first detection of a sn usingnustar. the total radiated luminosity of sn2010jl is extreme, at least 9e50erg. by modeling the visible-light data, we robustly show that the mass of thecircumstellar material within ~1e16 cm of the progenitor was in excess of 10solar masses, likely ejected tens of years prior to the sn explosion. ourmodeling suggests that the shock velocity during shock breakout was ~6000 km/s,decelerating to ~2600 km/s about two years after maximum light. our late-timenustar+xmm spectra of the sn presumably provide the first direct measurement ofsn shock velocity two years after the sn maximum light -- measured to be in therange of 2000 to 4500 km/s if the ions and electrons are in equilibrium, and&gt;~2000 km/s if they are not in equilibrium. this measurement is in agreementwith the shock velocity predicted by our modeling of the optical data. we alsoshow that the mean radial density distribution of the csm roughly follows anr^-2 law. a possible explanation for the massive csm with a wind-like profileis that they are the result of multiple pulsational pair instability eventsprior to the sn explosion, separated from each other by years.

1401.0538	connection between optical and gamma-ray variability in blazars	we use optical data from the palomar transient factory (ptf) and the catalinareal-time transient survey (crts) to study the variability of gamma-raydetected and non-detected objects in a large population of active galacticnuclei (agn) selected from the candidate gamma-ray blazar survey and fermigamma-ray space telescope catalogs. our samples include 714 sources with ptfdata and 1244 sources with crts data. we calculate the intrinsic modulationindex to quantify the optical variability amplitude in these samples. we findthe gamma-ray detected objects to be more variable than the non-detected ones.the flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) are more variable than the bl lacobjects in our sample, but the significance of the difference depends on thesample used. when dividing the objects based on their synchrotron peakfrequency, we find the low synchrotron peaked (lsp) objects to be significantlymore variable than the high synchrotron peaked (hsp) ones, explaining thedifference between the fsrqs and bl lacs. this could be due to the lsps beingobserved near their electron energy peak, while in the hsps the emission iscaused by lower energy electrons, which cool more slowly. we also find asignificant correlation between the optical and gamma-ray fluxes that isstronger in the hsp bl lacs than in the fsrqs. the fsrqs in our sample are alsomore compton dominated than the hsp bl lacs. these findings are consistent withmodels where the gamma-ray emission of hsp objects is produced by thesynchrotron self-compton mechanism, while the lsp objects need an additionalexternal compton component that increases the scatter in the flux-fluxcorrelation.

1401.5468	precursors prior to type iin supernova explosions are common: precursor  rates, properties, and correlations	there is a growing number of supernovae (sne), mainly of type iin, whichpresent an outburst prior to their presumably final explosion. these precursorsmay affect the sn display, and are likely related to some poorly chartedphenomena in the final stages of stellar evolution. here we present a sample of16 sne iin for which we have palomar transient factory (ptf) observationsobtained prior to the sn explosion. by coadding these images taken prior to theexplosion in time bins, we search for precursor events. we find five type iinsne that likely have at least one possible precursor event, three of which arereported here for the first time. for each sn we calculate the control time.based on this analysis we find that precursor events among sne iin are common:at the one-sided 99% confidence level, more than 50% of sne iin have at leastone pre-explosion outburst that is brighter than absolute magnitude -14, takingplace up to 1/3 yr prior to the sn explosion. the average rate of suchprecursor events during the year prior to the sn explosion is likely largerthan one per year, and fainter precursors are possibly even more common. wealso find possible correlations between the integrated luminosity of theprecursor, and the sn total radiated energy, peak luminosity, and rise time.these correlations are expected if the precursors are mass-ejection events, andthe early-time light curve of these sne is powered by interaction of the snshock and ejecta with optically thick circumstellar material.

0802.2458	properties of dusty tori in agn: i. the case of swire/sdss quasars	we derive the properties of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei (agn) fromthe comparison of observed spectral energy distributions (seds) of sdss quasarsand a precomputed grid of torus models. the observed seds comprise sdssphotometry, 2mass j, h, and k data, whenever available and mid-infrared (mir)data from the spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) survey. theadopted model is that of fritz et al., 2006. the fit is performed by standardchi^2 minimisation, the model however can be multi-component comprising astellar and a starburst components, whenever necessary. models with lowequatorial optical depth, tau_9.7, were allowed as well as ``traditional''models with tau_9.7 &gt; 1.0, corresponding to a_v &gt; 22 and the results werecompared. fits using high optical depth tori models only produced dust morecompactly distributed than in the configuration where all tau_9.7 models werepermitted. tori with decreasing dust density with the distance from the centrewere favoured while there was no clear preference for models with or withoutangular variation of the dust density. the computed outer radii of the tori areof some tens of parsecs large but can reach, in a few cases, a few hundreds ofparsecs. the mass of dust, m_dust, and infrared luminosity, l_ir, integrated inthe wavelength range between 1 and 1000 micron, do not show significantvariations with redshift, once the observational biases are taken into account.objects with 70 micron detections, representing 25% of the sample, are studiedseparately and the starburst contribution (whenever present) to the irluminosity can reach, in the most extreme but very few cases, 80%.

1404.4085	interaction-powered supernovae: rise-time vs. peak-luminosity  correlation and the shock-breakout velocity	interaction of supernova (sn) ejecta with the optically thick circumstellarmedium (csm) of a progenitor star can result in a bright, long-lived shockbreakout event. candidates for such sne include type iin and superluminous sne.if some of these sne are powered by interaction, then there should be arelation between their peak luminosity, bolometric light-curve rise time, andshock-breakout velocity. given that the shock velocity during shock breakout isnot measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between therise time and the peak luminosity of these sne. here, we present a sample of 15sne iin for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peakluminosity from observations obtained using the palomar transient factory. wereport on a possible correlation between the r-band rise time and peakluminosity of these sne, with a false-alarm probability of 3%. assuming thatthese sne are powered by interaction, combining these observables and theoryallows us to deduce lower limits on the shock-breakout velocity. the lowerlimits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected forsne (i.e., ~10^4 km/s). this supports the suggestion that the early-time lightcurves of sne iin are caused by shock breakout in a dense csm. we note thatsuch a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms. performing such atest on other classes of sne (e.g., superluminous sne) can be used to rule outthe interaction model for a class of events.

1405.0313	warm molecular gas in luminous infrared galaxies	we present our initial results on the co rotational spectral line energydistribution (sled) of the $j$ to $j$$-$1 transitions from $j=4$ up to $13$from herschel spire spectroscopic observations of 65 luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) in the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the observedsleds change on average from one peaking at $j \le 4$ to a broad distributionpeaking around $j \sim\,$6$-$7 as the iras 60-to-100 um color, $c(60/100)$,increases. however, the ratios of a co line luminosity to the total infraredluminosity, $l_{\rm ir}$, show the smallest variation for $j$ around 6 or 7.this suggests that, for most lirgs, ongoing star formation (sf) is alsoresponsible for a warm gas component that emits co lines primarily in themid-$j$ regime ($5 \lesssim j \lesssim 10$). as a result, the logarithmicratios of the co line luminosity summed over co (5$-$4), (6$-$5), (7$-$6),(8$-$7) and (10$-$9) transitions to $l_{\rm ir}$, $\log r_{\rm midco}$, remainlargely independent of $c(60/100)$, and show a mean value of $-4.13$ ($\equiv\log r^{\rm sf}_{\rm midco}$) and a sample standard deviation of only 0.10 forthe sf-dominated galaxies. including additional galaxies from the literature,we show, albeit with small number of cases, the possibility that galaxies,which bear powerful interstellar shocks unrelated to the current sf, andgalaxies, in which an energetic active galactic nucleus contributessignificantly to the bolometric luminosity, have their $r_{\rm midco}$ higherand lower than $r^{\rm sf}_{\rm midco}$, respectively.

astro-ph;0405604	obscured and unobscured active galactic nuclei in the spitzer space  telescope first look survey	selection of active galactic nuclei (agn) in the infrared allows thediscovery of agn whose optical emission is extinguished by dust. in this paper,we use the spitzer space telescope first look survey (fls) to assess whatfraction of agn with mid-infrared luminosities comparable to quasars are missedin optical quasar surveys due to dust obscuration. we begin by using the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) database to identify 54 quasars within the 4 deg^2extragalactic fls. these quasars occupy a distinct region in mid-infrared colorspace by virtue of their strong, red, continua. this has allowed us to define amid-infrared color criterion for selecting agn candidates. about 2000 flsobjects have colors consistent with them being agn, but most are much fainterin the mid-infrared than the sdss quasars, which typically have 8 micron fluxdensities, s(8.0), ~1 mjy. we have investigated the properties of the 43objects with s(8.0) &gt;= 1 mjy satisfying our agn color selection. this sampleshould contain both unobscured quasars, and agn which are absent from the sdsssurvey due to extinction in the optical. after removing 16 known quasars, threeprobable normal quasars, and eight spurious or confused objects from theinitial sample of 43, we are left with 16 objects which are likely to beobscured quasars or luminous seyfert-2 galaxies. this suggests the numbers ofobscured and unobscured agn are similar in samples selected in the mid-infraredat s(8.0)~1 mjy.

astro-ph;0405612	extremely red objects in the lockman hole	we investigate extremely red objects (eros) using near- and mid-infraredobservations in five passbands (3.6 to 24 micron) obtained from the spitzerspace telescope, and deep ground-based r and k imaging. the great sensitivityof the irac camera allows us to detect 64 eros in only 12 minutes of iracexposure time, by means of an r-[3.6] color cut (analogous to the traditionalred r-k cut). a pure infrared k-[3.6] red cut detects a somewhat differentpopulation and may be more effective at selecting z &gt; 1.3 eros. we find 17% ofall galaxies detected by irac at 3.6 or 4.5 micron to be eros. thesepercentages rise to about 40% at 5.8 micron, and about 60% at 8.0 micron. weutilize the spectral bump at 1.6 micron to divide the eros into broad redshiftslices using only near-infrared colors (2.2/3.6/4.5 micron). we conclude thattwo-thirds of all eros lie at redshift z &gt; 1.3. detections at 24 micron implythat at least 11% of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 eros and at least 22% of z &gt; 1.3 eros aredusty star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0405634	spitzer 24micron observations of optical/near-ir selected extremely red  galaxies: evidence for assembly of massive galaxies at z~1-2 ?	we carried out the direct measurement of the fraction of dusty sources in asample of extremely red galaxies with (r - ks) &gt; 5.3mag and ks &lt; 20.2mag, using24um data from the spitzer space telescope. combining deep 24um, ks- and r-banddata over an area of 64sq.arcmin in elais n1, we find that 50%+-6% of our erosample have measurable 24um flux above the 3sigma flux limit of 40ujy. thisflux limit corresponds to a sfr of 12msun/yr at z~1. the 24um-detected eroshave 24-to-2.2 and 24-to-0.7um flux ratios consistent with infrared luminous,dusty sources at z&gt;1, and an order of magnitude too red to be explained by aninfrared quiescent spiral or a pure old stellar population at any redshift.keck optical spectroscopy of a sample of similarly selected eros in the flsfield suggests that most of the eros in elais n1 are probably at z~1. the mean24um flux (167ujy) of the 24um-detected ero sample roughly corresponds to thetotal infrared luminosity of (3-10)x10^(11)lsun at z=1-1.5, which is similar tothat of local lirgs and uligs. the corresponding sfr is ~(50-170)msun/yr. ifthe time scale of this starbursting phase is on the order of 10^8yr as inferredfor the local lirgs and uligs, the lower limit on the masses of these24um-detected eros is (5-20)x10^9msun. it is plausible that some of thestarburst eros are in the midst of violent transformation to become massiveearly type galaxies at the epoch of z ~ 1-2.

astro-ph;0405635	extragalactic source counts at 24 microns in the spitzer first look  survey	we present the spitzer mips 24 micron source counts in the extragalacticfirst look survey main, verification and elais-n1 fields. spitzer's increasedsensitivity and efficiency in large areal coverage over previous infraredtelescopes, coupled with the enhanced sensitivity of the 24 micron band tosources at intermediate redshift, dramatically improve the quality andstatistics of number counts in the mid-infrared. the first look surveyobservations cover areas of, respectively, 4.4, 0.26 and 0.015 sq.deg. andreach 3-sigma depths of 0.11, 0.08 and 0.03 mjy. the extragalactic countsderived for each survey agree remarkably well. the counts can be fitted by asuper-euclidean power law of index alpha=-2.9 from 0.2 to 0.9 mjy, with aflattening of the counts at fluxes fainter than 0.2 mjy. comparison withinfrared galaxy evolution models reveals a peak's displacement in the 24 microncounts. this is probably due to the detection of a new population of galaxieswith redshift between 1 and 2, previously unseen in the 15 micron deep counts.

astro-ph;0405637	characterization of extragalactic 24micron sources in the spitzer first  look survey	in this letter, we present the initial characterization of extragalactic 24umsources in the spitzer first look survey (fls) by examining their counterpartsat 8um and r-band. the color-color diagram of 24-to-8 vs. 24-to-0.7um ispopulated with 18,734 sources brighter than the 3sigma flux limit of 110ujy,over an area of 3.7sq.degrees. the 24-to-0.7um colors of these sources spanalmost 4 orders of magnitudes, while the 24-to-8um colors distribute at leastover 2 orders of magnitudes. in addition to identifying ~30% of the totalsample with infrared quiescent, mostly low redshift galaxies, we also foundthat: (1) 23% of the 24um sources (~1200/sq.degrees) have very red 24-to-8 and24-to-0.7 colors and are probably infrared luminous starbursts withl(ir)&gt;3x10^(11)lsun at z&gt;1. in particular, 13% of the sample (660/sq.degrees)are 24um detected only, with no detectable emission in either 8um or r-band.these sources are the candidates for being ulirgs at z&gt;2. (2) 2% of the sample(85/sq.degrees) have colors similar to dust reddened agns, like mrk231 atz~0.6-3. (3) we anticipate that some of these sources with extremely red colorsmay be new types of sources, since they can not be modelled with any familiartype of spectral energy distribution. we find that 17% of the 24um sources haveno detectable optical counterparts brighter than r limit of 25.5mag. opticalspectroscopy of these optical extremely faint 24um sources would be verydifficult, and mid-infrared spectroscopy from the spitzer would be critical forunderstanding their physical nature (abridged).

astro-ph;0511563	counting individual galaxies from deep 24 micron spitzer surveys: beyond  the confusion limit	we address the question of how to deal with confusion limited surveys in themid-infrared domain by using informations from higher frequency observationsover the same sky regions. such informations, once applied to apparentlyextended mid-infrared sources, which are indeed ``blends'' of two or moredifferent sources, allow us to disentangle the single counterparts and to splitthe measured flux density into different components. we present the applicationof this method to the 24 micron spitzer archival data in the goods-en1 testfield, where apparently extended, ``blended'' sources constitute about 20% of areliable sample of 983 sources detected above the 5-sigma threshold down to 23microjy. as higher frequency data-set we have considered the public irac imagesand catalogues on the same field. we show that the 24 micron sample is almostunbiased down to ~40 microjy and the careful application of the deblendingprocedure does not require any statistical completeness correction (at least atthe flux level considered). this is probed by direct comparison of our resultswith those of chary et al. (2004), who analysed the same data-set throughextensive monte carlo simulations. the deblending procedure reduces of about30% the confusion limit of the mips 24 micron survey, allowing one to obtainreliable source counts down to ~40 microjy. the extrapolation of the sourcecounts down to fainter fluxes suggests that our 24 micron sample is able toresolve ~62% of the cosmic background down to a flux level of 38 microjy.
