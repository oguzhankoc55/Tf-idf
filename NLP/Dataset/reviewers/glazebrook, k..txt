0905.0001	the host galaxies of swift dark gamma-ray bursts: observational  constraints on highly obscured and very high-redshift grbs	in this work we present the first results of our imaging campaign at keckobservatory to identify the host galaxies of "dark" gamma-ray bursts (grbs),events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical fluxsignificantly fainter than expected from the observed x-ray afterglow. we findthat out of a uniform sample of 29 swift bursts rapidly observed by the palomar60-inch telescope through march 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), allevents have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxydetection, or both. our results constrain the fraction of swift grbs comingfrom very high redshift (z &gt; 7), such as the recent grb 090423, to between0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. in contrast, a significant fraction of thesample requires large extinction columns (host-frame a_v &gt; 1 mag, with severalevents showing a_v &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominantcause of the dark grb phenomenon. we infer that a significant fraction of grbs(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscuredregions. however, the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal opticalcolors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinityof the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

0905.0910	a near-infrared excess in the continuum of high-redshift galaxies: a  tracer of star formation and circumstellar disks?	a broad continuum excess in the near-infrared, peaking in the rest-frame at2-5 micron, is detected in a spectroscopic sample of 88 galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0taken from the gemini deep deep survey. line emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs) at 3.3 micron alone cannot explain the excess, which can befit by a spectral component consisting of a template of pah emission linessuperposed on a modified blackbody of temperature t~850 k. the luminosity ofthis near-infrared excess emission at 3 micron is found to be correlated withthe star formation rate of the galaxy. the origin of the near-infrared excessis explored by examining similar excesses observed locally in massive starforming regions, reflection and planetary nebulae, post-asymptotic giant branchstars and in the galactic cirrus. we also consider the potential contributionfrom dust heated around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. we conclude thatthe most likely explanation for the 2-5 micron excess is the contribution fromcircumstellar disks around massive young stellar objects seen in the integratedlight of high-redshift galaxies. assuming circumstellar disks extend down tolower masses, as they do in our own galaxy, the excess emission presents uswith an exciting opportunity to measure the formation rate of planetary systemsat cosmic epochs before our own solar system formed.

0905.4616	the science case for pilot ii: the distant universe	pilot (the pathfinder for an international large optical telescope) is aproposed 2.5 m optical/infrared telescope to be located at dome c on theantarctic plateau. the atmospheric conditions at dome c deliver a highsensitivity, high photometric precision, wide-field, high spatial resolution,and high-cadence imaging capability to the pilot telescope. these capabilitiesenable a unique scientific potential for pilot, which is addressed in thisseries of papers. the current paper presents a series of projects dealing withthe distant (redshift &gt;) universe, that have been identified as key sciencedrivers for the pilot facility. the potential for pilot to detect the firstpopulations of stars to form in the early universe, via infrared projectssearching for pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows, isinvestigated. two projects are proposed to examine the assembly and evolutionof structure in the universe: an infrared survey searching for the firstevolved galaxies at high redshift, and an optical survey aimed atcharacterising moderate-redshift galaxy clusters. finally, a large-areaweak-lensing survey and a program to obtain supernovae infrared light-curvesare proposed to examine the nature and evolution of dark energy and darkmatter.

1004.2900	afterglow observations of fermi-lat gamma-ray bursts and the emerging  class of hyper-energetic events	we present broadband (radio, optical, and x-ray) light curves and spectra ofthe afterglows of four long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs 090323, 090328,090902b, and 090926a) detected by the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) and largearea telescope (lat) instruments on the fermi satellite. with its wide spectralbandpass, extending to gev energies, fermi is sensitive to grbs with very largeisotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). although rare, these events areparticularly important for testing grb central-engine models. when combinedwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are ableto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburstmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of theoutflows. in agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativisticenergy budget of at least one of these events (grb 090926a) exceeds thecanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. such energies pose asevere challenge for models in which the grb is powered by a magnetar orneutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectationsfor magneto-hydrodynamical (mhd) collapsar models. our jet opening angles(theta) are similar to those found for pre-fermi grbs, but the large initiallorentz factors (gamma_0) inferred from the detection of gev photons implytheta gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in mhd models ofjet acceleration. finally, we find that these fermi-lat events preferentiallyoccur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that thismight result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicityprogenitor stars. future studies of fermi-lat afterglows in the radio with theorder-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the evla shoulddefinitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events.

1205.1306	an efficient approach to obtaining large numbers of distant supernova  host galaxy redshifts	we use the wide-field capabilities of the 2df fibre positioner and theaaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope (aat) to obtainredshifts of galaxies that hosted supernovae during the first three years ofthe supernova legacy survey (snls). with exposure times ranging from 10 to 60ksec per galaxy, we were able to obtain redshifts for 400 host galaxies in twosnls fields, thereby substantially increasing the total number of snlssupernovae with host galaxy redshifts. the median redshift of the galaxies inour sample that hosted photometrically classified type ia supernovae (sne ia)is 0.77, which is 25% higher than the median redshift of spectroscopicallyconfirmed sne ia in the three-year sample of the snls. our results demonstratethat one can use wide-field fibre-fed multi-object spectrographs on 4mtelescopes to efficiently obtain redshifts for large numbers of supernova hostgalaxies over the large areas of sky that will be covered by futurehigh-redshift supernova surveys, such as the dark energy survey.

1206.3579	on the shapes and structures of high-redshift compact galaxies	recent deep hubble space telescope wfc3 imaging suggests that a majority ofcompact quiescent massive galaxies at z~2 may contain disks. to investigatethis claim, we have compared the ellipticity distribution of 31 carefullyselected high-redshift massive quiescent compact galaxies to a set ofmass-selected ellipticity and sersic index distributions obtained from 2dstructural fits to ~40,000$ nearby galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey.a kolmogorov-smirnov test shows that the distribution of ellipticities for thehigh-redshift galaxies is consistent with the ellipticity distribution of asimilarly chosen sample of massive early-type galaxies. however thedistribution of sersic indices for the high-redshift sample is inconsistentwith that of local early-type galaxies, and instead resembles that of localdisk-dominated populations. the mismatch between the properties ofhigh-redshift compact galaxies and those of both local early-type anddisk-dominated systems leads us to conclude that the basic structures ofhigh-redshift compact galaxies probably do not closely resemble those of anysingle local galaxy population. any galaxy population analog to thehigh-redshift compact galaxies that exists at the current epoch is either a mixof different types of galaxies, or possibly a unique class of objects on theirown.

1206.6551	suppression of the near-infrared oh night sky lines with fibre bragg  gratings - first results	the background noise between 1 and 1.8 microns in ground-based instruments isdominated by atmospheric emission from hydroxyl molecules. we have built andcommissioned a new instrument, gnosis, which suppresses 103 oh doublets between1.47 - 1.7 microns by a factor of ~1000 with a resolving power of ~10,000. wepresent the first results from the commissioning of gnosis using the iris2spectrograph at the aat. the combined throughput of the gnosis fore-optics,grating unit and relay optics is ~36 per cent, but this could be improved to~46 per cent with a more optimal design. we measure strong suppression of theoh lines, confirming that oh suppression with fibre bragg gratings will be apowerful technology for low resolution spectroscopy. the integrated ohsuppressed background between 1.5 and 1.7 microns is reduced by a factor of 9compared to a control spectrum using the same system without suppression. thepotential of low resolution oh suppressed spectroscopy is illustrated withexample observations.  the gnosis background is dominated by detector dark current below 1.67microns and by thermal emission above 1.67 microns. after subtracting these wedetect an unidentified residual interline component of ~ 860 +/ 210ph/s/m^2/micron/arcsec^2. this component is equally bright in the suppressedand control spectra. we have investigated the possible source of the interlinecomponent, but were unable to discriminate between a possible instrumentalartifact and intrinsic atmospheric emission. resolving the source of thisemission is crucial for the design of fully optimised oh suppressionspectrographs. the next generation oh suppression spectrograph will be focussedon resolving the source of the interline component, taking advantage of betteroptimisation for a fbg feed. we quantify the necessary improvements for anoptimal oh suppressing fibre spectrograph design.

1304.4227	discovery of lyman break galaxies at z~7 from the zfourge survey	star-forming galaxies at redshifts z&gt;6 are likely responsible for thereionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of thesegalaxies. we present three candidates for z~7 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) froma 155 arcmin^2 area in the candels/cosmos field imaged by the deep fourstargalaxy evolution (zfourge) survey. the fourstar medium-band filters provide theequivalent of r~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 lbgsand brown dwarf stars. the distinction between stars and galaxies based on anobject's angular size can become unreliable even when using hst imaging; thereexists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (fwhm~0.5-1 kpc) that isindistinguishable from a point source. the medium-band filters provide narrowerredshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. the uvluminosity function derived using the three z~7 candidates is consistent withprevious studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (muv -21.6 mag)from z~7 to z~5. fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, wepredict lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest lbgs, and find thatthe presence of a lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux therebychanging the constraints on stellar masses and uv spectral slopes. thisillustrates the limitations of deriving lbg properties using only broad-bandphotometry. the derived specific star-formation rates for the bright lbgs are~13 per gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity lbgs, implying that thestar-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.

1406.4407	photometric redshift analysis in the dark energy survey science  verification data	we present results from a study of the photometric redshift performance ofthe dark energy survey (des), using the early data from a science verification(sv) period of observations in late 2012 and early 2013 that providedscience-quality images for almost 200 sq.~deg.~at the nominal depth of thesurvey. we assess the photometric redshift performance using about 15000galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from other surveys. thesegalaxies are used, in different configurations, as a calibration sample, andphoto-$z$'s are obtained and studied using most of the existing photo-$z$codes. a weighting method in a multi-dimensional color-magnitude space isapplied to the spectroscopic sample in order to evaluate the photo-$z$performance with sets that mimic the full des photometric sample, which is onaverage significantly deeper than the calibration sample due to the limiteddepth of spectroscopic surveys. empirical photo-$z$ methods using, forinstance, artificial neural networks or random forests, yield the bestperformance in the tests, achieving core photo-$z$ resolutions $\sigma_{68}\sim 0.08$. moreover, the results from most of the codes, including templatefitting methods, comfortably meet the des requirements on photo-$z$performance, therefore, providing an excellent precedent for future des datasets.

1407.3801	combining dark energy survey science verification data with near  infrared data from the eso vista hemisphere survey	we present the combination of optical data from the science verificationphase of the dark energy survey (des) with near infrared data from the esovista hemisphere survey (vhs). the deep optical detections from des are used toextract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower vhs data. joint 7-band($grizyjk$) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg decamfield centred at 02h26m$-$04d36m where the availability of ancillarymulti-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the dataquality. dual photometry increases the number of des galaxies with measured vhsfluxes by a factor of $\sim$4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matchingand results in a $\sim$1.5 mag increase in the 80\% completeness limit of thenir data. almost 70\% of des sources have useful nir flux measurements in thisinitial catalogue. photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxieswith spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited bysmall number statistics, indicate that the vhs data can help reduce thephotometric redshift scatter at both $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1$. we present exampledes+vhs colour selection criteria for high redshift luminous red galaxies(lrgs) at $z\sim0.7$ as well as luminous quasars. using spectroscopicobservations in this field we show that the additional vhs fluxes enable acleaner selection of both populations with $&lt;$10\% contamination from galacticstars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and $&lt;0.5\%$contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmedlrgs. the combined des+vhs dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited fortarget selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

0803.2718	the galaxy population hosting gamma-ray bursts	we present the most extensive and complete study of the properties for thelargest sample (46 objects) of gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies. theredshift interval and the mean redshift of the sample are 0&lt;z&lt;6.3 and z=0.96(look-back time: 7.2 gyr), respectively; 89% of the hosts are at z &lt;~ 1.6.optical-near-infrared (nir) photometry and spectroscopy are used to derivestellar masses, star formation rates (sfrs), dust extinctions andmetallicities. the average stellar mass is 10^9.3 m_sun, with a 1 sigmadispersion of 0.8 dex. the average metallicity for a subsample of 17 hosts isabout 1/6 solar and the dust extinction in the visual band (for a subsample of10 hosts) is a_v=0.5. we obtain new relations to derive sfr from [oii] or uvfluxes, when balmer emission lines are not available. sfrs, corrected for dustextinction, aperture-slit loss and stellar balmer absorption are in the range0.01-36 m_sun yr^-1. the median sfr per unit stellar mass (specific sfr) is 0.8gyr^-1. equivalently the inverse quantity, the median formation timescale is1.3 gyr. most grbs are associated with the death of young massive stars, morecommon in star-forming galaxies. therefore grbs are an effective tool to detectstar-forming galaxies in the universe. star-forming galaxies at z&lt;1.6 are afaint and low-mass population, hard to detect by conventional optical-nirsurveys, unless a grb event occurs. there is no compelling evidence that grbhosts are peculiar galaxies. more data on the subclass of short grb arenecessary to establish the nature of their hosts.

0803.3215	observations of the naked-eye grb 080319b: implications of nature's  brightest explosion	the first gamma-ray burst (grb) confirmed to be bright enough to be seen withthe naked eye, grb 080319b at redshift z = 0.937, allowed for exquisitefollow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. we present ourdetailed optical and infrared observations of the afterglow, consisting of over5000 images starting 51 s after the grb trigger, in concert with our ownanalysis of the swift data. the event is extreme not only in observedproperties but intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded atoptical and infrared wavelengths and had an exceedingly highisotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays. at early times, theafterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated,but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. the overall spectralenergy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-infraredwavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction inthe host frame. the afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: startingat about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red atlate times. in our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidencefor an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. finally, we examine thedetectability of such events with current and future facilities and find thatsuch an event could be detected in gamma-rays by bat out to z = 10.7 (8 sigma),while the nominal exist sensitivity would allow detection to z ~ 32. at k band,this source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ~17.

1410.3931	the sami galaxy survey: towards a unified dynamical scaling relation for  galaxies of all types	we take advantage of the first data from the sydney-aao multi-object integralfield (sami) galaxy survey to investigate the relation between the kinematicsof gas and stars, and stellar mass in a comprehensive sample of nearbygalaxies. we find that all 235 objects in our sample, regardless of theirmorphology, lie on a tight relation linking stellar mass ($m_{*}$) to internalvelocity quantified by the $s_{0.5}$ parameter, which combines the contributionof both dispersion ($\sigma$) and rotational velocity ($v_{rot}$) to thedynamical support of a galaxy ($s_{0.5}=\sqrt{0.5v_{rot}^{2}+\sigma^{2}}$). ourresults are independent of the baryonic component from which $\sigma$ and$v_{rot}$ are estimated, as the $s_{0.5}$ of stars and gas agree remarkablywell. this represents a significant improvement compared to the canonical$m_{*}$ vs. $v_{rot}$ and $m_{*}$ vs. $\sigma$ relations. not only is no samplepruning necessary, but also stellar and gas kinematics can be usedsimultaneously, as the effect of asymmetric drift is taken into account once$v_{rot}$ and $\sigma$ are combined. our findings illustrate how thecombination of dispersion and rotational velocities for both gas and stars canprovide us with a single dynamical scaling relation valid for galaxies of allmorphologies across at least the stellar mass range8.5$&lt;log(m_{*}/m_{\odot})&lt;$11. such relation appears to be more general and atleast as tight as any other dynamical scaling relation, representing a uniquetool for investigating the link between galaxy kinematics and baryonic content,and a less biased comparison with theoretical models.

1412.3806	zfourge/candels: on the evolution of m* galaxy progenitors from z=3 to  0.5	galaxies with stellar masses near m* contain the majority of stellar mass inthe universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxyevolution. the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) have present day stellarmasses near m*, at 5x10^10 msol (mw-mass) and 10^11 msol (m31-mass). we studythe typical progenitors of these galaxies using zfourge, a deep medium-bandnear-ir imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxiesout to z~3. we use abundance-matching techniques to identify the mainprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. we measure the evolution inthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-ir luminosities, andstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-irhst imaging from candels, and far-ir imaging from goods-h and candels-h. thetypical mw-mass and m31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolutionstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,to redder dust-obscured ir-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and tored, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. the progenitors of themw-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lowerredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than theprogenitors of the m31-mass galaxies. the process driving this evolution,including the suppression of star-formation in present-day m* galaxies requiresan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass thresholdfor quiescent galaxies. the effective size and star-formation rates imply thatthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift toz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the s\'ersic index.therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in m* galaxies corresponds to a rapiddecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formationefficiency.

0804.2892	on the galaxy stellar mass function, the mass-metallicity relation, and  the implied baryonic mass function	a comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (gsmfs)shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4--8 per cent of thebaryon density (assuming omega_b = 0.045). there remain significant sources ofuncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratioeven assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. wedetermine the z &lt; 0.05 gsmf using the new york university - value-added galaxycatalog sample of 49968 galaxies derived from the sloan digital sky survey andvarious estimates of stellar mass. the gsmf shows clear evidence for a low-massupturn and is fitted with a double schechter function that has alpha_2 =~ -1.6.at masses below ~ 10^8.5 msun, the gsmf may be significantly incomplete becauseof missing low surface-brightness galaxies. one interpretation of the stellarmass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction ofavailable baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. using thisprincipal, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellarmass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. this function has afaint-end slope, alpha_2 =~ -1.9. thus, we find evidence that the slope of thelow-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as thehalo mass function. we illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic massfunction --&gt; galaxy baryonic mass function --&gt; gsmf. this demonstrates therequirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ~ 10^11msun corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. the baryonic-infallefficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.

1507.05909	redshift distributions of galaxies in the des science verification shear  catalogue and implications for weak lensing	we present photometric redshift estimates for galaxies used in the weaklensing analysis of the dark energy survey science verification (des sv) data.four model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- annz2,bpz calibrated against bcc-ufig simulations, skynet, and tpz -- are analysed.for training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct acatalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against des sv data.the performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopiccatalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, withadditional validation against cosmos photo-zs. from the galaxies in the des svshear catalogue, which have mean redshift $0.72\pm0.01$ over the range$0.3&lt;z&lt;1.3$, we construct three tomographic bins with means of $z=\{0.45, 0.67,1.00\}$. these bins each have systematic uncertainties $\delta z \lesssim 0.05$in the mean of the fiducial skynet photo-z $n(z)$. we propagate the errors inthe redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parametersestimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of$\sigma_8$ of approx. 3%. this shift is within the one sigma statistical errorson $\sigma_8$ for the des sv shear catalog. we further study the potentialimpact of systematic differences on the critical surface density,$\sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}$, finding levels of bias safely less than thestatistical power of des sv data. we recommend a final gaussian prior for thephoto-z bias in the mean of $n(z)$ of width $0.05$ for each of the threetomographic bins, and show that this is a sufficient bias model for thecorresponding cosmology analysis.

1511.01988	radio galaxies in zfourge/nmbs: no difference in the properties of  massive galaxies with and without radio-agn out to z = 2.25	in order to reproduce the high-mass end of the galaxy mass-distribution, someprocess must be responsible for the suppression of star-formation in the mostmassive of galaxies. commonly active galactic nuclei (agn) are invoked tofulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic ofmuch debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression andenhancement of star-formation in agn hosts. using the zfourge and nmbs galaxysurveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited(m$_{\odot}$ $\ge$ 10$^{10.5}$ m$_{\odot}$), high-luminosity (l$_{1.4}$ $&gt;$10$^{24}$ w hz$^{-1}$) sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei to aredshift of z = 2.25. in contrast to low redshift studies, which associateradio-agn activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z $&gt;$ 1.5radio-agn are hosted by star-forming galaxies. indeed, the stellar populationsof radio-agn are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistentwith the non-agn mass-similar galaxy population. interestingly, we find theradio-agn fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 $\le$ z $&lt;$2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-agn duty cycle has little dependence onredshift or galaxy type. we do however see a strong relation between theradio-agn fraction and stellar mass, with radio-agn becoming rare below $\sim$10$^{10.5}$ m$_{\odot}$ or a halo-mass of 10$^{12}$ m$_{\odot}$. this halo-massthreshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-agnfeedback at this mass limit. despite this we find that radio-agn hoststar-formation rates are consistent with the non-agn mass-similar galaxysample, suggesting that while radio-agn are in the right place to suppressstar-formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible fordoing so.

astro-ph;0105500	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity dependence of galaxy  clustering	we investigate the dependence of the strength of galaxy clustering onintrinsic luminosity using the anglo-australian two degree field galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the 2dfgrs is over an order of magnitude larger thanprevious redshift surveys used to address this issue. we measure the projectedtwo-point correlation function of galaxies in a series of volume-limitedsamples. the projected correlation function is free from any distortion of theclustering pattern induced by peculiar motions and is well described by apower-law in pair separation over the range 0.1 &lt; r /h mpc &lt; 10. the clusteringof l* galaxies in real space is well fit by a correlation length r0 = 4.9 +/-0.3 /h mpc and power-law slope gamma = 1.71 +/- 0.06. the clustering amplitudeincreases slowly with absolute magnitude for galaxies fainter than m*, butrises more strongly at higher luminosities. at low luminosities, our resultsagree with measurements from the ssrs2 by benoist et al. however, we find aweaker dependence of clustering strength on luminosity at the highestluminosities. the correlation function amplitude increases by a factor of 4.0between $m_{b_{j}} -5\log_{10}h = -18$ and -22.5, and the most luminousgalaxies are 3.0 times more strongly clustered than l* galaxies. the power-lawslope of the correlation function shows remarkably little variation for samplesspanning a factor of 20 in luminosity. our measurements are in very goodagreement with the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation models ofbenson et al.

astro-ph;0106430	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the population of nearby radio galaxies  at the 1 mjy level	we use redshift determinations and spectral analysis of galaxies in the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey to study the properties of local radio sources with$s\ge 1$ mjy. 557 objects drawn from the first survey, corresponding to 2.3 percent of the total radio sample, are found in the 2dfgrs cataloge within thearea $9^h 48^m \simlt {\rm ra}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 14^h 32^m$ and $-2.77^\circ\simlt {\rm dec}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 2.25^\circ$, down to a magnitude limit$b_j= 19.45$. the excellent quality of 2df spectra allows us to divide thesesources into classes, according to their optical spectra. radio galaxies (i.e.absorption systems, mainly belonging to the class of fr i sources, whosespectra may or may not show emission lines due to agn activity) make up 63 percent of the spectroscopic sample; they are characterized by relatively highradio-to-optical ratios, red colours and luminosities $10^{21}\simlt p_{1.4{\rmghz}} w hz^${-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \simlt 10^{24}$. actively star-forming galaxiesinstead contribute with 30 per cent to the total sample. these objects --principally found at low redshifts ($z \simlt 0.1$) -- in general show lowradio-to-optical ratios, blue colours and low radio luminosities. we also found18 seyfert 2 galaxies and 4 seyfert 1's. analysis of the local radio luminosityfunction shows that radio galaxies are well described by models that assumepure luminosity evolution, at least down to radio powers $p_{1.4{\rmghz}}\simlt 10^{20.5} w hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ late-type galaxies, whose relativecontribution to the rlf is found to be lower than was predicted by previouswork, present a luminosity function which is compatible with the iras galaxylf, and therefore plausibly constitute the radio counterpart of the dustyspirals and starbursts that dominate the counts at 60 $\mu$m.

astro-ph;0107197	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy luminosity functions per spectral  type	we calculate the optical bj luminosity function of the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) for different subsets defined by their spectral properties.these spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter, eta, whichis a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a principalcomponent analysis. this parameter eta identifies the average emission andabsorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is auseful indicator of the present star formation. we use a total of 75,000galaxies in our calculations, chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noiseratio, low redshift galaxies observed before january 2001. we find that thereis a systematic steepening of the faint end slope (alpha) as one moves frompassive (alpha = -0.54) to active (alpha = -1.50) star-forming galaxies, andthat there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest-frame characteristicmagnitude m* - 5\log_10(h) (from -19.6 to -19.2). we also show that theschechter function provides a poor fit to the quiescent (type 1) lf for veryfaint galaxies (m - 5log_10(h) fainter than -16.0), perhaps suggesting thepresence of a significant dwarf population. the luminosity functions presentedhere give a precise confirmation of the trends seen previously in a muchsmaller preliminary 2dfgrs sample, and in other surveys. we also present a newprocedure for determining self-consistent k-corrections and investigatepossible fibre-aperture biases.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0112043	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the dependence of galaxy clustering on  luminosity and spectral type	we investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and spectraltype using the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). spectral types are assignedusing the principal component analysis of madgwick et al. we divide the sampleinto two broad spectral classes: galaxies with strong emission lines(`late-types'), and more quiescent galaxies (`early-types'). we measure theclustering in real space, free from any distortion of the clustering patterndue to peculiar velocities, for a series of volume-limited samples. theprojected correlation functions of both spectral types are well described by apower law for transverse separations in the range 2 &lt; (sigma/mpc/h) &lt; 15, witha marginally steeper slope for early-types than late-types. both early and latetypes have approximately the same dependence of clustering strength onluminosity, with the clustering amplitude increasing by a factor of ~2.5between l* and 4 l*. at all luminosities, however, the correlation functionamplitude for the early-types is ~50% higher than that of the late-types. theseresults support the view that luminosity, and not type, is the dominant factorin determining how the clustering strength of the whole galaxy populationvaries with luminosity.

astro-ph;0310437	the gemini deep deep survey: ii. metals in star-forming galaxies at  redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2	the goal of the gemini deep deep survey (gdds) is to study an unbiased sampleof k&lt;20.6 galaxies in the redshift range 0.8&lt;z&lt;2.0. here we determine thestatistical properties of the heavy element enrichment in the interstellarmedium (ism) of a subsample of 13 galaxies with 1.34&lt;z&lt;1.97 and uv absolutemagnitude m_2000 &lt; -19.65. the sample contains 38% of the total number ofidentified galaxies in the first two fields of the survey with z&gt;1.3. theselected objects have colors typical of irregular and sbc galaxies. strong[oii] emission indicates high star formation activity in the hii regions(sfr~13-106 m_sun/yr). the high s/n composite spectrum shows strong ism mgiiand feii absorption, together with weak mnii and mgi lines. the feii columndensity, derived using the curve of growth analysis, is logn_feii =15.54^{+0.23}_{-0.13}. this is considerably larger than typical values found indamped ly-alpha systems (dlas) along qso sight lines, where only 10 out of 87(~11%) have logn_feii &gt; 15.2. high feii column densities are observed in thez=2.72 lyman break galaxy cb58 (logn_feii ~ 15.25) and in gamma-ray burst hostgalaxies (logn_feii ~ 14.8-15.9). given our measured feii column density andassuming a moderate iron dust depletion (delta_fe ~ 1 dex), we derive anoptical dust extinction a_v ~ 0.6. if the hi column density is log n(hi)&lt;21.7(as in 98% of dlas), then the mean metallicity is z/z_sun &gt; 0.2. the highcompleteness of the gdds sample implies that these results are typical ofstar-forming galaxies in the 1&lt;z&lt;2 redshift range, an epoch which hasheretofore been particularly challenging for observational programs.

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0402475	l' and m' photometry of ultracool dwarfs	we have compiled l' and m' photometry of 63 single and binary m, l,and tdwarfs obtained at ukirt using the mko filter set. this compilation includesnew l' data for 8 l dwarfs and 13 t dwarfs and new m' data for 7 l dwarfs, 5 tdwarfs, and gl 229a. we compute l_bol, bc_k, and t_eff for 42 dwarfs whoseflux-calibrated jhk spectra, l' photometry, and trigonometric parallaxes areavailable, and we estimate these quantities for 9 other dwarfs whose parallaxesand flux-calibrated spectra have been obtained. bc_k is a well-behaved functionof near-ir spectral type with a dispersion of ~0.1 mag for types m6-t5; it issignificantly more scattered for types t5-t9. t_eff declines steeply andmonotonically for types m6-l7 and t4-t9, but is nearly constant at ~1450 k fortypes l7-t4 with assumed ages of ~3 gyr. this constant t_eff is evidenced bynearly unchanging values of l'-m' between types l6 and t3. we compare theobserved k, l', and m' luminosities of l and t dwarfs in our sample with thosepredicted by model atmospheres with varying surface gravities and sedimentationefficiencies. the models indicate that the l3-t4.5 dwarfs generally have highergravities (log g = 5.0-5.5) than the t6-t9 dwarfs (log g = 4.5-5.0). thepredicted m' luminosities of t dwarfs are 1.5-2.5 times larger than thosederived empirically for the t dwarfs in our sample. this discrepancy isattributed to absorption at 4.5-4.9 um by co, which is not expected under thecondition of chemical equilibrium assumed in the models. we determine that thel3 dwarf kelu-1 and the t0 dwarf sdss j0423-0414 are probable binary systems.we compute log(l_bol/l_sun) = -5.73 +/- 0.05 and t_eff = 600-750 k for the t9dwarf 2mass j0415-0935, which supplants gl 570d as the least luminous andcoolest brown dwarf presently known.

astro-ph;0402566	galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs: the luminous content of the groups	the 2dfgrs percolation-inferred galaxy group (2pigg) catalogue of ~29000objects is used to study the luminous content of galaxy systems of varioussizes. mock galaxy catalogues constructed from cosmological simulations areused to gauge the accuracy with which intrinsic group properties can berecovered. a schechter function is found to be a reasonable fit to the galaxyluminosity functions in groups of different mass in the real data. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is larger for more massive groups. however, themock data show that the shape of the recovered luminosity function is expectedto differ from the true shape, and this must be allowed for when interpretingthe data. the variation of halo mass-to-light ratio with group size is studiedin both these wavebands. a robust trend of increasing m/l with increasing groupluminosity is found in the 2pigg data. from groups with l_bj=10^{10}lsol tothose 100 times more luminous, the typical bj-band m/l increases by a factor of5, whereas the rf-band m/l grows by a factor of 3.5. these trends agree wellwith the simulations, which also predict a minimum m/l on a scale correspondingto the local group. our data indicate that if such a minimum exists, then itmust occur at l&lt;~10^{10}lsol, below the range accurately probed by the 2piggcatalogue. according to the mock data, the bj m/ls of the largest groups areexpected to be approximately 1.1 times the global value. assuming that thiscorrection applies to the real data yields an estimate of omega_m=0.26+/-0.03(statistical).

astro-ph;0404275	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: stochastic relative biasing between  galaxy populations	it is well known that the clustering of galaxies depends on galaxy type.suchrelative bias complicates the inference of cosmological parameters from galaxyredshift surveys, and is a challenge to theories of galaxy formation andevolution. in this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis ongalaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey, classified by both colour andspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. we fit three differentmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cellcounts, assuming poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. we investigatethe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells ofside 10mpc \leq l \leq 45mpc (h=0.7). exact linear bias is ruled out with highsignificance on all scales. power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihoodratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxyformation other than those from the local density field. using this model, wemeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_ln) of 0.958 forcells of length l=10mpc, increasing to 0.970 by l=45mpc. this corresponds to astochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\pm0.02 and 0.27\pm0.05 respectively. forsmaller cells, the poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents anincreasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction ofcompletely empty cells. we compare these trends with the predictions ofsemianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms ofoverall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of emptycells.

astro-ph;0404276	the nature of the relative bias between galaxies of different spectral  type in 2dfgrs	we present an analysis of the relative bias between early- and late-typegalaxies in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). our analysisexamines the joint counts in cells between early- and late-type galaxies, usingapproximately cubical cells with sides ranging from 7h^{-1}mpc to 42h^{-1}mpc.we measure the variance of the counts in cells using the method of efstathiouet al. (1990), which we find requires a correction for a finite volume effect.we fit lognormal models to the one-point density distribution and developmethods of dealing with biases in the recovered variances resulting from thistechnique. we directly fit deterministic models for the joint densitydistribution function, f(delta_e,delta_l), to the joint counts in cells using amaximum likelihood technique. our results are consistent with a scale invariantrelative bias factor on all scales studied. linear bias is ruled out on scalesless than l=28h^{-1}mpc. a power-law bias model is a significantly better fitto the data on all but the largest scales studied; the relative goodness of fitof this model as compared to that of the linear bias model suggests that anynonlinearity is negligible for l&gt;~40h^{-1}mpc, consistent with the expectationfrom theory that the bias should become linear on large scales.

astro-ph;0407537	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity functions by density  environment and galaxy type	we use the 2df galaxy redshift survey to measure the dependence of thebj-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined bydensity contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1mpc, and on spectral type, determinedfrom principal component analysis. we find that the galaxy populations at bothextremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. thepopulation in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudesbrighter than m_bj-5log10h &lt;-18.5. in contrast, cluster regions have a relativeexcess of very bright early-type galaxies with m_bj-5log10h &lt; -21. differencesin the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: atm_bj-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparableabundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order ofmagnitude. we find that the luminosity functions measured in all densityenvironments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by schechterfunctions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in afashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. theseobserved variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of theoverall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, mayprove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0410603	color bimodality: implications for galaxy evolution	we use a sample of 69726 galaxies from the sdss to study the variation of thebimodal color-magnitude (cm) distribution with environment. dividing the galaxypopulation by environment (sigma_5) and luminosity (-23&lt;m_r&lt;-17), the u-r colorfunctions are modeled using double-gaussian functions. this enables adeconvolution of the cm distributions into two populations: red and bluesequences. the changes with increasing environmental density can be separatedinto two effects: a large increase in the fraction of galaxies in the reddistribution, and a small color shift in the cm relations of each distribution.the average color shifts are 0.05+-0.01 and 0.11+-0.02 for the red and bluedistributions, respectively, over a factor of 100 in projected neighbordensity. the red fraction varies between about 0% and 70% for low-luminositygalaxies and between about 50% and 90% for high-luminosity galaxies. thisdifference is also shown by the variation of the luminosity functions withenvironment. we demonstrate that the effects of environment and luminosity canbe unified. a combined quantity, sigma_mod = sigma_5/mpc^{-2} + l_r/l_{-20.2},predicts the fraction of red galaxies, which may be related to the probabilityof transformation events. our results are consistent with major interactions(mergers and/or harassment) causing galaxies to transform from the blue to thered distribution. we discuss this and other implications for galaxy evolutionfrom earlier results and model the effect of slow transformations on the colorfunctions.

astro-ph;0508407	the gemini deep deep survey. vii. the redshift evolution of the  mass-metallicity relation	we have investigated the mass-metallicity (m-z) relation using galaxies at0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0 from the gemini deep deep survey and canada-france redshift survey.deep k and z' band photometry allowed us to measure stellar masses for 69galaxies. from a subsample of 56 galaxies, for which metallicity of theinterstellar medium is also measured, we identified a strong correlationbetween mass and metallicity, for the first time in the distant universe. thiswas possible because of the larger base line spanned by the sample in terms ofmetallicity (a factor of 7) and mass (a factor of 400) than in previous works.this correlation is much stronger and tighter than the luminosity-metallicity,confirming that stellar mass is a more meaningful physical parameter thanluminosity. we find clear evidence for temporal evolution in the m-z relationin the sense that at a given mass, a galaxy at z=0.7 tends to have lowermetallicity than a local galaxy of similar mass. we use the z=0.1 sdss m-zrelation, and a small sample of z=2.3 lyman break galaxies with known mass andmetallicity, to propose an empirical redshift-dependent m-z relation, accordingto which the stellar mass and metallicity in small galaxies evolve for a longertime than in massive galaxies. this relation predicts that the generally metalpoor damped lyman-alpha galaxies have stellar masses of the order of 10^8.8m_sun (with a dispersion of 0.7 dex) all the way from z=0.2 to z=4. theobserved redshift evolution of the m-z relation can be reproduced remarkablywell by a simple closed-box model where the key assumption is an e-folding timefor star formation which is higher or, in other words, a period of starformation that lasts longer in less massive galaxies than in more massivegalaxies. such a picture supports the downsizing scenario for galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9607034	the type ia supernova rate at z$\sim 0.4 $	we present the first measurement of the rate of type ia supernovae at highredshift. the result is derived using a large subset of data from the supernovacosmology project. three supernovae were discovered in a surveyed area of 1.7square degrees. the survey spanned a $\sim 3$ week baseline and used imageswith $3\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $r\sim 23$. we present our methods forestimating the numbers of galaxies and the number of solar luminosities towhich the survey is sensitive, and the supernova detection efficiency which isused to determine the control time, the effective time for which the survey issensitive to a type ia event. we derive a rest-frame type ia supernova rate at$z\sim0.4$ of $0.82\ {^{+0.54}_{-0.37}}\ {^{+0.37}_{-0.25}} $ $h^2$ snu (1 snu= 1 sn per century per $10^{10}$\lbsun), where the first uncertainty isstatistical and the second includes systematic effects. for the purposes ofobservers, we also determine the rate of sne, per sky area surveyed, to be $34.4\ {^{+23.9}_{-16.2}}$ sne\ $\rm year^{-1} deg^{-2}$ for sn magnitudes inthe range $21.3 &lt; r &lt; 22.3$.

astro-ph;9608192	measurements of the cosmological parameters omega and lambda from the  first 7 supernovae at z &gt;= 0.35	we have developed a technique to systematically discover and studyhigh-redshift supernovae that can be used to measure the cosmologicalparameters. we report here results based on the initial seven of &gt;28 supernovaediscovered to date in the high-redshift supernova search of the supernovacosmology project. we find a dispersion in peak magnitudes of sigma_{m_b} =0.27 this dispersion narrows to sigma_{m_b,corr} = 0.19 after "correcting" themagnitudes using the light-curve "width-luminosity" relation found for nearby(z &lt;= 0.1) type ia supernovae from the calan/tololo survey (hamuy et al. 1996).comparing lightcurve-width-corrected magnitudes as a function of redshift ofour distant (z = 0.35-0.46) supernovae to those of nearby type ia supernovaeyields a global measurement of the mass density, omega_m = 0.88^{+0.69}_{-0.60}for a lambda = 0 cosmology. for a spatially flat universe (i.e., omega_m+omega_lambda = 1), we find omega_m = 0.94 ^{+0.34}_{-0.28} or, equivalently, ameasurement of the cosmological constant, omega_lambda = 0.06 ^{+0.28}_{-0.34}(&lt;0.51 at the 95% confidence level). for the more general friedmann-lemaitrecosmologies with independent omega_m and omega_lambda, the results arepresented as a confidence region on the omega_m-omega_lambda plane. this regiondoes not correspond to a unique value of the deceleration parameter q_0. wepresent analyses and checks for statistical and systematic errors, and alsoshow that our results do not depend on the specifics of the width-luminositycorrection. the results for omega_lambda-versus-omega_m are inconsistent withlambda-dominated, low density, flat cosmologies that have been proposed toreconcile the ages of globular cluster stars with higher hubble constantvalues.

astro-ph;9610079	optical/near-infrared observations of gro j1744-28	we present results from a series of optical (g and r-band) and near-infrared(k'-band) observations of the region of the sky including the entire xte androsat error circles for the ``bursting pulsar'' gro j1744-28. these data weretaken with the astrophysical research consortium's 3.5-m telescope at apachepoint observatory and with the 2.2-m telescope at the european southernobservatory. we see no new object, nor any significant brightening of any knownobject, in these error circles, with the exception of an object detected in our8 february 1996 image. this object has already been proposed as a near-infraredcounterpart to gro j1744-28. while it is seen in only two of our ten 8 februaryframes, there is no evidence that this is an instrumental artifact, suggestingthe possibility of near-infrared flares from gro j1744-28, similar to thosethat have been reported from the rapid burster. the distance to the ``burstingpulsar'' must be more than 2 kpc, and we suggest that it is more than 7 kpc.

astro-ph;9701188	implications for the hubble constant from the first seven supernovae at  z &gt;= 0.35	the supernova cosmology project has discovered over twenty-eight supernovae(sne) at 0.35 &lt;z &lt; 0.65 in an ongoing program that uses type ia sne ashigh-redshift distance indicators. here we present measurements of the ratiobetween the locally observed and global hubble constants, h_0^l/h_0^g, based onthe first 7 sne of this high-redshift data set compared with 18 sne at z &lt;= 0.1from the calan/tololo survey. if omega_m &lt;= 1, then light-curve-width correctedsn magnitudes yield h_0^l/h_0^g &lt; 1.10 (95% confidence level) in both alambda=0 and a flat universe. the analysis using the sne ia as standard candleswithout a light-curve-width correction yields similar results. these resultsrule out the hypothesis that the discrepant ages of the universe derived fromglobular clusters and recent measurements of the hubble constant areattributable to a locally underdense bubble. using thecepheid-distance-calibrated absolute magnitudes for sne ia of sandage (1996},we can also measure the global hubble constant, h_0^g. if omega_m &gt;= 0.2, wefind that h_0^g &lt; 70 km/s/mpc in a lambda=0 universe and h_0^g &lt; 78 km/s/mpc ina flat universe, correcting the distant and local sn apparent magnitudes forlight curve width. lower results for h_0^g are obtained if the magnitudes arenot width corrected.

astro-ph;9712060	hst imaging of cfrs and ldss galaxies - i: morphological properties	(abridged) we analyse hubble space telescope images of a complete sample of341 galaxies drawn from both the canada france and autofib/low dispersionsurvey spectrograph ground-based redshift surveys. we discuss morphologicalclassifications of these galaxies, and quantify possible biases that may arisefrom various redshift-dependent effects. we then discuss these biases in thecontext of automated classifications, and quantify the expectedmisclassification in our system. after allowing for such biases, the redshiftdistribution for normal spirals, together with their luminosity functionderived as a function of redshift, indicates approximately 1 magnitude ofluminosity evolution in b(ab) by z=1. the elliptical sample is too small forprecise evolutionary constraints. however, we find a substantial increase inthe proportion of galaxies with irregular morphology at large redshift. thesegalaxies also appear to be the dominant cause of the rapid rise with redshiftin the blue luminosity density identified in the redshift surveys. althoughgalaxies with irregular morphology may well comprise a mixture of differentphysical systems and might not correspond to present day irregulars, it isclear that the apparently declining abundance and luminosities of our distant``irregulars'' holds an important key to understanding recent evolution in thestar formation history of normal galaxies.

astro-ph;9712061	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift surveys ii:  structural parameter and the evolution of disk galaxies to z=1	(abridged) several aspects of the evolution of star-forming galaxies arestudied using measures of the 2-dimensional surface brightness profile of asample of 341 faint objects selected from the cfrs and ldss redshift surveysthat have been observed with the hubble space telescope. the size function ofdisk scale lengths in disk-dominated galaxies is found to stay roughly constantto z=1. this result, which is strengthened by inclusion of the local de jong etal (1996) size function, suggests that the scale lengths of typical disks cannot have grown substantially with cosmic epoch since z=1, unless acorresponding number of large disks have been destroyed through merging. inaddition to a roughly constant number density, the galaxies with large diskshave, as a set, properties consistent with the idea that they are similargalaxies observed at different cosmic epochs. however, on average, they showhigher b-band disk surface brightnesses, bluer overall (u-v) colors, higher[oii] 3727 equivalent widths and less regular morphologies at high redshiftthan at low redshift, suggesting an increase in the star-formation rate by afactor of about 3 to z=0.7. this is consistent with the expectations of recentmodels for the evolution of the disk of the milky way and similar galaxies. theevolution of the large disk galaxies is probably not sufficient to account forthe evolution of the overall luminosity function of galaxies over the interval0&lt;z&lt;1, especially if omega=1. analysis of the half-light radii of all thegalaxies in the sample and construction of the bivariate size-luminosityfunction suggests that larger changes in the galaxy population are due tosmaller galaxies, those with half-light radii around 5 h_{50}^{-1} kpc

astro-ph;9807140	the star formation history of the hubble sequence: spatially resolved  colour distributions of intermediate redshift galaxies in the hubble deep  field	we analyse the spatially resolved colours of distant galaxies of knownredshift in the hubble deep field, using a new technique based on matchingresolved four-band internal colour data to the predictions of evolutionarysynthesis models. we quantify the relative age, dispersion in age, ongoingstar-formation rate, star-formation history, and dust content of thesegalaxies. to demonstrate the potential of the method, we study thenear-complete sample of 32 i&lt;21.9 mag galaxies with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.5 studied bybouwens et al (1997). the dispersion of the internal colours of a sample of0.4&lt;z&lt;1 early-type field galaxies in the hdf indicates that ~40% [4/11] showevidence of star formation which must have occurred within the past third oftheir ages at the epoch of observation. for a sample of well-defined spirals,we similarly exploit the dispersion in colour to analyse the relative historiesof bulge and disc stars, in order to resolve the current controversy regardingthe ages of galactic bulges. dust and metallicity gradients are ruled out asmajor contributors to the colour dispersions we observe in these systems. themedian ages of bulge stars are found to be signicantly older than those ingalactic discs, and exhibit markedly different star-formation histories. thisresult is inconsistent with a secular growth of bulges from disc instabilities,but consistent with gradual disc formation by accretion of gas onto bulges, aspredicted by hierarchical theories. we extend our technique in order to discussthe star formation history of the entire bouwens et al sample in the context ofearlier studies concerned with global star formation histories.

astro-ph;9906171	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift  surveys---iii. field elliptical galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0	surface photometry has been performed on a sample of 46 field ellipticalgalaxies. these galaxies are described well by a devaucouleurs r^{1/4} profile.the sample was selected from the combined canada-france and ldss redshiftsurveys and spans the range 0.20 &lt; z &lt; 1.00. the relationship between galaxyhalf-light radius and luminosity evolves such that a galaxy of a given size ismore luminous by delta m_b=-0.97 \pm 0.14 mag at z=0.92 and the mean rest-framecolor shifts blueward by delta (u-v) =-0.68 \pm 0.11 at z=0.92 relative to thelocal cluster relations. approximately 1/3 of these elliptical galaxies exhibit[oii] 3727 emission lines with equivalent widths &gt; 15 angstroms indicatingongoing star formation. estimated star-formation rates imply that \le 5% of thestellar mass in the elliptical galaxy population has been formed since z=1. wesee no evidence for a decline in the space density of early-type galaxies withlook-back time. the &lt;v/v_{max}&gt; statistics and a comparison with localluminosity functions are both consistent with the view that the population ofmassive early-type galaxies was largely in place by z~1. this implies thatmerging is not required since that time to produce the present-day spacedensity of elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9909211	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift surveys -  iv. influence of mergers in the evolution of faint field galaxies from z~1	hst images of a sample of 285 galaxies with measured z from the cfrs andautofib-ldss redshift surveys are analysed to derive the evolution of themerger fraction out to z~1. we have performed visual and machine-based mergeridentifications, as well as counts of bright pairs of galaxies with magnitudedifferences less than 1.5 mag. we find that the pair fraction increases with z,with up to ~20% of the galaxies being in physical pairs at z~0.75-1. we derivea merger fraction varying with z as (1+z)^{3.2 +/- 0.6}, after correction forline-of-sight contamination, in excellent agreement with the merger fractionderived from the visual classification of mergers for which m = 3.4 +/- 0.6.after correcting for seeing effects on the ground-based selection of surveygalaxies, we conclude that the pair fraction evolves as (1+z)^{2.7 +/- 0.6}.this implies that an average l* galaxy will have undergone 0.8 to 1.8 mergerevents from z=1 to 0, with 0.5 to 1.2 merger events occuring in a 2 gyr timespan at z~0.9. this result is consistent with predictions from semi-analyticalmodels of galaxy formation. from the simple co-addition of the observedluminosities of the galaxies in pairs, physical mergers are computed to lead toa brightening of 0.5 mag for each pair on average, and a boost in starformation rate of a factor of 2, as derived from the average [o ii] equivalentwidths. mergers of galaxies are therefore contributing significantly to theevolution of both the luminosity function and luminosity density of theuniverse out to z~1.

0811.1044	grb 080503: implications of a naked short gamma-ray burst dominated by  extended emission	we report on observations of grb 080503, a short gamma-ray burst with verybright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initialspike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short swift events.in spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart isextraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at~1 hr after the bat trigger. the optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and thenfalls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of li &amp; paczynski (1998)for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. however, ashallow spectral index and similar evolution in x-rays inferred from chandraobservations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. the extremefaintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emissionargues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a "naked" grb),consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deephst imaging. our observations reinforce the notion that short grbs generallyoccur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in somecases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that ofthe short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this classof events. because most previous bat short bursts without observed extendedemission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if itwere present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observedpresence or absence of extended emission in the existing swift sample arepremature.
