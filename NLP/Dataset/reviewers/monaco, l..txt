0906.1974	unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies: the case of "naked" agn	hawkins (2004) reported on a class of "naked" agn characterized by strongamplitude optical brightness variability and the complete absence of broademission lines in the optical spectrum. the variability suggests that thenucleus is seen directly, however the absence of broad lines contradicts thesimple formulation of unified models for agn. we present the results ofquasi-simultaneous spectroscopic observations with xmm-newton and ntt (lasilla) of two "naked" agn. we confirm the "naked" nature of q2131-427 for whichno broad emission line components have been detected in the optical spectrumand its x-ray spectrum shows no signs of intrinsic absorption. the optical andx-ray mismatch in this source cannot be ascribed to a high nuclear dust-to-gasratio and a compton thick nature is ruled out on the basis of the highf(x)/f([oiii]) ratio. the broad line region (blr) may be completely absent inthis source, possibly as a consequence of its low eddington ratio. on the otherhand, the optical spectrum of q2130-431 shows h(alpha) and h(beta) broademission line components, revealing the presence of a blr. a mild x-rayabsorption is expected in intermediate type 1.8 seyfert galaxies likeq2130-431, however we put a very low upper limit on the column density (&lt; 2 x10^(20) cm^(-2)), also the low balmer decrement suggests that the blr itselfdoes not suffer from reddening. we propose that in this object the blr isintrinsically weak, making a case of "true" intermediate seyfert galaxy. wealso report on the x-ray detection of the abell 3783 galaxy cluster in thexmm-newton field-of-view of the q2131-427 observation.

0907.0029	the young stellar population at the center of ngc 205	context. ngc 205 is a peculiar dwarf elliptical galaxy hosting in its centera population of young blue stars. their origin is still matter of debate, thecentral fresh star formation activity possibly being related to dynamicalinteractions between ngc 205 and m31. aims. the star formation history in thecentral 30\arcsec ($\sim$120 pc) around the ngc 205 central nucleus isinvestigated in order to obtain clues to the origin of the young stellarpopulation. methods. deep hst/acs ccd photometry is compared with theoreticalisochrones and luminosity functions to characterize the stellar content of theregion under study and compute the recent sf rate. results. our photometryreveals a previously undetected blue plume of young stars clearlydistinguishable down to i$\simeq$26. our analysis suggests that 1.9$\times10^5$m$_\odot$ were produced between approximately 62 myr and 335 myr ago in the ngc205 inner regions, with a latest minor episode occurring $\sim$25 myr ago. thisimplies a star formation rate of $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$/yr over thisperiod. conclusions. the excellent fit of the observed luminosity function ofyoung main sequence stars obtained with a model having a constant starformation rate argues against a tidally triggered star formation activity overthe last $\sim$300 myr. rather, a constant sf may be consistent with ngc 205being on its first interaction with m 31.

0907.4372	li-rich rgb stars in the galactic bulge	we present lithium abundance determination for a sample of k giant stars inthe galactic bulge. the stars presented here are the only 13 stars withdetectable lithium line (6767.18 a) among ~400 stars for which we have spectrain this wavelength range, half of them in baade's window (b=-4) and half in afield at b=-6. the stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph offlames@vlt, with a spectral resolution of r~20,000. abundances were derived viaspectral synthesis and the results are compared with those for stars withsimilar parameters, but no detectable li line. we find 13 stars with adetectable li line, among which 2 have abundances a(li)&gt;2.7. no clearcorrelations were found between the li abundance and those of other elements.with the exception of the two most li rich stars, the others follow a fairlytight a(li)-t_eff correlation. it would seems that there must be a liproduction phase during the red giant branch (rgb), acting either on a veryshort timescale, or selectively only in some stars. the proposed li productionphase associated with the rgb bump cannot be excluded, although our targets aresignificantly brighter than the predicted rgb bump magnitude for a populationat 8 kpc

1008.1817	the lithium content of omega centauri. new clues to the cosmological li  problem from old stars in external galaxies	a discrepancy has emerged between the cosmic lithium abundance inferred bythe wmap satellite measurement coupled with the prediction of the standardbig-bang nucleosynthesis theory, and the constant li abundance measured inmetal-poor halo dwarf stars (the so-called spite plateau). several models arebeing proposed to explain this discrepancy, involving either new physics, insitu depletion, or the efficient depletion of li in the pristine galaxy by ageneration of massive first stars. the realm of possibilities may be narrowedconsiderably by observing stellar populations in different galaxies, which haveexperienced different evolutionary histories.  the wcen stellar system is commonly considered as the remnant of a dwarfgalaxy accreted by the milky way (mw). we investigate the li content of aconspicuous sample of unevolved stars in this object.  we obtained moderate resolution (r=17000) spectra for 91 main-sequence/earlysub-giant branch (ms/sgb) wcen stars using the flames-giraffe/vlt spectrograph.li abundances were derived by matching the equivalent width of the liiresonance doublet at 6708a, to the prediction of synthetic spectra computedwith different li abundances. synthetic spectra were computed using the synthecode along with atlas9 model atmospheres. the stars effective temperatures arederived by fitting the wings of the ha line with synthetic profiles.  we obtain a mean content of a(li)=2.19+-0.14~dex for wcen ms/sgb stars. thisis comparable to what is observed in galactic halo field stars of similarmetallicities and temperatures.  the spite plateau seems to be an ubiquitous feature of old, warm metal-poorstars. it exists also in external galaxies, if we accept the current view aboutthe origin of wcen. this implies that the mechanism(s) that causes the"cosmological lithium problem" may be the same in the mw and other galaxies.

1010.5243	q2122-444: a naked agn fully dressed	based on previous spectral and temporal optical studies, q2122-444 has beenclassified as a naked agn or true type 2 agn, that is, an agn that genuinelylacks a broad line region (blr). its optical spectrum seemed to possess onlynarrow forbidden emission lines that are typical of type 2 (obscured) agns, butthe long-term optical light curve, obtained from a monitoring campaign overmore than two decades, showed strong variability, apparently ruling out thepresence of heavy obscuration. here, we present the results from a ~40 ksxmm-newton observation of q2122-444 carried out to shed light on the energeticsof this enigmatic agn. the x-ray analysis was complemented with atca radio datato assess the possible presence of a jet, and with new ntt/efosc2 opticalspectroscopic data to verify the actual absence of a blr. the higher-qualityoptical data revealed the presence of strong and broad balmer lines that are atodds with the previous spectral classification of this agn. the lack ofdetection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. the x-ray datacombined with simultaneous uv observations carried out by the om aboardxmm-newton confirm that q2122-444 is a typical type-1 agn without anysignificant intrinsic absorption. new estimates of the black hole massindependently obtained from the broad balmer lines and from a new scalingtechnique based on x-ray spectral data suggest that q2122-444 is accreting at arelatively high rate in eddington units.

1012.4756	the subgiant branch of omega cen seen through high-resolution  spectroscopy. i. the first stellar generation in omega centauri?	we analysed high-resolution uves spectra of six stars belonging to thesubgiant branch of omega centauri, and derived abundance ratios of 19 chemicalelements (namely al, ba, c, ca, co, cr, cu, fe, la, mg, mn, n, na, ni, sc, si,sr, ti, and y). a comparison with previous abundance determinations for redgiants provided remarkable agreement and allowed us to identify thesub-populations to which our targets belong. we found that three targets belongto a low-metallicity population at [fe/h]~-2.0 dex, [alpha/fe]~+0.4 dex and[s/fe]~0 dex. stars with similar characteristics were found in small amounts bypast surveys of red giants. we discuss the possibility that they belong to aseparate sub-population that we name vmp (very metal-poor, at most 5% of thetotal cluster population), which - in the self-enrichment hypothesis - is thebest-candidate first stellar generation in omega cen. two of the remainingtargets belong to the dominant metal-poor population (mp) at [fe/h]~-1.7 dex,and the last one to the metal-intermediate (mint) one at [fe/h]~-1.2 dex. theexistence of the newly defined vmp population could help to understand somepuzzling results based on low-resolution spectroscopy (sollima et al.,villanova et al.) in their age differences determinations, because themetallicity resolution of these studies was probably not enough to detect thevmp population. the vmp could also correspond to some of the additionalsubstructures of the subgiant-branch region found in the latest hst photometry(bellini et al.). after trying to correlate chemical abundances withsubstructures in the subgiant branch of omega cen, we found that the agedifference between the vmp and mp populations should be small (0+/-2 gyr),while the difference between the mp and mint populations could be slightlylarger (2+/-2~gyr).

1108.0138	lithium and sodium in the globular cluster m4. detection of a li-rich  dwarf star: preservation or pollution?	context. the abundance inhomogeneities of light elements observed in globularclusters (gcs), and notably the ubiquitous na-o anti-correlation, are generallyinterpreted as evidence that gcs comprise several generations of stars. thereis an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars which produce theinhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is away to shed new light on this problem. aims. we aim at investigating the li andna content of the gc m 4, that is known to have a well defined na-oanti-correlation. methods. we obtained moderate resolution (r=17 000-18 700)spectra for 91 main sequence (ms)/sub-giant branch stars of m 4 with thegiraffe spectrograph at the flames/vlt eso facility. using model atmospheresanalysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. results. we detect a weakli-na anti-correlation among un-evolved ms stars. one star in the sample, #37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance a(li)=2.87, compatible withcurrent estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. conclusions. the shallowslope found for the li-na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced inparallel to sodium. this evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature,suggests that the high lithium abundance of star # 37934 may originate bypollution from a previous generations of stars. the recent detection of ali-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster ngc 6397 may alsopoint in this direction. still, no clear cut evidence is available against apossible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star # 37934.

(2007) deducedfrom a drift of -180 (+/- 85) m/s at z =1.84, between two sets of feii linesfalling in the two uves arms may be real or induced by other kinds ofsystematics than those investigated here. the proposed technique allows realtime quality check of the spectrograph and should be followed for very accuratemeasurements.

1306.0839	flames and xshooter spectroscopy along the two bss sequences of m30	we present spectroscopic observations acquired with flames and xshooter atthe very large telescope for a sample of 15 blue straggler stars (bsss) in theglobular cluster (gc) m30. the targets have been selected to sample the two bsssequences discovered, with 7 bsss along the blue sequence and 8 along the redone. no difference in the kinematical properties of the two groups of bsss hasbeen found. in particular, almost all the observed bsss have projectedrotational velocity lower than ~30 km/s, with only one (blue) fast rotating bss(&gt;90 km/s), identified as a w uma binary. this rotational velocity distributionis similar to those obtained in 47 tucanae and ngc 6397, while m4 remains theonly gc studied so far harboring a large fraction of fast rotating bsss. allstars hotter than ~7800 k (regardless of the parent bss sequence) show ironabundances larger than those measured from normal cluster stars, with aclearcut trend with the effective temperature. this behaviour suggests thatparticle trasport mechanisms driven by radiative levitation occur in thephotosphere of these stars, as already observed for the bsss in ngc 6397.finally, 4 bsss belonging to the red sequence (not affected by radiativelevitation) show a strong depletion of [o/fe], with respect to the abundancemeasured in red giant branch and horizontal branch stars. this o-depletion iscompatible with the chemical signature expected in bsss formed by mass transferprocesses in binary systems, in agreement with the mechanism proposed for theformation of bsss in the red sequence.

1310.6058	isotope spectroscopy	the measurement of isotopic ratios provides a privileged insight both intonucleosynthesis and into the mechanisms operating in stellar envelopes, such asgravitational settling. in this article, we give a few examples of how isotopicratios can be determined from high-resolution, high-quality stellar spectra. weconsider examples of the lightest elements, h and he, for which the isotopicshifts are very large and easily measurable, and examples of heavier elementsfor which the determination of isotopic ratios is more difficult. the presenceof 6li in the stellar atmospheres causes a subtle extra depression in the redwing of the 7li 670.7 nm doublet which can only be detected in spectra of thehighest quality. but even with the best spectra, the derived $^6$li abundancecan only be as good as the synthetic spectra used for their interpretation. itis now known that 3d non-lte modelling of the lithium spectral line profiles isnecessary to account properly for the intrinsic line asymmetry, which isproduced by convective flows in the atmospheres of cool stars, and can mimicthe presence of 6li. we also discuss briefly the case of the carbon isotopicratio in metal-poor stars, and provide a new determination of the nickelisotopic ratios in the solar atmosphere.

1310.6963	topos: i. survey design and analysis of the first sample	the metal-weak tail of the metallicity distribution function (mdf) of thegalactic halo stars contains crucial information on the formation mode of thefirst generation of stars. to determine this observationally, it is necessaryto observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. we present here theturn-off primordial stars survey (topos) that is conducted as an eso largeprogramme at the vlt. this project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand theformation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weaktail of the halo mdf below [m/h]=-3.5. in particular, we aim at determining thecritical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for theformation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of theelements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massivefirst stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the timewhen the galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of c-enhanced extremelymetal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. the largenumber of stars observed in the sdss provides a good sample of candidates ofstars at extremely low metallicity. candidates with turn-off colours down tomagnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of sdss by meansof an automated procedure. x-shooter has the potential of performing thenecessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities andabundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. we here present thestellar parameters of the first set of stars. the nineteen stars range in ironabundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the sun. two stars have a highradial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear tobe marginally bound to the galaxy and are possibly accreted from anothergalaxy.

1403.6461	a super lithium-rich red-clump star in the open cluster trumpler 5	context. the existence of lithium-rich low-mass red giant stars stillrepresents a challenge for stellar evolution models. stellar clusters areprivileged environments for this kind of investigation. aims. to investigatethe chemical abundance pattern of the old open cluster trumpler\,5, we observeda sample of four red-clump stars with high-resolution optical spectrographs.one of them (#3416) reveals extremely strong lithium lines in its spectrum.methods. one-dimensional, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis wasperformed on the spectra of the observed stars. a 3d-nlte analysis wasperformed to derive the lithium abundance of star #3416. results. star #3416 issuper li-rich with a(li)=3.75\,dex. the lack of $^6$li enrichment($^6$li/$^7$li$&lt;$2%), the low carbon isotopic ratio($^{12}$c/$^{13}$c=14$\pm$3), and the lack of evidence for radial velocityvariation or enhanced rotational velocity ($v\sin i = 2.8\,$\kms) all suggestthat lithium production has occurred in this star through the cameron &amp; fowlermechanism. conclusions. we identified a super li-rich core helium-burning,red-clump star in an open cluster. internal production is the most likely causeof the observed enrichment. given the expected short duration of a star'sli-rich phase, enrichment is likely to have occurred at the red clump or in theimmediately preceding phases, namely during the he-flash at the tip of the redgiant branch (rgb) or while ascending the brightest portion of the rgb.

1407.0485	clues on the galactic evolution of sulphur from star clusters	(abridged) the abundances of alpha-elements are a powerful diagnostic of thestar formation history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. sulphur, beingmoderately volatile, can be reliably measured in the interstellar medium (ism)of damped ly-alpha galaxies and extragalactic hii regions. measurements instars of different metallicity in our galaxy can then be readily compared tothe abundances in external galaxies. such a comparison is not possible for sior ca that suffer depletion onto dust in the ism. furthermore, studying sulphuris interesting because it probes nucleosynthetic conditions that are verydifferent from those of o or mg. the measurements in star clusters are areliable tracers of the galactic evolution of sulphur. we find&lt;a(s)&gt;nlte=6.11+/-0.04 for m 4, &lt;a(s)&gt;nlte=7.17+/-0.02 for ngc 2477, and&lt;a(s)&gt;nlte=7.13+/-0.06 for ngc 5822. for the only star studied in trumpler 5 wefind a(s)nlte=6.43+/-0.03 and a(s)lte=6.94+/-0.05. our measurements show that,by and large, the s abundances in galactic clusters trace reliably those infield stars. the only possible exception is trumpler 5, for which the nltesulphur abundance implies an [s/fe] ratio lower by roughly 0.4 dex thanobserved in field stars of comparable metallicity, even though its lte sulphurabundance is in line with abundances of field stars. moreover the lte sulphurabundance is consistent only with the abundance of another alpha-element, mg,in the same star, while the low nlte value is consistent with si and ca. the sabundances in our sample of stars in clusters imply that the clusters arechemically homogeneous for s within 0.05 dex.

1407.7596	the cosmological lithium problem outside the galaxy: the sagittarius  globular cluster m54	the cosmological li problem is the observed discrepancy between li abundance,a(li), measured in galactic dwarf, old and metal-poor stars (traditionallyassumed to be equal to the initial value a(li)_0), and that predicted bystandard big bang nucleosynthesis calculations (a(li)_{bbn}). here we attackthe li problem by considering an alternative diagnostic, namely the surface liabundance of red giant branch stars that in a colour magnitude diagram populatethe region between the completion of the first dredge-up and the red giantbranch bump. we obtained high-resolution spectra with the flames facility atthe very large telescope for a sample of red giants in the globular clusterm54, belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. we obtain a(li)=+0.93+-0.11dex, translating -- after taking into account the dilution due to the dredgeup-- to initial abundances (a(li)_0) in the range 2.35--2.29 dex, depending onwhether or not atomic diffusion is considered. this is the first measurement ofli in the sagittarius galaxy and the more distant estimate of a(li)_0 in oldstars obtained so far. the a(li)_0 estimated in m54 is lower by ~0.35 dex thana(li)_{bbn}, hence incompatible at a level of ~3sigma. our result shows thatthis discrepancy is a universal problem concerning both the milky way andextra-galactic systems. either modifications of bbn calculations, or acombination of atomic diffusion plus a suitably tuned additional mixing duringthe main sequence, need to be invoked to solve the discrepancy.

1408.5754	on the hi-hole and agb stellar population of the sagittarius dwarf  irregular galaxy	using two hst/acs data-sets that are separated by ~2 years has allowed us toderive the relative proper-motion for the sagittarius dwarf irregular (sagdig)and reduce the heavy foreground galactic contamination. the proper-motiondecontaminated sagdig catalog provides a much clearer view of the youngred-supergiant and intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch populations. wereport the identification of 3 milky way carbon-rich dwarf stars, probablybelonging to the thin disk, and pointing to the high incidence of this class atlow galactic latitudes. a sub-group of 4 oxygen-rich candidate stars depicts afaint, red extension of the well-defined sagdig carbon-rich sequence. theorigin of these oxygen-rich candidate stars remains unclear, reflecting theuncertainty in the ratio of carbon/oxygen rich stars. sagdig is also a gas-richgalaxy characterized by a single large cavity in the gas disk (hi-hole), whichis offset by ~360 pc from the optical centre of the galaxy. we nonethelessinvestigate the stellar feedback hypothesis by comparing the proper-motioncleaned stellar populations within the hi-hole with appropriately selectedcomparison regions, having higher hi densities external to the hole. thecomparison shows no significant differences. in particular, the centre of thehi-hole (and the comparison regions) lack stellar populations younger than ~400myr, which are otherwise abundant in the inner body of the galaxy. we concludethat there is no convincing evidence that the sagdig hi-hole is the result ofstellar feedback, and that gravitational and thermal instabilities in the gasare the most likely mechanism for its formation.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1410.2275	spinning like a blue straggler: the population of fast rotating blue  straggler stars in omega centauri	by using high-resolution spectra acquired with flames-giraffe at the eso/vlt,we measured radial and rotational velocities for 110 blue straggler stars(bsss) in omega centauri, the globular cluster-like stellar system harboringthe largest known bss population. according to their radial velocities, 109bsss are members of the system. the rotational velocity distribution is verybroad, with the bulk of bsss spinning at less than ~40 km/s (in agreement withthe majority of such stars observed in other globular clusters) and a long tailreaching ~200 km/s. about 40% of the sample has vsini &gt;40 km/s and about 20%has vsini &gt;70 km/s. such a large fraction is very similar to the percentage ofof fast rotating bsss observed in m4. thus, omega centauri is the secondstellar cluster, beyond m4, with a surprisingly high population of fastspinning bsss. we found a hint of a radial behaviour of the fraction of fastrotating bsss, with a mild peak within one core radius, and a possibile rise inthe external regions (beyond four core radii). this may suggest that recentformation episodes of mass transfer bsss occurred preferentially in theoutskirts of omega centauri, or that braking mechanisms able to slow down thesestars are least efficient in lowest density environments.

1411.1422	new insights on ba over-abundance in open clusters. evidence for the  intermediate neutron-capture process at play?	recently an increasing number of studies were devoted to measure theabundances of neutron-capture elements heavier than iron in stars belonging togalactic open clusters (ocs). ocs span a sizeable range in metallicity-0.6&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar to diskstars of the same age. a different pattern is observed for heavy elements. alarge scatter is observed for ba, with most ocs showing [ba/fe] and [ba/la]overabundant with respect to the sun. the origin of this overabundance is notclearly understood. with the goal of providing new observational insights wedetermined radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical compositionof 27 giant stars members of five ocs: cr 110, cr 261, ngc 2477, ngc 2506 andngc 5822. we used high-resolution spectra obtained with the uves spectrographat eso paranal. we perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of these stars tomeasure the abundance of up to 22 elements per star. we study the dependence ofelement abundance on metallicity and age with unprecedented detail,complementing our analysis with data culled from the literature. we confirm thetrend of ba overabundance in ocs, and show its large dispersion for clustersyounger than ~4 gyr. finally, the implications of our results for stellarnucleosynthesis are discussed. we show in this work that the ba enrichmentcompared to other neutron-capture elements in ocs cannot be explained by thecontributions from the slow neutron-capture process and the rapidneutron-capture process. instead, we argue that this anomalous signature can beexplained by assuming an additional contribution by the intermediateneutron-capture process.

1412.7075	tachoastrometry: astrometry with radial velocities	spectra of composite systems (e.g., spectroscopic binaries) contain spatialinformation that can be retrieved by measuring the radial velocities (i.e.,doppler shifts) of the components in four observations with the slit rotated by90 degrees in the sky. by using basic concepts of slit spectroscopy we showthat the geometry of composite systems can be reliably retrieved by measuringonly radial velocity differences taken with different slit angles. the spatialresolution is determined by the precision with which differential radialvelocities can be measured. we use the uves spectrograph at the vlt to observethe known spectroscopic binary star hd 188088 (hip 97944), which has a maximumexpected separation of 23 milli-arcseconds. we measure an astrometric signal inradial velocity of 276 \ms, which corresponds to a separation between the twocomponents at the time of the observations of 18 $\pm2$ milli-arcseconds. thestars were aligned east-west. we describe a simple optical device tosimultaneously record pairs of spectra rotated by 180 degrees, thus reducingsystematic effects. we compute and provide the function expressing the shift ofthe centroid of a seeing-limited image in the presence of a narrow slit.theproposed technique is simple to use and our test shows that it is amenable forderiving astrometry with milli-arcsecond accuracy or better, beyond thediffraction limit of the telescope. the technique can be further improved byusing simple devices to simultaneously record the spectra with 180 degreesangles.with tachoastrometry, radial velocities and astrometric positions can bemeasured simultaneously for many double line system binaries in an easy way.the method is not limited to binary stars, but can be applied to anyastrophysical configuration in which spectral lines are generated by separate(non-rotational symmetric) regions.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.

1510.05401	abundance ratios of red giants in low mass ultra faint dwarf spheroidal  galaxies	low mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies are key objects for our understanding ofthe chemical evolution of the pristine universe and the local group ofgalaxies. abundance ratios in stars of these objects can be used to betterunderstand their star formation and chemical evolution. we report on theanalysis of a sample of 11 stars belonging to 5 different ultra faint dwarfspheroidal galaxies (ufdsph) based on x-shooter spectra obtained at the vlt.medium resolution spectra have been used to determine the detailed chemicalcomposition of their atmosphere. we performed a standard 1d lte analysis tocompute the abundances.  considering all the stars as representative of the same population of lowmass galaxies, we found that the [alpha/fe] ratios vs [fe/h] decreases as themetallicity of the star increases in a way similar to what is found for thepopulation of stars belonging to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the main differenceis that the solar [alpha/fe] is reached at a much lower metallicity for theufdsph than the dwarf spheroidal galaxies.  we report for the first time the abundance of strontium in cvni. the star weanalyzed in this galaxy has a very high [sr/fe] and a very low upper limit ofbarium which makes it a star with an exceptionally high [sr/ba] ratio.  our results seem to indicate that the galaxies which have produced the bulkof their stars before the reionization (fossil galaxies) have lower [x/fe]ratios at a given metallicity than the galaxies that have experienced adiscontinuity in their star formation rate (quenching).

1512.03835	the gaia-eso survey: separating disk chemical substructures with cluster  models	(abridged) recent spectroscopic surveys have begun to explore the galacticdisk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.in this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporalvariations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. we used agaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, toseparate in the [mg/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane a clean disk star subsample from thegaia-eso survey internal data release 2. we find that the sample is separatedinto five groups associated with major galactic components; the metal-rich endof the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.this is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) survey. the twometal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition([fe/h]&gt;-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. thisholds true at different radial regions. the distribution of galactocentricradial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([fe/h]&lt;-0.25 dex) isshifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. moreover,the metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale heightintermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and itdisplays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. these stars might haveformed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formationtaking place in the internal thin disk. their enhancement levels might be dueto their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or theinner halo. the smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distributionwith respect to the plane, in particular) with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] suggested bythe data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.

0807.0105	the nucleus of the sagittarius dsph galaxy and m54: a window on the  process of galaxy nucleation	we present the results of a thorough study of the nucleus of the sgr dwarfspheroidal galaxy and of the bright globular cluster m54 that resides withinthe same nucleus (sgr,n). we have obtained accurate radial velocities andmetallicity estimates for 1152 candidate red giant branch stars of sgr and m54lying within ~ 9 arcmin from the center of the galaxy, from keck/deimos andvlt/flames spectra of the infrared calcium ii triplet. using both velocity andmetallicity information we selected two samples of 425 and 321 very-likelymembers of m54 and of sgr,n, respectively. the two considered systems displaysignificantly different velocity dispersion profiles: m54 has a steeplydecreasing profile from r=0, where sigma= 14.2 km/s, to r=3.5 arcmin where itreaches sigma=5.3 km/s, then it appears to rise again to sigma= 10 km/s at r=7arcmin. in contrast sgr,n has a uniformly flat profile at sigma=9.6 km/s overthe whole 0 &lt; r &lt; 9 arcmin range. using data from the literature we show thatthe velocity dispersion of sgr remains constant at least out to r ~ 100 arcminand there is no sign of the transition between the outerflat-luminosity-profile core and the inner nucleus in the velocity profile.these results - together with a re-analysis of the surface brightness profileof sgr,n and a suite of dedicated n-body simulations - provide very strongsupport for the hypothesis that the nucleus of sgr formed independently of m54,which probably plunged to its present position, coincident with sgr,n, becauseof significant decay of the original orbit due to dynamical friction.

astro-ph;0112343	deep hst-wfpc2 photometry of ngc 288. i. binary systems and blue  stragglers	we present the first results of a deep wfpc2 photometric survey of the loosegalactic globular cluster ngc 288. the fraction of binary systems is estimatedfrom the color distribution of objects near the main sequence (ms) with amethod analogous to that introduced by rubenstein &amp; bailyn(1997). we haveunequivocally detected a significant population of binary systems which has aradial distribution that has been significantly influenced by mass segregation.in the inner region of the cluster (r&lt;1 r_h = 1.6 r_c) the binary fraction(f_b) lies in the range 0.08--0.38 regardless of the assumed distribution ofmass ratios, f(q). the most probable f_b lies between 0.10 and 0.20 dependingon the adopted f(q). on the other hand, in the outer region (r&gt; 1 r_h), f_bmust be less than 0.10, and the most likely value is 0.0, independently of theadopted f(q). the detected population of binaries is dominated by primordialsystems. the specific frequency of blue straggler stars (bss) is exceptionallyhigh, suggesting that the bss production mechanism via binary evolution can bevery efficient. a large population of bss is possible even in low densityenvironments if a sufficient reservoir of primordial binaries is available. theobserved distribution of bss in the color magnitude diagram is not compatiblewith a rate of bss production which has been constant in time, if it is assumedthat all the bss are formed by the merging of two stars.

astro-ph;0209391	the draco and ursa minor dwarf spheroidals. a comparative study	we present (v,i) photometry of two wide (~25 x 25 arcmin^2) fields centeredon the low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies draco and ursa minor.new estimates of the distance to these galaxies are provided((m-m)_0(umi)=19.41 \pm 0.12 and (m-m)_0(dra)=19.84 \pm 0.14) and a comparativestudy of their evolved stellar population is presented. we detect for the firsttime the rgb-bump in the luminosity function of umi (v_{rgb}^{bump}=19.40\pm0.06) while the feature is not detected in draco. photometric metallicitydistributions are obtained for the two galaxies and an accurate analysis todetermine the intrinsic metallicity spread is performed by means of artificialstars experiments. (abridged) we demonstrate that the inner region of umi issignificantly structured, at odds with what expected for a system in dynamicalequilibrium. in particular we show that the main density peak of umi isoff-centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and itshows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy.moreover, umi stars are shown to be clustered according to two differentcharacteristic clustering scales, as opposite to draco, which instead has avery symmetric and smooth density profile. the possible consequences of thisstriking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are brieflydiscussed. combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of thetotal luminosity of umi, we find that the mass to light (m/l) ratio of thisgalaxy may be as low as m/l ~ 7, a factor 5-10 lower than current estimates.

astro-ph;0311119	detection of the canis major galaxy at (l;b)=(244;-8) and in the  background of galactic open clusters	we report on the detection of main sequence stars belonging to the recentlyidentified canis major galaxy in a field located at ~ 4.2 deg from the centerof the stellar system. with main sequence fitting we obtain a distance modulus(m-m)_0=14.5 +/- 0.3 to the dwarf, corresponding to a distance of d_{sun} = 8.0+/- 1.2 kpc, in full agreement with previous estimates based on the photometricparallax of m-giants. from the comparison with theoretical isochrones weconstrain the age of the main population of the canis major system in the range\~ 4-10 gyr. a blue plume of likely younger stars (age &lt; 1-2 gyr) is alsoidentified. the available colour magnitude diagrams of open clusters that maybe projected onto the main body of canis major are also briefly analyzed. theposition, distance and stellar population of the old open clusters am-2 andtombaugh 2 strongly suggest that they are physically associated with the canismajor galaxy. using our own photometry and data from 2mass and the gsc2.2surveys we demonstrate that the claim by momany et al. that the cma overdensityis entirely due to the galactic warp is not supported by the existingobservations, once all the available pieces of information are taken intoaccount. it is shown that the cma overdensity clearly emerges at a heliocentricdistance of ~ 8 kpc above any overdensity possibly produced by the galacticwarp.

astro-ph;0401392	wide field photometry of the galactic globular cluster m22	we present wide field photometry of the galactic globular cluster m~22 in theb, v and i passbands for more than 186,000 stars. the study is complemented bythe photometry in two narrowband filters centered on h$_{\alpha}$ and theadjacent continuum, and by infrared j, h and k magnitudes derived from the 2mass survey for $\sim$2000 stars. profiting from this huge database, wecompletely characterized the evolved stellar sequences of the cluster bydetermining a variety of photometric parameters, including new photometricestimates of the mean metallicity, reddening and distance to the cluster. inparticular, from our multi-wavelength analysis, we re-examined thelong-standing metallicity spread problem in m~22. according to our dataset, weconclude that most of the observed width of the red giant branch must be due todifferential reddening, which amounts to a maximum of $\deltae(b-v)\simeq0.06$, although the presence of a small metallicity spread cannotbe completely ruled out. more specifically, the maximum metallicity spreadallowed by our data is of the order of $\delta$[fe/h]$\simeq 0.1\div 0.2$ dex,i.e., not much more than what allowed by the photometric errors. finally, weidentified most of the known variable stars and peculiar objects in our fieldof view. in particular, we find additional evidence supporting previous opticalidentifications of the central star of the planetary nebula iras 18333-2357,which is associated with m~22.

0705.4195	vsop: the variable star one-shot project i. project presentation and  first data release	the variable star one-shot project (vsop) is aimed at (1) providing thevariability type and spectral type of all unstudied variable stars, (2)process, publish, and make the data available as automatically as possible, and(3) generate serendipitous discoveries. this first paper describes the projectitself, the acquisition of the data, the dataflow, the spectroscopic analysisand the on-line availability of the fully calibrated and reduced data. we alsopresent the results on the 221 stars observed during the first semester of theproject. we used the high-resolution echelle spectrographs harps and feros inthe eso la silla observatory (chile) to survey known variable stars. oncereduced by the dedicated pipelines, the radial velocities are determined fromcross correlation with synthetic template spectra, and the spectral types aredetermined by an automatic minimum distance matching to synthetic spectra, withtraditional manual spectral typing cross-checks. the variability types aredetermined by manually evaluating the available light curves and thespectroscopy. in the future, a new automatic classifier, currently beingdeveloped by members of the vsop team, based on these spectroscopic data and onthe photometric classifier developed for the corot and gaia space missions,will be used. we confirm or revise spectral types of 221 variable stars fromthe gcvs. we identify 26 previously unknown multiple systems, among themseveral visual binaries with spectroscopic binary individual components. wepresent new individual results for the multiple systems v349 vel and bc gru,for the composite spectrum star v4385 sgr, for the t-tauri star v1045 sco, andfor dm boo which we re-classify as a by draconis variable. the complete datarelease can be accessed via the vsop web site.

astro-ph;0512109	the age of the main population of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal  galaxy. solving the "m giant conundrum"	we present a statistically decontaminated color magnitude diagram of a 1 degx 1 deg field in the core of the sagittarius dsph galaxy. coupling this cmdwith the most recent metallicity distributions obtained from high resolutionspectroscopy we derive robust constraints on the mean age of the stellarpopulation that dominates the galaxy (pop a). using three different sets oftheoretical isochrones in the metallicity range -0.4&lt;= [m/h]&lt;= -0.7 and takinginto consideration distance moduli in the range 16.90&lt;= (m-m)_0&lt;= 17.20 we findthat the mean age of pop a is larger than 5 gyr, and the best-fit value is age= 8.0 +/- 1.5 gyr. since pop a provides the vast majority of the m giants thattraces the tidal stream of sgr dsph all over the sky, our estimate resolves theso called ``m giant conundrum'' (majewski et al. 2003). the time needed by them giants that currently populates the stream to diffuse within the main body ofsgr and to reach the extremes of the tidal tails once torn apart from theparent galaxy (~ 3-4 gyr) can be easily accommodated into the time lapsed sincetheir birth (~ 5.5-9.5 gyr).

astro-ph;0608513	detection of a population gradient in the sagittarius stream	we present a quantitative comparison between the horizontal branch morphologyin the core of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgr) and in a widefield sampling a portion of its tidal stream (sgr stream), located tens of kpcaway from the center of the parent galaxy. we find that the blue horizontalbranch (bhb) stars in that part of the stream are five times more abundant thanin the sgr core, relative to red clump stars. the difference in the ratio ofbhb to rc stars between the two fields is significant at the 4.8 sigma level.this indicates that the old and metal-poor population of sgr was preferentiallystripped from the galaxy in past peri-galactic passages with respect to theintermediate-age metal rich population that presently dominates the bound coreof sgr, probably due to a strong radial gradient that was settled within thegalaxy before its disruption. the technique adopted in the present study allowsto trace population gradients along the whole extension of the stream.

astro-ph;0611070	high-resolution spectroscopy of rgb stars in the sagittarius streams. i.  radial velocities and chemical abundances	context. the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy is currently beingdisrupted under the strain of the milky way. a reliable reconstruction of sgrstar formation history can only be obtained by combining core and streaminformation. aims. we present radial velocities for 67 stars belonging to thesgr stream. for 12 stars in the sample we also present iron (fe) and$\alpha$-element (mg, ca) abundances. methods. spectra were secured usingdifferent high resolution facilities: uves@vlt, harps@3.6m, and sarg@tng.radial velocities are obtained through cross correlation with a templatespectra. concerning chemical analysis, for the various elements, selected lineequivalent widths were measured and abundances computed using the width codeand atlas model atmospheres. results. the velocity dispersion of the trailingtail is found to be $\sigma$=8.3$\pm$0.9 km s$^{-1}$, i.e., significantly lowerthan in the core of the sgr galaxy and marginally lower than previous estimatesin the same portion of the stream. stream stars follow the same trend as sgrmain body stars in the [$\alpha$/fe] vs [fe/h] plane. however, stars are, onaverage, more metal poor in the stream than in the main body. this effect isslightly stronger in stars belonging to more ancient wraps of the stream,according to currently accepted models of sgr disruption.

astro-ph;0612125	the exotic chemical composition of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy is the nearest neighbor of the milkyway. moving along a short period quasi-polar orbit within the halo, it is beingdestroyed by the tidal interaction with our galaxy, losing its stellar contentalong a huge stellar stream. we study the detailed chemical composition of 12giant stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal main body, together with 5 morein the associated globular cluster terzan 7 by means of high resolutionvlt-uves spectra. abundances are derived for up to 21 elements from o to nd, byfitting lines ew or line profiles against atlas 9 model atmospheres and synthespectral syntheses calculated ad-hoc. temperatures are derived from (v-i)_0 or(b-v)_0 colors, gravities from fe i - fe ii ionization equilibrium. themetallicity of the observed stars is between [fe/h]=-0.9 and 0. we detected ahighly peculiar ``chemical signature'', with undersolar alpha elements, na, al,sc, v, co, ni, cu and zn among others, and overabundant la, ce and nd. many ofthese abundance ratios (in particular light-odd elements and iron peak ones)are strongly at odds with what is observed within the milky way, they thus maybe a very useful tool to recognize populations originated within thesagittarius dwarf. this can be clearly seen in the case of the globular palomar12, which is believed to have been stripped from sagittarius: the cluster showsprecisely the same chemical ``oddities'', thus finally confirming itsextragalactic origin.
