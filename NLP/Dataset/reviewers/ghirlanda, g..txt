0902.0983	short versus long gamma-ray bursts: spectra, energetics, and  luminosities	we compare the spectral properties of 79 short and 79 long gamma-ray bursts(grbs) detected by batse and selected with the same limiting peak flux. shortgrbs have a low-energy spectral component harder and a peak energy slightlyhigher than long grbs, but no difference is found when comparing short grbspectra with those of the first 1-2 sec emission of long grbs. these resultsconfirm earlier findings for brighter grbs. the bolometric peak flux of shortgrbs correlates with their peak energy in a similar way to long bursts. shortand long grbs populate different regions of the bolometric fluence-peak energyplane, short bursts being less energetic by a factor similar to the ratio oftheir durations. if short and long grbs had similar redshift distributions,they would have similar luminosities yet different energies, which correlatewith the peak energy e_peak for the population of long grbs. we also testwhether short grbs are consistent with the e_peak-e_iso and e_peak-l_isocorrelations for the available sample of short (6 events) and long (92 events)grbs with measured redshifts and e_peak,obs: while short grbs are inconsistentwith the e_peak-e_iso correlation of long grbs, they could follow thee_peak-l_iso correlation of long bursts. all the above indications point toshort grbs being similar to the first phases of long bursts. this suggests thata similar central engine (except for its duration) operates in grbs ofdifferent durations.

0906.0575	the blazar s5 0014+813: a real or apparent monster?	a strong hard x-ray luminosity from a blazar flags the presence of a verypowerful jet. if the jet power is in turn related to the mass accretion rate,the most luminous hard x-ray blazars should pinpoint the largest accretionrates, and therefore the largest black hole masses. these ideas are confirmedby the swift satellite observations of the blazar s5 0014+813, at the redshiftz=3.366. swift detected this source with all its three instruments, from theoptical to the hard x-rays. through the construction of its spectral energydistribution we are confident that its optical-uv emission is thermal inorigin. associating it to the emission of a standard optically thickgeometrically thin accretion disk, we find a black hole mass of 40 billionsolar masses, radiating at 40% the eddington value. the derived mass is amongthe largest ever found. super-eddington slim disks or thick disks with thepresence of a collimating funnel can in principle reduce the black hole massestimate, but tends to produce spectra bluer than observed.

0906.2195	jet and accretion power in the most powerful fermi blazars	among the blazars detected by the fermi satellite, we have selected the 23blazars that in the three months of survey had an average gamma-ray luminosityabove 1e48 erg/s. for 17 out of the 23 sources we found and analysed x-ray andoptical-uv data taken by the swift satellite. with these data, implemented byarchival and not simultaneous data, we construct the spectral energydistributions, and interpreted them with a simple one-zone, leptonic,synchrotron and inverse compton model. when possible, we also compare differenthigh energy states of single sources, like 0528+134 and 3c 454.3, for whichmultiple good sets of multi-wavelength data are available. in our powerfulblazars the high energy emission always dominates the electromagnetic output,and the relatively low level of the synchrotron radiation often does not hidethe accretion disk emission. we can then constrain the black hole mass and thedisk luminosity. both are large (i.e. masses equal or greater than 1e9 solarmasses and disk luminosities above 0.1 eddington). by modelling the non-thermalcontinuum we derive the power that the jet carries in the form of bulk motionof particles and fields. on average, the jet power is found to be slightlylarger than the disk luminosity, and proportional to the mass accretion rate.

0907.4157	testing a new view of gamma ray burst afterglows	the optical and x-ray light-curves of long gamma ray bursts (grbs) often showa complex evolution and in most cases do not track each other. this behaviourcan not be easily explained by the simplest standard afterglow models. apossible interpretation is to consider the observed optical and x-raylight-curves as the sum of two separate components. this scenario requires thepresence of a spectral break between these bands. one of the aims of this workis to test whether such a break is present within the observed swift xrt energyrange. we analyse the x-ray afterglow spectra of a sample of 33 long grbs withknown redshift, good optical photometry and published estimate of the hostgalaxy dust absorption a_v(host). we find that indeed in 7 bright events abroken power-law provides a fit to the data that is better than a singlepower-law model. for 8 events, instead, the x-ray spectrum is better fitted bya single power-law. we discuss the role of these breaks in connection to therelation between the host hydrogen column density n_h(host) and a_v(host) andcheck the consistency of the x-ray spectral breaks with the optical bandsphotometry. we analyse the optical to x-ray spectral energy distributions atdifferent times and find again consistency with two components interpretation.

0907.5203	time resolved spectral behavior of bright batse precursors	aims: gamma ray bursts (grbs) are sometimes preceded by dimmer emissionepisodes, called "precursors", whose nature is still a puzzle: they couldeither have the same origin as the main emission episode or they could be dueto another mechanism. we investigate if precursors have some spectraldistinctive feature with respect to the main grb episodes. methods: to this aimwe compare the spectral evolution of the precursor with that of the main grbevent. we also study if and how the spectral parameters, and in particular thepeak of the vfv spectrum of time resolved spectra, correlates with the flux.this allows us to test if the spectra of the precursor and of the main eventbelong to the same correlation (if any). we searched grbs with precursoractivity in the complete sample of 2704 bursts detected by batse finding that12% of grbs have one or more precursors. among these we considered the burstswith time resolved spectral analysis performed by kaneko et al. 2006, selectingthose having at least two time resolved spectra for the precursor. results: wefind that precursors and main events have very similar spectral properties. thespectral evolution within precursors has similar trends as the spectralevolution observed in the subsequent peaks. also the typical spectralparameters of the precursors are similar to those of the main grb events.moreover, in several cases we find that within the precursors the peak energyof the spectrum is correlated with the flux similarly to what happens in themain grb event. this strongly favors models in which the precursor is due tothe same fireball physics of the main emission episodes.

0707.0689	did we observe the supernova shock breakout in grb 060218?	if the early optical data of grb 060218 up to 1e5 s are interpreted as theblack-body flux associated with the supernova shock breakout, we can derivelower limits to the bolometric luminosity and energetics of this black-bodycomponent. these limits are more severe for the very early data that implyenergetics of order of 1e51 erg. these values, puzzlingly large, are ratherindependent of the assumed time profile of the emitting surface, provided thatthe corresponding radius does not increase superluminally. another concern isthe luminosity of the black-body component observed in the x-rays, that islarge and appears to be produced by an approximately constant temperature and asurface area increasing only slowly in time. although it has been suggestedthat the long x-ray black-body duration is consistent with the supernova shockbreakout if anisotropy is assumed, the nearly constant emitting surfacerequires some fine tuning, allowing and suggesting an alternativeinterpretation, i.e. emission from late dissipation of the fireball bulkkinetic energy. this in turn requires a small value of the bulk lorentz factor.

0908.0338	testing an unifying view of gamma ray burst afterglows	four years after the launch the swift satellite the nature of the gamma raybursts (grbs) broadband afterglow behaviour is still an open issue ad thestandard external shock fireball models cannot easily explain the puzzlingcombined temporal and spectral optical to x-ray behaviour of a large number ofafterglows. we analysed the rest frame de-absorbed and k- corrected optical andx-ray multi-wavelength light-curves of a sample of 33 grbs with known redshiftand optical extinction at the host frame. we modelled their broadband behaviouras the sum of the standard forward shock emission due to the interaction of afireball with the circum-burst medium and an additional component. we are ableto obtain a good agreement with the observed light-curves despite theircomplexity and diversity and can also account for the lack of achromatic latetimes jet breaks in several grbs and explain the presence of chromatic breaks.even if the second component is treated in a phenomenological way, we canidentify it as a "late prompt" emission due to a prolonged activity of thecentral engine produced by a mechanism similar to the one responsible for theearly prompt emission. our attempt can be considered as a first step towardsthe construction of a more physical scenario. a first important hint is thatthe "late prompt" temporal decay is intriguingly consistent with what expectedwith the the accretion rate of fallback material. in order to test our modelalso from the spectral point of view, we analysed the x-ray time resolvedspectra and when possible the evolution of the optical to x-ray spectral energydistribution. all the events are found to be fully consistent with whatpredicted by our model.

0908.0732	prolonged activity of the central engine of gamma ray bursts	we call "prompt" emission of gamma ray bursts (grbs) the erratic and violentphase of hard x-ray and soft gamma-ray emission, usually lasting for tens ofseconds in long grbs. however, the central engine of grbs may live much longer.evidence of it comes from the strange behaviour of the early "afterglow", seenespecially in the x-ray band, characterised by a "steep-flat-steep" lightcurve, very often not paralleled by a similar behaviour in the optical band.this difference makes it hard to explain both the optical and the x-rayemission with a unique component. two different mechanisms seem to be required.one can well be the standard emission from the forward shock of the fireballrunning through the interstellar medium. the second one is more elusive, and tocharacterise its properties we have studied those grbs with well sampled dataand known redshift, fitting at the same time the optical and the x-ray lightcurves by means of a composite model, i.e. the sum of the standard forwardshock emission and a phenomenological additional component with a minimum offree parameters. some interesting findings have emerged, pointing to a longactivity of the central engine powered by fallback material.

0908.2807	spectral-luminosity relation within individual fermi grbs	we study the spectra of all long gamma ray bursts (grbs) of known redshiftdetected by the fermi satellite. their fluxes and fluences are large enough toallow a time dependent study of their spectral characteristics in the 8 kev-1mev energy range. we find that the peak energy ep of their el(e) spectrumcorrelates with the luminosity in a remarkable tight way within individualbursts. this time resolved ep-liso correlation is very similar for all theconsidered bursts, and has a slope and normalisation similar to the analogousep-liso correlation defined by the time integrated spectra of different burstsdetected by several different satellites. for a few of the considered grbs, wecould also study the behaviour of the ep-liso correlation during the rising anddecaying phases of individual pulses within each burst, finding no differences.our results indicate the presence of a similar physical mechanism, operatingfor the duration of different grbs, linking tightly the burst luminosity withthe peak energy of the spectrum emitted at different times. such a physicalmechanism is the same during the rise and decay phase of individual pulsescomposing a grb. these results, while calling for a robust physicalinterpretation, strongly indicate that the ep-liso spectral energy correlationfound considering the time integrated spectra of different bursts is real, andnot the result of instrumental selection effects.

1002.3377	fermi/lat gamma ray burst emission models and jet properties	the gev emission of gamma ray bursts, first detected by egret in an handfulof bursts, is now an established property of roughly the 10% of all bursts,thanks to the fermi/lat observations. grb 090510, a short burst, isparticularly interesting because the good timing allows to derive a severelimit to theories of quantum gravity. with the dozen bursts detected in the0.1-30 gev band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) theduration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected bythe gamma burst monitor (gbm) onboard fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistentwith f(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightestbursts, the flux detected by the lat decays as a power law with a typicalslope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the gbm emission exceeds 500 kev (restframe). these properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the gevflux. we propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly followingthe start of the prompt phase. the steep decay slope suggests that the fireballemits in the radiative regime, i.e. all dissipated energy is radiated away. thelarge peak energy of the gbm flux suggests that electron-positron pairs mightplay a crucial role. the rapid onset, but with some delay, of the gev flux withrespect to the gbm one suggests that the bulk lorentz factor gamma of thesebursts is of the order of 1000. therefore the relatively small fraction ofbursts detected at high energies might correspond to the fraction of burstshaving the largest gamma. if the emission occurs in the radiative regime we canstart to understand why the observed x-ray and optical afterglow energetics aremuch smaller than the energetics emitted during the prompt phase.

1007.2751	the radio/gamma-ray connection in fermi-blazars	we study the correlation between the gamma-ray flux f_g, averaged over thefirst 11 months of fermi survey and integrated above 100 mev, and the radioflux density (f_r at 20 ghz) of fermi sources associated with a radiocounterpart in the at20g survey. considering the blazars detected in bothbands, the correlation is highly significant and it is f_g~f_r^0.85+-0.04,similar for bl lac and fsrq sources. however, only a small fraction (~1/15) ofthe at20g radio sources with flat radio spectrum, are detected by fermi. tounderstand if this correlation is real, we examine the selection effectsintroduced by the flux limits of the radio and gamma-ray surveys, and theimportance of variability of the gamma-ray flux. we find that theradio/gamma-ray flux correlation is real, but its slope is steeper than theobserved one, i.e. f_g~f_r^delta with delta in the range 1.25-1.5. the observedf_g-f_r correlation and the fraction of radio sources detected by fermi isreproduced assuming a long term gamma-ray flux variability following alog-normal probability distribution with standard deviation sigma&gt;0.5(corresponding to f_g varying by at least a factor 3). such a variability iscompatible with what observed when comparing, for the sources in common, theegret and the fermi gamma-ray fluxes (even if the fermi fluxes are averagedover ~1 year). another indication of variability is the non detection of 12 outof 66 egret blazars by fermi, despite its higher sensitivity.we also study thestrong linear correlation between the gamma-ray and the radio luminosity of the144 at20g-fermi associations with known redshift and show that it isstatistically robust. two possible implications of these correlations arediscussed: the contribution of blazars to the extragalactic gamma-raybackground and the prediction of blazars that might undergo extremely highstates of gamma-ray emission in the next years.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1107.3841	grb091127/sn2009nz and the vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of its host  galaxy: probing the faint end of the mass-metallicity relation	we perform a detailed study of the gamma-ray burst grb091127/sn2009nz hostgalaxy at z=0.490 using the vlt/x-shooter spectrograph in slit andintegral-field unit (ifu). from the analysis of the optical and x-ray afterglowdata obtained from ground-based telescopes and swift-xrt we confirm thepresence of a bump associated with sn2009nz and find evidence of a possible jetbreak in the afterglow lightcurve. the x-shooter afterglow spectra revealseveral emission lines from the underlying host, from which we derive itsintegrated properties. these are in agreement with those of previously studiedgrb-sn hosts and, more generally, with those of the long grb host population.we use the hubble space telescope and ground based images of the host todetermine its stellar mass (m_star). our results extend to lower m_star valuesthe m-z plot derived for the sample of long grb hosts at 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0 adding newinformation to probe the faint end of the m-z relation and the shift of thelgrb host m-z relation from that found from emission line galaxy surveys.thanks to the ifu spectroscopy we can build the 2d velocity, velocitydispersion and star formation rate (sfr) maps. they show that the host galaxyhas a perturbed rotation kinematics with evidence of a sfr enhancementconsistent with the afterglow position.

1107.4096	gamma ray bursts in the comoving frame	we estimate the bulk lorentz factor gamma_0 of 31 grbs using the measuredpeak time of their afterglow light curves. we consider two possible scenariosfor the estimate of gamma_0: the case of a homogeneous circumburst medium or awind density profile. the values of gamma_0 are broadly distributed between fewtens and several hundreds with average values ~138 and ~66 for the homogeneousand wind density profile, respectively. we find that the isotropic energy andluminosity correlate in a similar way with gamma_0, i.e. eiso gamma_0^2 andliso gamma_0^2, while the peak energy epeak gamma_0. these correlations areless scattered in the wind density profile than in the homogeneous case. wethen study the energetics, luminosities and spectral properties of our burstsin their comoving frame. the distribution of liso' is very narrow with adispersion of less than a decade in the wind case, clustering aroundliso'=5x10^48 erg/s. peak photon energies cluster around epeak'=6 kev. thenewly found correlations involving gamma_0 offer a general interpretationscheme for the spectral-energy correlations of grbs. the epeak-eiso andepeak-liso correlations are due to the different gamma_0 factors and thecollimation-corrected correlation, epeak-egamma (obtained by correcting theisotropic quantities for the jet opening angle theta_j), can be explained iftheta_j^2*gamma_0=constant. assuming the epeak-egamma correlation as valid, wefind a typical value of theta_j*gamma_0 ~ 6-20, in agreement with thepredictions of magnetically accelerated jet models.

1109.1833	short and long grbs: same emission mechanism?	we study the spectral evolution on second and sub--second timescales in 11long and 12 short gamma ray bursts (grbs) with peak flux &gt;8.5e-6 erg/cm2 s (8kev-35 mev) detected by the fermi satellite. the peak flux correlates with thetime-averaged peak energy in both classes of bursts. the peak energy evolution,as a function of time, tracks the evolution of the flux on short timescales inboth short and long grbs. we do not find evidence of an hard-to-soft spectralevolution. while short grbs have observed peak energies larger than few mevduring most of their evolution, long grbs can start with a softer peak energy(of few hundreds kev) and become as hard as short ones (i.e. with ep,obs largerthan few mev) at the peak of their light curve. six grbs in our sample have ameasured redshift. in these few cases we find that their correlations betweenthe rest frame ep and the luminosity liso are less scattered than theircorrelations in the observer frame between the peak energy ep,obs and the fluxp. we find that the rest frame ep of long bursts can be as high or even largerthan that of short grbs and that short and long grbs follow the same ep-lisocorrelation, despite the fact that they likely have different progenitors.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1112.1700	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts: sample  presentation, luminosity function and evolution	we present a carefully selected sub-sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts(grbs), that is complete in redshift. the sample is constructed by consideringonly bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-upsearches, that are bright in the 15-150 kev swift/bat band, i.e. with 1-s peakphoton fluxes in excess to 2.6 ph s^-1 cm^-2. the sample is composed by 58bursts, 52 of them with redshift for a completeness level of 90%, while anothertwo have a redshift constraint, reaching a completeness level of 95%. for onlythree bursts we have no constraint on the redshift. the high level of redshiftcompleteness allows us for the first time to constrain the grb luminosityfunction and its evolution with cosmic times in a unbiased way. we find thatstrong evolution in luminosity (d_l=2.3\pm 0.6) or in density (d_d=1.7\pm 0.5)is required in order to account for the observations. the derived redshiftdistribution in the two scenarios are consistent with each other, in spite oftheir different intrinsic redshift distribution. this calls for otherindicators to distinguish among different evolution models. complete samplesare at the base of any population studies. in future works we will use thisunique sample of swift bright grbs to study the properties of the population oflong grbs.

1112.4470	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma ray bursts: testing the  spectral-energy correlations	we use a nearly complete sample of gamma ray bursts (grbs) detected by theswift satellite to study the correlations between the spectral peak energy epof the prompt emission, the isotropic energetics eiso and the isotropicluminosity liso. this grb sample is characterized by a high level ofcompleteness in redshift (90%). this allows us to probe in an unbiased way theissue related to the physical origin of these correlations against selectioneffects. we find that one burst, grb 061021, is an outlier to the ep-eisocorrelation. despite this case, we find strong ep-eiso and ep-liso correlationsfor the bursts of the complete sample. their slopes, normalisations anddispersions are consistent with those found with the whole sample of burstswith measured redshift and ep. this means that the biases present in the totalsample commonly used to study these correlations do not affect theirproperties. finally, we also find no evolution with redshift of the ep-eiso andep-liso correlations.

1112.4480	the dark bursts population in a complete sample of bright swift long  gamma-ray bursts	we study the properties of the population of optically dark events present ina carefully selected complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts. thehigh level of completeness in redshift of our sample (52 objects out of 58)allow us to establish the existence of a genuine dark population and we areable to estimate the maximum fraction of dark burst events (~30%) expected forthe whole class of long gamma-ray burst. the redshift distribution of thispopulation of dark bursts is similar to the one of the whole sample.interestingly, the rest-frame x-ray luminosity (and the de-absorbed x-ray flux)of the sub-class of dark bursts is slightly higher than the average luminosityof the non-dark events. at the same time the prompt properties do not differand the optical flux of dark events is at the lower tail of the optical fluxdistribution, corrected for galactic absorption. all these properties suggestthat dark bursts events generate in much denser environments with respect tonormal bright events. we can therefore exclude the high-z and the low-densityscenarios and conclude that the major cause of the origin of optically darkevents is the dust extinction.

1203.0003	the impact of selection biases on the ep-liso correlation of gamma ray  bursts	we study the possible effects of selection biases on the ep-liso correlationcaused by the unavoidable presence of flux-limits in the existing samples ofgamma ray bursts (grbs). we consider a well defined complete sample of swiftgrbs and perform monte carlo simulations of the grb population under differentassumptions for their luminosity functions. if we assume that there is nocorrelation between the peak energy ep and the isotropic luminosity liso, weare unable to reproduce it as due to the flux limit threshold of the swiftcomplete sample. we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no intrinsiccorrelation between ep and liso at more than 2.7 sigma level of confidence.this result is robust against the assumptions of our simulations and it isconfirmed if we consider, instead of swift, the trigger threshold of the batseinstrument. therefore, there must be a physical relation between these twoquantities. our simulations seem to exclude, at a lower confidence level of 1.6sigma, the possibility that the observed ep-liso correlation among differentbursts is caused by a boundary, i.e. such that for any given ep, we see onlythe largest liso, which has a flux above the threshold of the currentinstruments.

0704.3438	black-body components in gamma-ray bursts spectra?	we study 7 gamma ray bursts (grbs), detected both by the batse instrument,on-board the compton gamma ray observatory, and by the wide field camera (wfc),on-board bepposax. these bursts have measured spectroscopic redshifts and are asizeable fraction of the bursts defining the correlation between the peakenergy e_peak (i.e. the peak of the vfv spectrum) and the total promptisotropic energy e_iso (the so called "amati" relation). recent theoreticalinterpretations of this correlation assume that black-body emission dominatesthe time resolved spectra of grbs, even if, in the time integrated spectrum,its presence may be hidden by the change of its temperature and by the dilutionof a possible non-thermal power law component. we perform a time resolvedspectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body givesacceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the batse energy range,but overpredicts the flux in the wfc x-ray range. moreover, a fit with a cutoffpower-law plus a black-body is consistent with the wfc data, but the black-bodycomponent contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux. on the contrary,we find that fitting the spectra with a band model or a simple cutoff power-lawmodel yields an x-ray flux and spectral slope which well matches the wfcspectra.

1206.2357	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts: x-ray afterglow  luminosity and its correlation with the prompt emission	we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x-ray afterglowluminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selectedsub-sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) nearly complete inredshift (~90%). being free of selection effects (except flux limit), thissample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical propertiesof grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. the afterglow x-rayluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropicenergy e_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso and the rest frame peakenergy e_peak. we find that the rest frame afterglow x-ray luminosity docorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of eachcorrelation decreases over time. this result is in agreement with the idea thatthe grb x-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination ofdifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,respectively. in particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallowdecay phase often observed in grb x-ray light curves are powered by activityfrom the central engine. the existence of the l_x-e_iso correlation at latetimes (t_rf &gt; 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among differentbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the promptemission.

1206.5532	the optical sn 2012bz associated with the long grb 120422a	the association of type ic sne with long-duration grbs is well established.we endeavor, through accurate ground-based observational campaigns, tocharacterize these sne at increasingly high redshifts. we obtained a series ofoptical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ic sn2012bzassociated with the swift long-duration grb120422a (z=0.283) using the 3.6-mtng and the 8.2-m vlt telescopes. the peak times of the light curves ofsn2012bz in various optical filters differ, with the b-band and i'-band lightcurves reaching maximum at ~9 and ~23 rest-frame days, respectively. thebolometric light curve has been derived from individual bands photometricmeasurements, but no correction for the unknown contribution in thenear-infrared (probably around 10-15%) has been applied. therefore, the presentlight curve should be considered as a lower limit to the actual uv-optical-irbolometric light curve. this pseudo-bolometric curve reaches its maximum (mbol= -18.56 +/- 0.06) at 13 +/- 1 rest-frame days; it is similar in shape andluminosity to the bolometric light curves of the sne associated with z&lt;0.2 grbsand more luminous than those of sne associated with xrfs. a comparison with themodel generated for the bolometric light curve of sn2003dh suggests thatsn2012bz produced only about 15% less 56ni than sn2003dh, about 0.35 msol.similarly the vlt spectra of sn2012bz, after correction for galactic extinctionand for the contribution of the host galaxy, suggest comparable explosionparameters with those observed in sn2003dh (ek~3.5 x 10^52 erg, mej~7 msol) anda similar progenitor mass (~25-40 msol). grb120422a is consistent with theepeak-eiso and the ex,iso-egamma,iso-e_peak relations. grb120422a/sn2012bzshows the grb-sn connection at the highest redshift so far accurately monitoredboth photometrically and spectroscopically.

1208.3467	sdss j102623.61+254259.5: the second most distant blazar at z=5.3	the radio-loud quasar sdss j102623.61+254259.5, at a redshift z=5.3, is oneof the most distant radio-loud objects. since its radio flux exceeds 100 mjy ata few ghz, it is also one of the most powerful radio-loud sources. we proposethat this source is a blazar, i.e. we are seeing its jet at a small viewingangle. this claim is based on the spectral energy distribution of this source,and especially on its strong and hard x-ray spectrum, as seen by swift, verytypical of powerful blazars. observations by the gamma-ray burstoptical/near-infrared detector (grond) and by thewide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) allow to establish the thermal nature of the emission in thenear ir-optical band. assuming that this is produced by a standard accretiondisk, we derive that it emits a luminosity of l_d \simeq 9 \times 10^46 ergs^{-1} and that the black hole has a mass between 2 and 5 billion solar masses.this poses interesting constraints on the mass function of heavy (&gt; 10^9 m_sun)black holes at high redshifts.

1210.1215	the faster the narrower: characteristic bulk velocities and jet opening  angles of gamma ray bursts	the jet opening angle theta_jet and the bulk lorentz factor gamma_0 arecrucial parameters for the computation of the energetics of gamma ray bursts(grbs). from the ~30 grbs with measured theta_jet or gamma_0 it is known that:(i) the real energetic e_gamma, obtained by correcting the isotropic equivalentenergy e_iso for the collimation factor ~theta_jet^2, is clustered around10^50-10^51 erg and it is correlated with the peak energy e_p of the promptemission and (ii) the comoving frame e'_p and e'_gamma are clustered aroundtypical values. current estimates of gamma_0 and theta_jet are based onincomplete data samples and their observed distributions could be subject tobiases. through a population synthesis code we investigate whether differentassumed intrinsic distributions of gamma_0 and theta_jet can reproduce a set ofobservational constraints. assuming that all bursts have the same e'_p ande'_gamma in the comoving frame, we find that gamma_0 and theta_jet cannot bedistributed as single power-laws. the best agreement between our simulation andthe available data is obtained assuming (a) log-normal distributions fortheta_jet and gamma_0 and (b) an intrinsic relation between the peak values oftheir distributions, i.e theta_jet^2.5*gamma_0=const. on average, larger valuesof gamma_0 (i.e. the "faster" bursts) correspond to smaller values of theta_jet(i.e. the "narrower"). we predict that ~6% of the bursts that point to usshould not show any jet break in their afterglow light curve since they havesin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma_0. finally, we estimate that the local rate of grbs is~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~4.3% of local hypernovae, i.e. snib/c withbroad-lines.

1211.2062	grbs have preferred jet opening angles and bulk lorentz factors	we recently found that gamma ray burst energies and luminosities, in theircomoving frame, are remarkably similar. this, coupled with the clustering ofenergetics once corrected for the collimation factor, suggests the possibilitythat all bursts, in their comoving frame, have the same peak energy e'peak (ofthe order of a few kev) and the same energetics of the prompt emission e'gamma(of the order of 2e48 erg). the large diversity of bursts energies is then dueto the different bulk lorentz factor gamma and jet aperture angle theta_jet. weinvestigated, through a population synthesis code, what are the distributionsof gamma and theta_jet compatible with the observations. both quantities musthave preferred values, with log-normal best fitting distributions and &lt;gamma0&gt;~ 275 and &lt;\theta_jet&gt; ~ 8.7 degree. moreover, the peak values of the gamma andtheta_jet distributions must be related - theta_jet^2.5 gamma =const: thenarrower the jet angle, the larger the bulk lorentz factor. we predict that ~6%of the bursts that point to us should not show any jet break in their afterglowlight curve since they have sin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma. finally, we estimate thatthe local rate of grbs is ~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~2.5% of localhypernovae, i.e. snib/c with broad absorption lines.

1211.2806	afterglow emission in gamma-ray bursts: i. pair-enriched ambient medium  and radiative blast waves	forward shocks caused by the interaction between a relativistic blast waveand the circum-burst medium are thought to be responsible for the afterglowemission in gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we consider the hydrodynamics of aspherical relativistic blast wave expanding into the surrounding medium and wegeneralize the standard theory in order to account for several effects that aregenerally ignored. in particular, we consider the role of adiabatic andradiative losses on the hydrodynamical evolution of the shock, under theassumption that the cooling losses are fast. our model can describe adiabatic,fully radiative and semi-radiative blast waves, and can describe the effects ofa time-varying radiative efficiency. the equations we present are valid forarbitrary density profiles, and also for a circum-burst medium enriched withelectron-positron pairs. the presence of pairs enhances the fraction of shockenergy gained by the leptons, thus increasing the importance of radiativelosses. our model allows to study whether the high-energy (&gt;0.1 gev) emissionin grbs may originate from afterglow radiation. in particular, it is suitableto test whether the fast decay of the high-energy light curve observed inseveral fermi lat grbs can be ascribed to an initial radiative phase, followedby the standard adiabatic evolution.

1303.4743	dust extinction for an unbiased sample of grb afterglows	in this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of asample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. the selection criteria of thesample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emissionand therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. it istherefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population ofgamma-ray bursts. our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinctionof gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a singledistribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% sufferfrom less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. the remaining 13% of the afterglows arehighly absorbed. the true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing highabsorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events withoutreliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. these events maybe due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated withthe gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or tomassive dusty host galaxies. no clear evolution in the dust extinctionproperties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although thelargest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the starformation rate. those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. a correlation betweenoptical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density basedon x-ray studies is shown although the observed nh appears to be well in excesscompared to those observed in the local group. dust extinction does not seem tocorrelate with grb energetics or luminosity.

1304.1258	the at20g view of swift/bat selected agn: high-frequency radio waves  meet hard x-rays	we cross-matched the 6-year swift/burst alert telescope (bat) survey ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) with the at20g radio survey of the southern sky,which is one of the largest high-frequency radio surveys available. with thesedata we investigated the possible correlation between the radio and the x-rayemission at the highest radio and x-ray frequencies. we found 37 agn with ahigh probability of association (&gt;80 per cent), among which 19 are localseyfert galaxies (with median redshift z = 0.03) and 18 blazars. we found that\approx 20 per cent of the agn detected in hard x-rays are also bright radiosources at 20 ghz, but the apparent correlation between the radio and hardx-ray luminosity is completely driven by the different median redshifts of thetwo subgroups of agn. when we consider only the local seyfert sample we find noevidence of a correlation between their 20 ghz and 15-55 kev power. thereforeit appears that at high frequencies the radio-x connection, which had beenpreviously observed at lower frequencies, disappears. the disappearance of theradio-x correlation at high radio and x-ray frequencies could be tested throughvery long baseline interferometry and the use of the nuclear spectroscopictelescope array (nustar) satellite.

1305.3287	photospheric emission throughout grb 100507 detected by fermi	gamma ray bursts with blackbody spectra are only a few and in most cases thisspectral component is accompanied by a dominating non-thermal one. only fourbursts detected by batse have a pure blackbody spectrum throughout theirduration. we present the new case of grb 100507 detected by the gamma burstmonitor on board the fermi satellite. grb 100507 has a blackbody spectrum forthe entire duration (~30 s) of the prompt emission. the blackbody temperaturevaries between 25 and 40 kev. the flux varies between 1e-7 and 4e-7 erg/cm2 s.there is no clear evidence of a correlation between the temperature and theblackbody flux. if the thermal emission in grb 100507 is due to the fireballsbecoming transparent, we can estimate the radius r_t and bulk lorentz factorgamma_t corresponding to this transition and the radius r_0 where the fireballsare created. we compare these parameters with those derived for the other fourbursts with a pure blackbody spectrum. in all but one burst, for fiducialassumptions on the radiative efficiency and distance of the sources,r_0~1e9-1e10 cm, i.e. much larger than the gravitational radius of a few solarmass black hole. possible solutions of this apparent inconsistency aretentatively discussed considering the dependence of r_0 on the unknownparameters. alternatively, such a large r_0 could be where the fireball, stillopaque, converts most of its kinetic energy into internal energy (due to theimpact with some material left over by the progenitor star) and starts tore-accelerate.

1306.0013	how to switch on and off a gamma-ray burst through a magnetar	one of the most elusive features of gamma ray bursts (grbs) is the sporadicemission prior to the main prompt event observed in at least $\sim 15\%$ ofcases. these precursors have spectral and temporal properties similar to themain prompt emission, and smaller, but comparable, energetics. they areseparated from the main event by a quiescent time that may be extremely longand, in some cases, more than one precursor has been observed in the sameburst. precursors are still a puzzle: despite many attempts none of theproposed models can account for all the observed features. based on thecomplete sample of bright long grbs observed by swift (bat6), we propose a newscenario for which precursors are explained by assuming that the central grbengine is a newly born magnetar. in this model the precursor and the promptemission arise from accretion of matter onto the surface of the magnetar. theaccretion process can be halted by the centrifugal drag exerted by the rotatingmagnetosphere onto the in-falling matter, allowing for multiple precursors andvery long quiescent times.

1307.7704	radio afterglows of a complete sample of bright swift grbs: predictions  from present days to the ska era	radio observations of gamma ray bursts afterglows are fundamental inproviding insights into their physics and environment, and in constraining thetrue energetics of these sources. nonetheless, radio observations of grbafterglows are presently sparse in the time/frequency domain. starting from acomplete sample of 58 bright swift long bursts (bat6), we constructed ahomogeneous sub-sample of 38 radio detections/upper limits which preserves allthe properties of the parent sample. one half of the bursts have detectionsbetween 1 and 5 days after the explosion with typical fluxes f&gt;100 mujy at 8.4ghz. through a population synthesis code coupled with the standard afterglowhydrodynamical emission model (psyche) we reproduce the radio flux distributionof the radio sub-sample. based on these results we study the detectability inthe time/frequency domain of the entire long grb population by present andfuture radio facilities. we find that the grbs that typically trigger swift canbe detected at 8.4 ghz by jvla within few days with modest exposures even athigh redshifts. the final ska can potentially observe the whole grb populationprovided that there will be a dedicated grb gamma-ray detector more sensitivethan swift. for a sizable fraction (50%) of these bursts, ska will allow us toperform radio-calorimetry, after the trans-relativistic transition (occurring~100 d), providing an estimate of the true (collimation corrected) energeticsof grbs.

1308.5442	a hint to the origin of the extended emission in lat grbs: the relation  between lat luminosity and prompt energetics	we consider the 0.1-10 gev rest frame light curves of 10 grbs detected by latand with known redshift. in all cases the emission persists after the prompthas faded away. this extended emission decays in time as a power-law. the decayslope is similar among different bursts, while the normalization spans morethan 2 decades. however, when the lat luminosity is normalized to the 1 kev-10mev energetics of the prompt emission e_iso all light curves become consistentwith having the same normalization, i.e. they cluster. at each given time theratio between the lat luminosity and the prompt energetics is narrowlydistributed. we argue that this result is expected in the external shockscenario and it strengthens the interpretation of the gev emission in terms ofradiation from external shocks. in this context, we derive limits on thedistribution of epsilon_e (the fraction of the shock energy that goes intoelectrons) and eta (the efficiency of the mechanism producing the prompt).

1309.1167	the obscured hyper-energetic grb 120624b hosted by a luminous compact  galaxy at z = 2.20	gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous explosions that we can witness in theuniverse. studying the most extreme cases of these phenomena allows us toconstrain the limits for the progenitor models. in this letter, we study theprompt emission, afterglow, and host galaxy of grb 120624b, one of thebrightest grbs detected by fermi, to derive the energetics of the event andcharacterise the host galaxy in which it was produced. following thehigh-energy detection we conducted a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign,including near-infrared imaging from hawki/vlt, optical from osiris/gtc, x-rayobservations from the chandra x-ray observatory and atsub-millimetre/millimetre wavelengths from sma. optical/nir spectroscopy wasperformed with x-shooter/vlt. we detect the x-ray and nir afterglow of theburst and determine a redshift of z = 2.1974 +/- 0.0002 through theidentification of emission lines of [oii], [oiii] and h-alpha from the hostgalaxy of the grb. this implies an energy release of eiso = (3.0+/-0.2)x10^54erg, amongst the most luminous ever detected. the observations of the afterglowindicate high obscuration with av &gt; 1.5. the host galaxy is compact, with r1/2&lt; 1.6 kpc, but luminous, at l ~ 1.5 l* and has a star formation rate of 91 +/-6 msol/yr as derived from h-alpha. as other highly obscured grbs, grb 120624bis hosted by a luminous galaxy, which we also proof to be compact, with a veryintense star formation. it is one of the most luminous host galaxies associatedwith a grb, showing that the host galaxies of long grbs are not always bluedwarf galaxies, as previously thought.

1401.1972	a magnetar powering the ordinary monster grb 130427a?	we present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (grb)130427a under the hypothesis that the grb central engine is anaccretion-powered magnetar. in this framework, initially proposed to explaingrbs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion ofmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to theaccretion rate. the emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces areable to pause accretion. we show that the x-ray and optical afterglow is wellexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contributionfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. our modelling does not require anycontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglowlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. wederive the magnetic field ($b\sim 10^{16}$ g) and the spin period ($p\sim 20$ms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimumluminosity for accretion. this minimum luminosity results well below the promptemission luminosity of grb 130427a, providing a strong consistency check forthe scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuousaccretion onto the magnetar. this is in agreement with the relatively long spinperiod of the magnetar. grb 130427a was a well monitored grb showing a verystandard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that anaccretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long grbs.

1402.6338	grb orphan afterglows in present and future radio transient surveys	orphan afterglows (oa) are slow transients produced by gamma ray bursts seenoff-axis that become visible on timescales of days/years at optical/nir andradio frequencies, when the prompt emission at high energies (x and gamma rays)has already ceased. given the typically estimated jet opening angle of grbstheta_jet ~ 3 deg, for each burst pointing to the earth there should be afactor ~ 700 more grbs pointing in other directions. despite this, no secureoas have been detected so far. through a population synthesis code we study theemission properties of the population of oa at radio frequencies. oas reachtheir emission peak on year-timescales and they last for a comparable amount oftime. the typical peak fluxes (which depend on the observing frequency) are offew micro jy in the radio band with only a few oa reaching the mjy level. thesevalues are consistent with the upper limits on the radio flux of sn ib/cobserved at late times. we find that the oa radio number count distribution hasa typical slope -1.7 at high fluxes and a flatter (-0.4) slope at low fluxeswith a break at a frequency-dependent flux. our predictions of the oa rates areconsistent with the (upper) limits of recent radio surveys and archive searchesfor radio transients. future radio surveys like vast/askap at 1.4 ghz shoulddetect ~ 3x10^-3 oa deg^-2 yr-1, meerkat and evla at 8.4 ghz should see ~3x10^-1 oa deg-2 yr-1. the ska, reaching the micro jy flux limit, could see upto ~ 0.2-1.5 oa deg^-2 yr^-1. these rates also depend on the duration of the oaabove a certain flux limit and we discuss this effect with respect to thesurvey cadence.

1403.3245	optical and x-ray rest-frame light curves of the bat6 sample	we present the rest-frame light curves in the optical and x-ray bands of anunbiased and complete sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), namely thebat6 sample. the unbiased bat6 sample (consisting of 58 events) has the highestlevel of completeness in redshift ($\sim$ 95%), allowing us to compute therest-frame x-ray and optical light curves for 55 and 47 objects, respectively.we compute the x-ray and optical luminosities accounting for any possiblesource of absorption (galactic and intrinsic) that could affect the observedfluxes in these two bands. we compare the behaviour observed in the x-ray andin the optical bands to assess the relative contribution of the emission duringthe prompt and afterglow phases. we unarguably demonstrate that the grbsrest-frame optical luminosity distribution is not bimodal, being ratherclustered around the mean value log(l$_{r}$) = 29.9 $\pm$ 0.8 when estimated ata rest frame time of 12 hr. this is in contrast with what found in previousworks and confirms that the grb population has an intrinsic unimodal luminositydistribution. for more than 70% of the events the rest-frame light curves inthe x-ray and optical bands have a different evolution, indicating distinctemitting regions and/or mechanisms. the x-ray light curves normalised to thegrb isotropic energy (e$_{\rm iso}$), provide evidence for x-ray emission stillpowered by the prompt emission until late times ($\sim$ hours after the burstevent). on the other hand, the same test performed for the e$_{\rmiso}$-normalised optical light curves shows that the optical emission is abetter proxy of the afterglow emission from early to late times.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1405.3981	afterglows from precursors in gamma ray bursts. application to the  optical afterglow of grb 091024	about 15% of gamma ray bursts have precursors, i.e. emission episodespreceding the main event, whose spectral and temporal properties are similar tothe main emission. we propose that precursors have their own fireball,producing afterglow emission due to the dissipation of the kinetic energy viaexternal shock. in the time lapse between the precursor and the main event, weassume that the central engine is not completely turned off, but it continuesto eject relativistic material at a smaller rate, whose emission is below thebackground level. the precursor fireball generates a first afterglow by theinteraction with the external circumburst medium. matter injected by thecentral engine during the "quasi-quiescent" phase replenishes the externalmedium with material in relativistic motion. the fireball corresponding to themain prompt emission episode crashes with this moving material, producing asecond afterglow, and finally catches up and merges with the first precursorfireball. we apply this new model to grb 091024, an event with a precursor inthe prompt light curve and two well defined bumps in the optical afterglow,obtaining an excellent agreement with the existing data.

1405.5131	a complete sample of bright swift short gamma-ray bursts	we present a carefully selected sample of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs)observed by the swift satellite up to june 2013. inspired by the criteria weused to build a similar sample of bright long grbs (the bat6 sample), weselected sgrbs with favorable observing conditions for the redshiftdetermination on ground, ending up with a sample of 36 events, almost half ofwhich with a redshift measure. the redshift completeness increases up to about70% (with an average redshift value of z = 0.85) by restricting to those eventsthat are bright in the 15-150 kev swift burst alert telescope energy band. suchflux-limited sample minimizes any redshift-related selection effects, and canprovide a robust base for the study of the energetics, redshift distributionand environment of the swift bright population of sgrbs. for all the events ofthe sample we derived the prompt and afterglow emission in both the observerand (when possible) rest frame and tested the consistency with the correlationsvalid for long grbs. the redshift and intrinsic x-ray absorbing column densitydistributions we obtain are consistent with the scenario of sgrbs originated bythe coalescence of compact objects in primordial binaries, with a possibleminor contribution (~10%-25%) of binaries formed by dynamical capture (orexperiencing large natal kicks). this sample is expected to significantlyincrease with further years of swift activity.

1406.6693	clustering of lat light curves: a clue to the origin of high-energy  emission in gamma-ray bursts	the physical origin of the &gt;0.1 gev emission detected from gamma-ray bursts(grbs) by the fermi satellite has not yet been completely understood. in thiswork we consider the gev light curves of ten grbs with measured redshiftdetected by the fermi-lat. these light curves are characterised by a long-lived($\gtrsim10^2$ seconds) emission, whose luminosity decays in time as apower-law. while the decay rate is similar for all grbs (i.e. $l_{lat}\proptot^{-1.2}$), the normalisation spans about two orders of magnitude inluminosity. however, after re-normalising the luminosities to the promptenergetics $e_{iso}$ the light curves overlap. we consider the scenario inwhich the temporally extended lat emission is dominated by synchrotronradiation from electrons accelerated at the forward external shock. accordingto this model, at high-energies (i.e. above the typical synchrotronfrequencies) a small dispersion of the $e_{iso}$-normalised light curves isexpected. the fact that the lat temporally extended emission follows thisbehaviour reinforces its interpretation in terms of afterglow radiation fromexternal shocks. assuming this scenario, we argue that the parameters$\epsilon_e$ and $\eta_\gamma$ (i.e., the fraction of shock-dissipated energygained by the electrons, and the efficiency of the mechanism producing theprompt radiation, respectively) must be narrowly distributed.

1409.1213	luminosity function and jet structure of gamma ray bursts	the structure of gamma ray burst (grb) jets impacts on their prompt andafterglow emission properties. the jet of grbs could be uniform, with constantenergy per unit solid angle within the jet aperture, or it could instead bestructured, namely with energy and velocity that depend on the angular distancefrom the axis of the jet. we try to get some insight about the still unknownstructure of grbs by studying their luminosity function. we show that low(1e46-1e48 erg/s) and high (i.e. with l &gt; 1e50 erg/s) luminosity grbs can bedescribed by a unique luminosity function, which is also consistent withcurrent lower limits in the intermediate luminosity range (1e48-1e50} erg/s).we derive analytical expressions for the luminosity function of grbs in uniformand structured jet models and compare them with the data. uniform jets canreproduce the entire luminosity function with reasonable values of the freeparameters. a structured jet can also fit adequately the current data, providedthat the energy within the jet is relatively strongly structured, i.e. e proptotheta^{-k} with k &gt; 4. the classical e propto theta^{-2} structured jet modelis excluded by the current data.

1410.5216	comparing the spectral lag of short and long gamma-ray bursts and its  relation with the luminosity	we investigated the rest frame spectral lags of two complete samples ofbright long (50) and short (6) gamma-ray bursts (grb) detected by swift. weanalysed the swift/bat data through a discrete cross-correlation function (ccf)fitted with an asymmetric gaussian function to estimate the lag and theassociated uncertainty. we find that half of the long grbs have a positive lagand half a lag consistent with zero. all short grbs have lags consistent withzero. the distributions of the spectral lags for short and long grbs havedifferent average values. limited by the small number of short grbs, we cannotexclude at more than 2 sigma significance level that the two distributions oflags are drawn from the same parent population. if we consider the entiresample of long grbs, we do not find evidence for a lag-luminosity correlation,rather the lag-luminosity plane appears filled on the left hand side, thussuggesting that the lag-luminosity correlation could be a boundary. short grbsare consistent with the long ones in the lag-luminosity plane.

0804.1675	the epeak-eiso plane of long gamma ray bursts and selection effects	we study the distribution of long gamma ray bursts in the ep-eiso and in theep,obs-fluence planes through an updated sample of 76 bursts, with measuredredshift and spectral parameters, detected up to september 2007. we confirm theexistence of a strong rest frame correlation ep ~ eiso^0.54+-0.01. contrary toprevious studies, no sign of evolution with redshift of the ep-eiso correlation(either its slope and normalisation) is found. the 76 bursts define a strongep,obs-fluence correlation in the observer frame (ep,obs ~ f^0.32+-0.05) withredshifts evenly distributed along this correlation. we study possibleinstrumental selection effects in the observer frame ep,obs-fluence plane. inparticular, we concentrate on the minimum peak flux necessary to trigger agiven grb detector (trigger threshold) and the minimum fluence a burst musthave to determine the value of ep,obs (spectral analysis threshold). we findthat the latter dominates in the ep,obs-fluence plane over the former. ouranalysis shows, however, that these instrumental selection effects do notdominate for bursts detected before the launch of the swift satellite, whilethe spectral analysis threshold is the dominant truncation effect of the swiftgrb sample (27 out of 76 events). this suggests that the ep,obs-fluencecorrelation defined by the pre--swift sample could be affected by other, stillnot understood, selection effects. besides we caution about the conclusions onthe existence of the ep,obs-fluence correlation based on our swift samplealone.

1502.02676	accessing the population of high redshift gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are a powerful probe of the high redshift universe.we present a tool to estimate the detection rate of high-z grbs by a genericdetector with defined energy band and sensitivity. we base this on a populationmodel that reproduces the observed properties of grbs detected by swift, fermiand cgro in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands. we provide the expectedcumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated grbs in differentenergy bands. we show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively highenergies (e.g. tens of kev to the mev), can detect only the most luminous grbsat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and theluminosity (ep-liso) of grbs. we show that the best strategy for catching thelargest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft x-ray band)but with a very high sensitivity. for instance, an imaging soft x-ray detectoroperating in the 0.2-5 kev energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding toa fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 atz&gt;5 (~3 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z&gt;10). once high-z grbs are detected the principalissue is to secure their redshift. to this aim we estimate their nir afterglowflux at relatively early times and evaluate the effectiveness of following themup and construct usable samples of events with any forthcoming grb missiondedicated to explore the high-z universe.

1502.06608	structure of gamma-ray burst jets: intrinsic versus apparent properties	with this paper we introduce the concept of apparent structure of a grb jet,as opposed to its intrinsic structure. the latter is customarily definedspecifying the functions epsilon(theta) (the energy emitted per jet unit solidangle) and gamma(theta) (the lorentz factor of the emitting material); theapparent structure is instead defined by us as the isotropic equivalent energye_iso(theta_v) as a function of the viewing angle theta_v. we show how topredict the apparent structure of a jet given its intrinsic structure. we findthat a gaussian intrinsic structure yields a power law apparent structure: thisopens a new viewpoint on the gaussian (which can be understood as a proxy for arealistic narrow, well collimated jet structure) as a possible candidate for aquasi-universal grb jet structure. we show that such a model (a) is consistentwith recent constraints on the observed luminosity function of grbs; (b)implies fewer orphan afterglows with respect to the standard uniform model; (c)can break out the progenitor star (in the collapsar scenario) without wastingan unreasonable amount of energy; (d) is compatible with the explanation of theamati correlation as a viewing angle effect; (e) can be very standard in energycontent, and still yield a very wide range of observed isotropic equivalentenergies.

1503.01131	gamma-ray burst jets: uniform or structured?	the structure of gamma-ray burst (grb) jets impacts on their prompt andafterglow emission properties. insights into the still unknown structure ofgrbs can be achieved by studying how different structures impact on theluminosity function (lf): i) we show that low ($10^{46} &lt; l_{\rm iso} &lt;10^{48}$ erg/s) and high (i.e. with $l_{\rm iso} &gt; 10^{50}$ erg/s) luminositygrbs can be described by a unique lf; ii) we find that a uniform jet (seen on-and off-axis) as well as a very steep structured jet (i.e. $\epsilon(\theta)\propto \theta^{-s}$ with $s &gt; 4$) can reproduce the current lf data; iii)taking into account the emission from the whole jet (i.e. includingcontributions from mildly relativistic, off-axis jet elements) we find that$e_{\rm iso}(\theta_{\rm v})$ (we dub this quantity "apparent structure") canbe very different from the intrinsic structure $\epsilon(\theta)$: inparticular, a jet with a gaussian intrinsic structure has an apparent structurewhich is more similar to a power law. this opens a new viewpoint on thequasi-universal structured jet hypothesis.

1504.02096	unveiling the population of orphan gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts are detectable in the gamma-ray band if their jets areoriented towards the observer. however, for each grb with a typical theta_jet,there should be ~2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewherein space. these off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to thedeceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparableto the viewing angle. orphan afterglows (oa) should outnumber the currentpopulation of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not beenconclusively observed so far at any frequency. we compute the expected flux ofthe population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and x-ray bands througha population synthesis code of grbs and the standard afterglow emission model.we estimate the detection rate of oa by on-going and forthcoming surveys. theaverage duration of oa as transients above a given limiting flux is derived anddescribed with analytical expressions: in general oa should appear as dailytransients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radioband. we find that ~ 2 oa yr^-1 could already be detected by gaia and up to 20oa yr^-1 could be observed by the ztf survey. a larger number of 50 oa yr^-1should be detected by lsst in the optical band. for the x-ray band, ~ 26 oayr^-1 could be detected by the erosita. for the large population of oadetectable by lsst, the x-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for thebrightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm andradio band could be the key to disentangle their grb nature from otherextragalactic transients of comparable flux density.

1506.05463	the rate and luminosity function of long gamma ray bursts	we derive, adopting a direct method, the luminosity function and theformation rate of long gamma ray bursts through a complete, flux-limited,sample of swift bursts which has a high level of completeness in redshift z(~82%). we parametrise the redshift evolution of the grb luminosity as l =l_0(1+ z)^k and we derive k = 2.5, consistently with recent estimates. thede-evolved luminosity function of grbs can be represented by a broken power lawwith slopes a = -1.32 +- 0.21 and b = -1.84 +- 0.24 below and above,respectively, a characteristic break luminosity l_0,b = 10^51.45+-0.15 erg/s.under the hypothesis of luminosity evolution we find that the grb formationrate increases with redshift up to z~2, where it peaks, and then decreases inagreement with the shape of the cosmic star formation rate. we test the directmethod through numerical simulations and we show that if it is applied toincomplete (both in redshift and/or flux) grb samples it can misleadinglyresult in an excess of the grb formation rate at low redshifts.

0806.3076	precursors in swift gamma ray bursts with redshift	we study a sample of gamma-ray bursts detected by the swift satellite withknown redshift which show a precursor in the swift-bat light curve. we analyzethe spectra of the precursors and compare them with the time integrated spectraof the prompt emission. we find neither a correlation between the two slopesnor a tendency for the precursors spectra to be systematically harder or softerthan the prompt ones. the energetics of the precursors are large: on average,they are just a factor of a few less energetic (in the source rest frame energyrange 15-150 kev) than the entire bursts. these properties do not depend uponthe quiescent time between the end of the precursor and the start of the mainevent. these results suggest that what has been called a "precursor" is not aphenomenon distinct from the main event, but is tightly connected with it, evenif, in some case, the quiescent time intervals can be longer than 100 seconds.

astro-ph;0301390	hard grb spectra: thermal vs non-thermal emission	we consider the evidence for very hard low energy spectra during the promptphase of gamma ray bursts (grb). in particular we examine the spectralevolution of grb 980306 together with the detailed analysis of some otherbursts already presented in the literature (grb 911118, grb 910807, grb 910927and grb 970111), and check for the significance of their hardness by applyingdifferent tests. the hard spectra of these bursts and their evolution constrainseveral non--thermal emission models, which appear inadequate to account forthese cases. the extremely hard spectra at the beginning of their promptemission are also compared with a black body spectral model: the resulting fitsare remarkably good. these findings on the possible thermal character of theevolving spectrum and their implications on the grb physical scenario can beconsidered in the frameworks of photospheric models for a fireball which isbecoming optically thin, and of the compton drag model. both models appear tobe qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the found spectralcharacteristics.

astro-ph;0310861	the spectra of short gamma-ray bursts	we present the results of the spectral analysis of a sample of short bright$\gamma$--ray bursts (grb) detected by batse and compare them with the averageand time resolved spectral properties of long bright bursts. while the spectralparameters of short grbs confirm, as expected from previous works based on thehardness ratio, that they are harder than long events, we find that thisdifference is mainly due to a harder low energy spectral component present inshort bursts, rather than to a (marginally) different peak energy. intriguinglyour analysis also reveals that the emission properties of short grbs aresimilar to the first 2 s of long events. this might suggest that the centralengine of long and short grbs is the same, just working for a longer time forlong grbs. we find that short bursts do not obey the correlation between peakfrequency and isotropic emitted energy for any assumed redshift, while they canobey the similar correlation between the peak frequency and isotropic emittedluminosity. this is consistent with (although not a proof of) the idea thatshort grbs emit a $\gamma$--ray luminosity similar to long grbs. if they indeedobey the peak frequency -- isotropic luminosity relation, we can estimate theredshift distribution of short bursts, which turns out to be consistent withthat of long bursts just with a slightly smaller average redshift.

astro-ph;0312294	short-bright grbs: spectral properties	we study the spectra of short-bright grbs detected by batse and compare themwith the average and time resolved spectral properties of long-bright bursts.we confirm that short events are harder than long bursts, as already found fromthe comparison of their (fluence) hardness ratio, but we find that thisdifference is mainly due to a harder low energy spectral component present inshort bursts, rather than to a (marginally) different peak energy. moreover, wefind that short grbs are similar to the first 1 sec emission of long bursts.the comparison of the energetic of short and long bursts also suggests thatshort grbs do not obey the peak energy--equivalent isotropic energy correlationrecently proposed for long events, implying that short grbs emit lower energythan long ones. nonetheless, short bursts seem to emit a luminosity similar tolong grbs and under such hypothesis their redshift distribution appearsconsistent with that observed for long events. these findings might suggest thepresence of a common mechanism at the beginning of short and long bursts whichoperates on different timescales in the these two classes.

astro-ph;0408350	gamma ray bursts: new rulers to measure the universe	the best measure of the universe should be done using a standard "ruler" atany redshift. type ia supernovae (sn ia) probe the universe up to z$\sim$1.5,while the cosmic microwave background (cmb) primary anisotropies concernbasically $z\sim$1000. apparently, gamma--ray bursts (grbs) are all butstandard candles. however, their emission is collimated and thecollimation--corrected energy correlates tightly with the frequency at whichmost of the radiation of the prompt is emitted, as found by ghirlanda et al.(2004). through this correlation we can infer the burst energy accuratelyenough to probe the intermediate redshift ($z&lt;10$) universe. using the bestknown 15 grbs we find very encouraging results that emphasize the cosmologicalgrb role. a combined fit with sn ia yields $\omega_{\rm m}=0.37\pm0.10$ and$\omega_{\lambda}=0.87\pm 0.23$. assuming in addition a flat universe, theparameters are constrained to be $\omega_{\rm m}=0.29\pm0.04$ and$\omega_{\lambda}=0.71\pm 0.05$. grbs accomplish the role of "missing link"between sn ia and cmb primary anisotropies. they can provide a new insight onthe cosmic effects of dark energy, complementary to the one supplied by cmbsecondary anisotropies through the integrated sachs wolfe effect. theunexpected standard candle cosmological role of grbs motivates the mostoptimistic hopes for what can be obtained when the grb-dedicated satellite,swift, will be launched.

astro-ph;0501395	a new method optimized to use gamma ray bursts as cosmic rulers	we present a new method aimed to handle long gamma-ray burst (grbs) as cosmicrulers. the recent discovery of a tight correlation between the collimationcorrected grb energy and the peak of the gamma-ray spectrum has opened thepossibility to use grbs as a new category of standard candles. unfortunately,because of the lack of low-z grbs, up to now this correlation is obtained fromhigh-z grbs with the consequence that it depends on the cosmological parameterswe pretend to constrain. hopefully this circularity problem will be solvedwhen, in a few years, the low-z grb sample will be increased enough. in themeanwhile we present here a new bayesian method that eases the aforesaidcircularity problem, and allows to introduce new constrains on the cosmological(om,ol) diagram as well as to explore the universe kinematics up to z~3. themethod we propose offers the further advantage to make handy the problem of the(om,ol) loitering line singularity which inevitably appears when standardcandles with z&gt;2 are used. the combination of grb with sn ia data makes thepopular lambdacdm cosmology more consistent with the hubble diagram at a 68%confidence level. for a flat cosmology we find om=0.28\pm0.03 for the combinedgrb+sn ia data set. correspondingly, the transition redshift between cosmicdeceleration and acceleration is z_t=0.73\pm0.09, slightly larger than thevalue found by considering sne ia alone. we briefly discuss our results also interms of non--lambdacdm dark energy models.

astro-ph;0502488	the peak luminosity - peak energy correlation in grbs	we derive the peak luminosity - peak energy (l_iso - e_peak) correlationusing 22 long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with firm redshift measurements. we findthat its slope is similar to the correlation between the time integratedisotropic emitted energy e_iso and e_peak (amati et al. 2002). for the 15 grbsin our sample with estimated jet opening angle we compute the collimationcorrected peak luminosity l_gamma, and find that it correlates with e_peak.this has, however, a scatter larger than the correlation between e_peak ande_gamma (the time integrated emitted energy, corrected for collimation;ghirlanda et al. 2004), which we ascribe to the fact that the opening angle isestimated through the global energetics. we have then selected a large sampleof 442 grbs with pseudo--redshifts, derived through the lag-luminosityrelation, to test the existence of the l_iso-e_peak correlation. with thissample we also explore the possibility of a correlation between time resolvedquantities, namely l_iso,p and the peak energy at the peak of emissione_peak,p.

astro-ph;0503630	grb jets inside and outside the star: precursors and cosmological  implications	after many years of speculation, recent observations have confirmed theassociation of gamma-ray bursts with core-collapse supernova explosions frommassive stars. this association carries with it important consequences. theburst relativistic jet has to propagate through the cold dense stellar materialbefore it reaches the transparency radius and the burst photons are produced.this propagation is likely to affect the initial properties of the jet, shapingit and changing its energy composition. the variability injected at the base ofthe jet is also likely to be erased by the jet-star interaction. despite this,grbs seem to have remarkably predictable properties once the radiative phasesets in, as emphasized by the recent discovery of several tight correlationbetween spectral, geometric and energetic properties of the jet. in thiscontribution we discuss the jet interaction with the star, emphasizing itstime-dependent properties and the resulting energy distribution. we finallyemphasize the surprising predictability of jet and radiation properties outsidethe star and underline its implication for standardizing the grb candle.

astro-ph;0507362	a gamma-ray burst mission to investigate the properties of dark energy	[abridged] very recently, relations between the peak energy of gamma-rayburst burst spectra, the isotropic-equivalent energy of the burst, and theradiated energy of the burst have been found. in a way that is exactlyanalogous to the way in which the relation between the peak luminosity and therate of decline of the light curve of type ia supernovae can be used to maketype ia supernovae excellent standard candles for cosmology, so too, therelations between epk, eiso, and egamma point toward a methodology for usinggrbs as excellent standard candles for cosmology. in addition, grbs occur overthe broad redshift range from z=0.1 to at least z=4.5, and both they and theirafterglows are easily detectable out to z &gt; 8. thus grbs show great promise ascosmological ``yardsticks'' to measure the rate of expansion of the universeover time, and therefore the properties of dark energy (i.e., omega_m,omega_lambda, w_0, and w_a).  we describe a concept for a possible midex-class mission dedicated to usinggrbs to constrain the properties of dark energy that would obtain thesequantities for &gt; 800 bursts in the redshift range 0.1 &gt;~ z &lt;~ 10 during a2-year mission. this burst sample would enable both omega_m and w_0 to bedetermined to +/- 0.07 and +/- 0.06 (68% cl), respectively, and w_a to besignificantly constrained.

astro-ph;0508447	the clustering of the luminosities of optical afterglows of long gamma  ray bursts	we studied the optical afterglows of the 24 pre-swift gamma-ray bursts withknown spectroscopic redshift and published estimates of the optical extinctionin the source frame. we find an unexpected clustering of the optical afterglowluminosities measured 12 hours (source frame time) after the trigger. for 21out of 24 bursts, the distribution of the optical luminosities is narrower thanthe distribution of the x-ray luminosities, and even narrower than thedistribution of the ratio between the monochromatic optical luminosities andthe total isotropic emitted prompt energy. three bursts stand apart from thedistribution of the other sources, being underluminous by a factor ~15. wecompare this result with the somewhat analogous result concerning theluminosity of the x-ray afterglows studied by gendre &amp; boer. for all our grbswe construct the optical to x-ray spectral energy distribution. for all but aminority of them, the optical and the x-ray emissions are consistent with beingproduced by the same radiation process. we discuss our results in the frameworkof the "standard" external shock synchrotron model. finally, we consider thebehavior of the first grbs of known redshifts detected by swift. we find thatthese swift grbs entirely confirm our findings.

astro-ph;0510058	gamma--ray bursts associated with supernovae: a systematic analysis of  batse grb candidates	we examined the properties of a sample of batse gamma--ray bursts (grbs)comprising events which have indications of association with a supernova (sn),some on the basis of indications of re--brightening in the optical afterglowlight curve, but in most cases based only on the `loose' temporal anddirectional coincidence inferred from the cross correlation of catalogs.despite of the large uncertainties in the latter selection method, the temporaland spectral analysis reveal three interesting statistical results when thesample is compared with that of all the batse grbs: the grbs tentativelyassociated with sne are found to predominantly (in $\sim$ 80% of the cases)have single-peaked light curves, a softer spectrum (i.e. low energy power lawindex $\alpha \sim$ --1.5) and tend not to follow the lag-luminosity andisotropic energy--peak energy correlations. these three independent statisticalproperties point toward the existence of a significant number ofunder-luminous,grb 980425-like events constituting -- at least from anobservational point of view -- a tail or a separate class with respect to thewhole of the batse grb events. the unusually high percentage of sn ibc amongthose identified by the catalog cross--correlation (factor $\sim 4$ higher thanexpected from sn catalog statistics) reinforces the non-randomness of (some of)the selected events.

astro-ph;0511499	on the interpretation of the spectral--energy correlations in long  gamma--ray bursts	recently, liang &amp; zhang (2005) found a tight correlation involving onlyobservable quantities, namely the isotropic emitted energy $e_{\gamma,iso}$,the energy of the peak of the prompt spectrum $e^\prime_{p}$, and the jet breaktime $t^\prime_{j}$. this phenomenological correlation can have a firstexplanation in the framework of jetted fireballs, whose semiaperture angle$\theta_{j}$ is measured by the jet break time $t^\prime_{j}$. by correcting$e_{\gamma, iso}$ for the angle $\theta_{j}$ one obtains the so calledghirlanda correlation linking the collimation corrected energy $e_\gamma$ and$e^\prime_{p}$. there are two ways to derive $\theta_{j}$ from $t^\prime_{j}$in the standard scenario, corresponding to an homogeneous or to a wind-likecircumburst medium. we show that the ghirlanda correlation with a wind-likemedium is as tight as (if not tighter) than the ghirlanda correlation found inthe case of an homogeneous medium. there are hence two ghirlanda correlations,both entirely consistent with the phenomenological liang &amp; zhang relation. weconsider the difference between the observed correlations and the ones onewould see in the comoving frame (i.e. moving with the same bulk lorentz factorof the fireball). since both $e_{p}$ and $e_\gamma$ transform in the same way,the wind-like ghirlanda relation, which is linear, remains linear also in thecomoving frame, no matter the distribution of bulk lorentz factors. instead, inthe homogeneous density case, one is forced to assume the existence of a strictrelation between the bulk lorentz factor and the total energy, which in turnput constraints on the radiation mechanisms of the prompt emission. thewind-like ghirlanda correlation, being linear, corresponds to different burstshaving the same number of photons.

astro-ph;0511559	cosmological constraints with grbs: homogeneous medium vs wind density  profile	we present the constraints on the cosmological parameters obtained with the$e_{\rm peak}$--$e_{\gamma}$ correlation found with the most recent sample of19 grbs with spectroscopically measured redshift and well determined promptemission spectral and afterglow parameters. we compare our results obtained inthe two possible uniform jet scenarios, i.e. assuming a homogeneous densityprofile (hm) or a wind density profile (wm) for the circumburst medium. betterconstraints on $\omega_{m}$ and $\omega_{\lambda}$ are obtained with the(tighter) $e_{\rm peak}$--$e_{\gamma}$ correlation derived in the wind densityscenario. we explore the improvements to the constraints of the cosmologicalparameters that could be reached with a large sample, $\sim$ 150 grbs, in thefuture. we study the possibility to calibrate the slope of these correlations.our optimization analysis suggests that $\sim 12$ grbs with redshift$z\in(0.9,1.1)$ can be used to calibrate the $e_{\rm peak}$--$e_{\gamma}$ witha precision better than 1%. the same precision is expected for the same numberof bursts with $z\in(0.45,0.75)$. this result suggests that we do notnecessarily need a large sample of low z grbs for calibrating the slope ofthese correlations.

astro-ph;0511795	on the correlation of short gamma--ray bursts and clusters of galaxies	we cross correlate gamma--ray bursts and x--ray selected clusters of galaxiesat z\leq0.45. we find a positive 2\sigma signal for the angularcross--correlation function w_{bc}(\theta) on scales \theta\leq 3 deg betweenshort grbs and clusters. conversely, no correlation is found between clustersand the population of long grbs. the comparison with the clusterautocorrelation function shows that short grbs do not trace the clusterdistribution as not all short grbs are found in clusters. a higher signal inw_{bc}(\theta) is found if we only consider the cluster population up to z=0.1.by comparing the short burst autocorrelation function with model predictions wethen constrain short bursts to mostly originate within \sim 270 mpc (i.e. z\leq0.06). our analysis also reveals that short grbs are better correlated with``normal'' galaxies. the double compact object merger model for short grbswould associate them preferentially to early--type galaxies but the presentstatistics do not allow us to exclude that at least a fraction of these eventsmight also take place in late--type galaxies, in agreement with recentevidences.

astro-ph;0605073	discovery of a tight correlation among the prompt emission properties of  long gamma ray bursts	we report the discovery of a correlation among three prompt emissionproperties of grbs. these are the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso, the peakenergy of the time-integrated prompt emission spectrum e_pk, and the ``highsignal" timescale t_0.45, previously used to characterize the variabilitybehavior of bursts. in the rest frame of the source the found correlation readsl_iso\propto e_pk^1.62 t_0.45^-0.49. we find other strong correlations, but atthe cost of increasing the number of variables, involving the variability andthe isotropic energy of the prompt emission. with respect to the previous tightcorrelations found in grbs the newly found correlation does not require anyinformation from the afterglow phase of the bursts, nor any model-dependentassumption. in the popular scenario in which we are receiving beamed radiationoriginating in a fireball pointing at us, the found correlation preserves itsform in the comoving frame. this helps to explain the small scatter of thecorrelation, and underlines the role of the local brightness (i.e. thebrightness of the visible fraction of the fireball surface). this correlationhas been found for 19 objects, and it is hard to establish if any selectionbias affects it. its connection with the prompt local brightness is promising,but a solid physical understanding is still to be found. despite all that, wefind that some properties of the correlation, which we discuss, support itstrue existence, and this has important implications for the grb physics.furthermore, it is possible to use such correlation as an accurate redshiftestimator, and its tightness will allow us to use it as a tool to constrain thecosmological parameters (abridged)

astro-ph;0605267	long gamma-ray burst prompt emission properties as a cosmological tool	recently, a tight correlation among three quantities that characterize theprompt emission of long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with known redshift z, wasdiscovered (firmani et al. 2006). we use this correlation to construct thehubble diagram (hd) with a sample of 19 grbs in the broad range of z=0.17-4.5,and carry out a full statistical analysis to constrain cosmological parameters(cps). to optimally solve the problem of circularity, a bayesian approach isapplied. the main result is that the concordance lambdacdm cosmology is fullyconsistent with the grb data at the level of several tests. if we assume thelambda cosmology, then we find om_m=0.31^{+0.09}_{-0.08} andom_lambda=0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.30}$ (1sigma); the flat-geometry case is within1sigma. assuming flatness, we find om_m=0.29^{+0.08}_{-0.06}, and fixingom_m=0.28, we obtain a dark energy equation of state parameterw=-1.07^{+0.25}_{-0.38}, i.e. the ambdacdm model (w=-1) is within 1sigma. giventhe low number of usable grbs we cannot yet constrain well the possibleevolution of w=w(z). however, the case w(z)=-1 (lambdacdm) is consistent at the68.3% cl with grbs. it is shown also how a broad range of z's in the usedsample improves the determination of cps from the hd, which is the case of grbsas distance indicators.

astro-ph;0608555	puzzled by grb 060218	we study the optical-uv/x-ray spectral energy distribution of grb 060218during the prompt phase and during what seems to be the afterglow phase. theresults are puzzling, since if the opt-uv and the x-ray emission belong to asingle backbody (bb), then its luminosity is too large, and this bb cannot beinterpreted as the signature of the shock breakout of the supernova. there arealso serious problems in associating the emission expected by the supernovashock breakout with either the opt-uv or the x-ray emission. in the former casewe derive too small ejecta velocities; in the latter case, on the contrary, therequired velocity is too large, corresponding to the large radius of a bbrequired to peak close to the uv band. we then present what we think is themost conservative alternative explanation, namely a synchrotron spectrum,self-absorbed in the opt-uv and extending up to the x-ray band, where weobserve the emission of the most energetic electrons, which are responsible forthe exponential roll-over of the spectrum. the obtained fit can explain theentire spectrum except the bb observed in the x-rays, which must be a separatecomponent. the puzzling feature of this interpretation is that the same modelis required to explain the spectrum also at later times, up to 1e5 s, becausethe opt-uv emission remains constant in shape and also (approximately) innormalisation. in this case the observed x-ray flux is produced by self-comptonemission. thus the prompt emission phase should last for ~1e5 s or more.finally, we show that the bb observed in x-rays, up to 7000 seconds, can bephotospheric emission from the cocoon or stellar material, energized by the grbjet at radii comparable to the stellar radius (i.e. 1e10-1e11 cm), not very farfrom where this material becomes transparent (e.g. 1e12 cm).

astro-ph;0610248	gamma ray bursts as standard candles to constrain the cosmological  parameters	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are among the most powerful sources in the universe:they emit up to 10^54 erg in the hard x-ray band in few tens of seconds. thecosmological origin of grbs has been confirmed by several spectroscopicmeasurements of their redshifts, distributed in the range 0.1-6.3. these twoproperties make grbs very appealing to investigate the far universe. theenergetics implied by the observed fluences and redshifts span at least fourorders of magnitudes. therefore, at first sight, grbs are all but standardcandles. but there are correlations among some observed quantities which allowus to know the total energy or the peak luminosity emitted by a specific burstwith a great accuracy. through these correlations, grbs become "known" candlesto constrain the cosmological parameters. one of these correlation is betweenthe rest frame peak spectral energy e_peak and the total energy emitted ingamma--rays e_gamma, properly corrected for the collimation factor. anothercorrelation, discovered very recently, relates the total grb luminosity l_iso,its peak spectral energy e_peak and a characteristic timescale t_0.45, relatedto the variability of the prompt emission. it is based only on prompt emissionproperties, it is completely phenomenological, model independent andassumption--free. the constraints found through these correlations on theomega_m and omega_lambda parameters are consistent with the concordance model.the present limited sample of bursts and the lack of low redshift events,necessary to calibrate these correlations, makes the cosmological constraintsobtained with grbs still large compared to those obtained with othercosmological probes (e.g. snia or cmb). however, the newly born field ofgrb--cosmology is very promising for the future.

astro-ph;0701430	"late prompt" emission in gamma ray bursts?	the flat decay phase in the first 1e2-1e4 seconds of the x-ray light curve ofgamma ray bursts (grbs) has not yet found a convincing explanation. the factthat the optical and x-ray lightcurves are often different, with breaks atdifferent times, makes contrived any explanation based on the same origin forboth the x-ray and optical fluxes. we here assume that the central engine canbe active for a long time, producing shells of decreasing bulk lorentz factorsgamma. we also assume that the internal dissipation of these late shellsproduces a continuous and smooth emission (power-law in time), usually dominantin x-rays and sometimes in the optical. when gamma of the late shells is largerthan 1/theta_j, where theta_j is the jet opening angle, we see only a portionof the emitting surface. eventually, gamma becomes smaller than 1/theta_j, andthe entire emitting surface is visible. thus there is a break in the lightcurve when gamma=1/theta_j, which we associate to the time at which the plateauends. after the steeply decaying phase which follows the early prompt, we seethe sum of two emission components: the "late-prompt" emission (due to lateinternal dissipation), and the "real afterglow" emission (due to externalshocks). a variety of different optical and x-ray light curves are thenpossible, explaining why the x-ray and the optical light curves often do nottrack each other (but sometimes do), and often they do not have simultaneousbreaks.

astro-ph;0701705	the role of afterglow break-times as grb jet angle indicators	the early x-ray light curve of gamma ray bursts (grbs) is complex, and showsa typical steep-flat-steep behaviour. the time t_a at which the flat (plateau)part ends may bear some important physical information, especially if it playsthe same role of the so called jet break time t_jet. to this aim, stimulated bythe recent analysis of willingale et al., we have assembled a sample of grbs ofknown redshifts, spectral parameters of the prompt emission, and t_a. by usingt_a as a jet angle indicator, and then estimating the collimation correctedprompt energetics, we find a correlation between the latter quantity and thepeak energy of the prompt emission. however, this correlation has a largedispersion, similar to the dispersion of the amati correlation and it is notparallel to the ghirlanda correlation. furthermore, we show that thecorrelation itself results mainly from the dependence of the jet opening angleon the isotropic prompt energy, with the time t_a playing no role, contrary towhat we find for the jet break time t_jet. we also find that for the bursts inour sample t_a weakly correlates with e_iso of the prompt emission, but thatthis correlation disappears when considering all bursts of known redshift andt_a. there is no correlation between t_a and the isotropic energy of theplateau phase.

0811.1038	a unifying view of gamma ray burst afterglows	we selected a sample of 33 gamma ray bursts (grbs) detected by swift, withknown redshift and optical extinction at the host frame. for these, weconstructed the de-absorbed and k-corrected x-ray and optical rest frame lightcurves. these are modelled as the sum of two components: emission from theforward shock due to the interaction of a fireball with the circum-burst mediumand an additional component, treated in a completely phenomenological way. thelatter can be identified, among other possibilities, as "late prompt" emissionproduced by a long lived central engine with mechanisms similar to thoseresponsible for the production of the "standard" early prompt radiation. apartfrom flares or re-brightenings, that we do not model, we find a good agreementwith the data, despite of their complexity and diversity. although based inpart on a phenomenological model with a relatively large number of freeparameters, we believe that our findings are a first step towards theconstruction of a more physical scenario. our approach allows us to interpretthe behaviour of the optical and x-ray afterglows in a coherent way, by arelatively simple scenario. within this context it is possible to explain whysometimes no jet break is observed; why, even if a jet break is observed, it isoften chromatic; why the steepening after the jet break time is often shallowerthan predicted. finally, the decay slope of the late prompt emission after theshallow phase is found to be remarkably similar to the time profile expected bythe accretion rate of fall-back material (i.e. proportional to t^{-5/3}),suggesting that this can be the reason why the central engine can be active fora long time.

0811.1578	time-resolved spectral correlations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts	for a sample of long grbs with known redshift, we study the distribution ofthe evolutionary tracks on the rest-frame luminosity-peak energy liso-ep'diagram. we are interested in exploring the extension of the `yonetoku'correlation to any phase of the prompt light curve, and in verifying how thehigh-signal prompt duration time, tf, in the rest frame correlates with theresiduals of such correlation (firmani et al. 2006). for our purpose, weanalyse separately two samples of time-resolved spectra corresponding to 32grbs with peak fluxes &gt;1.8 phot cm^-2 s^-1 from the swift-bat detector, and 7bright grbs from the cgro-batse detector previously processed by kaneko et al.(2006). after constructing the liso-ep' diagram, we discuss the relevance ofselection effects, finding that they could affect significantly thecorrelation. however, we find that these effects are much less significant inthe liso x tf-ep' diagram, where the intrinsic scatter reduces significantly.we apply further corrections for reducing the intrinsic scatter even more. forthe sub-samples of grbs (7 from swift and 5 from cgro) with measured jet breaktime, we analyse the effects of correcting liso by jet collimation. we findthat (i) the scatter around the correlation is reduced, and (ii) this scatteris dominated by the internal scatter of the individual evolutionary tracks.these results suggest that the time, integrated `amati' and `ghirlanda'correlations are consequences of the time resolved features, not of selectioneffects, and therefore call for a physical origin. we finally remark therelevance of looking inside the nature of the evolutionary tracks.
