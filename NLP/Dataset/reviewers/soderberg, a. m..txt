0901.0710	an intermediate luminosity transient in ngc300: the eruption of a  dust-enshrouded massive star	[abridged] we present multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectroscopy,uv/radio/x-ray imaging, and archival hubble and spitzer observations of anintermediate luminosity optical transient recently discovered in the nearbygalaxy ngc300. we find that the transient (ngc300 ot2008-1) has a peak absolutemagnitude of m_bol~-11.8 mag, intermediate between novae and supernovae, andsimilar to the recent events m85 ot2006-1 and sn2008s. our high-resolutionspectra, the first for this event, are dominated by intermediate velocity(~200-1000 km/s) hydrogen balmer lines and caii emission and absorption linesthat point to a complex circumstellar environment, reminiscent of the yellowhypergiant irc+10420. in particular, we detect broad caii h&amp;k absorption withan asymmetric red wing extending to ~1000 km/s, indicative of gas infall onto amassive and relatively compact star (blue supergiant or wolf-rayet star); anextended red supergiant progenitor is unlikely. the origin of the inflowing gasmay be a previous ejection from the progenitor or the wind of a massive binarycompanion. the low luminosity, intermediate velocities, and overall similarityto a known eruptive star indicate that the event did not result in a completedisruption of the progenitor. we identify the progenitor in archival spitzerobservations, with deep upper limits from hubble data. the spectral energydistribution points to a dust-enshrouded star with a luminosity of about 6x10^4l_sun, indicative of a ~10-20 m_sun progenitor (or binary system). thisconclusion is in good agreement with our interpretation of the outburst andcircumstellar properties. the lack of significant extinction in the transientspectrum indicates that the dust surrounding the progenitor was cleared by theoutburst.

0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0905.0001	the host galaxies of swift dark gamma-ray bursts: observational  constraints on highly obscured and very high-redshift grbs	in this work we present the first results of our imaging campaign at keckobservatory to identify the host galaxies of "dark" gamma-ray bursts (grbs),events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical fluxsignificantly fainter than expected from the observed x-ray afterglow. we findthat out of a uniform sample of 29 swift bursts rapidly observed by the palomar60-inch telescope through march 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), allevents have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxydetection, or both. our results constrain the fraction of swift grbs comingfrom very high redshift (z &gt; 7), such as the recent grb 090423, to between0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. in contrast, a significant fraction of thesample requires large extinction columns (host-frame a_v &gt; 1 mag, with severalevents showing a_v &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominantcause of the dark grb phenomenon. we infer that a significant fraction of grbs(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscuredregions. however, the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal opticalcolors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinityof the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

0905.0690	the collimation and energetics of the brightest swift gamma-ray bursts	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are widely believed to behighly-collimated explosions (opening angle theta ~ 1-10 deg). as a result ofthis beaming factor, the true energy release from a grb is usually severalorders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. measuring thisopening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in theafterglow light curve (a "jet" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in theswift era. here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of theisotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, e(gamma, iso)) grbs in the swift erato search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energyrelease. we present multi-wavelength (radio through x-ray) observations of grbs050820a, 060418, and 080319b, and construct afterglow models to extract theopening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.together with results from previous analyses of grbs 050904 and 070125, we findevidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supportingthe canonical picture of grbs as collimated explosions. the most naturalexplanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most swift grbs istherefore selection effects. however, the opening angles for the events in oursample are larger than would be expected if all grbs had a canonical energyrelease of ~ 10e51 erg. the total energy release we measure for those"hyper-energetic" (e(total) &gt;~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enoughto start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0906.2003	a faint type of supernova from a white dwarf with a helium-rich  companion	supernovae (sne) are thought to arise from two different physical processes.the cores of massive, short-lived stars undergo gravitational core collapse andtypically eject a few solar masses during their explosion. these are thought toappear as as type ib/c and ii sne, and are associated with young stellarpopulations. a type ia sn is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonationof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose massapproaches the chandrasekhar limit. such sne are observed in both young and oldstellar environments. here we report our discovery of the faint type ib sn2005e in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, ngc 1032.  the lack of any trace of recent star formation near the sn location (fig. 1),and the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 m_sun), argue strongly against acore-collapse origin for this event. spectroscopic observations and the derivednucleosynthetic output show that the sn ejecta have high velocities and aredominated by helium-burning products, indicating that sn 2005e was neither asubluminous nor a regular sn ia (fig. 2). we have therefore found a new type ofstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likelyinvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. thesn ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of sn and likelyadditional large amounts of radioactive 44ti. such sne may thus help resolvefundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitivesolar system and that of the oldest stars, to the galactic production ofpositrons.

0908.2817	a relativistic type ibc supernova without a detected gamma-ray burst	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) mark the explosive death of somemassive stars and are a rare sub-class of type ibc supernovae (sne ibc). theyare distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativisticoutflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and along-lived radio afterglow. to date, central engine-driven sne have beendiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expectedthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivityor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. in thisframework, the recovery of undetected grbs may be possible through radiosearches for sne ibc with relativistic outflows. here we report the discoveryof luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type ibc sn 2009bb,which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.the lack of a coincident grb makes sn 2009bb the first engine-driven sndiscovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. a comparison with our extensiveradio survey of sne ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines islow, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferredrate of nearby grbs. our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radiosurveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearestengine-driven sne. a similar result for a different supernova is reportedindependently.

0908.2818	the high-metallicity explosion environment of the relativistic supernova  2009bb	we investigate the environment of the nearby (d ~ 40mpc) broad-lined type icsupernova sn 2009bb. this event was observed to produce a relativistic outflowlikely powered by a central accreting compact object. while such a phenomenonwas previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), no lgrbwas detected in association with sn 2009bb. using an optical spectrum of the sn2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ism properties for the hostenvironment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and starformation rate. we compare the sn explosion site properties to observations oflgrb and broad-lined sn ic host environments on optical emission line ratiodiagnostic diagrams. based on these analyses, we find that the sn 2009bbexplosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement withother broad-lined sn ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshiftlgrb host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits forrelativistic explosions. we consider the implications of these findings and theimpact that sn 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have onour understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some sne toproduce a relativistic outflow.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1106.3568	the birth of a relativistic outflow in the unusual {\gamma}-ray  transient swift j164449.3+573451	active galactic nuclei (agn), powered by long-term accretion onto centralsupermassive black holes, produce relativistic jets with lifetimes of greaterthan one million yr that preclude observations at birth. transient accretiononto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of astray star, may therefore offer a unique opportunity to observe and study thebirth of a relativistic jet. on 2011 march 25, the swift {\gamma}-ray satellitediscovered an unusual transient source (swift j164449.3+573451) potentiallyrepresenting such an event. here we present the discovery of a luminous radiotransient associated with swift j164449.3+573451, and an extensive set ofobservations spanning centimeter to millimeter wavelengths and covering thefirst month of evolution. these observations lead to a positional coincidencewith the nucleus of an inactive galaxy, and provide direct evidence for anewly-formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto amillion solar mass black hole. while a relativistic outflow was not predictedin this scenario, we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturallyexplains the high-energy properties, radio luminosity, and the inferred rate ofsuch events. the weaker beaming in the radio compared to {\gamma}-rays/x-rays,suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z ~6.

1107.1740	x-ray flare candidates in short gamma-ray bursts	we present the first systematic study of x-ray flare candidates in shortgamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) exploiting the large 6-year swift database with theaim to constrain the physical nature of such fluctuations. we find that flarecandidates appear in different types of sgrb host galaxy environments and showno clear correlation with the x-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates aredetected both in sgrbs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-raysand in sgrbs which do not show such component. we furthermore show that sgrbx-ray flare candidates only partially share the set of observational propertiesof long grb (lgrb) flares. in particular,the main parameter driving theduration evolution of x-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to bethe elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on thedifferent progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, promptvariability time-scales and energy budgets. on the contrary, sgrb flarecandidates significantly differ from lgrb flares in terms of peak luminosity,isotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variabilityflux. however, these differences disappear when the central engine time-scalesand energy budget are accounted for, suggesting that (i) flare candidates andprompt pulses in sgrbs likely have a common origin; (ii) similar dissipationand/or emission mechanisms are responsible for the prompt and flare emission inlong and short grbs, with sgrbs being less energetic albeit faster evolvingversions of the long class. finally, we show that in strict analogy to the sgrbprompt emission, flares candidates fall off the lag-luminosity relation definedby lgrbs, thus strengthening the sgrb flare-prompt pulse connection.

1107.3552	pan-starrs1 discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae at z ~ 0.9	we present the discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae (sne) at z ~ 0.9with the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey. these sne, ps1-10ky and ps1-10awh, areamongst the most luminous sne ever discovered, comparable to the unusualtransients sn 2005ap and scp 06f6. like sn 2005ap and scp 06f6, they showcharacteristic high luminosities (m_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a fewbroad absorption lines, and no evidence for h or he. we have constructed a fullmulti-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-seriesspectroscopy for these sne. given the similarities between the sne, we combinetheir light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course ofexplosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10^51 erg. we find photospheric velocities of12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of anoptically-thick massive shell of material. we show that, consistent withfindings for other ultra-luminous sne in this class, radioactive decay is notsufficient to power ps1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for theseevents: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse sn, orsn shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a wolf-rayetstar.

1205.7075	the afterglow and environment of the short grb111117a	we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of the shortgrb111117a, and follow-up observations of its host galaxy. from rapid opticaland radio observations we place limits of r \gtrsim 25.5 mag at \deltat \approx0.55 d and f_nu(5.8 ghz) &lt; 18 \mujy at \deltat \approx 0.50 d, respectively.however, using a chandra observation at t~3.0 d we locate the absolute positionof the x-ray afterglow to an accuracy of 0.22" (1 sigma), a factor of about 6times better than the swift-xrt position. this allows us to robustly identifythe host galaxy and to locate the burst at a projected offset of 1.25 +/- 0.20"from the host centroid. using optical and near-ir observations of the hostgalaxy we determine a photometric redshift of z=1.3 (+0.3,-0.2), one of thehighest for any short grb, and leading to a projected physical offset for theburst of 10.5 +/- 1.7 kpc, typical of previous short grbs. at this redshift,the isotropic gamma-ray energy is e_{gamma,iso} \approx 3\times10^51 erg(rest-frame 23-2300 kev) with a peak energy of e_{pk} \approx 850-2300 kev(rest-frame). in conjunction with the isotropic x-ray energy, grb111117aappears to follow our recently-reported e_x,iso-e_gamma,iso-e_pk universalscaling. using the x-ray data along with the optical and radio non-detectionswe find that for a blastwave kinetic energy of e_{k,iso} \approx e_{gamma,iso},the circumburst density is n_0 \sim 3x10^(-4)-1 cm^-3 (for a range ofepsilon_b=0.001-0.1). similarly, from the non-detection of a break in the x-raylight curve at t&lt;3 d, we infer a minimum opening angle for the outflow oftheta_j&gt; 3-10 degrees (depending on the circumburst density). we conclude thatchandra observations of short grbs are effective at determining precisepositions and robust host galaxy associations in the absence of optical andradio detections.

1207.2152	multi-wavelength observations of supernova 2011ei: time-dependent  classification of type iib and ib supernovae and implications for their  progenitors	we present x-ray, uv/optical, and radio observations of thestripped-envelope, core-collapse supernova (sn) 2011ei, one of the leastluminous sne iib or ib observed to date. our observations begin with adiscovery within 1 day of explosion and span several months afterward. earlyoptical spectra exhibit broad, type ii-like hydrogen balmer profiles thatsubside rapidly and are replaced by type ib-like he-rich features on thetimescale of one week. high-cadence monitoring of this transition suggests thatabsorption attributable to a high velocity (&gt; 12,000 km/s) h-rich shell is notrare in type ib events. radio observations imply a shock velocity of v = 0.13cand a progenitor star mass-loss rate of 1.4 x 10^{-5} msun yr^{-1} (assumingwind velocity v_w=10^3 km/s). this is consistent with independent constraintsfrom deep x-ray observations with swift-xrt and chandra. overall, themulti-wavelength properties of sn 2011ei are consistent with the explosion of alower-mass (3-4 msun), compact (r* &lt;= 1x10^{11} cm), he core star. the starretained a thin hydrogen envelope at the time of explosion, and was embedded inan inhomogeneous circumstellar wind suggestive of modest episodic mass-loss. weconclude that sn 2011ei's rapid spectral metamorphosis is indicative oftime-dependent classifications that bias estimates of explosion rates for typeiib and ib objects, and that important information about a progenitor star'sevolutionary state and mass-loss immediately prior to sn explosion can beinferred from timely multi-wavelength observations.

1209.4654	illuminating the darkest gamma-ray bursts with radio observations	we present x-ray, optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of grbs110709b and 111215a, as well as optical and near-ir observations of their hostgalaxies. the combination of x-ray detections and deep optical/near-infraredlimits establish both bursts as "dark". sub-arcsecond positions enabled byradio detections lead to robust host galaxy associations, with opticaldetections that indicate z &lt; 4 (110709b) and 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.7 (111215a). using theradio and x-ray data for each burst we find that grb 110709b requires a_v &gt; 5.3mag and grb 111215a requires a_v &gt; 8.5 mag (z=2), among the largest extinctionvalues inferred for dark bursts to-date. the two bursts also exhibit largeneutral hydrogen column densities (n_h &gt; 10^22/cm^2; z=2) as inferred fromtheir x-ray spectra, in agreement with the trend for dark grbs. finally, wefind that for both bursts the afterglow emission is best explained by acollimated outflow with a total beaming-corrected energy of e_gamma+e_k ~ 7-9 x10^51 erg (z=2) expanding into a wind medium with a high density (n~100-350cm^-3 at 10^17 cm). while the energy release is typical of long grbs, theinferred density may be indicative of larger mass loss rates for grbprogenitors in dusty (and hence metal rich) environments. this studyestablishes the critical role of radio observations in determining the originand properties of dark grbs. observations with the jvla and alma will provide asample with sub-arcsecond positions and robust host associations that will helpshed light on obscured star formation and the role of metallicity in grbprogenitors.

1212.1173	radio monitoring of the tidal disruption event swift j164449.3+573451.  ii. the relativistic jet shuts off and a transition to forward shock  x-ray/radio emission	we present continued multi-frequency radio observations of the relativistictidal disruption event sw1644+57 extending to dt~600 d. the data were obtainedwith the jvla and ami large array. we combine these data with public swift/xrtand chandra x-ray observations over the same time-frame to show that the jethas undergone a dramatic transition starting at ~500 d, with a sharp decline inthe x-ray flux by about a factor of 170 on a timescale of dt/t&lt;0.2. the rapiddecline rules out a forward shock origin (direct or reprocessing) for the x-rayemission at &lt;500 d, and instead points to internal dissipation in the innerjet. on the other hand, our radio data uniquely demonstrate that the low x-rayflux measured by chandra at ~610 d is consistent with emission from the forwardshock. furthermore, the chandra data are inconsistent with thermal emissionfrom the accretion disk itself since the expected temperature of 30-60 ev andinner radius of 2-10 r_s cannot accommodate the observed flux level or thedetected emission at &gt;1 kev. we associate the rapid decline with a turn off ofthe relativistic jet when the mass accretion rate dropped below mdot_edd~0.006msun/yr (for a 3x10^6 msun black hole and order unity efficiency) indicatingthat the peak accretion rate was about 330 mdot_edd, and the total accretedmass by 500 d is about 0.15 msun. from the radio data we further findsignificant flattening in the integrated energy of the forward shock at &gt;250 dwith e_j,iso~2x10^54 erg (e_j~10^52$ erg for a jet opening angle, theta_j=0.1)following a rise by about a factor of 15 at 30-250 d. projecting forward, wepredict that the emission in the radio and x-ray bands will evolve in tandemwith similar decline rates.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

0712.2828	grb070125: the first long-duration gamma-ray burst in a halo environment	we present the discovery and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observationsof the optical afterglow of the long-duration gamma-ray burst grb070125. unlikeall previously observed long-duration afterglows in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z&lt; 2.0, we find no strong (rest-frame equivalent width w &gt; 1.0 a) absorptionfeatures in the wavelength range 4000 - 10000 a. the sole significant featureis a weak doublet we identify as mg ii 2796 (w = 0.18 +/- 0.02 a), 2803 (w =0.08 +/- 0.01) at z = 1.5477 +/- 0.0001. the low observed mg ii and inferred hi column densities are typically observed in galactic halos, far away from thebulk of massive star formation. deep ground-based imaging reveals no hostdirectly underneath the afterglow to a limit of r &gt; 25.4 mag. either of the twonearest blue galaxies could host grb070125; the large offset (d &gt;= 27 kpc)would naturally explain the low column density. to remain consistent with thelarge local (i.e. parsec scale) circum-burst density inferred from broadbandafterglow observations, we speculate grb070125 may have occurred far away fromthe disk of its host in a compact star-forming cluster. such distant stellarclusters, typically formed by dynamical galaxy interactions, have been observedin the nearby universe, and should be more prevalent at z&gt;1 where galaxymergers occur more frequently.

0712.3290	swift and chandra detections of supernova 2006jc: evidence for  interaction of the supernova shock with a circumstellar shell	the peculiar type ib supernova (sn) 2006jc has been observed with theuv/optical telescope (uvot) and x-ray telescope (xrt) on board the swiftobservatory over a period of 19 to 183 days after the explosion. signatures ofinteraction of the outgoing sn shock with dense circumstellar material (csm)are detected, such as strong x-ray emission (l_{0.2-10} &gt; e39 erg/s) and thepresence of mgii 2800a line emission visible in the uv spectra. in combinationwith a chandra observation obtained on day 40 after the explosion, the x-raylight curve is constructed, which shows a unique rise of the x-ray emission bya factor of ~5 over a period of ~4 months, followed by a rapid decline. weinterpret the unique x-ray and uv properties as a result of the sn shockinteracting with a shell of material that was deposited by an outburst of thesn progenitor two years prior to the explosion. our results are consistent withthe explosion of a wolf-rayet star that underwent an episodic mass ejectionqualitatively similar to those of luminous blue variable stars prior to itsexplosion. this led to the formation of a dense (&gt;e7 cm**-3) shell at adistance of ~e16 cm from the site of the explosion, which expands with the wrwind at a velocity of (1300+/-300) km/s.

1303.1531	ps1-10bzj: a fast, hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova in a metal poor  host galaxy	we present observations and analysis of ps1-10bzj, a superluminous supernova(slsn) discovered in the pan-starrs medium deep survey at a redshift z = 0.650.spectroscopically, ps1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor slsne 2005ap andscp 06f6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (m_bol = -21.4mag) than previous events. we construct a bolometric light curve, and show thatwhile ps1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, itsluminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. weexplore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario andfind that either can fit the data. ps1-10bzj is located in the extended chandradeep field south and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys,including with the hubble space telescope. the host is a compact dwarf galaxy(m_b ~ -18 mag, diameter &lt; 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (m_* ~ 2.4 * 10^7m_sun), young stellar population (\tau_* ~ 5 myr), and a star formation rate of~ 2-3 m_sun/yr. the specific star formation rate is the highest seen in a slsnhost so far (~ 100 gyr^{-1}). we detect the [o iii]\lambda 4363 line, and finda low metallicity: 12+(o/h) = 7.8 +/- 0.2 (~ 0.1 z_sun). together, thisindicates that at least some of the progenitors of slsne come from young,low-metallicity populations.

1303.1818	ps1-12sk is a peculiar supernova from a he-rich progenitor system in a  brightest cluster galaxy environment	we report on our discovery and observations of the pan-starrs1 supernova (sn)ps1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation inits host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system modelsfor this class of explosion. the optical spectra of ps1-12sk classify it as atype ibn sn (c.f. sn 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) andtime variable he i emission. our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes therise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an nuv-nir sed with temperature &gt; 17x10^3 kand a peak rise magnitude of mz = -18.9 mag. sn ibn spectroscopic propertiesare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 m_sun)explosion within a he-enriched circumstellar medium. however, unlike previoustype ibn supernovae, ps1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightestcluster galaxy, cgcg 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster rxc j0844.9+4258. theexpected probability of an event like ps1-12sk in such environments is lowgiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse sne in red sequence galaxiescompounded by the low volumetric rate of sn ibn. furthermore, we find noevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (sigmahalpha &lt; 2x10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2). we therefore discuss white dwarf binarysystems as a possible progenitor channel for sne ibn. we conclude that ps1-12skrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidencefor a top-heavy imf in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first cluesuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for type ibn sne.

1305.2453	a reverse shock in grb 130427a	we present extensive radio and millimeter observations of the unusuallybright grb 130427a at z=0.340, spanning 0.67 to 12 days after the burst. takenin conjunction with detailed multi-band uv, optical, nir, and x-rayobservations we find that the broad-band afterglow emission is composed ofdistinct reverse shock and forward shock contributions. the reverse shockemission dominates in the radio/millimeter and at &lt;0.1 days in theuv/optical/nir, while the forward shock emission dominates in the x-rays and at&gt;0.1 days in the uv/optical/nir. we further find that the optical and x-raydata require a wind circumburst environment, pointing to a massive starprogenitor. using the combined forward and reverse shock emission we find thatthe parameters of the burst are an isotropic kinetic energy of e_kiso~2e53 erg,a mass loss rate of mdot~3e-8 msun/yr (for a wind velocity of 1,000 km/s), anda lorentz factor at the deceleration time of gamma(200s)~130. due to the lowdensity and large isotropic energy, the absence of a jet break to ~15 daysplaces only a weak constraint on the opening angle of theta_j&gt;2.5 deg, andtherefore a total energy of e_gamma+e_k&gt;1.2e51 erg, similar to other grbs. thereverse shock emission is detectable in this burst due to the low circumburstdensity, which leads to a slow cooling shock. we speculate that this is arequired property for the detectability of reverse shocks in the radio andmillimeter bands. following on grb 130427a as a benchmark event, observationsof future grbs with the exquisite sensitivity of vla and alma, coupled withdetailed modeling of the reverse and forward shock contributions will test thishypothesis.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1306.2337	the fast and furious decay of the peculiar type ic supernova 2005ek	we present extensive multi-wavelength observations of the extremely rapidlydeclining type ic supernova, sn 2005ek. reaching a peak magnitude of m_r =-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, sn 2005ek isamong the fastest type i supernovae observed to date. the spectra of sn 2005ekclosely resemble those of normal sn ic, but with an accelerated evolution.there is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine dayspost-maximum. spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 msun thatis dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve isconsistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 msun of radioactive ni-56.although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., sn 1885a, sn 1939b, sn 2002bj,sn 2010x) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shellon a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with thisproposed mechanism. we find that the properties of sn 2005ek are consistentwith either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or theiron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. however,if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of sn 2005ek to other snic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarfprogenitor becomes very improbable. sn 2005ek may be one of the lowest massstripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. we find that the rateof such rapidly declining type i events is at least 1-3% of the normal sn iarate.

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.7171	radio limits on off-axis grb afterglows and vlbi observations of sn  2003gk	we report on a vla survey for late-time radio emission from 59 supernovae(sne) of type i b/c, which have been associated with long-duration gamma-raybursts (grbs). an "off-axis" grb burst (i.e. whose relativistic jet points awayfrom us) is expected to have late-time radio emission even in the absence ofsignificant prompt gamma-ray emission. from our sample, we detected only sn2003gk with an 8.4-ghz flux density of $2260 \pm 130 \,\mu$jy. our subsequentvlbi observations of sn 2003gk, at an age of $\sim$8 yr, allowed us todetermine its radius to be $(2.4 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{17}$ cm, or $94 \pm 15$light days. this radius rules out relativistic expansion as expected for anoff-axis grb jet, and instead suggests an expansion speed of $\sim 10\:000$ kms$^{-1}$ typical for non-relativistic core-collapse supernovae. we attributethe late-onset radio emission to interaction of the ejecta with a dense shellcaused by episodic mass-loss from the progenitor.  in addition, we present new calculations for the expected radio lightcurvesfrom grb jets at various angles to the line of sight, and compare these to ourobserved limits on the flux densities of the remainder of our sn sample. fromthis comparison we can say that only a fraction of broadlined type i b/c snehave a radio-bright jet similar to those seen for grb afterglows atcosmological distances. however, we also find that for a reasonable range ofparameters, as might be representative of the actual population of grb eventsrather than the detected bright ones, the radio emission from the grb jets canbe quite faint, and that at present, radio observations do not place strongconstraints on off-axis grb jets.

1311.0026	hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts have similar host galaxies	we present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-ir photometry of 31 hostgalaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including 15 eventsfrom the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey. our sample spans the redshift range0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specificsubclass of cosmic explosions. combining the multi-band photometry andemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, starformation rates and metallicities. we find that as a whole, the hosts of slsneare a low-luminosity (&lt;m_b&gt; ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (&lt;m_*&gt; ~ 2 x 10^8m_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (&lt;ssfr&gt; ~ 2gyr^-1). the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +log(o/h}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solarmetallicity. the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are statistically distinct fromthe hosts of goods core-collapse sne (which cover a similar redshift range),but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) interms of stellar mass, sfr, ssfr and metallicity. this result indicates thatthe environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbsare similar, and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in lowmetallicity environments. we speculate that the key ingredient is large coreangular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in slsne and anaccreting black hole in lgrbs.

1311.3645	multi-epoch high-spectral-resolution observations of neutral sodium in  14 type ia supernovae	one of the main questions concerning type ia supernovae is the nature of thebinary companion of the exploding white dwarf. a major discriminant betweendifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties ofcircumstellar material at the time of explosion. if present, this material willbe ionized by the ultra-violet radiation of the explosion and later recombine.this ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variableabsorption features that can be detected via multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution observations. previous studies have shown that thestrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium d lines. we report onobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epochhigh-resolution spectra of 14 type ia supernova events. this is the firstmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple sne. no variability inline strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.we find that ~18% of the events in the extended sample exhibit time-variablesodium features associated with circumstellar material. we explore theimplication of this study on our understanding of the progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae via the current type ia supernova multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution sample.

1401.2991	interaction between the broad-lined type ic supernova 2012ap and  carriers of diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are absorption features observed inoptical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated withcarbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. however, because thecentral wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronictransitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remaineduncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. here we report onunusually strong dibs in optical spectra of the broad-lined type ic supernovasn 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)timescales. the 4428 and 6283 angstrom dib features get weaker with time,whereas the 5780 angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. these nonuniformchanges suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of thedibs and that the dib carriers possess high ionization potentials, such assmall cations or charged fullerenes. we conclude that moderate-resolutionspectra of supernovae with dib absorptions obtained within weeks of outburstcould reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of theirprogenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of dibcarriers.

1402.6344	relativistic supernovae have shorter-lived central engines or more  extended progenitors: the case of sn\,2012ap	deep late-time x-ray observations of the relativistic, engine-driven, type icsn2012ap allow us to probe the nearby environment of the explosion and revealthe unique properties of relativistic sne. we find that on a local scale of~0.01 pc the environment was shaped directly by the evolution of the progenitorstar with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate &lt;5x10^-6 msun yr-1 in line with grbsand the other relativistic sn2009bb. like sub-energetic grbs, sn2012ap ischaracterized by a bright radio emission and evidence for mildly relativisticejecta. however, its late time (t~20 days) x-ray emission is ~100 times fainterthan the faintest sub-energetic grb at the same epoch, with no evidence forlate-time central engine activity. these results support theoretical proposalsthat link relativistic sne like 2009bb and 2012ap with the weakest observedengine-driven explosions, where the jet barely fails to breakout. furthermore,our observations demonstrate that the difference between relativistic sne andsub-energetic grbs is intrinsic and not due to line-of-sight effects. thisphenomenology can either be due to an intrinsically shorter-lived engine or toa more extended progenitor in relativistic sne.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1408.1606	the broad-lined type ic sn 2012ap and the nature of relativistic  supernovae lacking a gamma-ray burst detection	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations of sn 2012ap,a broad-lined type ic supernova in the galaxy ngc 1729 that produced arelativistic and rapidly decelerating outflow without a gamma-ray burstsignature. photometry and spectroscopy follow the flux evolution from -13 to+272 days past the b-band maximum of -17.4 +/- 0.5 mag. the spectra aredominated by fe ii, o i, and ca ii absorption lines at ejecta velocities of20,000 km/s that change slowly over time. other spectral absorption lines areconsistent with contributions from photospheric he i, and hydrogen may also bepresent at higher velocities (&gt; 27,000 km/s). we use these observations toestimate explosion properties and derive a total ejecta mass of 2.7 msolar, akinetic energy of 1.0x10^{52} erg, and a 56ni mass of 0.1-0.2 msolar. nebularspectra (t &gt; 200d) exhibit an asymmetric double-peaked [oi] 6300,6364 emissionprofile that we associate with absorption in the supernova interior, althoughtoroidal ejecta geometry is an alternative explanation. sn 2012ap joins sn2009bb as another exceptional supernova that shows evidence for a centralengine (e.g., black-hole accretion or magnetar) capable of launching anon-negligible portion of ejecta to relativistic velocities without acoincident gamma-ray burst detection. defining attributes of their progenitorsystems may be related to notable properties including above-averageenvironmental metallicities of z &gt; zsolar, moderate to high levels ofhost-galaxy extinction (e(b-v) &gt; 0.4 mag), detection of high-velocity helium atearly epochs, and a high relative flux ratio of [ca ii]/[o i] &gt; 1 at nebularepochs. these events support the notion that jet activity at various energyscales may be present in a wide range of supernovae.

1410.7387	dust in the wind: the role of recent mass loss in long gamma-ray bursts	we study the late-time (t&gt;0.5 days) x-ray afterglows of nearby (z&lt;0.5) longgamma-ray bursts (grb) with swift and identify a population of explosions withslowly decaying, super-soft (photon index gamma_x&gt;3) x-ray emission that isinconsistent with forward shock synchrotron radiation associated with theafterglow. these explosions also show larger-than-average intrinsic absorption(nh_x,i &gt;6d21 cm-2) and prompt gamma-ray emission with extremely long duration(t_90&gt;1000 s). chance association of these three rare properties (i.e. largenh_x,i, super-soft gamma_x and extreme duration) in the same class ofexplosions is statistically unlikely. we associate these properties with theturbulent mass-loss history of the progenitor star that enriched and shaped thecircum-burst medium. we identify a natural connection between nh_x,i gamma_xand t_90 in these sources by suggesting that the late-time super-soft x-raysoriginate from radiation reprocessed by material lost to the environment by thestellar progenitor before exploding, (either in the form of a dust echo or asreprocessed radiation from a long-lived grb remnant), and that the interactionof the explosion's shock/jet with the complex medium is the source of theextremely long prompt emission. however, current observations do not allow usto exclude the possibility that super-soft x-ray emitters originate frompeculiar stellar progenitors with large radii that only form in very dustyenvironments.

1411.1060	zooming in on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae with the hst	we present hubble space telescope (hst) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of thehost galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including11 events from the pan-starrs medium deep survey. taking advantage of thesuperb angular resolution of hst, we characterize the galaxies' morphologicalproperties, sizes and star formation rate (sfr) densities. we determine thesupernova (sn) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometricmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the snpositions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness. wefind that the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are irregular, compact dwarfgalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. the uv-derived sfrdensities are high (&lt;sigma_sfr&gt; ~ 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that slsneform in overdense environments. their locations trace the uv light of theirhost galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regionsof their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normalcore-collapse sne), though cannot be statistically distinguished from eitherwith the current sample size. taken together, this strengthens the picture thatslsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinarycore-collapse sne to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies asdo lgrbs. if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightestregions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate adifferent, potentially lower-mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs.

1502.06964	galex detection of shock breakout in type ii-p supernova ps1-13arp:  implications for the progenitor star wind	we present the galex detection of a uv burst at the time of explosion of anoptically normal type ii-p supernova (ps1-13arp) from the pan-starrs1 survey atz=0.1665. the temperature and luminosity of the uv burst match the theoreticalpredictions for shock breakout in a red supergiant, but with a duration afactor of ~50 longer than expected. we compare the $nuv$ light curve ofps1-13arp to previous galex detections of type iip sne, and find cleardistinctions that indicate that the uv emission is powered by shock breakout,and not by the subsequent cooling envelope emission previously detected inthese systems. we interpret the ~ 1 d duration of the uv signal with a shockbreakout in the wind of a red supergiant with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate of~ 10^-3 msun yr^-1. this mass-loss rate is enough to prolong the duration ofthe shock breakout signal, but not enough to produce an excess in the opticalplateau light curve or narrow emission lines powered by circumstellarinteraction. this detection of non-standard, potentially episodic highmass-loss in a rsg sn progenitor has favorable consequences for the prospectsof future wide-field uv surveys to detect shock breakout directly in thesesystems, and provide a sensitive probe of the pre-explosion conditions of snprogenitors.

astro-ph;0210524	flaring up: radio diagnostics of the kinematic, hydrodynamic and  environmental properties of grbs	the specific incidence of radio flares appears to be significantly largerthan that of the prompt optical emission. this abundance, coupled with thereverse shock interpretation suggests that radio flares add a unique probe onthe physics of grb shocks. motivated thus, we estimate the strength of thereverse shock expected for bursts in which multi-wavelength observations haveallowed the physical parameters of the forward shock to be determined. we useall 6 bursts (980519, 990123, 990510, 991208, 991216, 000418) which are foundto be adiabatic and thus predicted to have a strong reverse shock. we aim toconstrain the hydrodynamic evolution of the reverse shock and the initial bulklorentz factor -- which we found to be between $10^{2}$ and $10^{3}$ and wellabove the lower limits derived from the requirement that gamma-ray bursts beoptically thin to high-energy photons. in half of the cases we improve thedescription of the early afterglow lightcurves by adding a contribution fromthe reverse shock. modelling of this early emission provides the opportunity toinvestigate the immediate surroundings of the burst. for 991216 and 991208, theexpected $1/r^2$ density structure for a stellar wind is not compatible withthe early afterglow lightcurves. considering the radial range relevant to thesegrbs, we discuss the conditions under which the inclusion of a wind terminationshock may resolve the absence of a $1/r^2$ density profile.

astro-ph;0301634	a radio flare from grb 020405: evidence for a uniform medium around a  massive stellar progenitor	we present radio observations of grb 020405 starting 1.2 days after theburst, which reveal a rapidly-fading ``radio flare''. based on its temporal andspectral properties, we interpret the radio flare as emission from the reverseshock. this scenario rules out a circumburst medium with a radial densityprofile \rho ~ r^{-2} expected around a mass-losing massive star, since in thatcase the reverse shock emission decays on the timescale of the burst durationt~100 s. using published optical and x-ray data, along with the radio datapresented here, we further show that a self-consistent model requirescollimated ejecta with an opening angle of 6 degrees (t_j~0.95 days). as aconsequence of the early jet break, the late-time (t&gt;10 days) emission measuredwith the hubble space telescope significantly deviates from an extrapolation ofthe early, ground-based data. this, along with an unusually red spectrum, f_\nu\~ \nu^{-3.9}, strengthens the case for a supernova that exploded at about thesame time as grb 020405, thus pointing to a massive stellar progenitor for thisburst. this is the first clear association of a massive progenitor with auniform medium, indicating that a \rho ~ r^{-2} profile is not a requiredsignature, and in fact may not be present on the lengthscales probed by theafterglow in the majority of bursts.

astro-ph;0307228	a radio survey of type ib and ic supernovae: searching for engine driven  supernovae	the association of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and core-collapse supernovae (sne)of type ib and ic was motivated by the detection of sn 1998bw in the error boxof grb 980425 and the now-secure identification of a sn 1998bw-like event inthe cosmological grb 030329. the bright radio emission from sn 1998bw indicatedthat it possessed some of the unique attributes expected of grbs, namely alarge reservoir of energy in (mildly) relativistic ejecta and variable energyinput. the two popular scenarios for the origin of sn 1998bw are a typicalcosmological burst observed off-axis or a member of a new distinct class ofsupernova explosions (gsne). in the former, about 0.5% of local type ib/c sneare expected to be similar to sn1998bw; for the latter no such constraintexists. motivated thus, we began a systematic program of radio observations ofmost reported type ib/c sne accessible to the very large array. of the 33 sneobserved from late 1999 to the end of 2002 at most one is as bright as sn1998bw. from this we conclude that the incidence of such events is &lt;3%.furthermore, analysis of the radio emission indicates that none of the observedsne exhibit clear engine signatures. finally, a comparison of the sn radioemission to that of grb afterglows indicates that none of the sne could haveresulted from a typical grb, independent of the initial jet orientation. thus,while the nature of sn 1998bw remains an open question, there appears to be aclear dichotomy between the majority of hydrodynamic and engine-drivenexplosions.

astro-ph;0402163	constraints on off-axis grb jets in type ibc supernovae from late-time  radio observations	it has been suggested that the peculiar properties of the luminous type icsupernova sn 1998bw and its low-energy gamma-ray burst grb 980425 may beunderstood if they originated in a standard gamma-ray burst explosion viewedfar from the axis of the relativistic jet. in this scenario, strong radioemission is predicted from the jet on a timescale 1 to 10 years after theexplosion as it decelerates and spreads into our line of sight. to test thishypothesis we have carried out late-time radio observations of sn 1998bw at$t=5.6$ years, yielding upper limits which are consistent with the continuedfading of the supernova. we find these limits to be consistent with an off-axisjet only if the progenitor mass loss rate is $\dot{m}\lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ (for a wind velocity $v_w=1000$ km s$^{-1}$) or thefraction of the shock energy in magnetic fields is $\epsilon_b \lesssim10^{-3}$. these values are low relative to those inferred for cosmologicalgrbs. we combine the sn 1998bw measurements with existing observations for asample of 15 local type ibc supernovae to estimate that at most 6% producecollimated, relativistic outflows.

astro-ph;0408096	the sub-energetic grb 031203 as a cosmic analogue to grb 980425	over the six years since the discovery of the gamma-ray burst grb 980425,associated with the nearby (distance, ~40 mpc) supernova 1998bw, astronomershave fiercely debated the nature of this event. relative to bursts located atcosmological distances, (redshift, z~1), grb 980425 was under-luminous ingamma-rays by three orders of magnitude. radio calorimetry showed the explosionwas sub-energetic by a factor of 10. here, we report observations of the radioand x-ray afterglow of the recent z=0.105 grb 031203 and demonstrate that ittoo is sub-energetic. our result, when taken together with the low gamma-rayluminosity, suggest that grb 031203 is the first cosmic analogue to grb 980425.we find no evidence that this event was a highly collimated explosion viewedoff-axis. like grb 980425, grb 031203 appears to be an intrinsicallysub-energetic gamma-ray burst. such sub-energetic events have faint afterglows.intensive follow-up of faint bursts with smooth gamma-ray light curves (commonto both grbs 031203 and 980425) may enable us to reveal their expected largepopulation.

astro-ph;0410038	the caltech core-collapse project (cccp)	the cosmological utility of type ia supernovae (sne) prompted numerousstudies of these events, and they are now well characterized observationally,both as individual objects and as a population. in contrast, all other types ofsne (i.e., core-collapse events) are not as well observationally characterized.while some individual events have been studied in great detail (e.g., sn 1987aor sn 1998bw), the global properties of the core-collapse sn population arelittle known. however, in recent years, major drivers for change have emerged,among them the verification of the connection between core-collapse sne andlong-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), the possible utility of somecore-collapse sne (type ii-p) as independent cosmological probes, and studiesof core-collapse sne as high redshift targets for missions like snap and jwst.the caltech core-collapse project (cccp) is a large observational program usingthe hale 200'' and the robotic 60'' telescopes at palomar observatory to obtainoptical photometry, spectroscopy and ir photometry of ~50 nearby core-collapsesne. the program is designed to provide a complete sample of core-collapseevents, with well-defined selection criteria and uniform, high-qualityoptical/ir observations, as well as radio and x-ray light curves for someevents. we will use this sample to characterize the little-studied propertiesof core-collapse sne as a population. the sample will be used as a comparisonset for studies of sne associated with gamma-ray bursts, to promote andcalibrate the use of sne ii-p for cosmography, and to set the stage forinvestigations of sne at high-z using coming space missions such as snap andjwst.

astro-ph;0410163	the radio and x-ray luminous type ibc supernova 2003l	we present extensive radio observations of sn 2003l, the most luminous andenergetic type ibc radio supernova with the exception of sn 1998bw (associatedwith grb 980425). observations from the very large array are well described bya fitting a synchrotron self-absorption model to the emission spectrum. thismodel implies a sub-relativistic ejecta velocity, v ~ 0.2c, and a size of r ~4.3 x 10^{15} cm at t ~ 10 days. the circumstellar density is suitably fit witha stellar wind profile, n_e ~ r^{-2} and a constant mass loss rate of m_dot ~7.5 x 10^{-6} m_{solar}/year. moreover, the magnetic field follows b ~ r^{-1}and the kinetic energy of the radio bright ejecta is roughly e ~ 10^{48} ergassuming equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magneticfields. furthermore, we show that free-free absorption does not contributesignificantly to the radio spectrum, since it implies ejecta velocities whichare inconsistent with size constraints derived from very long baseline arrayobservations. in conclusion, we find that although sn 2003l has a radioluminosity comparable to that seen in sn 1998bw, it shows no evidence for asignificant amount of energy coupled to relativistic ejecta. using sn 2003l asan example, we comment briefly on the coupling of ejecta velocity and energy intype ibc supernovae.

astro-ph;0502468	the discovery of the optical and near-ir afterglows of the first swift  gamma-ray bursts	we present optical and near-infrared searches for afterglow emission from thefirst four swift bursts with accurate positions from the x-ray telescope (xrt).using telescopes at las campanas, keck, and palomar observatories we rapidlyidentified and followed up afterglows for three of the four bursts. the burstpositions were also observed with the very large array, but no radio afterglowemission was detected. the optical/nir afterglows are fainter than about 75% ofall afterglows detected to date, with grb 050126 being the faintest, and wereidentified thanks to accurate and rapid positions from the xrt and rapidresponse with &gt;1-m telescopes. this suggests that the fraction of dust-obscuredbursts is small, &lt;10% when combined with afterglows localized by the hete-2soft x-ray camera. the x-ray fluxes are typical of the known population, withthe exception of grb 050126 which has the faintest x-ray afterglow to date(normalized to t=10 hr), and was detected thanks to a response time of only 130s after the burst. finally, we find that all three optical/nir afterglows arelocated &lt;2 arcsec away from the nominal xrt positions, suggesting that the xrtis capable of delivering highly accurate positions, which will revolutionizeafterglow studies.

astro-ph;0505107	the afterglows, redshifts, and properties of swift gamma-ray bursts	we present optical, near-ir, and radio follow up of sixteen swift bursts,including our discovery of nine afterglows and a redshift determination forthree. these observations, supplemented by data from the literature, provide anafterglow recovery rate of 60% in the optical/near-ir, much higher than inprevious missions (bepposax, hete-2, integral, and ipn). the optical/near-irafterglows of swift events are on average 1.7 mag fainter at t=12 hr than thoseof previous missions. the x-ray afterglows are similarly fainter compared tothose of pre-swift bursts. in the radio the limiting factor is the vlathreshold and the detection rate for swift bursts is similar to that for pastmissions. the redshift distribution of pre-swift bursts peaked at z~1, whereasthe five swift bursts with measured redshifts are distributed evenly between1.3 and 3.2. from these results we conclude that (i) the pre-swiftdistributions were biased in favor of bright events and low redshift events,(ii) the higher sensitivity and accurate positions of swift result in a betterrepresentation of the true burst redshift and brightness distributions (whichare higher and dimmer, respectively), and (iii) as many as 1/3 of the burstscan be optically dark, as a result of a high redshift and/or dust extinction.we remark that the apparent lack of low redshift, low luminosity swift bursts,and the lower event rate compared to pre-launch estimates (90 vs. 150 peryear), are the result of a threshold that is similar to that of batse. in viewof these inferences, afterglow observers may find it advisable to makesignificant changes in follow up strategies of swift events.

astro-ph;0506472	a high angular-resolution search for the progenitor of the type ic  supernova 2004gt	we report the results of a high-spatial-resoltion search for the progenitorof type ic supernova sn 2004gt, using the newly commissioned keck laser-guidestar adaptive optics system (lgsao) along with archival hubble space telescopedata. this is the deepest search yet performed for the progenitor of any typeib/c event in a wide wavelength range stretching from the far uv to the nearir. we determine that the progenitor of sn 2004gt was most likely less luminousthan m_v=-5.5 and m_b=-6.5 magnitudes. the massive stars exploding ashydrogen-deficient core-collapse supernovae (sne) should have lost their outerhydrogen envelopes prior to their explosion, either through winds -- such starsare identified within our galaxy as wolf-rayet (w-r) stars -- or to a binarycompanion. the luminosity limits we set rule out more than half of the knowngalactic w-r stars as possible progenitors of this event. in particular, theyimply that a w-r progenitor should have been among the more-evolved (highlystripped, less luminous) of these stars, a concrete constraint on itsevolutionary state just prior to core collapse. the possibility of a lessluminous, lower-mass binary progenitor cannot be constrained. this studydemonstrates the power of lgs observations in furthering our understanding ofcore collapse, and the physics powering supernovae, grbs and xrfs.

astro-ph;0507147	late-time radio observations of 68 type ibc supernovae: strong  constraints on off-axis gamma-ray bursts	we present late-time radio observations of 68 local type ibc supernovae,including six events with broad optical absorption lines (``hypernovae''). noneof these objects exhibit radio emission attributable to off-axis gamma-rayburst jets spreading into our line-of-sight. comparison with our afterglowmodels reveals the following conclusions: (1) less than $\sim 10%$ of type ibcsupernovae are associated with typical gamma-ray bursts initially directed awayfrom our line-of-sight; this places an empirical constraint on the grb beamingfactor of $&lt;f_b^{-1}&gt; \lesssim 10^4$ corresponding to an average jet openingangle, $\theta_j \gtrsim 0.8$ degrees. (2) this holds in particular for thebroad-lined supernovae (sne 1997dq, 1997ef, 1998ey, 2002ap, 2002bl and 2003jd)which have been argued to host grb jets. our observations reveal no evidencefor typical (or even sub-energetic) grbs and rule out the scenario in whichevery broad-lined sn harbors a grb at the 84% confidence level. their largephotospheric velocities and asymmetric ejecta (inferred from spectropolarimetryand nebular spectroscopy) appear to be characteristic of the non-relativisticsupernova explosion and do not necessarily imply the existence of associatedgrb jets.

astro-ph;0508115	the afterglow and elliptical host galaxy of the short gamma-ray burst  grb 050724	despite a rich phenomenology, gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are divided into twoclasses based on their duration and spectral hardness -- the long-soft and theshort-hard bursts. the discovery of afterglow emission from long grbs was awatershed event, pinpointing their origin to star forming galaxies, and hencethe death of massive stars, and indicating an energy release of about 10^51erg. while theoretical arguments suggest that short grbs are produced in thecoalescence of binary compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), theprogenitors, energetics, and environments of these events remain elusivedespite recent localizations. here we report the discovery of the first radioafterglow from a short burst, grb 050724, which unambiguously associates itwith an elliptical galaxy at a redshift, z=0.257. we show that the burst ispowered by the same relativistic fireball mechanism as long grbs, with theejecta possibly collimated in jets, but that the total energy release is10-1000 times smaller. more importantly, the nature of the host galaxydemonstrates that short grbs arise from an old (&gt;1 gyr) stellar population,strengthening earlier suggestions, and providing support for coalescing compactobject binaries as the progenitors.

astro-ph;0509891	the progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts from an extended sample  of events	the detection of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hardgamma-ray bursts (shbs) is one of the most exciting recent astronomicaldiscoveries. indications that shb progenitors belong to old stellarpopulations, in contrast to those of the long-soft grbs, provide a strong clueabout their physical nature. definitive conclusions however are limited by thesmall number of shbs with known hosts. here, we present our investigation ofshbs previously localized by the interplanetary network (ipn) using new andarchival optical and x-ray observations. we show that we can likely identifythe host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasingthe sample of shbs with known hosts and/or distances. in particular, wedetermine that the bright shb 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy clusterabell 1892, making it probably the nearest shb currently known. we show thatthe brightest galaxy within the error box of shb 000607, at z=0.14, is mostlikely the host galaxy of this event. additionally, we rule out the existenceof galaxy overdensities (down to ~21mag) near the locations of two other shbs,and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. we combine our shb samplewith events discovered recently by the swift and hete-2 missions, andinvestigate the properties of the extended sample. comparison to sne ia showsthat the progenitors of shbs are typically older, implying a typical life timeof several gy. we also show that it is unlikely that there is a significantpopulation of progenitors with life time shorter than 1gy. this resultdisfavors the popular model of ns-ns mergers as the progenitors of shbs.

astro-ph;0601455	the afterglow, energetics and host galaxy of the short-hard gamma-ray  burst 051221a	we present detailed optical, x-ray and radio observations of the brightafterglow of the short gamma-ray burst 051221a obtained with gemini, swift/xrt,and the very large array, as well as optical spectra from which we measure theredshift of the burst, z=0.5464. at this redshift the isotropic-equivalentprompt energy release was about 1.5 x 10^51 erg, and using the standardafterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy issimilar, e_k,iso ~ 8.4 x 10^51 erg. an observed jet break at t ~ 5 daysindicates that the opening angle is ~ 7 degrees and the total beaming-correctedenergy is therefore ~ 2.5 x 10^49 erg, comparable to the values inferred forprevious short grbs. we further show that the burst experienced an episode ofenergy injection by a factor of 3.4 between t=1.4 and 3.4 hours, which wasaccompanied by reverse shock emission in the radio band. this result providescontinued evidence that the central engines of short grbs may be activesignificantly longer than the duration of the burst and/or produce a wide rangeof lorentz factors. finally, we show that the host galaxy of grb051221a isactively forming stars at a rate of about 1.6 m_solar/yr, but at the same timeexhibits evidence for an appreciable population of old stars (~ 1 gyr) and nearsolar metallicity. the lack of bright supernova emission and the lowcircumburst density (n ~ 10^-3 cm^-3) continue to support the idea that shortbursts are not related to the death of massive stars and are instead consistentwith a compact object merger. given that the total energy release is a factorof ~ 10 larger than the predicted yield for a neutrino annihilation mechanism,this suggests that magnetohydrodynamic processes may be required to power theburst.

astro-ph;0604389	relativistic ejecta from xrf 060218 and the rate of cosmic explosions	over the last decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) including thesubclass of x-ray flashes (xrfs) have been revealed to be a rare variety oftype ibc supernova (sn). while all these events result from the death ofmassive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of grbs and xrfs exceed thoseof ordinary type ibc sne by many orders of magnitude. the essential physicalprocess that causes a dying star to produce a grb or xrf, and not just an sn,remains the crucial open question. here we present radio and x-ray observationsof xrf 060218 (associated with sn 2006aj), the second nearest grb identifiedto-date, which allow us to measure its total energy and place it in the largercontext of cosmic explosions. we show that this event is 100 times lessenergetic but ten times more common than cosmological grbs. moreover, it isdistinguished from ordinary type ibc sne by the presence of 10^48 erg coupledto mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed,rapidly rotating compact source) which produces x-rays for weeks after theexplosion. this suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the keyphysical distinction between grbs/xrfs and ordinary sne, while the nature ofthe central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts fromlow-luminosity, spherical events like xrf 060218.

astro-ph;0604580	an energetic afterglow from a distant stellar explosion	we present the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the high redshift(z=6.295) burst grb 050904. the peak flux density for this burst is similar totypical low-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grb). we further show that beyond aredshift of order unity, the flux density of radio afterglows are largelyinsensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. by combining the existingx-ray, near-infrared and radio measurements, we derive estimates for thekinetic energy and opening angle of the blast wave, and for the density of thecircumburst medium into which it expands. both the kinetic and radiated energyindicate that grb 050904 was an unusally energetic burst (10**52 erg). moreimportantly, we are able to make an in situ measurement of the densitystructure of the circumburst medium. we conclude that grb 050904 exploded intoa constant density medium with n=680 cm**-3, which is two orders of magnitudeabove the nominal value for low-redshift grbs. the next generation ofcentimeter (evla) and millimeter radio instuments (alma) will be able toroutinely detect events like grb 050904 and use them to study magnetic fields,and the atomic and molecular gas in the high redshift universe.

astro-ph;0611128	a new population of high redshift short-duration gamma-ray bursts	the redshift distribution of the short-duration grbs is a crucial, butcurrently fragmentary, clue to the nature of their progenitors. here we presentoptical observations of nine short grbs obtained with gemini, magellan, and thehubble space telescope. we detect the afterglows and host galaxies of two shortbursts, and host galaxies for two additional bursts with known opticalafterglow positions, and five with x-ray positions (&lt;6'' radius). in eight ofthe nine cases we find that the most probable host galaxies are faint,r~23-26.5 mag, and are therefore starkly different from the first few short grbhosts with r~17-22 mag and z&lt;0.5. indeed, we measure spectroscopic redshifts ofz~0.4-1.1 for the four brightest hosts. a comparison to large field galaxysamples, as well as the hosts of long grbs and previous short grbs, indicatesthat the fainter hosts likely reside at z&gt;1. our most conservative limit isthat at least half of the five hosts without a known redshift reside at z&gt;0.7(97% confidence level), suggesting that about 1/3-2/3 of all short grbsoriginate at higher redshifts than previously determined. this has twoimportant implications: (i) we constrain the acceptable age distributions to awide lognormal (sigma&gt;1) with tau~4-8 gyr, or to a power law, p(tau)~tau^n,with -1&lt;n&lt;0; and (ii) the inferred isotropic energies,e_{gamma,iso}~10^50-10^52 erg, are significantly larger than ~10^48-10^49 ergfor the low redshift short grbs, indicating a large spread in energy release orjet opening angles. finally, we re-iterate the importance of short grbs aspotential gravitational wave sources and find a conservative advanced ligodetection rate of ~2-6 yr^-1.

astro-ph;0611919	preliminary results from the caltech core-collapse project (cccp)	we present preliminary results from the caltech core-collapse project (cccp),a large observational program focused on the study of core-collapse sne.uniform, high-quality nir and optical photometry and multi-epoch opticalspectroscopy have been obtained using the 200'' hale and robotic 60''telescopes at palomar, for a sample of 50 nearby core-collapse sne. thecombination of both well-sampled optical light curves and multi-epochspectroscopy will enable spectroscopically and photometrically based subtypedefinitions to be disentangled from each other. multi-epoch spectroscopy iscrucial to identify transition events that evolve among subtypes with time. thecccp sn sample includes every core-collapse sn discovered between july 2004 andseptember 2005 that was visible from palomar, found shortly (&lt; 30 days) afterexplosion (based on available pre-explosion photometry), and closer than ~120mpc. this complete sample allows, for the first time, a study of core-collapsesne as a population, rather than as individual events. here, we present thefull cccp sn sample and show exemplary data collected. we analyze availabledata for the first ~1/3 of the sample and determine the subtypes of 13 sne iibased on both light curve shapes and spectroscopy. we discuss the relative snii subtype fractions in the context of associating sn subtypes with specificprogenitor stars.

astro-ph;0611933	the incidence of dwarf novae in large area transient searches	understanding and quantifying the contribution of known classes of transientand variable sources is an important lesson to be learned from the manifold ofpre-cursors programs of the near-future large synoptic sky survey programs likeskymapper, pan-starrs and lsst. with this goal in mind, we undertookphotometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of three recently reportedunidentified transients. for two sources, wfi j132813.7-214237 and wfij161953.3+031909, we show that unfortunate coincidences lead to their previousdesignation as transients. while the former is now interpreted as the spatialcoincidence of a solar system object with faint background star, the latter ismerely a cataclysmic variable unfortunately caught in and out of eclipse. thethird candidate, rotse3 j160213.1-021311.7 is identified as an su uma-typedwarf novae with quiescent brightness of r~22.7 and an outburst amplitude ofabout 5 mag. the fourth event, sdss-sn15207, similarly shows evidence for adwarf nova origin. our main conclusion is that cataclysmic variables in theirvarious avata rs will contribute moderately to the population of transientobjects.

astro-ph;0612408	sn 2006gy: an extremely luminous supernova in the galaxy ngc 1260	with an extinction-corrected v-band peak absolute magnitude of about -22,supernova (sn) 2006gy is probably the brightest sn ever observed. we report onmulti-wavelength observations of this sn and its environment. our spectroscopyshows an h alpha emission line as well as absorption features which may beidentified as siii lines at low expansion velocity. the high peak luminosity,the slow rise to maximum, and the narrow h alpha line are similar to thoseobserved in hybrid type-ia/iin (also called iia) sne. the host galaxy, ngc1260, is dominated by an old stellar population with solar metallicity.however, our high resolution adaptive optics images reveal a dust lane in thisgalaxy, and there appears to be an hii region in the vicinity of the sn. theextra-ordinarily large peak luminosity, ~3x10^44 erg/s, demands a densecircum-stellar medium, regardless of the mass of the progenitor star. theinferred mass loss rate of the progenitor is ~0.1 solar mass per year over aperiod of ~10 yr prior to explosion. such an high mass-loss rate may be theresult of a binary star common envelope ejection. the total radiated energy inthe first two months is about 1.1x10^51 erg, which is only a factor of two lessthan that available from a super-chandrasekhar ia explosion. therefore, giventhe presence of a star forming region in the vicinity of the sn and the highenergy requirements, a plausible scenario is that sn 2006gy is related to thedeath of a massive star (e.g., pair production sn).

astro-ph;0703192	grb 060505: a possible short-duration gamma-ray burst in a star forming  region at redshift of 0.09	on 2006 may 5, a four second duration, low energy, ~10^49 erg, gamma-rayburst (grb) was observed, spatially associated with a z=0.0894 galaxy. here, wereport the discovery of the grb optical afterglow and observations of itsenvironment using gemini-south, hubble space telescope (hst), chandra, swiftand the very large array. the optical afterglow of this grb is spatiallyassociated with a prominent star forming region in the sc-type galaxy 2dfgrss173z112. its proximity to a star forming region suggests that the progenitordelay time, from birth to explosion, is smaller than about 10 myr. our hst deepimaging rules out the presence of a supernova brighter than an absolutemagnitude of about -11 (or -12.6 in case of ``maximal'' extinction) at abouttwo weeks after the burst, and limits the ejected mass of radioactive nickel 56to be less than about 2x10^-4 solar mass (assuming no extinction). although itwas suggested that grb 060505 may belong to a new class of long-duration grbswith no supernova, we argue that the simplest interpretation is that thephysical mechanism responsible for this burst is the same as for short-durationgrbs.

astro-ph;0703765	x-ray, uv, and optical observations of supernova 2006bp with swift:  detection of early x-ray emission	we present results on the x-ray and optical/uv emission from the type iip sn2006bp and the interaction of the sn shock with its environment, obtained withthe x-ray telescope (xrt) and uv/optical telescope (uvot) on-board the swiftobservatory. sn 2006bp is detected in x-rays at a 4.5 sigma level ofsignificance in the merged xrt data from days 1 to 12 after the explosion. ifthe x-ray luminosity of (1.8+/-0.4)e39 ergs/s is caused by interaction of thesn shock with circumstellar material (csm), deposited by a stellar wind fromthe progenitor's companion star, a mass-loss rate of ~e-05 m_sun/yr isinferred. the mass-loss rate is consistent with the non-detection in the radiowith the vla on days 2, 9, and 11 after the explosion and characteristic of ared supergiant progenitor with a mass around 12-15 m_sun prior to theexplosion. in combination with a follow-up xmm-newton observation obtained onday 21 after the explosion, an x-ray rate of decline with index 1.2+/-0.6 isinferred. since no other sn has been detected in x-rays prior to the opticalpeak and since type iip sne have an extended 'plateau' phase in the optical, wediscuss the scenario that the x-rays might be due to inverse compton scatteringof photospheric optical photons off relativistic electrons produced incircumstellar shocks. however, due to the high required value of the lorentzfactor (~10-100) we conclude that inverse compton scattering is an unlikelyexplanation for the observed x-ray emission. the fast evolution of theoptical/ultraviolet spectral energy distribution and the spectral changesobserved with swift reveal the onset of metal line-blanketing and cooling ofthe expanding photosphere during the first few weeks after the outburst.

0811.3173	vlbi observations of sn 2008d	we report on two epochs of very-long-baseline interferometry (vlbi)observations of the type ib/c supernova sn 2008d, which was associated with thex-ray outburst xrf 080109. at our first epoch, at t = 30 days after theexplosion, we observed at 22 and 8.4 ghz, and at our second, at t = 133 days,at 8.4 and 5.0 ghz. the vlbi observations allow us to accurately measure thesource's size and position at each epoch, and thus constrain its expansionvelocity and proper motion. we find the source at best marginally resolved atboth epochs, allowing us to place a 3sigma upper limit of ~0.75c on theexpansion velocity of a circular source. for an elongated source, ourmeasurements are compatible with mildly relativistic expansion. however, our3sigma upper limit on the proper motion is 4 micro-arcsec/day, corresponding toan apparent velocity of &lt;0.6c, and is consistent with a stationary fluxcentroid. this limit rules out a relativistic jet such as an gamma-ray burstjet away from the line of sight, which would be expected to show apparentproper motion of &gt;c. taken together, our measurements argue against thepresence of any long-lived relativistic outflow in sn 2008d. on the other hand,our measurements are consistent with the nonrelativistic expansion velocitiesof &lt;30,000 km/s and small proper motions (&lt;500 km/s) seen in typicalsupernovae.
