0901.0550	the dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass surface  density and sersic index in zcosmos galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9 compared with sdss  galaxies at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08	one of the key unanswered questions in the study of galaxy evolution is whatphysical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the sfrs in individualgalaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the globalstar-formation rate density (sfrd) to redshifts since z~2. many studies of thesfr at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integratedstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internalstructural properties of the galaxies. in this paper we present a comparativestudy of the dependence of sfrs on the average surface mass densities (sigmam)of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zcosmos andsdss surveys. the main findings about the evolution of these relatively massivegalaxies are: 1) there is evidence that, for both sdss ans zcosmos galaxies,the mean specific sfr within a given population (either disk-dominated orbulge-dominated) is independent of sigmam; 2) the observed ssfr - sigmamstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changingmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increasesand the strong difference in the average ssfr between disks and bulges. we alsofind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk andspheroid galaxies; 3) the shape of the median ssfr - sigmam relation issimilar, but with median ssfr values that are about 5-6 times higher in zcosmosgalaxies than for sdss, across the whole range of sigmam, and in both spheroidand disk galaxies. this increase matches that of the global sfrd of theuniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,proportionally, to the global increase in sfrd in the universe back to theseredshifts (abridged).

0903.0102	galaxy stellar mass assembly between 0.2&lt;z&lt;2 from the s-cosmos survey	we follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral typein the cosmos 2-deg^2 field. we derive the stellar mass functions and stellarmass densities from z=2 to z=0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at f(3.6micron) &gt; 1 microjy with accurate photometric redshifts(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i&lt;22.5). using a spectral classification, wefind that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly ofquiescent galaxies. their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex betweenz=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (delta t ~2.5 gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 andz~0.1 (delta t ~ 6 gyr). then, we add the morphological information and findthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(m)~11) have an ellipticalmorphology at z&lt;0.8. therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of starformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a spi/irrmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(m)~9.5), but this fraction is smallerthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. wealso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. we find that the mostmassive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phasefirst. finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomeslower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z&lt;1. as aconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the mostmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z&lt;1, which could explain theobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0903.3411	an optical group catalogue to z = 1 from the zcosmos 10k sample	we present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1in the ~1.7 deg^2 cosmos field, based on the first ~10,000 zcosmos spectra. theperformance of both the friends-of-friends (fof) and voronoi-delaunay-method(vdm) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored andcompared using realistic mock catalogues. we find that the performance improvessubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-findingparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelitycatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining theindependently created fof and vdm catalogues. the final completeness and purityof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,compares favorably with recent results in the literature. the current groupcatalogue contains 102 groups with n &gt;= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,with a further ~700 groups with 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 4. most of the groups can be assigneda velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,with quantifiable uncertainties. the fraction of zcosmos galaxies in groups isabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. the zcosmosgroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analyticevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. not least, we show that thenumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases fromredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth ofstructure.

0903.3972	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at z ~ 2. iv. the variety of  dust populations	the properties of dust attenuation at rest-frame uv wavelengths are inferredfrom very high-quality fors2 spectra of 78 galaxies from the gmass survey at1&lt;z&lt;2.5. these objects complement a previously investigated sample of 108uv-luminous galaxies at similar redshifts, selected from the fdf spectroscopicsurvey, the k20 survey, and the gdds. the shape of the uv extinction curve isconstrained by a parametric description of the rest-frame uv continuum. the uvbump is further characterised by fitting lorentzian-like profiles. spectraexhibit a significant 2175a feature in at least 30% of the cases. ifattenuation is dominated by dust ejected from the galaxy main body viasuperwinds, uv extinction curves in-between those of the smc and lmccharacterise the sample galaxies. the fraction of galaxies with extinctioncurves differing from the smc one increases, if more dust resides in thegalactic plane or dust attenuation depends on stellar age. on average, thewidth of the manifested uv bumps is about 60% of the values typical of the lmcand milky way. this suggests the presence of dust similar to that found in thelmc2 supershell close to 30dor. the presence of the carriers of the uv bump at1&lt;z&lt;2.5 argues for outflows from agb stars being copious then. consistent withtheir higher sfrs, the gmass galaxies with a manifested uv bump are moreluminous at rest-frame 8mum, where the emission is dominated by pahs (alsoproducts of agb stars). in addition, they exhibit stronger uv absorptionfeatures, mostly of interstellar origin, which indicates overall more evolvedstellar populations. we conclude that diversification of the small-size dustcomponent has already started in the most evolved star-forming systems at1&lt;z&lt;2.5.

0906.1807	the zcosmos survey. the dependence of clustering on luminosity and  stellar mass at z=0.2-1	we study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar massat redshifts z ~ [0.2-1] using the first zcosmos 10k sample.  we measure the redshift-space correlation functions xi(rp,pi) and itsprojection wp(rp) for sub-samples covering different luminosity, mass andredshift ranges. we quantify in detail the observational selection biases andwe check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles ofsemi-analytic mock catalogues. we finally compare our measurements to thecosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.  at odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxyclustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. a mild dependence onstellar mass is instead observed. at z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power onlarge scales. we interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominatingthe survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular tothe line-of-sight. we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of theamplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.  the clustering measured in the zcosmos data at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 for galaxies withlog(m/m_\odot)&gt;=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mocksurveys. on scales larger than ~2 h^-1 mpc, the observed clustering amplitudeis compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. thus, if the power spectrum of matteris lcdm with standard normalization and the bias has no unnaturalscale-dependence, this result indicates that cosmos has picked up aparticularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1mpc^3. these findings underline the need for larger surveys of the z~1 universeto appropriately characterize the level of structure at this epoch.

0906.3648	dynamical masses of early-type galaxies at z~2: are they truly  superdense?	we measured stellar velocity dispersions sigma and dynamical masses of 9massive (m~10^11 msun) early-type galaxies (etg) from the gmass sample atredshift 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.0. the sigma are based on individual spectra for two galaxiesat z~1.4 and on a stacked spectrum for 7 galaxies with 1.6&lt;z&lt;2.0, with 202-h ofexposure at the eso very large telescope. we constructed detailed axisymmetricdynamical models for the objects, based on the jeans equations, taking theobserved surface brightness (from deep hst/acs observations), psf and sliteffects into account. our dynamical masses m_jeans agree within ~30% withvirial estimates m_vir=5*re*sigma^2/g, although the latter tend to be smaller.this suggests that sizes are not underestimated by more than a similarfraction. our m_jeans also agrees within a factor &lt;2 with the m_pop previouslyderived using stellar population models and 11 bands photometry. this confirmsthat the galaxies are intrinsically massive. the inferred mass-to-light ratiosm/l_u in the very age-sensitive rest frame u-band are consistent with passiveevolution in the past ~1 gyr (formation redshift z_f~3). a 'bottom-light'stellar initial mass function (imf) appears to be required to ensure closeagreement between m_jeans and m_pop at z~2, as it does at z~0. the gmass etgsare on average more dense than their local counterpart. however a few percentof local etgs of similar dynamical masses also have comparable sigma and masssurface density sigma_50 inside re.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0907.5416	zcosmos - 10k-bright spectroscopic sample. the bimodality in the galaxy  stellar mass function: exploring its evolution with redshift	we present the galaxy stellar mass function (mf) up to z~1 from thezcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. we investigate the total mf and thecontribution of etgs and ltgs, defined by different criteria (sed, morphologyor star formation). we unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global mf, betterrepresented by 2 schechter functions dominated by etgs and ltgs, respectively.for the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number densityincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. we find that the mfevolution at intermediate-low values of mstar (logm&lt;10.6) is mostly explainedby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formationactivities. the low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger pergalaxy per gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). we find that etgs increasein number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing mstar, with a median"building redshift" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.for ltgs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remainsalmost constant from z~1. instead, the most extreme population of active starforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. we suggest atransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into bluequiescent and successively (1-2 gyr after) into red passive types. the completemorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scalesor follows after 1-2 gyr. a continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expectedby low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass. we estimate that on average~25% of blue galaxies is transforming into red per gyr for logm&lt;11. we concludethat the build-up of galaxies and etgs follows the same downsizing trend withmass as the formation of their stars, converse to the trend predicted bycurrent sams. we expect a negligible evolution of the global galaxy baryonicmf.

0909.1951	the zcosmos redshift survey: how group environment alters global  downsizing trends	we took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first ~10000galaxies of the zcosmos-bright survey and its group catalogue to study thecomplex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. theclassical indicator f_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simplebut powerful diagnostic tool. we studied its variation for different luminosityand mass selected galaxy samples. using rest-frame b-band selected samples, thegroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,but maintains a lower f_blue with respect both to the global and the isolatedgalaxy population. however moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparentthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the b-bandluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright bluegalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. byfocusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomesnegligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logmass &lt;= 10.6)does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function ofenvironment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. ourresults indicate that red galaxies of logmass &gt;= 10.8 are already in place at z~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possiblyoriginating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. in contrast, for lowergalaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence ingroups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from thetrend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, andmore so with cosmic time. these galaxies exhibit signatures of group-relatedsecular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0909.4674	the zcosmos survey: the role of the environment in the evolution of the  luminosity function of different galaxy types	(abridged) we studied the evolution in the b band luminosity function to z~1in the zcosmos 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and adetailed description of the local density field are available.  the global lf exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in m* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.at low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end ispopulated mainly by early types. at higher z, late-type galaxies evolvesignificantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to thebright end of the lf is comparable. the evolution for early types is in bothluminosity and normalization. a similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,but with an opposite trend for the normalization. studying the role of theenvironment, we find that the global lf of galaxies in overdense regions hasalways a brighter m* and a flatter slope. in low density environments, the maincontribution to the lf is from blue galaxies, while for high densityenvironments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the brightend. the differences between the global lf in the two environments are not dueto only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but alsoto their relative luminosity distributions: the value of m* for both types inunderdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.  the "specular" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent witha scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies withincreasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction ofintermediate-type galaxies. the bulk of this tranformation in overdense regionsprobably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z inunderdense environments.

0911.0523	properties and environment of radio emitting galaxies in the vla-zcosmos  survey	we investigate the properties and the environment of radio sources withoptical counterpart from the combined vla-cosmos and zcosmos samples. theadvantage of this sample is the availability of optical spectroscopicinformation, high quality redshifts, and accurate density determination.  by comparing the star formation rates estimated from the optical spectralenergy distribution with those based on the radio luminosity, we divide theradio sources in three families, passive agn, non-passive agn and star forminggalaxies. these families occupy specific regions of the 8.0-4.5 $\mu$m infraredcolor--specific star formation plane, from which we extract the correspondingcontrol samples.  only the passive agn have a significantly different environment distributionfrom their control sample. the fraction of radio-loud passive agn increasesfrom ~2% in underdense regions to ~15% for overdensities (1+delta) greater than10. this trend is also present as a function of richness of the groups hostingthe radio sources. passive agn in overdensities tend to have higher radioluminosities than those in lower density environments. since the black holemass distribution is similar in both environments, we speculate that, for lowradio luminosities, the radio emission is controlled (through fueldisponibility or confinement of radio jet by local gas pressure) by theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy, while in other cases it is determinedby the structure (group or cluster) in which the galaxy resides.

0911.2252	the zcosmos-bright survey: the clustering of early and late galaxy  morphological types since z~1	we measure the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of theirmorphological type at z~0.8, for the first time in a deep redshift survey withfull morphological information. this is obtained by combining high-resolutionhst imaging and vlt spectroscopy for about 8,500 galaxies to i_ab=22.5 withaccurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos-bright redshift survey. atthis epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly strongerclustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. a comparison to thesdss at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early andlate morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at smallseparations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution sincez~0.8. this suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed inintermediate and dense environments at this epoch. our results are consistentwith a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphologicaltypes between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in themorphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-drivenevolution.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

1003.4747	mass and environment as drivers of galaxy evolution in sdss and zcosmos  and the origin of the schechter function	we explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate andenvironment in the sdss, zcosmos and other surveys. the differential effects ofmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that twodistinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching".environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change withepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops inthe universe. the observed constancy of the mass-function shape forstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around andabove m*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z &lt; 2. wepostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broaderrange of stellar mass and epoch. these two simple quenching processes, plussome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) aquasi-static schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value ofm* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation andmass-quenching rates, (b) a double schechter function for passive galaxies withtwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactlythe same m* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, whilethe other is produced by environment effects and has the same m* and alpha asthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat inthe denser environments, slightly increasing m* and making alpha more negative.all of these detailed quantitative relationships between the schechterparameters are indeed seen in the sdss, lending strong support to our simpleempirically-based model. the model naturally produces for passive galaxies the"anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

1006.4956	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field ii: the role of mergers in galaxy evolution	we analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 micronselected galaxies in the cosmos field spanning the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt; 3.5with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of10^8&lt;l_ir&lt;10^14l_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. in generalthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 m_sun, andluminous, with -25&lt;m_k&lt;-20. we find a strong correlation between the fractionof major mergers and l_ir, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being upto 50%. we also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with l_ir.minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity forsources with low luminosities. the precise fraction of mergers in any givenl_ir bin varies by redshift due to sources at z&gt;1 being difficult to classifyand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers canonly be considered lower limits. at z&lt;1, where the morphologicalclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ulirgpopulation (50-80%) and are important for the lirg population (25-40%). at z&gt;1the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ulirgs. although thegeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local(u)lirgs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.this is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at highredshift. we argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed andthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (u)lirgphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals(&lt;10^12 m_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

1007.1984	understanding the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function at  z~1 in the cosmos field	we investigate how the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function asmeasured in the zcosmos survey depends on local environment, quantified interms of the density contrast on scales of 5 mpc/h. we show that the flat shapepreviously observed at redshifts between z=0.6 and z=1 can be explained by thisvolume being simply 10% over-abundant in high-density environments, withrespect to a universal density probability distribution function. when galaxiescorresponding to the top 10% tail of the distribution are excluded, themeasured w_p(r_p) steepens and becomes indistinguishable from lcdm predictionson all scales. this is the same effect recognised by abbas &amp; sheth in the sdssdata at z~0 and explained as a natural consequence of halo-environmentcorrelations in a hierarchical scenario. galaxies living in high-densityregions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are morecorrelated. if the density probability distribution function of the sample isparticularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced byits finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. weargue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed "peculiar"clustering in the cosmos field.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1009.3376	zcosmos 10k-bright spectroscopic sample: exploring mass and environment  dependence in early-type galaxies	we present the analysis of the u-v rest-frame color distribution and somespectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample ofearly-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey.the first sample ("red galaxies") is defined with a photometric classification,while the second ("etgs") by combining morphological, photometric, andspectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. we find that thecolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment forall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies inunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. the dependence onmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.we study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while thecolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.the spectral analysis that we perform on our etgs sample is in good agreementwith our photometric results: we find for d4000 a dependence on mass betweenhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for theequivalent width of h{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\aa}acrossthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.by analyzingthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of adownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger d4000 and analmost constant equivalent width of $h\delta$ formed their mass at higherredshift than lower mass ones. we also conclude that the main driver of galaxyevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1106.4308	the relative abundance of compact and normal massive early-type galaxies  and its evolution from redshift z~2 to the present	we report on the evolution of the number density and size of early-typegalaxies from z~2 to z~0. we select a sample of 563 massive (m&gt;10^{10} msun),passively evolving (ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}) and morphologically spheroidalgalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, using the panchromatic photometry and spectroscopicredshifts available in the goods fields. we combine acs and wfc3 hst images tostudy the morphology of our galaxies in their optical rest-frame in the whole0&lt;z&lt;2.5 range. we find that throughout the explored redshift range the passivegalaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological k-correction, withsize being slightly smaller in the optical than in the uv rest-frame (by ~20and ~10 at z&gt;1.2 and z&lt;1.2, respectively). we measure a significant evolutionof the mass-size relation of early-type galaxies, with the fractional incrementthat is almost independent on the stellar mass. early-type galaxies (etgs)formed at z&gt;1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of themass-size relation at z&lt;1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of thecompact galaxies and the appearance of new etgs with large sizes. we also findthat the number density of all passive early-type galaxies increases rapidly,by a factor of 5, from z~2 to z~1, and then more mildly by another factor of1.5 from z~1 to z~0. we interpret these results as the evidence that the bulkof the etgs are formed at 1&lt;z&lt;3 through a mechanism that leaves very compactremnants. at z&lt;1 the compact etgs grow gradually in size, becoming normal sizegalaxies, and at the same time new etgs with normal-large sizes are formed.

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

0801.1184	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2. ii. superdense  passive galaxies: how did they form and evolve ?	we combine ultradeep optical spectroscopy from the gmass project ("galaxymass assembly ultradeep spectroscopic survey") with goods multi-band photometryand hst imaging to study a sample of passive galaxiesat 1.39&lt;z&lt;1.99 selected at4.5 microns. a stacked spectrum with an equivalent integration time of ~500hours was obtained is publicly released. the spectral and photometric sedproperties indicate very weak or absent star formation, moderately old stellarages of ~1 gyr (for solar metallicity) and stellar masses in the range of10^{10-11} solar masses, thus implying that the major star formation andassembly processes for these galaxies occurred at z&gt;2. these galaxies havemorphologies that are predominantly compact and spheroidal.however, their sizes(r_e &lt;~ 1 kpc) are much smaller than those of spheroids in the present--dayuniverse. their stellar mass surface densities are consequently higher by ~1dex if compared to spheroids at z~0 with the same mass. their rest-frame b-bandsurface brightness scales with the effective radius, but the offset withrespect to the surface brightness of the local kormendy relation is too largeto be explained by simple passive evolution. at z~1, a larger fraction ofpassive galaxies follows the z~0 size -- mass relation. superdense relics withr_e~1 kpc are extremely rare at z~0 with respect to z&gt;1, and absent if r_e&lt;1kpc. because of the similar sizes and mass densities, we suggest that thesuperdense passive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 are the remnants of the powerfulstarbursts occurring in submillimeter--selected galaxies at z&gt;2. the resultsare compared with theoretical models and the main implications discussed in theframework of massive galaxy formation and evolution.

0801.1193	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at redshift z~2. i. the stellar  metallicity	context: galaxy metallicities have been measured to redshift z~2 by gas-phaseoxygen abundances of the interstellar medium using the r23 and n2 methods.galaxy stellar metallicities provide crucial data for chemical evolution modelsbut have not been assessed reliably much outside the local universe. aims: wedetermine the iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies(sfgs) at redshift z~2, observed as part of the galaxy mass assembly ultra-deepspectroscopic survey (gmass). methods: we compute the equivalent width of arest-frame mid-ultraviolet, photospheric absorption-line index, the 1978 indexfound to vary monotonically with stellar metallicity by rix and collaborators.we normalise and combine 75 sfg spectra from the gmass survey to produce aspectrum corresponding to a total integration time 1652.5 hours (and asignal-to-noise ratio ~100 for our 1.5 angstrom binning) of fors2 spectroscopicobservations at the very large telescope. results: we measure aniron-abundance, stellar metallicity of log (z/zsolar) = -0.574+/-0.159 for ourspectrum representative of a galaxy of stellar mass 9.4 x 10^9 msolar assuminga chabrier imf. we find that the r04 model sfg spectrum for log (z/zsolar) =-0.699 solar metallicity provides the best description of our gmass coaddedspectrum. for similar galaxy stellar mass, our stellar metallicity is ~0.25 dexlower than the oxygen-abundance, gas-phase metallicity quantified by erb andcollaborators for uv-selected star-forming galaxies at z=2. conclusions: weconclude that we are witnessing the establishment of a light-elementoverabundance in galaxies as they are being formed at redshift z~2. ourmeasurements are reminiscent of the alpha-element enhancement seen inlow-redshift, galactic bulges and early-type galaxies.

1311.4401	agn feedback at z~2 and the mutual evolution of active and inactive  galaxies	the relationships between galaxies of intermediate stellar mass and moderateluminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) at 1&lt;z&lt;3 are investigated with thegalaxy mass assembly ultra-deep spectroscopic survey (gmass) samplecomplemented with public data in the goods-south field. using x-ray data,hidden agns are identified in unsuspected star-forming galaxies with noapparent signs of non-stellar activity. in the color-mass plane, two paralleltrends emerge during the ~2 gyr between the average redshifts z~2.2 and z~1.3:while the red sequence becomes significantly more populated by ellipticals, themajority of agns with l(2-10 kev)&gt;10^42.3 erg s^-1 disappear from the bluecloud/green valley where they were hosted predominantly by star-forming systemswith disk and irregular morphologies. these results are even clearer when therest-frame colors are corrected for dust reddening. at z~2.2, the ultravioletspectra of active galaxies (including two type 1 agns) show possible gasoutflows with velocities up to about -500 km s^-1 that are not observed neitherin inactive systems at the same redshift, nor at lower redshifts. such outflowsindicate the presence of gas that can move faster than the escape velocities ofactive galaxies. these results suggest that feedback from moderately luminousagns (logl_x&lt;44.5 erg s^-1) played a key role at z&gt;~2 by contributing tooutflows capable of ejecting part of the interstellar medium and leading to arapid decrease in the star formation in host galaxies with stellar masses10&lt;logm&lt;11 m_sun.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1403.4230	vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds): witnessing the assembly of a massive  cluster at z~3.3	using new spectroscopic observations obtained as part of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds), we perform a systematic search for overdense environments in theearly universe ($z&gt;2$) and report here on the discovery of cl j0227-0421, amassive protocluster at $z=3.29$. this protocluster is characterized by boththe large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometricredshift members. the halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a varietyof methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{m}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that ofthe coma cluster. the properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed membergalaxies are compared with a large sample of vuds/vvds galaxies in lowerdensity field environments at similar redshifts. we find tentative evidence foran excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines ofthe protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we maybe observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. the propertiesof these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightestprotocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear andstarburst activity. the remaining member galaxies appear to havecharacteristics which are largely similar to the field population. though wefind weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation ratesamongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect tothe field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with theensemble of protostructures that are found in the full vuds sample.

0804.1064	gmass ultradeep spectroscopy of galaxies at z~2. iii: the emergence of  the color bimodality at z~2	the aim of this work is to study the evolution of the rest frame colordistribution of galaxies with the redshift, in particular in the criticalinterval 1.4&lt;z&lt;3. we combine ultradeep spectroscopy from the gmass project(galaxy mass assembly ultradeep spectroscopic survey) with goods multi-bandphotometry (from optical to mid-infrared) to study a sample of 1021 galaxies upto m(4.5$\mu$m)=23. we find that the distribution of galaxies in the (u-b)color vs stellar mass plane is bimodal up to at least redshift z=2. we define amass complete sample of galaxies residing on the red-sequence, selectingobjects with log(m/m_{\odot})&gt;10.1, and we study their morphological andspectro-photometric properties. we show that the contribution to this sample ofearly-type galaxies, defined as galaxies with a spheroidal morphology and nostar formation, decreases from 60-70% at z&lt;0.5 down to ~50% at redshift z=2. atz&gt;2 we still find red galaxies in the mass complete sample, even if thebimodality is not seen any more. about 25% of these red galaxies at z&gt;2 arepassively evolving, with the bulk of their stars formed at redshift z&gt;`3.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

astro-ph;0411768	the evolution of the galaxy b-band rest-frame morphology to z~2: new  clues from the k20/goods sample	we present a detailed analysis of the evolution of the rest-frame b-bandmorphology of k-selected galaxies with 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. this work is based on thek20 spectroscopic sample (ks&lt;20) located within the chandra deep field southarea, coupled with the public deep goods hst+acsmulti-band optical imagingavailable in that field. thanks to the spectroscopic completeness of thiscatalog reaching 94%, we can compare the morphological and spectroscopicproperties of galaxies with unprecedented detail. our morphological analysisincludes visual inspection and automatic procedures using both parametric (e.g.the sersic indices treated by the galfit and gasphot packages) andnon-parametric (the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness, cas) methods. ouranalysis classifies the k20 galaxies as: 60/300 (20%, class 1) normalellipticals/s0; 14/300 (4%, class 2) perturbed or peculiar ellipticals; 80/300(27%, class 3) normal spirals; 48/300 (16%, class 4) perturbed or activelystar-forming spirals; 98/300 (33%, class 5) irregulars. the evolution of themerging fraction is constrained up to z~2, by carefully accounting effects ofmorphological k-correction: both asymmetry criterion and pair statistic show anincreasing merging fraction as a function of the redshift. we finally analysethe redshift-dependence of the effective radii for early- and late-typegalaxies and find some mild evidence for a decrease with z of the early-typegalaxy sizes, while disks and irregulars remain constant. altogether, thisanalysis of the k20 sample indicates the large predominance of spirals andirregulars at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5 in k-band selected samples at even moderate depths.

astro-ph;0508456	morphological studies of the swire galaxy population in the ugc 10214  hst/acs field	we present results of a morphological analysis of a small subset of thespitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic survey (swire) galaxy population. theanalysis is based on public acs data taken inside the swire n1 field, which arethe deepest optical high-resolution imaging available within the swire fieldsas of today. our reference sample includes 156 galaxies detected by both acsand swire. among the various galaxy morphologies, we disentangle two mainclasses, spheroids (or bulge-dominated galaxies) and disk-dominated ones, forwhich we compute the number counts as a function of flux. we then limit oursample to objects with irac fluxes brighter than 10 microjy, estimated ~90%completeness limit of the swire catalogues, and compare the observed counts tomodel predictions. we find that the observed counts of the spheroidalpopulation agree with the expectations of a hierarchical model while amonolithic scenario predicts steeper counts. both scenaria, however,under-predict the number of late-type galaxies. these observations show thatthe large majority (close to 80 per cent) of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxypopulation, even at these moderately faint fluxes, is dominated by spiral andirregular galaxies or mergers.

astro-ph;0601003	cosmic evolution of the galaxy mass and luminosity functions by  morphological type from multi-wavelength data in the cdf-south	we constrain the evolution of the galaxy mass and luminosity functions fromthe analysis of (public) multi-wavelength data in the chandra deep field south(cdfs) area, obtained from the goods and other projects, and including verydeep high-resolution imaging by hst/acs. our reference catalogue of fainthigh-redshift galaxies, which we have thoroughly tested for completeness andreliability, comes from a deep (s(3.6micron)&gt;1 microjy) image by irac on thespitzer observatory. these imaging data in the field are complemented withextensive optical spectroscopy by the eso vlt/fors2 and vimos spectrographs,while deep k-band vlt/isaac imaging is also used to derive furthercomplementary statistical constraints and to assist the source identificationand sed analysis. we have selected a highly reliable irac 3.6micron sub-sampleof 1478 galaxies with s(3.6)&gt;10microjy, 47% of which have spectroscopicredshift, while for the remaining objects both combo-17 and hyperz are used toestimate the photometric redshift. this very extensive dataset is exploited toassess evolutionary effects in the galaxy luminosity and stellar massfunctions, while luminosity/density evolution is further constrained with thenumber counts and redshift distributions. the deep acs imaging allows us todifferentiate these evolutionary paths by morphological type, which oursimulations show to be reliable at least up to z=1.5 for the two main early-(e/s0) and late-type (sp/irr) classes. these data, as well as our directestimate of the stellar mass function above m=10^(10)m_sun for the spheroidalsubclass, consistently evidence a progressive dearth of such objects to occurstarting at z=0.7, paralleled by an increase in luminosity.

astro-ph;0602463	evolutionary paths for galaxies and agns: new insights by the spitzer  space telescope	we compare the history of the galaxy mass build-up, as inferred from near-irobservations, and the star formation rate of massive stars in the comovingvolume traced by deep extensive far-ir surveys, both possible now with thespitzer space telescope. these two independent and complementary approaches tothe history of galaxy formation consistently indicate that a wide interval ofcosmic epochs between z~0.7 to z~2 brackets the main evolutionary phases. therate of the integrated galaxy mass growth indicated by the ir-based comovingsfr appears consistent with the observed decrease of the stellar mass densitieswith redshift. there are also indications that the evolution with z of thetotal population depends on galaxy mass, being stronger for moderate-mass, butalmost absent up to z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previousevidence for a "downsizing" effect in galaxy formation. the most massivegalaxies appear already mostly in place by z~1. although a precise matching ofthis galaxy build-up with the growth of nuclear super-massive black-holes isnot possible with the present data (due to difficulties for an accurate censusof the obscured agn phenomenon), some preliminary indications reveal a similarmass/luminosity dependence for agn evolution as for the hosting galaxies.

astro-ph;0604132	gmass, unveiling distant massive galaxies with spitzer	one of the main questions of galaxy formation is how and when galaxiesassembled their mass. observations suggest that most mass assembly and starformation occured at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3. however, in the same redshift range, fullyassembled old and massive galaxies co-exist with star-bursting systems still intheir assembling stage. in order to explore galaxy evolution in this criticalredshift range, we started a project called gmass (galaxy mass assemblyultra-deep spectroscopic survey) based on an 145 hours eso large program andaimed at doing ultradeep spectroscopy with the vlt of a sample of high redshiftgalaxies slected with irac/spitzer m(4.5mu) &lt; 23, z(phot) &gt; 1.4) from thegoods-south/hudf region. the selection at 4.5 micron is crucial to select highredshift galaxies based on the stellar mass or objects affected by strong dustextinction. the spectroscopic deep integration times (15 - 50 hours) are neededto identify unambiguously the redshift and nature of these galaxies, whichredshifts are mostly in the "desert" where spectroscopy is traditionallydifficult due to the absence of strong emission lines at optical wavelengths.the survey is almost complete and some preliminary results are presented here.

astro-ph;0612152	531 new spectroscopic redshifts from the cdfs and a test on the  cosmological relevance of the goods-south field	(abbrev.) this paper prepares a series of papers analysing the intermediatemass galaxy evolution sequence (images) up to z=1. intermediate mass galaxies(mj &lt;=-20.3) are selected from the chandra deep field south (cdfs) for which weidentify a serious lack of spectroscopically determined redshifts..... we havespectroscopically identified 691 objects including 580 gal., 7 qsos, and 104stars. this study provides 531 new redshifts in the cdfs. it confirms thepresence of several large scale structures in the cdfs. to test the impact ofthese structures in the goods-south field, we ... compare the evolution ofrest-frame u, b, v and k galaxy luminosity densities to that derived from thecfrs. the cdfs field shows a significant excess of luminosity densities in thez=0.5-0.75 range, which increases with the wavelength, reaching up to 0.5 dexat 2.1 um. stellar mass and specific star formation evolutions might besignificantly affected by the presence of the peculiar large scale structuresat z= 0.668 and at z= 0.735, that contain a significant excess of evolved,massive galaxies when compared to other fields. this leads to a clear warningto results based on the cdfs/goods south fields, especially those related tothe evolution of red luminosity densities, i.e. stellar mass density andspecific star formation rate. photometric redshift techniques, when applied tothat field, are producing quantities which are apparently less affected bycosmic variance (0.25 dex at 2.1 um), however at the cost of the difficulty indisentangling between evolutionary and cosmic variance effects.

astro-ph;0701482	the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos): a large-scale structure at z=0.73  and the relation of galaxy morphologies to local environment	we have identified a large-scale structure at z~0.73 in the cosmos field,coherently described by the distribution of galaxy photometric redshifts, anacs weak-lensing convergence map and the distribution of extended x-ray sourcesin a mosaic of xmm observations. the main peak seen in these maps correspondsto a rich cluster with tx= 3.51+0.60/-0.46 kev and lx=(1.56+/-0.04) x 10^{44}erg/s ([0.1-2.4] kev band). we estimate an x-ray mass within $r500$corresponding to m500~1.6 x 10^{14} msun and a total lensing mass (extrapolatedby fitting a nfw profile) m(nfw)=(6+/-3) x 10^15 msun. we use an automatedmorphological classification of all galaxies brighter than i_ab=24 over thestructure area to measure the fraction of early-type objects as a function oflocal projected density sigma_10, based on photometric redshifts derived fromground-based deep multi-band photometry. we recover a robust morphology-densityrelation at this redshift, indicating, for comparable local densities, asmaller fraction of early-type galaxies than today. interestingly, thisdifference is less strong at the highest densities and becomes more severe inintermediate environments. we also find, however, local "inversions'' of theobserved global relation, possibly driven by the large-scale environment. inparticular, we find direct correspondence of a large concentration of diskgalaxies to (the colder side of) a possible shock region detected in the x-raytemperature map and surface brightness distribution of the dominant cluster. weinterpret this as potential evidence of shock-induced star formation inexisting galaxy disks, during the ongoing merger between two sub-clusters.

astro-ph;0701483	the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos): the morphological content and  enviromental dependence of the galaxy color-magnitude relation at z~0.7	we study the enviromental dependence and the morphological composition of thegalaxy color-magnitude diagram at z~0.7, using a pilot sub-sample of ~2000galaxies from the cosmos surve, with i_ab&lt;24, photometric redshift within0.61&lt;z&lt;0.85 and galaxy morphologies based on the hst-acs data. the c-m diagramshows a clear red-sequence dominated by early-type galaxies and also aremarkably well-defined "blue sequence'" described by late-type objects. whilethe percentage of objects populating the two sequences is a function ofenvironment, with a clear morphology/color-density relation, theirnormalization and slope are independent of local density. we identify and studya number of objects with "anomalous'' colors, given their morphology. redlate-type galaxies are found to be mostly highly-inclined spiral galaxies, withcolors dominated by internal reddening (33% contamination with respect to trulypassive spheroidals). conversely, the population of blue early-type galaxies iscomposed by objects of moderate luminosity and mass, concurring to only ~5% ofthe mass in spheroidal galaxies. the majority of them (~70%) occupy a positionin the surface-brightness/effective-radius plane not consistent with them beingprecursors of current epoch elliptical galaxies. in a color-mass diagram, colorsequences are even better defined, with red galaxies covering in general awider range of masses at nearly constant color, and blue galaxies showing amore pronounced dependence of color on mass. while the red sequence isadequately reproduced by models of passive evolution, the blue sequence isbetter interpreted as a specific star-formation sequence. its substantialinvariance with respect to local density suggests that the overall, "secular''star formation is driven more by galaxy mass than by environment.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0810.4769	the spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn in the xmm-cosmos field	we study the spatial clustering of 538 x-ray selected agn in the 2 deg^2xmm-cosmos field that are spectroscopically identified to i_{ab}&lt;23 and spanthe redshift range z=0.2-3.0. the median redshift and luminosity of the sampleare z = 0.98 and l_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. a strongclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significantmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of x-ray selected agn. by fittingthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales ofr_p=0.3-40 mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6+- 0.5 mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (poissonian errors; bootstraperrors are about a factor of 2 larger). an excess signal is observed in therange r_p~5-15 mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36containing about 40 agn. when removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computingw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 mpc/h, which isconsistent with that observed for bright optical qsos at the same redshift.  we investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured agnseparately. within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence thatagn with broad optical lines (blagn) cluster differently from agn without broadoptical lines (non-blagn).  the correlation length measured for xmm-cosmos agn at z~1 is similar to thatof massive galaxies (stellar mass m_*&gt; 3 x 10^{10} m_sun) at the same redshift.this suggests that agn at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, asobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) universe.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
