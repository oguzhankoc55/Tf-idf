0902.2179	binarity of transit host stars - implications on planetary parameters	straight-forward derivation of planetary parameters can only be achieved intransiting planetary systems. however, planetary attributes such as radius andmass strongly depend on stellar host parameters. discovering a transit hoststar to be multiple leads to a necessary revision of the derived stellar andplanetary parameters. based on our observations of 14 transiting exoplanethosts, we derive parameters of the individual components of three transit hoststars (wasp-2, tres-2, and tres-4) which we detected to be binaries. two ofthese have not been known to be multiple before. parameters of thecorresponding exoplanets are revised. high-resolution "lucky imaging" withastralux at the 2.2m calar alto telescope provided near diffraction limitedimages in i' and z' passbands. these results have been combined with existingplanetary data in order to recalibrate planetary attributes. despite thefaintness (delta mag ~ 4) of the discovered stellar companions to tres-2,tres-4, and wasp-2, light-curve deduced parameters change by up to more than1sigma. we discuss a possible relation between binary separation and planetaryproperties, which - if confirmed - could hint at the influence of binarity onthe planet formation process.

physics;0605042	resolved hubble space spectroscopy of ultracool binary systems	using the low-resolution mode of the space telescope imaging spectrograph(stis) aboard the \emph{hubble space telescope} (hst), we have obtainedspatially resolved spectra of 20 ultracool dwarfs. 18 of them belong to 9 knownvery low-mass binary systems with angular separations in the range 0.37-0.098arcseconds. we have derived spectral types in the range dm7.5 to dl6 from thepc3 index, and by comparing our stis spectra with ground-based spectra ofsimilar spectral resolution from mart{\'\i}n et al. (1999). we have searchedfor h$_\alpha$ emission in each object but it was clearly detected in only 2 ofthem. we find that the distribution of h$_\alpha$ emission in our sample isstatistically different from that of single field dwarfs, suggesting anintriguing anticorrelation between chromospheric activity and binarity form7--m9.5 dwarfs. we provide measuments of the strength of the main photosphericfeatures and the pc3 index, and we derive calibrations of spectral subclassesversus f814w and k-band absolute magnitudes for a subset of 10 dwarfs in 5binaries that have known trigonometric parallaxes.

0906.4145	imaging search for the unseen companion to eps ind a -- improving the  detection limits with 4 micron observations	eps ind a is one of the nearest sun-like stars, located only 3.6 pc away. itis known to host a binary brown dwarf companion, eps ind ba/bb, at a largeprojected separation of 6.7", but radial velocity measurements imply that anadditional, yet unseen component is present in the system, much closer to epsind a. previous direct imaging has excluded the presence of any stellar orhigh-mass brown dwarf companion at small separations, indicating that theunseen companion may be a low-mass brown dwarf or high-mass planet. we presentthe results of a deep high-contrast imaging search for the companion, usingactive angular differential imaging (aadi) at 4 micron, a particularly powerfultechnique for planet searches around nearby and relatively old stars. we alsodevelop an additional psf reference subtraction scheme based on locallyoptimized combination of images (loci) to further enhance the detection limits.no companion is seen in the images, although we are sensitive to significantlylower masses than previously achieved. combining the imaging data with theknown radial velocity trend, we constrain the properties of the companion towithin approximately 5-20 mjup, 10-20 au, and i &gt; 20 deg, unless it is anexotic stellar remnant. the results also imply that the system is probablyolder than the frequently assumed age of ~1 gyr.

1005.5162	imaging of a transitional disk gap in reflected light: indications of  planet formation around the young solar analog lkca 15	we present h- and ks-band imaging data resolving the gap in the transitionaldisk around lkca 15, revealing the surrounding nebulosity. we detect sharpelliptical contours delimiting the nebulosity on the inside as well as theoutside, consistent with the shape, size, ellipticity, and orientation ofstarlight reflected from the far-side disk wall, whereas the near-side wall isshielded from view by the disk's optically thick bulk. we note thatforward-scattering of starlight on the near-side disk surface could provide analternate interpretation of the nebulosity. in either case, this discoveryprovides confirmation of the disk geometry that has been proposed to explainthe spectral energy distributions (sed) of such systems, comprising anoptically thick outer disk with an inner truncation radius of ~46 au enclosinga largely evacuated gap. our data show an offset of the nebulosity contoursalong the major axis, likely corresponding to a physical pericenter offset ofthe disk gap. this reinforces the leading theory that dynamical clearing by atleast one orbiting body is the cause of the gap. based on evolutionary models,our high-contrast imagery imposes an upper limit of 21 jupiter masses oncompanions at separations outside of 0.1" and of 13 jupiter masses outside of0.2". thus, we find that a planetary system around lkca 15 is the most likelyexplanation for the disk architecture.

1006.2377	lucky imaging survey for southern m dwarf binaries	while m dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the milky way, there is stilllarge uncertainty about their basic physical properties (mass, luminosity,radius, etc.) as well as their formation environment. precise knowledge ofmultiplicity characteristics and how they change in this transitional massregion, between sun-like stars on the one side and very low mass stars andbrown dwarfs on the other, provide constraints on low mass star and brown dwarfformation. in the largest m dwarf binary survey to date, we search forcompanions to active, and thus preferentially young, m dwarfs in the solarneighbourhood. we study their binary/multiple properties, such as themultiplicity frequency and distributions of mass ratio and separation, andidentify short period visual binaries, for which orbital parameters and hencedynamical mass estimates can be derived in the near future. the observationsare carried out in the sdss i' and z' band using the lucky imaging cameraastralux sur at the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope. in the first part ofthe survey, we observed 124 m dwarfs of integrated spectral types m0-m6 andidentified 34 new and 17 previously known companions to 44 stars. we derivedrelative astrometry and component photometry for these systems. more than halfof the binaries have separations smaller than 1 arcsec and would have beenmissed in a simply seeing-limited survey. correcting our sample for selectioneffects yields a multiplicity fraction of 32+/-6% for 108 m dwarfs within 52 pcand with angular separations of 0.1-6.0 arcsec, corresponding to projectedseparation 3-180 au at median distance 30 pc. compared to early-type m dwarfs(m&gt;0.3m_sun), later type (and hence lower mass) m dwarf binaries appear to havecloser separations, and more similar masses.

1007.1765	the fringe detection laser metrology for the gravity interferometer at  the vlti	interferometric measurements of optical path length differences of stars overlarge baselines can deliver extremely accurate astrometric data. theinterferometer gravity will simultaneously measure two objects in the field ofview of the very large telescope interferometer (vlti) of the european southernobservatory (eso) and determine their angular separation to a precision of 10micro arcseconds in only 5 minutes. to perform the astrometric measurement withsuch a high accuracy, the differential path length through the vlti and theinstrument has to be measured (and tracked since earth's rotation willpermanently change it) by a laser metrology to an even higher level of accuracy(corresponding to 1 nm in 3 minutes). usually, heterodyne differential pathtechniques are used for nanometer precision measurements, but with thesemethods it is difficult to track the full beam size and to follow the lightpath up to the primary mirror of the telescope. here, we present thepreliminary design of a differential path metrology system, developed withinthe gravity project. it measures the instrumental differential path over thefull pupil size and up to the entrance pupil location. the differential phaseis measured by detecting the laser fringe pattern both on the telescopes'secondary mirrors as well as after reflection at the primary mirror. based onour proposed design we evaluate the phase measurement accuracy based on a fullbudget of possible statistical and systematic errors. we show that thismetrology design fulfills the high precision requirement of gravity.

1009.1872	the search for planetary mass companions to field brown dwarfs with  hst/nicmos	we present the results of a high-resolution spectral differential imagingsurvey of 12 nearby, relatively young field l dwarfs (&lt;1 gyr) carried out withhst/nicmos to search for planetary mass companions at small physicalseparations from their host. the survey resolved two brown dwarf binaries: thel dwarf system kelu-1ab and the newly discovered l/t transition system 2massj031059+164815ab. for both systems common proper motion has already beenconfirmed in follow-up observations which have been published elsewhere. thederived separations of the binaries are smaller than 6 au and consistent withprevious brown dwarf binary statistics. their mass ratios of q &gt; 0.8 confirmthe preference for equal mass systems similar to a large number of othersurveys. furthermore, we found tentative evidence for a companion to the l4dwarf 2mass w033703-175807, straddling the brown dwarf/planetary mass boundaryand revealing an uncommonly low mass ratio system (q ~ 0.2) compared to thevast majority of previously found brown dwarf binaries. with a derived minimummass of 10 - 15 mjup, a planetary nature of the secondary cannot be ruled outyet. however, it seems more likely to be a very low mass brown dwarf secondaryat the border of the spectral t/y transition regime, primarily due to itssimilarities to recently found very cool t dwarfs. this would make it one ofthe closest resolved brown dwarf binaries (0.087" $/pm$ 0.015", correspondingto 2.52 $\pm$ 0.44 au at a distance of 29 pc) with the coolest (teff ~ 600-630k) and least massive companion to any l or t dwarf.

1101.3221	infrared narrow-band tomography of the local starburst ngc 1569 with  lbt/lucifer	we used the near-ir imager/spectrograph lucifer mounted on the largebinocular telescope (lbt) to image, with sub-arcsec seeing, the local dwarfstarburst ngc 1569 in the jhk bands and hei 1.08 micron, [feii] 1.64 micron andbrgamma narrow-band filters. we obtained high-quality spatial maps of hei,[feii] and brgamma emission across the galaxy, and used them together withhst/acs images of ngc 1569 in the halpha filter to derive the two-dimensionalspatial map of the dust extinction and surface star formation rate density. weshow that dust extinction is rather patchy and, on average, higher in thenorth-west (nw) portion of the galaxy [e_g(b-v) = 0.71 mag] than in thesouth-east [e_g(b-v) = 0.57 mag]. similarly, the surface density of starformation rate peaks in the nw region of ngc 1569, reaching a value of about 4x 10^-6 m_sun yr^-1 pc^-2. the total star formation rate as estimated from theintegrated, dereddened halpha luminosity is about 0.4 m_sun yr^-1, and thetotal supernova rate from the integrated, dereddened [feii] luminosity is about0.005 yr^-1 (assuming a distance of 3.36 mpc). the azimuthally averaged[feii]/brgamma flux ratio is larger at the edges of the central, gas-deficientcavities (encompassing the super star clusters a and b) and in the galaxyoutskirts. if we interpret this line ratio as the ratio between the averagepast star formation (as traced by supernovae) and on-going activity(represented by ob stars able to ionize the interstellar medium), it would thenindicate that star formation has been quenched within the central cavities andlately triggered in a ring around them. the number of ionizing hydrogen andhelium photons as computed from the integrated, dereddened halpha and heiluminosities suggests that the latest burst of star formation occurred about 4myr ago and produced new stars with a total mass of ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun.[abridged]

1203.1612	the missing cavities in the seeds polarized scattered light images of  transitional protoplanetary disks: a generic disk model	transitional circumstellar disks around young stellar objects have adistinctive infrared deficit around 10 microns in their spectral energydistributions (sed), recently measured by the spitzer infrared spectrograph(irs), suggesting dust depletion in the inner regions. these disks have beenconfirmed to have giant central cavities by imaging of the submillimeter(sub-mm) continuum emission using the submillimeter array (sma). however, thepolarized near-infrared scattered light images for most objects in a systematicirs/sma cross sample, obtained by hiciao on the subaru telescope, show noevidence for the cavity, in clear contrast with sma and spitzer observations.radiative transfer modeling indicates that many of these scattered light imagesare consistent with a smooth spatial distribution for micron-sized grains, withlittle discontinuity in the surface density of the micron-sized grains at thecavity edge. here we present a generic disk model that can simultaneouslyaccount for the general features in irs, sma, and subaru observations.particularly, the scattered light images for this model are computed, whichagree with the general trend seen in subaru data. decoupling between thespatial distributions of the micron-sized dust and mm-sized dust inside thecavity is suggested by the model, which, if confirmed, necessitates amechanism, such as dust filtration, for differentiating the small and big dustin the cavity clearing process. our model also suggests an inwardly increasinggas-to-dust-ratio in the inner disk, and different spatial distributions forthe small dust inside and outside the cavity, echoing the predictions in graincoagulation and growth models.

1205.3159	high-contrast nir polarization imaging of mwc480	one of the key predictions of modeling from the ir excess of herbig ae starsis that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settlinghas occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partiallyor largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimationradius. when the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expectedto be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scaleheight of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.high-contrast imaging combined with the ir spectral energy distribution allowus to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine theproperties of the outer disk. we present polarimetric differential imaging in$h$ band obtained with subaru/hiciao of one such system, mwc 480. the hiciaodata were obtained at a historic minimum of the nir excess. the disk isdetected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137au). together withthe marginal detection of the disk from 1998 february 24 by hst/nicmos, ourdata constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. when compared with similar measures in co forthe gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of thegas disk scale height (h/r$\sim$0.03). such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giantplanets have formed.

1211.3284	subaru imaging of asymmetric features in a transitional disk in upper  scorpius	we report high-resolution (0.07 arcsec) near-infrared polarized intensityimages of the circumstellar disk around the star 2mass j16042165-2130284obtained with hiciao mounted on the subaru 8.2 m telescope. we present our$h$-band data, which clearly exhibits a resolved, face-on disk with a largeinner hole for the first time at infrared wavelengths. we detect thecentrosymmetric polarization pattern in the circumstellar material as has beenobserved in other disks. elliptical fitting gives the semimajor axis, semiminoraxis, and position angle (p.a.) of the disk as 63 au, 62 au, and -14$^{\circ}$, respectively. the disk is asymmetric, with one dip located at p.a.sof $\sim85^{\circ}$. our observed disk size agrees well with a previous studyof dust and co emission at submillimeter wavelength with submillimeter array.hence, the near-infrared light is interpreted as scattered light reflected fromthe inner edge of the disk. our observations also detect an elongated arc (50au) extending over the disk inner hole. it emanates at the inner edge of thewestern side of the disk, extending inward first, then curving to thenortheast. we discuss the possibility that the inner hole, the dip, and the arcthat we have observed may be related to the existence of unseen bodies withinthe disk.

1211.3744	direct imaging discovery of a `super-jupiter' around the late b-type  star kappa and	we present the direct imaging discovery of an extrasolar planet, or possiblelow-mass brown dwarf, at a projected separation of 55 +/- 2 au (1.058 +/- 0.007arcsec) from the b9-type star kappa and. the planet was detected withsubaru/hiciao during the seeds survey, and confirmed as a bound companion viacommon proper motion measurements. observed near-infrared magnitudes of j =16.3 +/- 0.3, h = 15.2 +/- 0.2, ks = 14.6 +/- 0.4, and l' = 13.12 +/- 0.09indicate a temperature of ~1700 k. the galactic kinematics of the host star areconsistent with membership in the columba association, implying a correspondingage of 30 +20 -10 myr. the system age, combined with the companion photometry,points to a model-dependent companion mass ~12.8 mjup. the host star'sestimated mass of 2.4-2.5 msun places it among the most massive stars everknown to harbor an extrasolar planet or low-mass brown dwarf. while the mass ofthe companion is close to the deuterium burning limit, its mass ratio, orbitalseparation, and likely planet-like formation scenario imply that it may be bestdefined as a `super-jupiter' with properties similar to other recentlydiscovered companions to massive stars.

1307.2886	direct imaging of a cold jovian exoplanet in orbit around the sun-like  star gj 504	several exoplanets have recently been imaged at wide separations of &gt;10 aufrom their parent stars. these span a limited range of ages (&lt;50 myr) andatmospheric properties, with temperatures of 800--1800 k and very red colors (j- h &gt; 0.5 mag), implying thick cloud covers. furthermore, substantial modeluncertainties exist at these young ages due to the unknown initial conditionsat formation, which can lead to an order of magnitude of uncertainty in themodeled planet mass. here, we report the direct imaging discovery of a jovianexoplanet around the sun-like star gj 504, detected as part of the seedssurvey. the system is older than all other known directly-imaged planets; as aresult, its estimated mass remains in the planetary regime independent ofuncertainties related to choices of initial conditions in the exoplanetmodeling. using the most common exoplanet cooling model, and given the systemage of 160 [+350, -60] myr, gj 504 b has an estimated mass of 4 [+4.5, -1.0]jupiter masses, among the lowest of directly imaged planets. its projectedseparation of 43.5 au exceeds the typical outer boundary of ~30 au predictedfor the core accretion mechanism. gj 504 b is also significantly cooler (510[+30, -20] k) and has a bluer color (j-h = -0.23 mag) than previously imagedexoplanets, suggesting a largely cloud-free atmosphere accessible tospectroscopic characterization. thus, it has the potential of providing novelinsights into the origins of giant planets, as well as their atmosphericproperties.

1501.04738	the gravity metrology system: narrow-angle astrometry via phase-shifting  interferometry	the vlti instrument gravity will provide very powerful astrometry bycombining the light from four telescopes for two objects simultaneously. itwill measure the angular separation between the two astronomical objects to aprecision of 10 microarcseconds. this corresponds to a differential opticalpath difference (dopd) between the targets of few nanometers and the pathswithin the interferometer have to be maintained stable to that level. for thispurpose, the novel metrology system of gravity will monitor the internal dopdsby means of phase-shifting interferometry. we present the four-stepphase-shifting concept of the metrology with emphasis on the method used forcalibrating the phase shifts. the latter is based on a phase-step insensitivealgorithm which unambiguously extracts phases in contrast to other methods thatare strongly limited by non-linearities of the phase-shifting device. the mainconstraint of this algorithm is to introduce a robust ellipse fitting routine.via this approach we are able to measure phase shifts in the laboratory with atypical accuracy of lambda/2000 or 1 nanometer of the metrology wavelength.

astro-ph;0005048	timescales of disk evolution and planet formation	we present high-spatial resolution hst and adaptive optics observations, andhigh-sensitivity iso (isocam &amp; isophot) observations of a sample of x-rayselected weak-line (wtts) and post (ptts) t tauri stars located in the nearbychamaeleon t and scorpius-centaurus ob associations. hst/nicmos and adaptiveoptics observations aimed at identifying substellar companions at separations&gt;=30 a.u. from the primary stars. no such objects were found within 300 a.u. ofany of the target stars, and a number of faint objects at larger separationscan very likely be attributed to a population of background stars. isocamobservations of 5 to 15 myr old wtts and ptts in scocen reveal infraredexcesses which are clearly above photospheric levels, and which have a spectralindex intermediate between that of younger (1 to 5 myr) t tauri stars in chaand that of pure stellar photospheres. the difference in the spectral index ofthe older ptts in scocen compared to the younger classical and wtts in cha canbe attributed to a deficiency of smaller size (0.1 to 1mu) dust grains relativeto larger size (~5mu) dust grains in the disks of the ptts. the lack of smalldust grains is either due to the environment (effect of nearby o stars andsupernova explosions) or due to disk evolution. if the latter is the case, itwould hint that circumstellar disks start to get dust depleted at an agebetween 5 to 15 myr. dust depletion is very likely related to the build-up oflarger particles (ultimately rocks and planetesimals) and thus an indicator forthe onset of the period of planet formation.

astro-ph;0601440	discovery of a very nearby brown dwarf to the sun: a methane rich brown  dwarf companion to the low mass star scr 1845-6357	we present vlt/naco sdi images of the very nearby star scr 1845-6357(hereafter scr 1845). scr 1845 is a recently discovered (hambly et al. 2004)m8.5 star just 3.85 pc from the sun (henry et al. 2006). using the capabilitiesof the unique sdi device, we discovered a substellar companion to scr 1845 at aseparation of 4.5 au (1.170''+-0.003'' on the sky) and fainter by 3.57+-0.057mag in the 1.575 um sdi filter. this substellar companion has an h magnitude of13.16+0.31-0.26 (absolute h magnitude of 15.30+0.31-0.26), making it likely thebrightest mid-t dwarf known. the unique simultaneous differential imager (sdi)consists of 3 narrowband filters placed around the 1.6 um methane absorptionfeature characteristic of t-dwarfs (teff &lt; 1200 k). the flux of the substellarcompanion drops by a factor of 2.7+-0.1 between the sdi f1(1.575 um) filter andthe sdi f3(1.625 um) filter, consistent with strong methane absorption in asubstellar companion. we estimate a spectral type of t5.5+-1 for the companionbased on the strength of this methane break. the chances that this object is abackground t dwarf are vanishing small -- and there is no isolated backgroundt-dwarf in this part of the sky according to 2mass. thus, it is a boundcompanion, hereafter scr 1845-6357b. for an age range of 100 myr - 10 gyr andspectral type range of t4.5-t6.5, we find a mass range of 9 - 65 mjup for scr1845b from the baraffe et al. 2003 cond models. scr 1845ab is the 24th closeststellar system to the sun (at 3.85 pc); the only brown dwarf system closer tothe sun is eps indi ba-bb (at 3.626 pc). in addition, this is the first t-dwarfcompanion discovered around a low mass star.

astro-ph;0606582	the star-forming region ngc 346 in the small magellanic cloud with  hubble space telescope acs observations i. photometry	we present a photometric study of the star-forming region ngc 346 and itssurrounding field in the small magellanic cloud, using data taken with theadvanced camera for surveys (acs) on board the hubble space telescope (hst).the data set contains both short and long exposures for increased dynamicrange, and photometry was performed using the acs module of the stellarphotometry package dolphot. we detected almost 100,000 stars over a magnituderange of v ~ 11 to v ~ 28 mag, including all stellar types from the mostmassive young stars to faint lower main sequence and pre-main sequence stars.we find that this region, which is characterized by a plethora of stellarsystems and interesting objects, is an outstanding example of mixed stellarpopulations. we take into account different features of the color-magnitudediagram of all the detected stars to distinguish the two dominant stellarsystems: the stellar association ngc 346 and the old spherical star cluster bs90. these observations provide a complete stellar sample of a field about 5arcmin x 5 arcmin around the most active star-forming region in this galaxy.considering the importance of these data for various investigations in thearea, we provide the full stellar catalog from our photometry. this paper isthe first part of an ongoing study to investigate in detail the two dominantstellar systems in the area and their surrounding field.

astro-ph;0609187	discovery of a young substellar companion in chamaeleon	during an imaging survey of the chamaeleon i star-forming region with the acsaboard hst, we have discovered a candidate substellar companion to the younglow-mass star chxr 73 (~2 myr, m=0.35 msun). we measure a projected separationof 1.3+/-0.03" for the companion, chxr 73 b, which corresponds to 210 au at thedistance of the cluster. a near-infrared spectrum of this source obtained withcormass at the magellan ii telescope exhibits strong steam absorption thatconfirms its late-type nature (&gt;=m9.5). in addition, the gravity-sensitiveshapes of the h- and k-band continua demonstrate that chxr 73 b is a young,pre-main-sequence object rather than a field star. the probability that chxr73a and b are unrelated members of chamaeleon i is ~0.001. we estimate themasses of chxr 73 b and other known substellar companions in young clusterswith a method that is consistent with the dynamical measurements of theeclipsing binary brown dwarf 2m 0535-0546, which consists of a comparison ofthe bolometric luminosities of the companions to the values predicted by theevolutionary models of chabrier &amp; coworkers and burrows &amp; coworkers. we arriveat mass estimates of 0.003-0.004, 0.024+/-0.012, 0.011+0.01/-0.003, and0.012+0.008/-0.005 msun for 2m 1207-3932 b, gq lup b, dh tau b, and chxr 73 b,respectively. thus, dh tau b and chxr 73 b appear to be the least massivecompanions to stars outside the solar system that have been detected in directimages, and may have masses that are within the range observed for extrasolarplanetary companions (m&lt;=0.015 msun). however, because these two objects (aswell as 2m 1207-3932 b) probably did not form within circumstellar disks aroundtheir primaries, we suggest that they should be viewed as brown dwarfcompanions rather than planets.

astro-ph;9910074	hst/wfpc2 and vlt/isaac observations of proplyds in the giant hii region  ngc 3603	we report the discovery of three proplyd-like structures in the giant hiiregion ngc 3603. the emission nebulae are clearly resolved in narrow-band andbroad-band hst/wfpc2 observations in the optical and broad-band vlt/isaacobservations in the near-infrared. all three nebulae are tadpole shaped, withthe bright ionization front at the head facing the central cluster and afainter ionization front around the tail pointing away from the cluster.typical sizes are 6,000 a.u. x 20,000 a.u. the nebulae share the overallmorphology of the proplyds (``proto planetary disks'') in orion, but are 20 to30 times larger in size. additional faint filaments located between the nebulaeand the central ionizing cluster can be interpreted as bow shocks resultingfrom the interaction of the fast winds from the high-mass stars in the clusterwith the evaporation flow from the proplyds. the striking similarity of thetadpole shaped emission nebulae in ngc 3603 to the proplyds in orion suggeststhat the physical structure of both types of objects might be the same. wepresent 2d radiation hydrodynamical simulations of an externally illuminatedstar-disk-envelope system, which was still in its main accretion phase whenfirst exposed to ionizing radiation from the central cluster. the simulationsreproduce the overall morphology of the proplyds in ngc 3603 very well, butalso indicate that mass-loss rates of up to 10^-5 mo/yr are required in orderto explain the size of the proplyds.

astro-ph;9912500	on the possibility of ground-based direct imaging detection of  extra-solar planets: the case of twa-7	we show that {\em ground-based} direct imaging detection of extra-solarplanets is possible with current technology. as an example, we present evidencefor a possible planetary companion to the young t tauri star1rxsj104230.3$-$334014 (=twa-7), discovered by rosat as a member of the nearbytw hya association. in an hst nicmos f160w image, an object is detected that ismore than 9 mag fainter than twa-7, located $2.445 \pm 0.035^{\prime \prime}$south-east at a position angle of $142.24 \pm 1.34^{\circ}$. one year laterusing the eso-ntt with the sharp speckle camera, we obtained h- and k-banddetections of this faint object at a separation of $2.536 \pm 0.077^{\prime\prime}$ and a position angle of $139.3 \pm 2.1^{\circ}$. given the knownproper motion of twa-7, the pair may form a proper motion pair. if the faintobject orbits twa-7, then its apparent magnitudes of h=$16.42 \pm 0.11$ andk=$16.34 \pm 0.15$ mag yield absolute magnitudes consistent with a $\sim10^{6.5}$ yr old $\sim 3$ m$_{\rm jup}$ mass object according to the non-graytheory by burrows et al. (1997). at $\sim 55$ pc, the angular separation of$\sim 2.5^{\prime \prime}$ corresponds to $\sim 138$~au. however, positionangles and separations are slightly more consistent with a background objectthan with a companion.

0810.0099	binarity at the l/t brown dwarf transition	current atmospheric models cannot reproduce some of the characteristics ofthe transition between the l dwarfs with cloudy atmospheres and the t dwarfswith dust-depleted photospheres. it has been proposed that a majority of thel/t transition brown dwarfs could actually be a combinaison of a cloudy l dwarfand a clear t dwarf. indeed binarity seems to occur more frequently among l/ttransition brown dwarfs.  we aim to refine the statistical significance of the seemingly higherfrequency of binaries. co-eval binaries would also be interesting test-beds forevolutionary models. we obtained high-resolution imaging for six mid-l tolate-t dwarfs, with photometric distances between 8 and 33pc, using theadaptive optics systems naco at the vlt, and the lick system, both with thelaser guide star.  we resolve none of our targets. combining our data with published results, weobtain a frequency of resolved l/t transition brown dwarfs of (31+21-15)%,compared to (21+10-7)% and (14+14-7)% for mid-l and t dwarfs (90% of confidencelevel). these fractions do not significantly support, nor contradict, thehypothesis of a larger binary fraction in the l/t transition. none of ourtargets has companions with effective temperatures as low as 360-1000k atseparations larger than 0.5".

0811.0556	kelu-1 ab - a possible brown dwarf triple system	we have monitored the benchmark l dwarf binary kelu-1ab over the past 3 yearsto derive improved spectral types and luminosities for the individualcomponents. the astrometric measurements enable us to compute the orbitalparameters and result in the first dynamical mass estimate for the system. weobtained resolved high angular resolution, near-ir images with hst and thevlt/naco adaptive optics instrument in the j, h and ks bands. in addition weused naco to achieve the first spatially resolved mid-resolution spectra in theh- and k-band for a precise spectral type determination. the near-ir spectrumof kelu-1a reveals a distinct dip in the h-band providing evidence that kelu-1a itself is a spectroscopic binary. we derive spectral types of l0.5+- 0.5 forkelu- 1 aa and t7.5+-1 for kelu-1 ab. kelu-1b is classified as spectral typel3pec +-1.5. from the relative orbit, we derive an orbital period of 38 +8 -6years and a semi-major axis of 6.4+2.4 -1.3 au. this yields the firstdynamically determined total system mass of 177 +113 -55 mjup for the kelu-1absystem, with the uncertainties mainly attributed to the error of the systemdistance measurement and the yet missing apastron passage. the derivedproperties of kelu-1ab allow us to test common theoretical models. thecomparison of our results with color-magnitude diagrams based on evolutionarymodels yields a slightly revised age estimate (0.3 - 0.5 gyr) and a discrepancybetween dynamically and theoretically derived masses, stressing the importancefor further dynamical mass determinations of brown dwarf binaries.
