0902.2199	swift x-ray and uv monitoring of the classical nova v458 vul (nova vul  2007)	we describe the highly variable x-ray and uv emission of v458 vul (nova vul2007), observed by swift between 1 and 422 days after outburst. initiallybright only in the uv, v458 vul became a variable hard x-ray source due tooptically thin thermal emission at kt=0.64 kev with an x-ray band unabsorbedluminosity of 2.3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} during days 71-140. the x-ray spectrum atthis time requires a low fe abundance (0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.1} solar), consistentwith a suzaku measurement around the same time. on day 315 we find a new x-rayspectral component which can be described by a blackbody with temperature ofkt=23^{+9}_{-5} ev, while the previous hard x-ray component has declined by afactor of 3.8. the spectrum of this soft x-ray component resembles thosetypically seen in the class of supersoft sources (sss) which suggests that thenova ejecta were starting to clear and/or that the wd photosphere is shrinkingto the point at which its thermal emission reaches into the x-ray band. we finda high degree of variability in the soft component with a flare rising by anorder of magnitude in count rate in 0.2 days. in the following observations ondays 342.4-383.6, the soft component was not seen, only to emerge again on day397. the hard component continued to evolve, and we found an anticorrelationbetween the hard x-ray emission and the uv emission, yielding a spearman rankprobability of 97%. after day 397, the hard component was still present, wasvariable, and continued to fade at an extremely slow rate but could not beanalysed owing to pile up contamination from the bright sss component.

0905.1945	on the effect of magnetic spots on stellar winds and angular momentum  loss	we simulate the effect of latitudinal variations in the location of starspots, as well as their magnetic field strength, on stellar angular momentumloss to the stellar wind. we use the michigan solar corona globalmagnetohydrodynamic model, which incorporates realistic relation between themagnetic field topology and the wind distribution. we find that the spotslocation significantly affects the stellar wind structure, and as a result, thetotal mass loss rate and angular momentum loss rate. in particular, we findthat the angular momentum loss rate is controlled by the mass flux when spotsare located at low latitudes but is controlled by an increased plasma densitybetween the stellar surface and the alfven surface when spots are located athigh latitudes. our results suggest that there might be a feedback mechanismbetween the magnetic field distribution, wind distribution, angular momentumloss through the wind, and the motions at the convection zone that generate themagnetic field. this feedback might explain the role of coronal magnetic fieldsin stellar dynamos.

0906.5222	hard x-ray flux from low-mass stars in the cygnus ob2 association	context. the cygnus ob2 association, the central engine of the cygnus xstar-forming region, is the subject of an extensive integral key project thatwill accumulate 6ms of observations. analysis of 2ms of observations by debecker and co-workers provides the most sensitive limit yet obtained on hardx-ray emission from the cluster. aims. we investigate the x-ray emission in the20-40 kev band expected from the flaring low-mass stellar population in cygnusob2. we discuss whether such emission needs to be considered in theinterpretation of existing and future x-ray observations of the region, andwhether such observations might provide insight into the high-energy processeson low-mass pre-main sequence stars. methods. the total hard x-ray flux fromlow-mass stars is estimated by assuming the observed soft x-ray emission stemsfrom a superposition of flares. we further assume the ratio of hard x-ray tosoft x-ray emission is described by a scaling found for solar flares by isolaand co-workers. results. we estimate the low-mass stellar hard x-ray flux inthe 20-40 kev band to lie in the range ~2x10^31-6x10^32 erg/s and discuss somepotential biases that might affect this result. conclusions. hard x-rayemission could lie at a level not much below the current observed flux upperlimits for cygnus ob2. if this emission could be detected, it would provideinsight into the hard x-ray production of large flares on pre-main sequencestars. we highlight the penetrating power of hard x-rays from low-mass stellarpopulations as a possible pointer to our galaxy's hidden star-forming clustersand super-clusters using more sensitive observations from future missions.

0908.0468	the interactions of winds from massive young stellar objects: x-ray  emission, dynamics, and cavity evolution	2d axis-symmetric hydrodynamical simulations are presented which explore theinteraction of stellar and disk winds with surrounding infalling cloudmaterial. the star, and its accompanying disk, blow winds inside a cavitycleared out by an earlier jet. the collision of the winds with theirsurroundings generates shock heated plasma which reaches temperatures up to~10^8 k. attenuated x-ray spectra are calculated from solving the equation ofradiative transfer along lines-of-sight. this process is repeated at variousepochs throughout the simulations to examine the evolution of the intrinsic andattenuated flux. we find that the dynamic nature of the wind-cavity interactionfuels intrinsic variability in the observed emission on timescales of severalhundred years. this is principally due to variations in the position of thereverse shock which is influenced by changes in the shape of the cavity wall.the collision of the winds with the cavity wall can cause clumps of cloudmaterial to be stripped away. mixing of these clumps into the winds mass-loadsthe flow and enhances the x-ray emission measure. the position and shape of thereverse shock plays a key role in determining the strength and hardness of thex-ray emission. in some models the reverse shock is oblique to much of thestellar and disk outflows, whereas in others it is closely normal over a widerange of polar angles. for reasonable stellar and disk wind parameters theintegrated count rate and spatial extent of the intensity peak for x-rayemission agree with \textit{chandra} observations of the deeply embedded mysoss106 irs4, mon r2 irs3 a, and afgl 2591.(abridged)

0909.0218	x-ray optical depth diagnostics of t tauri accretion shocks	in classical t tauri stars, x-rays are produced by two plasma components: ahot low-density plasma, with frequent flaring activity, and a high-densitylower temperature plasma. the former is coronal plasma related to the stellarmagnetic activity. the latter component, never observed in non-accreting stars,could be plasma heated by the shock formed by the accretion process. howeverits nature is still being debated. our aim is to probe the soft x-ray emissionfrom the high-density plasma component in classical t tauri stars to checkwhether this is plasma heated in the accretion shock or whether it is coronalplasma. high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy allows us to measure individual linefluxes. we analyze x-ray spectra of the classical t tauri stars mp muscae andtw hydrae. our aim is to evaluate line ratios to search for optical deptheffects, which are expected in the accretion-driven scenario. we also derivethe plasma emission measure distributions emd, to investigate whether and howthe emd of accreting and non accreting young stars differ. the results arecompared to those obtained for the non-accreting weak-line t tauri star twa 5.we find evidence of resonance scattering in the strongest lines of mp mus,supporting the idea that soft x-rays are produced by plasma heated in theaccretion shock. we also find that the emd of mp mus has two peaks: a cool peakat temperatures expected for plasma heated in the accretion shock, and a hotpeak typical of coronal plasma. the shape of the emd of mp mus appears to bethe superposition of the emd of a pure coronal source, like twa 5, and an emdalike that of tw hydrae, which is instead dominated by shock-heated plasma.

0909.3093	interactions of the magnetospheres of stars and close-in giant planets	since the first discovery of an extrasolar planetary system more than adecade ago, hundreds more have been discovered. surprisingly, many of thesesystems harbor jupiter-class gas giants located close to the central star, atdistances of 0.1 au or less. observations of chromospheric 'hot spots' thatrotate in phase with the planetary orbit, and elevated stellar x-rayluminosities,suggest that these close-in planets significantly affect thestructure of the outer atmosphere of the star through interactions between thestellar magnetic field and the planetary magnetosphere. here we carry out thefirst detailed three-dimensional magnetohydrohynamics (mhd) simulationcontaining the two magnetic bodies and explore the consequences of suchinteractions on the steady-state coronal structure. the simulations reproducethe observable features of 1) increase in the total x-ray luminosity, 2)appearance of coronal hot spots, and 3) phase shift of these spots with respectto the direction of the planet. the proximate cause of these is an increase inthe density of coronal plasma in the direction of the planet, which preventsthe corona from expanding and leaking away this plasma via a stellar wind. thesimulations produce significant low temperature heating. by including dynamicaleffects, such as the planetary orbital motion, the simulation should betterreproduce the observed coronal heating.

1007.4320	the coronal structure of ab doradus	we perform a numerical simulation of the corona of the young, rapidlyrotating k0 dwarf ab doradus using a global mhd model. the model is driven by asurface map of the radial magnetic field constructed using zeeman-dopplerimaging. we find that the global structure of the stellar corona is dominatedby strong azimuthal tangling of the magnetic field due to the rapid rotation.the mhd solution enables us to calculate realistic alfv\'en surfaces and we cantherefore estimate the stellar mass loss rate and angular momentum loss ratewithout making undue theoretical simplifications. we consider three cases,parametrized by the base density of the corona, that span the range of possiblesolutions for the system. we find that overall, the mass and angular-momentumloss rates are higher than in the solar case; the mass loss rates are 10 to 500times higher, and the angular momentum loss rate can be up to $3\times{10}^4$higher than present day solar values. our simulations show that this model canbe use to constrain the wide parameter space of stellar systems. it also showsthat an mhd approach can provide more information about the physical systemover the commonly used potential field extrapolation.

1011.3295	identification of a population of x-ray emitting massive stars in the  galactic plane	we present x-ray, infrared, optical and radio observations of four previouslyunidentified galactic plane x-ray sources, ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, axj144701-5919 and ax j144547-5931. detection of each source with the chandrax-ray observatory has provided sub-arcsecond localizations, which we use toidentify bright infrared counterparts to all four objects. infrared and opticalspectroscopy of these counterparts demonstrate that all four x-ray sources areextremely massive stars, with spectral classifications ofpe/wn9 (axj163252-4746), wn7 (ax j184738-0156 = wr121a), wn7-8h (ax j144701-5919) andoif+ (ax j144547-5931). ax j163252-4746 and ax j184738-0156 are both luminous,hard, x-ray emitters with strong fe xxv emission lines in their x-ray spectraat ~6.7 kev. the multi-wavelength properties of ax j163252-4746 and axj184738-0156 are not consistent with isolated massive stars or accretion onto acompact companion; we conclude that their x-ray emission is most likelygenerated in a colliding-wind binary system. for both ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931, the x-ray emission is an order of magnitude less luminous andwith a softer spectrum. these properties are consistent with a colliding-windbinary interpretation for these two sources also, but other mechanisms for thegeneration of x-rays cannot be excluded. there are many other as yetunidentified x-ray sources in the galactic plane, with x-ray properties similarto those seen for ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931. this may indicate a substantial population of x-ray-emittingmassive stars and colliding-wind binaries in the milky way.

(b) on day 29, no such emission line wasfound. (c) on day 40, the 6.7 kev emission line emerged again. (d) on days 50and 60-150, three emission lines at 6.4, 6.7, and 7.0 kev respectively fromquasi-neutral fe, fe xxv, and fe xxvi were found. statistically significantchanges of the fe k line intensities were confirmed between day 29 and 50.based on these phenomena, we conclude that (1) the post-nova evolution can bedivided into two different phases, (2) ejecta is responsible for the x-rayemission in the earlier phase, while rekindled accretion is for the laterphase, and (3) the accretion process is considered to be reestablished as earlyas day 50 when the quasi-neutral fe emission line emerged, which is a commonsignature of accretion from magnetic cataclysmic variables.

1105.2717	from x-ray dips to eclipse: witnessing disk reformation in the recurrent  nova usco	the 10th recorded outburst of the recurrent eclipsing nova usco was observedsimultaneously in x-ray, uv, and optical by xmm-newton on days 22.9 and 34.9after outburst. two full passages of the companion in front of the nova ejectawere observed, witnessing the reformation of the accretion disk. on day 22.9,we observed smooth eclipses in uv and optical but deep dips in the x-ray lightcurve which disappeared by day 34.9, then yielding clean eclipses in all bands.x-ray dips can be caused by clumpy absorbing material that intersects the lineof sight while moving along highly elliptical trajectories. cold material fromthe companion could explain the absence of dips in uv and optical light. thedisappearance of x-ray dips before day 34.9 implies significant progress in theformation of the disk. the x-ray spectra contain photospheric continuumemission plus strong emission lines, but no clear absorption lines. bothcontinuum and emission lines in the x-ray spectra indicate a temperatureincrease from day 22.9 to day 34.9. we find clear evidence in the spectra andlight curves for thompson scattering of the photospheric emission from thewhite dwarf. photospheric absorption lines can be smeared out during scatteringin a plasma of fast electrons. we also find spectral signatures of resonantline scattering that lead to the observation of the strong emission lines.their dominance could be a general phenomenon in high-inclination systems suchas cal87.

1108.0828	multi-wavelength study of the 2008-2009 outburst of v1647 ori	v1647 ori is a young eruptive variable star, illuminating a reflection nebula(mcneil's nebula). it underwent an outburst in 2003 before fading back to itspre-outburst brightness in 2006. in 2008, v1647 ori underwent a new outburst.the observed properties of the 2003-2006 event are different in severalrespects from both the exor and fuor type outbursts, and suggest that this starmight represent a new class of eruptive young stars, younger and more deeplyembedded than exors, and exhibiting variations on shorter time scales thanfuors. in outburst, the star lights up the otherwise invisible mcneil's nebular- a conical cloud likely accumulated from previous outbursts. we presentfollow-up photometric as well as optical and near-ir spectroscopy of the nebulaobtainted during the 2008-2009 outburst. we will also present results fromcontemporaneous x-ray observations. these multi-wavelength observations ofv1647 ori, obtained at this key early stage of the outburst, provide a snapshotof the "lighting up" of the nebula, probe its evolution through the event, andenable comparison with the 2003-2006 outburst.

1109.3661	neon insights from old solar x-rays: a plasma temperature dependence of  the coronal neon content	an analysis using modern atomic data of fluxes culled from the literature foro viii and ne ix lines observed in solar active regions by the p78 and solarmaximum mission satellites confirms that the coronal ne/o abundance ratiovaries by a factor of two or more, and finds an increase in ne/o withincreasing active region plasma temperature. the latter is reminiscent ofevidence for increasing ne/o with stellar activity in low-activity coronae thatreaches a "neon saturation" in moderately active stars at approximately twicethe historically accepted solar value of about 0.15 by number. we argue thatneon saturation represents the underlying stellar photospheric compositions,and that low activity coronae, including that of the sun, are generallydepleted in neon. the implication would be that the solar ne/o abundance ratioshould be revised upward by a factor of about two to n(ne)/n(o)~0.3. diverseobservations of neon in the local cosmos provide some support for such arevision. neon would still be of some relevance for reconciling helioseismologywith solar models computed using recently advocated chemical mixtures withlower metal content.

1109.5024	modeling the 2010 blast wave of the symbiotic-like nova v407 cygni	(abridged) the symbiotic-like binary mira and nova v407 cyg was observed inoutburst on march 2010 and monitored in several wavelength bands. here wereport on multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations describing the 2010outburst of v407 cyg, exploring the first 60 days of evolution. the model takesinto account thermal conduction and radiative cooling; the pre-explosion systemconditions included the companion star and a circumbinary density enhancement.the simulations showed that the blast and the ejecta distribution are bothaspherical due to the inhomogeneous circumstellar medium in which they expand;in particular they are significantly collimated in polar directions (producinga bipolar shock morphology) if the circumstellar envelope is characterized byan equatorial density enhancement. the blast is partially shielded by the miracompanion, producing a wake with dense and hot post-shock plasma on the rearside of the companion star; most of the x-ray emission produced during theevolution of the blast arises from this plasma structure. the observed x-raylightcurve can be reproduced, assuming values of outburst energy and ejectedmass similar to those of rs oph and u sco, if a circumbinary gas densityenhancement is included in the model. in this case, the 2010 blast propagatedthrough a circumbinary gas density enhancement with radius of the order of 40au and gas density \approx 10^6 cm^{-3} and the mass of ejecta in the outburstwas m_{ej} \approx 2\times 10^{-7} m_{\odot} with an explosion energy e_{0}\approx 2\times 10^{44} erg. alternatively, the model can produce a similarx-ray lightcurve without the need of a circumbinary gas density enhancementonly if the outburst energy and ejected mass were similar to those at the upperend of ranges for classical novae, namely m_{ej} \approx 5\times 10^{-5}m_{\odot} and e_{0} \approx 5\times 10^{46} erg.

1201.0998	the role of white dwarfs in cataclysmic variable spin-down	we study the effect of a white dwarf on the spin-down of a cataclysmicvariable system using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical model.the model includes the stellar corona, the stellar wind, and the wd mass andmagnetic field. the existence of the wd modifies the system spin-down byphysically blocking the stellar wind, restructuring the wind, channeling thewind towards the wd surface, and by modifying the shape and size of thealfv\'en surface. the combination of these processes differs among a set ofsimple test cases, and the resulting angular momentum loss rates vary byfactors of 2-3, and by factors of two relative to a test model with a single mdwarf. while the model employs some simplifications, the results suggestangular momentum loss schemes currently employed in cataclysmic variablestudies do not require drastic revision. insights are also gained on windaccretion. we find that efficient accretion switches on quite rapidly withdecreasing orbital separation. accretion rates depend on magnetic fieldalignment and should be modulated by magnetic cycles on the m dwarf. forparticular values of white dwarf magnetic field strength, an efficientsyphoning of coronal plasma from the inward facing m dwarf hemisphere occurs.wind accretion rates are expected to vary by factors of 10 or more betweenfairly similar close binaries, depending on magnetic field strengths andorbital separation.

1205.2111	chandra/acis-i study of the x-ray properties of the ngc 6611 and m16  stellar population	mechanisms regulating the origin of x-rays in ysos and the correlation withtheir evolutionary stage are under debate. studies of the x-ray properties inyoung clusters allow to understand these mechanisms. one ideal target for thisanalysis is the eagle nebula (m16), with its central cluster ngc6611. at 1750pc from the sun, it harbors 93 ob stars, together with a population of low-massstars from embedded protostars to disk-less class iii objects, with age &lt;=3myrs. we study an archival 78 ksec chandra/acis-i observation of ngc6611, andtwo new 80ksec observations of the outer region of m16, one centered on thecolumn v, and one on a region of the molecular cloud with ongoingstar-formation. we detect 1755 point sources, with 1183 candidate clustermembers (219 disk-bearing and 964 disk-less). we study the global x-rayproperties of m16 and compare them with those of the orion nebula cluster. wealso compare the level of x-ray emission of class ii and class iii stars, andanalyze the x-ray spectral properties of ob stars. our study supports the lowerlevel of x-ray activity for the disk-bearing stars with respect to thedisk-less members. the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of m16 is similar tothat of orion, supporting the universality of the xlf in young clusters. 85% ofthe o stars of ngc6611 have been detected in x-rays. with only one possibleexception, they show soft spectra with no hard component, indicating thatmechanisms for the production of hard x-ray emission in o stars are notoperating in ngc 6611.

1208.6296	optical photometric gtc/osiris observations of the young massive  association cygnus ob2	in order to fully understand the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds,the star formation process and the evolution of circumstellar disks, thesephenomena must be studied in different galactic environments with a range ofstellar contents and positions in the galaxy. the young massive associationcygnus ob2, in the cygnus-x region, is an unique target to study how starformation and the evolution of circumstellar disks proceed in the presence of alarge number of massive stars. we present a catalog obtained with recentoptical observations in r,i,z filters with osiris, mounted on the $10.4\,m$ gtctelescope, which is the deepest optical catalog of cyg ob2 to date.  the catalog consist of 64157 sources down to m=0.15 solar masses at theadopted distance and age of cyg ob2. a total of 38300 sources have goodphotometry in all three bands. we combined the optical catalog with existingx-ray data of this region, in order to define the cluster locus in the opticaldiagrams. the cluster locus in the r-i vs. i-z diagram is compatible with anextinction of the optically selected cluster members in the 2.64&lt;av&lt;5.57 range.we derive an extinction map of the region, finding a median value of av=4.33 inthe center of the association, decreasing toward the north-west. in thecolor-magnitude diagrams, the shape of the distribution of main sequence starsis compatible with the presence of an obscuring cloud in the foreground atabout 850+/-25 pc from the sun.

1209.5916	the cosmic ray intensity near the archean earth	we employ three-dimensional state of the art magnetohydrodynamic models ofthe early solar wind and heliosphere and a two-dimensional model for cosmic raytransport to investigate the cosmic ray spectrum and flux near the archeanearth. we assess how sensitive the cosmic ray spectrum is to changes in thesunspot placement and magnetic field strength, the large scale dipole magneticfield strength, the wind ram pressure, and the sun's rotation period. overall,our results confirm earlier work that suggested the archean earth would haveexperienced a greatly reduced cosmic ray flux than is the case today. thecosmic ray reduction for the early sun is mainly due to the shorter solarrotation period and tighter winding of the parker spiral, and to the differentsurface distribution of the more active solar magnetic field. these effectslead to a global reduction of the cosmic ray flux at 1au by up to two orders ofmagnitude or more. variations in the sunspot magnetic field have more effect onthe flux than variations in the dipole field component. the wind ram pressureaffects the cosmic ray flux through its influence on the size of theheliosphere via the pressure balance with the ambient interstellar medium.variations in the interstellar medium pressure experienced by the solar systemin orbit through galaxy could lead to order of magnitude changes in the cosmicray flux at earth on timescales of a few million years.

0712.2791	x-ray flaring on the dme star, ross 154	we present results from two chandra imaging observations of ross 154, anearby flaring m dwarf star. during a 61-ks acis-s exposure, a very large flareoccurred (the equivalent of a solar x3400 event, with l_x = 1.8x10^30 ergs/s)in which the count rate increased by a factor of over 100. the early phase ofthe flare shows evidence for the neupert effect, followed by a further rise andthen a two-component exponential decay. a large flare was also observed at theend of a later 48-ks hrc-i observation. emission from the non-flaring phases ofboth observations was analyzed for evidence of low level flaring. from thesetemporal studies we find that microflaring probably accounts for most of the`quiescent' emission, and that, unlike for the sun and the handful of otherstars that have been studied, the distribution of flare intensities does notappear to follow a power-law with a single index. analysis of the acis spectra,which was complicated by exclusion of the heavily piled-up source core,suggests that the quiescent ne/o abundance ratio is enhanced by a factor of~2.5 compared to the commonly adopted solar abundance ratio, and that the ne/oratio and overall coronal metallicity during the flare appear to be enhancedrelative to quiescent abundances. based on the temperatures and emissionmeasures derived from the spectral fits, we estimate the length scales andplasma densities in the flaring volume and also track the evolution of theflare in color-intensity space. lastly, we searched for a stellar-windcharge-exchange x-ray halo around the star but without success; because of therelationship between mass-loss rate and the halo surface brightness, not evenan upper limit on the stellar mass-loss rate can be determined.

1306.5757	the protoplanetary disks in the nearby massive star forming region  cygnus ob2	the formation of stars in massive clusters is one of the main modes of thestar formation process. however, the study of massive star forming regions ishampered by their typically large distances to the sun. one exception to thisis the massive star forming region cygnus ob2 in the cygnus x region, at thedistance of about 1400 pc. cygnus ob2 hosts very rich populations of massiveand low-mass stars, being the best target in our galaxy to study the formationof stars, circumstellar disks, and planets in presence of massive stars. inthis paper we combine a wide and deep set of photometric data, from the r bandto 24 micron, in order to select the disk bearing population of stars in cygnusob2 and identify the class i, class ii, and stars with transition andpre-transition disks. we selected 1843 sources with infrared excesses in anarea of 1 degree x 1 degree centered on cyg ob2 in several evolutionary stages:8.4% class i, 13.1% flat-spectrum sources, 72.9% class ii, 2.3% pre-transitiondisks, and 3.3% transition disks. the spatial distribution of these sourcesshows a central cluster surrounded by a annular overdensity and some clumps ofrecent star formation in the outer region. several candidate subclusters areidentified, both along the overdensity and in the rest of the association.

1309.2604	obscuration effects in super-soft-source x-ray spectra	super-soft-source (sss) x-ray spectra are blackbody-like spectra witheffective temperatures ~3-7x10^5 k and luminosities of 10^{35-38} erg/s. sssgrating spectra display atmospheric absorption lines. radiation transportatmosphere models can be used to derive physical parameters, but moresophisticated models are required. we bypass the complications of spectralmodels and concentrate on the data in a comparative, qualitative study. weinspect all available x-ray grating sss spectra to determine systematic,model-independent trends. we use comparative plots of spectra of differentsystems to find common and different features. the results are interpreted inthe context of system parameters obtained from the literature. we find twodistinct types of sss spectra which we name ssa and sse. their mainobservational characteristics are either clearly visible absorption lines oremission lines, respectively, while both types contain atmospheric continuumemission. sse may be obscured ssa systems, which is supported by similaritiesbetween sse and ssa with obscured and unobscured agn, respectively. further, wefind all known or suspected high-inclination systems to emit permanently in ansse state. some sources are found to transition between ssa and sse states,becoming sse when fainter. sss spectra are subject to various occultationprocesses. in cal 87, the accretion disc blocks the central hot source whenviewed edge on. in novae, the accretion disc may have been destroyed during theinitial explosion but could have reformed by the time of the sss phase. inaddition, clumpy ejecta may lead to temporary obscuration events. the emissionlines originate from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc, its wind orfurther out in clumpy ejecta while thomson scattering allows continuum emissionto be visible also during total obscuration of the central hot source.

1403.1029	the corona of hd 189733 and its x-ray activity	abridged. here we report on the x-ray activity of the primary star, hd189733a, using a new xmm-newton observation and a comparison with the previous x-rayobservations. the spectrum in the quiescent intervals is described by twotemperatures at 0.2 kev and 0.7 kev, while during the flares a third componentat 0.9 kev is detected. we obtain estimates of the electron density in therange $n_e = 1.6 - 13 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and thus the corona of hd189733a appears denser than the solar one. {for the third time, we observe a largeflare that occurred just after the eclipse of the planet. together with theflares observed in 2009 and 2011, the events are restricted to a smallplanetary phase range of $\phi = 0.55-0.65$. although we do not find conclusiveevidence of a significant excess of flares after the secondary transits, wesuggest that the planet might trigger such flares when it passes close tolocally high magnetic field of the underlying star at particular combinationsof stellar rotational phases and orbital planetary phases. for the most recentflares, a wavelet analysis of the light curve suggests a loop of length of fourstellar radii at the location of the bright flare, and a local magnetic fieldof order of 40-100 g, in agreement with the global field measured in otherstudies. the loop size suggests an interaction of magnetic nature betweenplanet and star, separated by only $\sim8 r_*$. we also detect the stellarcompanion (hd 189733 b, $\sim12"$ from the primary star) in this xmmobservation. its very low x-ray luminosity ($l_x = 3.4\times 10^{26}$ ergs$^{-1}$) confirms the old age of this star and of the binary system. the highactivity of the primary star is best explained by a transfer of angularmomentum from the planet to the star.

0705.1206	the sss phase of rs ophiuchi observed with chandra and xmm-newton i.:  data and preliminary modeling	the phase of super-soft-source (sss) emission of the sixth recorded outburstof the recurrent nova rs oph was observed twice with chandra and once withxmm-newton. the observations were taken on days 39.7, 54.0, and 66.9 afteroutburst. we confirm a 35-sec period on day 54.0 and found that it originatesfrom the sss emission and not from the shock. we discus the bound-freeabsorption by neutral elements in the line of sight, resonance absorption linesplus self-absorbed emission line components, collisionally excited emissionlines from the shock, he-like intersystem lines, and spectral changes during anepisode of high-amplitude variability. we find a decrease of the oxygen k-shellabsorption edge that can be explained by photoionization of oxygen. theabsorption component has average velocities of -1286+-267 km/s on day 39.7 andof -771+-65 km/s on day 66.9. the wavelengths of the emission line componentsare consistent with their rest wavelengths as confirmed by measurements ofnon-self absorbed he-like intersystem lines. we have evidence that these linesoriginate from the shock rather than the outer layers of the outflow and may bephotoexcited in addition to collisional excitations. we found collisionallyexcited emission lines that are fading at wavelengths shorter than 15a thatoriginate from the radiatively cooling shock. on day 39.5 we find a systematicblue shift of -526+-114 km/s from these lines. we found anomalous he-like f/iratios which indicates either high densities or significant uv radiation nearthe plasma where the emission lines are formed. during the phase of strongvariability the spectral hardness light curve overlies the total light curvewhen shifted by 1000sec. this can be explained by photoionization of neutraloxygen in the line of sight if the densities of order 10^{10}-10^{11} cm^{-3}.

1405.7707	magnetospheric structure and atmospheric joule heating of habitable  planets orbiting m-dwarf stars	we study the magnetospheric structure and the ionospheric joule heating ofplanets orbiting m-dwarf stars in the habitable zone using a set ofmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) models. the stellar wind solution is used to drive amodel for the planetary magnetosphere, which is coupled with a model for theplanetary ionosphere. our simulations reveal that the space environment aroundclose-in habitable planets is extreme, and the stellar wind plasma conditionschange from sub- to super-alfvenic along the planetary orbit. as a result, themagnetospheric structure changes dramatically with a bow shock forming in thesuper-alfvenic sectors, while no bow shock forms in the sub-alfvenic sectors.the planets reside most of the time in the sub-alfvenic sectors with pooratmospheric protection. a significant amount of joule heating is provided atthe top of the atmosphere as a result of the planetary interaction with thestellar wind. for the steady-state solution, the heating is about 0.1-3\% ofthe total incoming stellar irradiation, and it is enhanced by 50\% for thetime-dependent case. the significant joule heating obtained here should beconsidered in models for the atmospheres of habitable planets in terms of thethickness of the atmosphere, the top-side temperature and density, the boundaryconditions for the atmospheric pressure, and particle radiation and transport.

1503.03181	x-ray fading and expansion in the "miniature supernova remnant" of gk  persei	we report on a second epoch of chandra x-ray imaging spectroscopy of thespatially-resolved old nova remnant gk persei. an acis-s3 observation of 97.4ks was conducted in november 2013 after a lapse of 13.8 years from the lastvisit in 2000. the x-ray emitting nebula appeared more faint and patchycompared with the first epoch. the flux decline was particularly evident infainter regions and the mean decline was 30-40 % in the 0.5-1.2 kev energyband. a typical expansion of the brightest part of the remnant was 1.9 arcsec,which corresponds to an expansion rate of 0.14 arcsec yr^{-1}. the soft x-rayspectra extracted from both the 2000 and 2013 data can be explained by anon-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model convolved with interstellarabsorption, though do not allow us to constrain the origin of the fluxevolution. the plasma temperature has not significantly evolved since the 2000epoch and we conclude that the fading of the x-ray emission is due largely toexpansion. this implies that recent expansion has been into a lower densitymedium, a scenario that is qualitatively consistent with the structure of thecircumstellar environment photographed soon after the initial explosion morethan a century ago. fainter areas are fading more quickly than brighter areas,indicating that they are fainter because of a lower ambient medium density andconsequently more rapid expansion.

1509.04004	swift detection of the super-swift switch-on of the super-soft phase in  nova v745 sco (2014)	v745 sco is a recurrent nova, with the most recent eruption occurring infebruary 2014. v745 sco was first observed by swift a mere 3.7 hr after theannouncement of the optical discovery, with the super-soft x-ray emission beingdetected around four days later and lasting for only ~two days, making it boththe fastest follow-up of a nova by swift and the earliest switch-on ofsuper-soft emission yet detected. such an early switch-on time suggests acombination of a very high velocity outflow and low ejected mass and, togetherwith the high effective temperature reached by the super-soft emission, a highmass white dwarf (&gt;1.3 m_sun). the x-ray spectral evolution was followed froman early epoch where shocked emission was evident, through the entirety of thesuper-soft phase, showing evolving column density, emission lines, absorptionedges and thermal continuum temperature. uv grism data were also obtainedthroughout the super-soft interval, with the spectra showing mainly emissionlines from lower ionization transitions and the balmer continuum in emission.v745 sco is compared with both v2491 cyg (another nova with a very shortsuper-soft phase) and m31n 2008-12a (the most rapidly recurring nova yetdiscovered). the longer recurrence time compared to m31n 2008-12a could be dueto a lower mass accretion rate, although inclination of the system may alsoplay a part. nova v745 sco (2014) revealed the fastest evolving super-softsource phase yet discovered, providing a detailed and informative dataset forstudy.

astro-ph;0012162	structure of the x-ray emission from the jet of 3c 273	we present images from five observations of the quasar 3c 273 with thechandra x-ray observatory. the jet has at least four distinct features whichare not resolved in previous observations. the first knot in the jet (a1) isvery bright in x-rays. its x-ray spectrum is well fitted with a power law withalpha = 0.60 +/- 0.05. combining this measurement with lower frequency datashows that a pure synchrotron model can fit the spectrum of this knot from1.647 ghz to 5 kev (over nine decades in energy) with alpha = 0.76 +/- 0.02,similar to the x-ray spectral slope. thus, we place a lower limit on the totalpower radiated by this knot of 1.5e43 erg/s; substantially more power may beemitted in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands.  knot a2 is also detected and is somewhat blended with knot b1. synchrotronemission may also explain the x-ray emission but a spectral bend is requirednear the optical band. for knots a1 and b1, the x-ray flux dominates theemitted energy. for the remaining optical knots (c through h), localized x-rayenhancements that might correspond to the optical features are not clearlyresolved. the position angle of the jet ridge line follows the optical shapewith distinct, aperiodic excursions of +/-1 deg from a median value of-138.0deg. finally, we find x-ray emission from the ``inner jet'' between 5 and10" from the core.

astro-ph;0302197	rx j1856.5-3754: bare quark star or naked neutron star ?	recent chandra observations have shown that the soft x-ray spectrum from theisolated neutron star rx j1856.5-3754 is featureless and best fitted by ablackbody, in contrast with the predictions of current neutron star atmosphericmodels. the star distance (~120-140 pc) implies a radiation radius of at most\~5-6 km, too small for any neutron star equation of state. proposedexplanations for such a small radius include a reduced x-ray emitting region(as a polar cap), or the presence of a more compact object, as a barequark/strange star. however, both interpretations rely on the presumption thatthe quark star or the cap radiates a pure blackbody spectrum, and nojustification for this assumption has been presented yet. here we discuss analternative possibility. cool neutron stars (t &lt; 10^6 k) endowed with highmagnetic field (b &gt; 10^13 g) may suffer a phase transition in the outermostlayers. the neutron star is then left bare of the gaseous atmosphere. wecomputed spectra from naked neutron stars with a surface fe composition.depending on b, we found that the 0.1-2 kev emission can be featureless andindistinguishable from a blackbody. owing to the reduced surface emissivity,the star only radiates ~30-50 % of the blackbody power, thus that the size ofthe emitting region is larger than for a perfect planckian emitter. whenapplied to rx j1856.5-3754 our model accounts for the observed x-ray propertiesand solves the paradox of the small radius. the apparent star radius is ~10-12km, consistent with equations of state of a neutron star. the optical emissionof rx j1856.5-3754 may be explained by the presence a thin gaseous shell on thetop of the fe condensate.

astro-ph;0403017	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the post-t tauri star pz tel	we present an analysis of the chandra high energy transmission gratingspectrometer observation of the rapidly rotating p_(rot)=0.94 d post t tauri(~20 myr old) star pz telescopii, in the tucana association. using twodifferent methods we have derived the coronal emission measure distribution,em(t), and chemical abundances. the em(t) peaks at log t = 6.9 and exhibits asignificant emission measure at temperatures log t &gt; 7. the coronal abundancesare generally ~0.5 times the solar photospheric values that are presumed fairlyrepresentative of the composition of the underlying star. a minimum inabundance is seen at a first ionization potential (fip) of 7-8 ev, withevidence for higher abundances at both lower and higher fip, similar topatterns seen in other active stars. from an analysis of the he-like triplet ofmg xi we have estimated electron densities of ~10^(12)-10^(13) cm^(-3). all thecoronal properties found for pz tel are much more similar to those of ab dor,which is slightly older than pz tel, than to those of the younger t tauri startw hya. these results support earlier conclusions that the soft x-ray emissionof tw hya is likely dominated by accretion activity rather than by amagnetically-heated corona. our results also suggest that the coronae ofpre-main sequence stars rapidly become similar to those of older activemain-sequence stars soon after the accretion stage has ended.

astro-ph;0405580	x-ray spectroscopy of the unsteady quiescent corona of ad leo with  chandra	we present the analysis and interpretation of an observation of the flarestar ad leo (dm3e) with chandra/letg. the high resolution x-ray spectrumallowed us to infer the plasma emission measure distribution (emd) vs.temperature, and the abundances of individual elements in the corona of thismagnetically-active star, during a typical state characterized by significantvariability but no large flaring event. we have also measured plasma densitiesat various temperatures using spectroscopic diagnostics provided by he-liketriplets and fe xxi lines. we show that the present emd is similar to thosepreviously obtained from euve spectra during quiescent and flaring states,confirming the long-term stability of the corona of ad leo. at variance withthe case of other active stars, the emd of ad leo is characterized by asignificantly shallower slope, compatible with that predicted by static modelsof isobaric loops with constant cross-section and uniform heating. we discusssuch coronal modeling to infer the average properties of the corona in terms ofloop populations, including estimates of the surface filling factor. we alsoshow that the emd is compatible with the model of a corona continuously heatedby flares. the coronal composition is such that the element abundances,relative to solar values, tend to increase with the first ionization potential,with few exceptions. the line to continuum ratios suggest a nearly solarcoronal metallicity.

astro-ph;0410264	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of pre-main-sequence stars: twa 5 and  pz tel	we report on the analysis of high resolution x-ray spectra of twopre-main-sequence stars: twa 5 (observed with xmm-newton) and pz telescopii(observed with chandra/hetgs). twa 5 is a classical t tauri star in the twhydrae association while pz tel is a rapidly rotating weak-lined t tauri starin the beta-pictoris moving group. for both stars we have reconstructed theemission measure distribution and derived the coronal abundances to check forpossible patterns of the abundances related to the first ionization potentialof the various elements. we have also derived estimates of the plasma densityfrom the analysis of the he-like triplets. we compare the characteristics ofour targets with those of other pre-main sequence stars previously analyzed byother authors: tw hya, hd 98800 and hd 283572. our findings suggest that x-rayemission from classical t tauri and weak-lined t tauri stars is produced in allcases by magnetically-heated coronae, except for tw hya which has unique plasmatemperatures and densities. moreover we derive that twa 5 has the same peculiarne/fe abundance ratio as tw hya.

astro-ph;0411614	the coronae of ab dor and v471 tau: primordial angular momentum vs tidal  spin-up	the zero-age main-sequence star ab dor and the k dwarf component of the v471tau close binary have essentially identical rotation rates and spectral types.an analysis of their high resolution {\it chandra} x-ray spectra revealsremarkably similar coronal characteristics in terms of both temperaturestructure and element abundances. both stars show depletions of low fipelements by factors of $\sim 3$, with higher fip elements showing more milddepletions. no evidence for enhancements of very low fip ($&lt; 7$ ev) elements,such as na, al and ca, as compared to other low fip elements was found. theabundance anomaly pattern for ab dor and v471 tau is similar to, though lessextreme than, the abundance anomalies exhibited by active rs-cvn-type binaries.while we find statistically significant structure in the underlyingdifferential emission measure distributions of these stars over narrowtemperature intervals, this structure is strongly dependent on the lines usedin the analysis and is probably spurious. based on their x-ray similarities, weconclude that the exact evolutionary state of a star has little effect oncoronal characteristics, and that the parameters that dominate coronalstructure and composition are simply the rotation rate and spectral type.

astro-ph;0503183	an assessment of the fe xviii and fe xix line ratios from the chandra  grating observations of capella	observations of fe xviii and fe xix x-ray, euv, and fuv line emission, formedat the peak of capella's (alpha aurigae) emission measure distribution andubiquitous in spectra of many cool stars and galaxies, provide a uniqueopportunity to test the robustness of fe xviii and fe xix spectral models. theastrophysical plasma emission code (apec) is used to identify over 35 linesfrom these two ions alone, and to compare model predictions with spectraobtained with the chandra low energy transmission grating and high energytransmission grating spectrometers, the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer,and the extreme ultraviolet explorer. some flux discrepancies larger thanfactors of two are found between observations of fe xviii and fe xix lines andpredictions by apec and other models in common usage. in particular the x-rayresonance lines for both ions are stronger than predicted by all modelsrelative to the euv resonance lines. the multiwavelength observationsdemonstrate the importance of including dielectronic recombination and protonimpact excitation, and of using accurate wavelengths in spectral codes. theseions provide important diagnostic tools for 10^7 k plasmas currently observedwith chandra, xmm-newton, and fuse.

astro-ph;0503319	an overview of the performance of the chandra x-ray observatory	the chandra x-ray observatory is the x-ray component of nasa's greatobservatory program which includes the recently launched spitzer infraredtelescope, the hubble space telescope (hst) for observations in the visible,and the compton gamma-ray observatory (cgro) which, after providing years ofuseful data has reentered the atmosphere. all these facilities provide, orprovided, scientific data to the international astronomical community inresponse to peer-reviewed proposals for their use. the chandra x-rayobservatory was the result of the efforts of many academic, commercial, andgovernment organizations primarily in the united states but also in europe.nasa's marshall space flight center (msfc) manages the project and providesproject science; northrop grumman space technology (ngst -- formerly trw)served as prime contractor responsible for providing the spacecraft, thetelescope, and assembling and testing the observatory; and the smithsonianastrophysical observatory (sao) provides technical support and is responsiblefor ground operations including the chandra x-ray center (cxc). telescope andinstrument teams at sao, the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), thepennsylvania state university (psu), the space research institute of thenetherlands (sron), the max-planck institut fur extraterrestrische physik(mpe), and the university of kiel also provide technical support to the chandraproject. we present here a detailed description of the hardware, its on-orbitperformance, and a brief overview of some of the remarkable discoveries thatillustrate that performance.

astro-ph;0512492	evidence of the fip effect in the coronae of late-type giants	$\beta$ cet, 31 com and $\mu$ vel represent the main stages through whichlate-type giants evolve during their lifetime (the hertzsprung gap (31 com),the rapid braking zone ($\mu$ vel) and the core helium burning ``clump'' phase($\beta$ cet)). an analysis of their high resolution {\it chandra} x-rayspectra reveals similar coronal characteristics in terms of both temperaturestructure and element abundances for the more evolved stars ($\mu$ vel and$\beta$ cet) with slight differences for the `younger' giant (31 com). thecoronal temperature structure of 31 com is significantly hotter showing a clearpeak while $\beta$ cet and $\mu$ vel show a plateau. $\beta$ cet and $\mu$ velshow evidence for a fip effect in which coronae are depleted in high fipelements relative to their photospheres by a factor of $\sim 2$. in contrast,31 com is characterized by a lack of fip effect. in other words, neitherdepletion nor enhancement relative to stellar photospheric values is found. weconclude that the structural changes during the evolution of late-type giantscould be responsible for the observed differences in coronal abundances andtemperature structure. in particular, the size of the convection zone coupledwith the rotation rate seem obvious choices for playing a key role indetermining coronal characteristics.

astro-ph;0601591	soft x-ray emission lines of fe xv in solar flare observations and the  chandra spectrum of capella	recent calculations of atomic data for fe xv have been used to generatetheoretical line ratios involving n = 3-4 transitions in the soft x-rayspectral region (52-83 a), for a wide range of electron temperatures anddensities applicable to solar and stellar coronal plasmas. a comparison ofthese with solar flare observations from a rocket-borne spectrograph (xsst)reveals generally good agreement between theory and experiment. in particular,the 82.76 a emission line in the xsst spectrum is identified, for the firsttime to our knowledge in an astrophysical source. most of the fe xv transitionswhich are blended have had the species responsible clearly identified, althoughthere remain a few instances where this has not been possible. the line ratiocalculations are also compared with a co-added spectrum of capella obtainedwith the chandra satellite, which is probably the highest signal-to-noiseobservation achieved for a stellar source in the 25-175 a soft x-ray region.good agreement is found between theory and experiment, indicating that the fexv lines are reliably detected in chandra spectra, and hence may be employed asdiagnostics to determine the temperature and/or density of the emitting plasma.however the line blending in the chandra data is such that individual emissionlines are difficult to measure accurately, and fluxes may only be reliablydetermined via detailed profile fitting of the observations. the co-addedcapella spectrum is made available to hopefully encourage further explorationof the soft x-ray region in astronomical sources.

astro-ph;0604618	swift observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs  ophiuchi: i. early x-ray emission from the shocked ejecta and red giant wind	rs ophiuchi began its latest outburst on 2006 february 12. previous outburstshave indicated that high velocity ejecta interact with a pre-existing red giantwind, setting up shock systems analogous to those seen in supernova remnants.however, in the previous outburst in 1985, x-ray observations did not commenceuntil 55 days after the initial explosion. here we report on swift observationscovering the first month of the 2006 outburst with the burst alert (bat) andx-ray telescope (xrt) instruments. rs oph was clearly detected in the bat 14-25kev band from t=0 to $t\sim6$ days. xrt observationsfrom 0.3-10 kev, started at3.17 days after outburst. the rapidly evolving xrt spectra clearly show thepresence of both line and continuum emission which can be fitted by thermalemission from hot gas whose characteristic temperature, overlying absorbingcolumn, $[n_h]_w$, and resulting unabsorbed total flux decline monotonicallyafter the first few days. derived shock velocities are in good agreement withthose found from observations at other wavelengths. similarly, $[n_h]_w$ is inaccord with that expected from the red giant wind ahead of the forward shock.we confirm the basic models of the 1985 outburst and conclude that standardphase i remnant evolution terminated by $t\sim10$ days and the remnant thenrapidly evolved to display behaviour characteristic of phase iii. around t=26days however, a new, luminous and highly variable soft x-ray source began toappear whose origin will be explored in a subsequent paper.

astro-ph;0605318	on the relevance of compton scattering for the soft x-ray spectra of hot  da white dwarfs	we re-examine the effects of compton scattering on the emergent spectra ofhot da white dwarfs in the soft x-ray range. earlier studies have implied thatsensitive x-ray observations at wavelengths $\lambda &lt; 50$ \aa might be capableof probing the flux deficits predicted by the redistribution ofelectron-scattered x-ray photons toward longer wavelengths. we adopt twoindependent numerical approaches to the inclusion of compton scattering in thecomputation of pure hydrogen atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium. oneemploys the kompaneets diffusion approximation formalism, while the other usesthe cross-sections and redistribution functions of guilbert. models andemergent spectra are computed for stellar parameters representative of hz 43and sirius b, and for models with an effective temperature $t_{\rm eff} = 100000$ k. the differences between emergent spectra computed for compton andthomson scattering cases are completely negligible in the case of both hz 43and sirius b models, and are also negligible for all practical purposes formodels with temperatures as high as $t_{\rm eff} = 100 000$ k. models of thesoft x-ray flux from these stars are instead dominated by uncertainties intheir fundamental parameters.

0810.0401	a planetary nebula around nova v458 vul undergoing flash ionization	nova v458 vul erupted on 2007 august 8th and reached a visual magnitude of8.1 a few days later. h$\alpha$ images obtained six weeks before the outburstas part of the iphas galactic plane survey reveal an 18th magnitude progenitorsurrounded by an extended nebula. subsequent images and spectroscopy of thenebula reveal an inner nebular knot increasing rapidly in brightness due toflash ionization by the nova event. we derive a distance of 13 kpc based onlight travel time considerations, which is supported by two other distanceestimation methods. the nebula has an ionized mass of 0.2 m$_{\odot}$ and a lowexpansion velocity: this rules it out as ejecta from a previous nova eruption,and is consistent with it being a ~14,000 year old planetary nebula, probablythe product of a prior common envelope (ce) phase of evolution of the binarysystem. the large derived distance means that the mass of the erupting wdcomponent of the binary is high. we identify two possible evolutionaryscenarios, in at least one of which the system is massive enough to produce atype ia supernova on merging.

0810.2023	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the evolving shock in the 2006  outburst of rs ophiuchi	the evolution of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi wasfollowed with 12 x-ray grating observations with chandra and xmm-newton. wepresent detailed spectral analyses using two independent approaches. from thebest dataset, taken on day 13.8 after outburst, we reconstruct the temperaturedistribution and derive elemental abundances. we find evidence for at least twodistinct temperature components on day 13.8 and a reduction of temperature withtime. the x-ray flux decreases as a power-law, and the power-law index changesfrom -5/3 to -8/3 around day 70 after outburst. this can be explained bydifferent decay mechanisms for the hot and cool components. the decay of thehot component and the decrease in temperature are consistent with radiativecooling, while the decay of the cool component can be explained by theexpansion of the ejecta. we find overabundances of n and of alpha-elements,which could either represent the composition of the secondary that provides theaccreted material or that of the ejecta. the n overabundance indicatescno-cycled material. from comparisons to abundances for the secondary takenfrom the literature, we conclude that 20-40% of the observed nitrogen couldoriginate from the outburst. the overabundance of the alpha-elements is nottypical for stars of the spectral type of the secondary in the rs oph system,and white dwarf material might have been mixed into the ejecta. however, nodirect measurements of the alpha-elements in the secondary are available, andthe continuous accretion may have changed the observable surface composition.

0811.3941	three-dimensional modeling of the asymmetric blast wave from the 2006  outburst of rs ophiuchi: early x-ray emission	chandra/hetg observations of the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi at day 13.9 ofits 2006 outburst reveal a spectrum covering a large range in plasmatemperature and characterized by asymmetric and blue-shifted emission lines. weinvestigate the origin of these asymmetries and broadening of emission lines.we perform 3-d hydrodynamic simulations of the blast wave from the 2006outburst, propagating through the inhomogeneous csm. the model takes intoaccount the thermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation)and the radiative cooling. from the simulations, we synthesize the x-rayemission and derive the spectra as they would be observed with chandra/hetg.our model reproduces the observed x-ray emission in a natural way if the csm inwhich the outburst occurred is characterized by an equatorial densityenhancement. our ``best-fit'' model predicts that most of the early x-rayemission originates from a small region propagating in the directionperpendicular to the line-of-sight and localized just behind the interactionfront between the blast wave and the equatorial density enhancement. the modelpredicts asymmetric and blue-shifted line profiles remarkably similar to thoseobserved. these asymmetries are due to substantial x-ray absorption ofred-shifted emission by ejecta material. the comparison of high quality data ofchandra/hetg with detailed hydrodynamic modeling has allowed us to unveil, forthe first time, the details of the structure emitting in the x-ray band inearly phases of the outburst evolution, contributing to a better understandingof the physics of interactions between nova blasts and csm in recurrent novae.this may have implications for whether or not rs ophiuchi is a type ia snprogenitor system.
