0905.0690	the collimation and energetics of the brightest swift gamma-ray bursts	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are widely believed to behighly-collimated explosions (opening angle theta ~ 1-10 deg). as a result ofthis beaming factor, the true energy release from a grb is usually severalorders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. measuring thisopening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in theafterglow light curve (a "jet" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in theswift era. here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of theisotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, e(gamma, iso)) grbs in the swift erato search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energyrelease. we present multi-wavelength (radio through x-ray) observations of grbs050820a, 060418, and 080319b, and construct afterglow models to extract theopening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.together with results from previous analyses of grbs 050904 and 070125, we findevidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supportingthe canonical picture of grbs as collimated explosions. the most naturalexplanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most swift grbs istherefore selection effects. however, the opening angles for the events in oursample are larger than would be expected if all grbs had a canonical energyrelease of ~ 10e51 erg. the total energy release we measure for those"hyper-energetic" (e(total) &gt;~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enoughto start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.

0910.5598	searching for sub-kilometer tnos using pan-starrs video mode  lightcurves: preliminary study and evaluation using engineering data	we present a pre-survey study of using pan-starrs high sampling rate videomode guide star images to search for tnos. with suitable selection of the guidestars within the pan-starrs 7 deg^{2} field of view, the lightcurves of theseguide stars can also be used to search for occultations by tnos. the besttarget stars for this purpose are stars with high signal-to-noise ratio (snr)and small angular size.in order to do this, we compiled a catalog using the snrcalculated from stars with m_v &lt;13 mag in the tycho2 catalog then cross matchedthese stars with the 2mass catalog and estimated their angular sizes from (v-k)color. we also outlined a new detection method based on matched filter that isoptimized to search for diffraction patterns in the lightcurves due tooccultation by sub-kilometer tnos. a detection threshold is set to compromisebetween real detections and false positives. depending on the theoretical sizedistribution model used, we expect to find up to a hundred events during thethree-year life time of the pan-starrs-1 project. we have tested the detectionalgorithm and the pipeline on a set of engineering data (taken at 10hz in steadof 30hz). no events were found within the engineering data, which is consistentwith the small size of the data set and the theoretical models. meanwhile, witha total of ~ 22 star-hours video mode data (|\beta| &lt; 10^{\circ}), we are ableto set an upper limit of n(&gt;0.5 km) ~ 2.47x10^10 deg^-2 at 95% confidencelimit.

0912.2999	evidence for supernova-synthesised dust from the rising afterglow of grb  071025 at z~5	we present observations and analysis of the broadband afterglow of swift grb071025. using optical and infrared (riyjhk) photometry, we derive a photometricredshift of 4.4 &lt; z &lt; 5.2; at this redshift our simultaneous multicolourobservations begin at ~30 s after the grb trigger in the host frame and duringthe initial rising phase of the afterglow. we associate the light curve peak at580 s in the observer frame with the formation of the forward shock, giving anestimate of the initial lorentz factor gamma_0 ~ 200. the red spectral energydistribution (even in regions not affected by the lyman-alpha break) providessecure evidence of a large dust column. however, the inferred extinction curveshows a prominent flat component between 2000-3000 angstroms in the rest-frame,inconsistent with any locally observed template but well-fit by models of dustformed by supernovae. time-dependent fits to the extinction profile reveal noevidence of dust destruction and limit the decrease in the extinction column todelta a_3000 &lt; 0.54 mag after t = 50 s in the rest frame. our observationsprovide evidence of a transition in dust properties at z~5, in agreement withstudies of high-z quasars, and suggest that sn-formed dust continues todominate the opacity of typical galaxies at this redshift.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1107.3552	pan-starrs1 discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae at z ~ 0.9	we present the discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae (sne) at z ~ 0.9with the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey. these sne, ps1-10ky and ps1-10awh, areamongst the most luminous sne ever discovered, comparable to the unusualtransients sn 2005ap and scp 06f6. like sn 2005ap and scp 06f6, they showcharacteristic high luminosities (m_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a fewbroad absorption lines, and no evidence for h or he. we have constructed a fullmulti-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-seriesspectroscopy for these sne. given the similarities between the sne, we combinetheir light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course ofexplosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10^51 erg. we find photospheric velocities of12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of anoptically-thick massive shell of material. we show that, consistent withfindings for other ultra-luminous sne in this class, radioactive decay is notsufficient to power ps1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for theseevents: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse sn, orsn shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a wolf-rayetstar.

(2008) in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), we use repeat ps1 observations of stars to perform the relativecalibration of ps1 in each of its five bands, solving simultaneously for thesystem throughput, the atmospheric transparency, and the large-scale detectorflat field. both internal consistency tests and comparison against the sdssindicate that we achieve relative precision of &lt;10 mmag in g, r, and i_p1, and~10 mmag in z and y_p1. the spatial structure of the differences with the sdssindicates that errors in both the ps1 and sdss photometric calibrationcontribute similarly to the differences. the analysis suggests that both theps1 system and the haleakala site will enable &lt;1% photometry over much of thesky.

1205.1401	composite reverberation mapping	reverberation mapping offers one of the best techniques for studying theinner regions of qsos. it is based on cross-correlating continuum andemission-line light curves. new time-resolved optical surveys will produce wellsampled light curves for many thousands of qsos. we explore the potential ofstacking samples to produce composite cross-correlations for groups of objectsthat have well sampled continuum light curves, but only a few (~2)emission-line measurements. this technique exploits current and futurewide-field optical monitoring surveys (e.g. pan-starrs, lsst) and themultiplexing capability of multi-object spectrographs (e.g. 2df, hectospec) tosignificantly reduce the observational expense of reverberation mapping, inparticular at high redshift (0.5 to 2.5).  we demonstrate the technique using simulated qso light curves and explore thebiases involved when stacking cross-correlations in some simplified situations.we show that stacked cross correlations have smaller amplitude peaks comparedto well sampled correlation functions as the mean flux of the emission lightcurve is poorly constrained. however, the position of the peak remains intact.we find there can be `kinks' in stacked correlation functions due to differentmeasurements contributing to different parts of the correlation function.  using the pan-starrs medium-deep survey (mds) as a template we show thatcross-correlation lags should be measurable in a sample size of 500 qsos thathave weekly photometric monitoring and two spectroscopic observations. finallywe apply the technique to a small sample (42) of qsos that have light curvesfrom the mds. we find no indication of a peak in the stacked cross-correlation.a larger spectroscopic sample is required to produce robust reverberation lags.

0712.2828	grb070125: the first long-duration gamma-ray burst in a halo environment	we present the discovery and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observationsof the optical afterglow of the long-duration gamma-ray burst grb070125. unlikeall previously observed long-duration afterglows in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z&lt; 2.0, we find no strong (rest-frame equivalent width w &gt; 1.0 a) absorptionfeatures in the wavelength range 4000 - 10000 a. the sole significant featureis a weak doublet we identify as mg ii 2796 (w = 0.18 +/- 0.02 a), 2803 (w =0.08 +/- 0.01) at z = 1.5477 +/- 0.0001. the low observed mg ii and inferred hi column densities are typically observed in galactic halos, far away from thebulk of massive star formation. deep ground-based imaging reveals no hostdirectly underneath the afterglow to a limit of r &gt; 25.4 mag. either of the twonearest blue galaxies could host grb070125; the large offset (d &gt;= 27 kpc)would naturally explain the low column density. to remain consistent with thelarge local (i.e. parsec scale) circum-burst density inferred from broadbandafterglow observations, we speculate grb070125 may have occurred far away fromthe disk of its host in a compact star-forming cluster. such distant stellarclusters, typically formed by dynamical galaxy interactions, have been observedin the nearby universe, and should be more prevalent at z&gt;1 where galaxymergers occur more frequently.

1302.7281	the pan-starrs moving object processing system	we describe the pan-starrs moving object processing system (mops), a modernsoftware package that produces automatic asteroid discoveries andidentifications from catalogs of transient detections from next-generationastronomical survey telescopes. mops achieves &gt; 99.5% efficiency in producingorbits from a synthetic but realistic population of asteroids whosemeasurements were simulated for a pan-starrs4-class telescope. additionally,using a non-physical grid population, we demonstrate that mops can detectpopulations of currently unknown objects such as interstellar asteroids.  mops has been adapted successfully to the prototype pan-starrs1 telescopedespite differences in expected false detection rates, fill-factor loss andrelatively sparse observing cadence compared to a hypothetical pan-starrs4telescope and survey. mops remains &gt;99.5% efficient at detecting objects on asingle night but drops to 80% efficiency at producing orbits for objectsdetected on multiple nights. this loss is primarily due to configurable mopsprocessing limits that are not yet tuned for the pan-starrs1 mission.  the core mops software package is the product of more than 15 person-years ofsoftware development and incorporates countless additional years of effort inthird-party software to perform lower-level functions such as spatial searchingor orbit determination. we describe the high-level design of mops and essentialsubcomponents, the suitability of mops for other survey programs, and suggest aroad map for future mops development.

1303.0555	x-ray selected galaxy clusters in the pan-starrs medium-deep survey	[abridged]  we present the results of a pilot study for the extended macs survey (emacs),a comprehensive search for distant, x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z&gt;0.5.our pilot study applies the emacs concept to the 71 deg^2 area extended by theten fields of the pan-starrs1 (ps1) medium deep survey (mds). candidateclusters are identified by visual inspection of ps1 images in the g,r, i, and zbands in a 5x5 arcmin^2 region around x-ray sources detected in the rosatall-sky survey (rass). to test and optimize the emacs x-ray selection criteria,our pilot study uses the largest possible rass database, i.e., all rass sourceslisted in the bright and faint source catalogs (bsc and fsc) that fall withinthe mds footprint. scrutiny of ps1/mds images for 41 bsc and 200 fsc sourcescombined with dedicated spectroscopic follow-up observations results in asample of 11 clusters with estimated or spectroscopic redshifts of z&gt;0.3. x-rayfollow-up observations will be crucial in order to establish robust clusterluminosities for emacs clusters.  although the small number of distant x-ray luminous clusters in the mds doesnot allow us to make firm predictions for the over 20,000 deg^2 ofextragalactic sky covered by emacs, the identification of two extremelypromising emacs cluster candidates at z&gt;0.6 (both yet to be observed withchandra) in such a small solid angle is encouraging. representing a tremendousgain over the presently known two dozen such systems from x-ray, optical, andsz cluster surveys combined, the sample of over 100 extremely massive clustersat z&gt;0.5 expected from emacs would be invaluable for the identification of themost powerful gravitational lenses in the universe, as well as for in-depth andstatistical studies of the physical properties of the most massive galaxyclusters out to z~1.

1303.1818	ps1-12sk is a peculiar supernova from a he-rich progenitor system in a  brightest cluster galaxy environment	we report on our discovery and observations of the pan-starrs1 supernova (sn)ps1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation inits host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system modelsfor this class of explosion. the optical spectra of ps1-12sk classify it as atype ibn sn (c.f. sn 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) andtime variable he i emission. our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes therise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an nuv-nir sed with temperature &gt; 17x10^3 kand a peak rise magnitude of mz = -18.9 mag. sn ibn spectroscopic propertiesare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 m_sun)explosion within a he-enriched circumstellar medium. however, unlike previoustype ibn supernovae, ps1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightestcluster galaxy, cgcg 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster rxc j0844.9+4258. theexpected probability of an event like ps1-12sk in such environments is lowgiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse sne in red sequence galaxiescompounded by the low volumetric rate of sn ibn. furthermore, we find noevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (sigmahalpha &lt; 2x10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2). we therefore discuss white dwarf binarysystems as a possible progenitor channel for sne ibn. we conclude that ps1-12skrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidencefor a top-heavy imf in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first cluesuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for type ibn sne.

1304.3320	super luminous ic supernovae: catching a magnetar by the tail	we report extensive observational data for five of the lowest redshiftsuper-luminous type ic supernovae (sl-sne ic) discovered to date, namelyptf10hgi, sn2011ke, ptf11rks, sn2011kf and sn2012il. photometric imaging of thetransients at +50 to +230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtractionreveals a luminous tail phase for four of these sl-sne. a high resolution,optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broadhe i $\lambda$10830 emission line in the spectrum (+50d) of sn2012il, revealingthat at least some sl-sne ic are not completely helium free. at first sight,the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with theradioactive decay of \co, and would require 1-4m of \ni to produce theluminosity. these \ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusiontimes at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. weinstead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source forthese objects. a semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from thespin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. themodel predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required arein reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. we derivemagnetar energies of $0.4\lesssim e$($10^{51}$erg) $\lesssim6.9$ and ejectamasses of $2.3\lesssim m_{ej}$(\m) $\lesssim 8.6$. the sample of five sl-sne icpresented here, combined with sn 2010gx - the best sampled sl-sne ic so far -point toward an explosion driven by a magnetar as a viable explanation for allsl-sne ic.

1305.1803	stacked reverberation lags at high redshift	over the past 20years reverberation mapping has proved one of the mostsuccessful techniques for studying the local (&lt;1pc) environment ofsuper-massive black holes that drive active galactic nuclei. key successes ofreverberation mapping have been direct black hole mass estimates, theradius-luminosity relation for the hbeta line and the calibration ofsingle-epoch mass estimators commonly employed up to z~7. however, observingconstraints mean that few studies have been successful at z&gt;0.1, or for themore-luminous quasars that make up the majority of current spectroscopicsamples, or for the rest-frame ultra-violet emission lines available in opticalspectra of z&gt;0.5 objects.  previously we described a technique for stacking cross correlations to obtainreverberation mapping results at high z. here we present the first results froma campaign designed for this purpose. we construct stacked cross-correlationfunctions for the civ and mgii lines and find a clear peak in both. we find thepeak in the mgii correlation is at longer lags than civ consistent withprevious results at low redshift. for the civ sample we are able to bin byluminosity and find evidence for increasing lags for more-luminous objects.this civ radius-luminosity relation is consistent with previous studies butwith a fraction of the observational cost.

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1307.8124	towards a complete stellar mass function of the hyades. i. pan-starrs1  optical observations of the low-mass stellar content	the hyades cluster is an ideal target to study the dynamical evolution of astar cluster over the entire mass range due to its intermediate age andproximity to the sun. we wanted to extend the hyades mass function towardslower masses down to 0.1 msol and to use the full three-dimensional spatialinformation to characterize the dynamical evolution of the cluster. weperformed a kinematic and photometric selection using the ppmxl and pan-starrs1sky surveys, to search for cluster members up to 30 pc from the cluster centre.we determined our detection efficiency and field star contamination rate toderive the cluster luminosity and mass functions down to masses of 0.1 msol.the thorough astrometric and photometric constraints minimized thecontamination. a minimum spanning tree algorithm was used to quantify the masssegregation. we discovered 43 new hyades member candidates with velocityperpendicular to the hyades motion up to 2 km/s. they have mass estimatesbetween 0.43 and 0.09 msol, for a total mass of 10 msol. this doubles thenumber of hyades candidates with masses smaller than 0.15 msol. we provide anadditional list of 11 possible candidates with velocity perpendicular to thehyades motion up to 4 km/s. the cluster is significantly mass segregated. theextension of the mass function towards lower masses provided an even clearersignature than estimated in the past. we also identified as likely hyadesmember an l0 dwarf previously assumed to be a field dwarf. finally we questionthe membership of a number of previously published candidates, including al2.5-type dwarf.

1309.0503	a search for l/t transition dwarfs with pan-starrs1 and wise: discovery  of seven nearby objects including two candidate spectroscopic variables	we present initial results from a wide-field (30,000 deg^2) search for l/ttransition brown dwarfs within 25 pc using the pan-starrs1 and wise surveys.previous large-area searches have been incomplete for l/t transition dwarfs,because these objects are faint in optical bands and have near-infrared colorsthat are difficult to distinguish from background stars. to overcome theseobstacles, we have cross-matched the pan-starrs1 (optical) and wise (mid-ir)catalogs to produce a unique multi-wavelength database for finding ultracooldwarfs. as part of our initial discoveries, we have identified seven browndwarfs in the l/t transition within 9-15 pc of the sun. the l9.5 dwarf psoj140.2308+45.6487 and the t1.5 dwarf pso j307.6784+07.8263 (both independentlydiscovered by mace et al. 2013) show possible spectroscopic variability at they- and j-bands. two more objects in our sample show evidence of photometricj-band variability, and two others are candidate unresolved binaries based ontheir spectra. we expect our full search to yield a well-defined,volume-limited sample of l/t transition dwarfs that will include many newtargets for study of this complex regime. pso j307.6784+07.8263 in particularmay be an excellent candidate for in-depth study of variability, given itsbrightness (j = 14.2 mag) and proximity (11 pc).

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1401.7424	characterization of the praesepe star cluster by photometry and proper  motions with 2mass, ppmxl, and pan-starrs	membership identification is the first step to determine the properties of astar cluster. low-mass members in particular could be used to trace thedynamical history, such as mass segregation, stellar evaporation, or tidalstripping, of a star cluster in its galactic environment. we identified membercandidates with stellar masses $\sim$0.11--2.4 msun of the intermediate-agepraesepe cluster (m44), by using pan-starrs and 2mass photometry, and ppmxlproper motions. within a sky area of 3 deg radius, 1040 candidates areidentified, of which 96 are new inclusions. using the same set of selectioncriteria on field stars led to an estimate of a false positive rate 16%,suggesting 872 of the candidates being true members. this most complete andreliable membership list allows us to favor the bt-settl model in comparisonwith other stellar models. the cluster shows a distinct binary track above themain sequence, with a binary frequency of 20--40%, and a high occurrence rateof similar mass pairs. the mass function is consistent with that of the diskpopulation but shows a deficit of members below 0.3 solar masses. a clear masssegregation is evidenced, with the lowest-mass members in our sample beingevaporated from this disintegrating cluster.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1402.6403	pan-starrs 1 observations of the unusual active centaur p/2011 s1(gibbs)	p/2011 s1 (gibbs) is an outer solar system comet or active centaur with asimilar orbit to that of the famous 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1. p/2011 s1(gibbs) has been observed by the pan-starrs 1 (ps1) sky survey from 2010 to2012. the resulting data allow us to perform multi-color studies of the nucleusand coma of the comet. analysis of ps1 images reveals that p/2011 s1 (gibbs)has a small nucleus $&lt; 4$ km radius, with colors $g_{p1}-r_{p1} = 0.5 \pm0.02$, $r_{p1}-i_{p1} = 0.12 \pm 0.02$ and $i_{p1}-z_{p1} = 0.46 \pm 0.03$. thecomet remained active from 2010 to 2012, with a model-dependent mass-loss rateof $\sim100$ kg s$^{-1}$. the mass-loss rate per unit surface area of p/2011 s1(gibbs) is as high as that of 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1, making it one of themost active centaurs. the mass-loss rate also varies with time from $\sim 40$kg s$^{-1}$ to 150 kg s$^{-1}$. due to its rather circular orbit, we proposethat p/2011 s1 (gibbs) has 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1-like outbursts thatcontrol the outgassing rate. the results indicate that it may have a similarsurface composition to that of 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1.  our numerical simulations show that the future orbital evolution of p/2011 s1(gibbs) is more similar to that of the main population of centaurs than to thatof 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1. the results also demonstrate that p/2011 s1(gibbs) is dynamically unstable and can only remain near its current orbit forroughly a thousand years.

1403.3393	a large catalog of accurate distances to molecular clouds from ps1  photometry	distance measurements to molecular clouds are important, but are often madeseparately for each cloud of interest, employing very different different dataand techniques. we present a large, homogeneous catalog of distances tomolecular clouds, most of which are of unprecedented accuracy. we determinedistances using optical photometry of stars along lines of sight toward theseclouds, obtained from panstarrs-1. we simultaneously infer the reddenings anddistances to these stars, tracking the full probability distribution functionusing a technique presented in green et al. (2014). we fit these star-by-starmeasurements using a simple dust screen model to find the distance to eachcloud. we thus estimate the distances to almost all of the clouds in themagnani et al. (1985) catalog, as well as many other well-studied clouds,including orion, perseus, taurus, cepheus, polaris, california, and monocerosr2, avoiding only the inner galaxy. typical statistical uncertainties in thedistances are 5%, though the systematic uncertainty stemming from the qualityof our stellar models is about 10%. the resulting catalog is the largestcatalog of accurate, directly-measured distances to molecular clouds. ourdistance estimates are generally consistent with available distance estimatesfrom the literature, though in some cases the literature estimates are off by afactor of more than two.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1407.0716	measuring quasar variability with pan-starrs1 and sdss	we measure quasar variability using the panoramic survey telescope and rapidresponse system 1 survey (pan-starrs1 or ps1) and the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and establish a method of selecting quasars via their variability in10,000 square degree surveys. we use 100,000 spectroscopically confirmedquasars that have been well measured in both ps1 and sdss and take advantage ofthe decadal time scales that separate sdss measurements and ps1 measurements. apower law model fits the data well over the entire time range tested, 0.01 to10 years. variability in the current ps1-sdss dataset can efficientlydistinguish between quasars and non-varying objects. it improves the purity ofa griz quasar color cut from 4.1% to 48% while maintaining 67% completeness.variability will be very effective at finding quasars in datasets with no uband and in redshift ranges where exclusively photometric selection is notefficient. we show that quasars' rest-frame ensemble variability, measured as aroot mean squared in delta magnitudes, is consistent with v(z, l, t) = a0(1+z)^0.37 (l/l0)^-0.16 (t/1yr)^0.246 , where l0 = 10^46 ergs^-1 and a0 =0.190, 0.162, 0.147 or 0.141 in the gp1 , rp1 , ip1 or zp1 filter,respectively. we also fit across all four filters and obtain median variabilityas a function of z, l and lambda as v(z, l, lambda, t) = 0.079(1 + z)^0.15(l/l0 )^-0.2 (lambda/1000 nm)^-0.44 (t/1yr)^0.246 .

1501.05470	machine learning for transient discovery in pan-starrs1 difference  imaging	efficient identification and follow-up of astronomical transients is hinderedby the need for humans to manually select promising candidates from datastreams that contain many false positives. these artefacts arise in thedifference images that are produced by most major ground-based time domainsurveys with large format ccd cameras. this dependence on humans to rejectbogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys andsignificant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally.in this paper we explore a simple machine learning approach to real-bogusclassification by constructing a training set from the image data of ~32000real astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey. we derive our feature representation from the pixel intensityvalues of a 20x20 pixel stamp around the centre of the candidates. this differsfrom previous work in that it works directly on the pixels rather thancatalogued domain knowledge for feature design or selection. three machinelearning algorithms are trained (artificial neural networks, support vectormachines and random forests) and their performances are tested on a held-outsubset of 25% of the training data. we find the best results from the randomforest classifier and demonstrate that by accepting a false positive rate of1%, the classifier initially suggests a missed detection rate of around 10%.however we also find that a combination of bright star variability, nucleartransients and uncertainty in human labelling means that our best estimate ofthe missed detection rate is approximately 6%.

astro-ph;0106574	the cosmic gamma-ray bursts	cosmic gamma-ray bursts are one of the great frontiers of astrophysics today.they are a playground of relativists and observers alike. they may teach usabout the death of stars and the birth of black holes, the physics in extremeconditions, and help us probe star formation in the distant and obscureduniverse. in this review we summarise some of the remarkable progress in thisfield over the past few years. while the nature of the grb progenitors is stillunsettled, it now appears likely that at least some bursts originate inexplosions of very massive stars, or at least occur in or near the regions ofmassive star formation. the physics of the burst afterglows is reasonably wellunderstood, and has been tested and confirmed very well by the observations.bursts are found to be beamed, but with a broad range of jet opening angles;the mean gamma-ray energies after the beaming corrections are ~ 10^51 erg.bursts are associated with faint &lt;r&gt; ~ 25 mag) galaxies at cosmologicalredshifts, with &lt;z&gt; ~ 1. the host galaxies span a range of luminosities andmorphologies, but appear to be broadly typical for the normal, activelystar-forming galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and magnitudes. some ofthe challenges for the future include: the nature of the short bursts andpossibly other types of bursts and transients; use of grbs to probe theobscured star formation in the universe, and possibly as probes of the veryearly universe; and their detection as sources of high-energy particles andgravitational waves.

astro-ph;0203467	grb 011121: a massive star progenitor	of the cosmological gamma-ray bursts, grb 011121 has the lowest redshift,z=0.36. more importantly, the multi-color excess in the afterglow detected inthe hubble space telescope (hst) light curves is compelling observationalevidence for an underlying supernova. here we present near-infrared and radioobservations of the afterglow. we undertake a comprehensive modeling of theseobservations and those reported in the literature and find good evidencefavoring a wind-fed circumburst medium. in detail, we infer the progenitor hada mass loss rate of mdot ~ 10^-7 / v_w3 mo/yr where v_w3 is the speed of thewind from the progenitor in units of 10^3 km/s. this mass loss rate is similarto that inferred for the progenitor of sn 1998bw which has been associated withgrb 980425. our data, taken in conjunction with the hst results of bloom et al.(2002), provide a consistent picture: the long duration grb 011121 had amassive star progenitor which exploded as a supernova at about the same time asthe grb event.

astro-ph;0207009	time-dependent optical spectroscopy of grb 010222: clues to the grb  environment	we present sequential optical spectra of the afterglow of grb 010222 obtainedone day apart using the low resolution imaging spectrometer (lris) and theechellette spectrograph and imager (esi) on the keck telescopes. threelow-ionization absorption systems are spectroscopically identified atz1=1.47688, z2=1.15628, and z3=0.92747. the higher resolution esi spectrumreveals two distinct components in the highest redshift system at z1a=1.47590and z1b=1.47688. we interpret the z1b=1.47688 system as an absorption featureof the disk of the host galaxy of grb 010222. the best fitted power-law opticalcontinuum and [zn/cr] ratio imply low dust content or a local gray dustcomponent near the burst site. in addition, we do not detect strong signaturesof vibrationally excited states of h_2. if the grb took place in a superbubbleor young stellar cluster, there are no outstanding signatures of an ionizedabsorber, either. analysis of the spectral time dependence at low resolutionshows no significant evidence for absorption-line variability. this lack ofvariability is confronted with time-dependent photoionization simulationsdesigned to apply the observed flux from grb 010222 to a variety of assumedatomic gas densities and cloud radii. the absence of time dependence in theabsorption lines implies that high-density environments are disfavored. inparticular, if the grb environment was dust free, its density was unlikely toexceed nh=10^2 cm^-3. if depletion of metals onto dust is similar to galacticvalues or less than solar abundances are present, then nh &gt; 2 x 10^4 cm^-3 isprobably ruled out in the immediate vicinity of the burst.

astro-ph;0208008	discovery of grb 020405 and its late red bump	we present the discovery of grb 020405 made with the inter-planetary network(ipn). with a duration of 60 s, the burst appears to be a typical long durationevent. we observed the 75-square acrminute ipn error region with the mountstromlo observatory's 50-inch robotic telescope and discovered a transientsource which subsequently decayed and was also associated with a variable radiosource. we identify this source as the afterglow of grb 020405. subsequentobservations by other groups found varying polarized flux and established aredshift of 0.690 to the host galaxy. motivated by the low redshift wetriggered observations with wfpc2 on-board the hubble space telescope (hst).modeling the early ground-based data with a jet model, we find a clear redexcess over the decaying optical lightcurves that is present between day 10 andday 141 (the last hst epoch). this `bump' has the spectral and temporalfeatures expected of an underlying supernova (sn). in particular, the red colorof the putative sn is similar to that of the sn associated with grb 011121, atlate time. restricting the sample of grbs to those with z&lt;0.7, a total of fivebursts, red bumps at late times are found in grb 970228, grb 011121, and grb020405. it is possible that the simplest idea, namely that all long durationgrbs have underlying sne with a modest dispersion in their properties(especially peak luminosity), is sufficient to explain the non detections.

astro-ph;0212554	optical spectropolarimetry of the grb 020813 afterglow	the optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst 020813 was observed for 3 hours withthe lris spectropolarimeter at the keck-i telescope, beginning 4.7 hours afterthe burst was detected by hete-2. the spectrum reveals numerous metalabsorption lines that we identify with two systems at z=1.223 and z=1.255. wealso detect an o ii 3727 emission line at z=1.255 and we identify this galaxyas the likely host of the grb. after a correction for galactic interstellarpolarization, the optical afterglow has a linear polarization of 1.8-2.4%during 4.7-7.9 hours after the burst. a measurement of p = 0.80% +/- 0.16% onthe following night by covino et al. demonstrates significant polarizationvariability over the next 14 hours. the lack of strong variability in theposition angle of linear polarization indicates that the magnetic field in thejet is likely to be globally ordered rather than composed of a number ofrandomly oriented cells. within the framework of afterglow models withcollimated flows, the relatively low observed polarization suggests that themagnetic field components perpendicular and parallel to the shock front areonly different by about 20%.

astro-ph;0309419	the bright optical afterglow of the nearby gamma-ray burst of 29 march  2003	many past studies of cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been limitedbecause of the large distance to typical grbs, resulting in faint afterglows.there has long been a recognition that a nearby grb would shed light on theorigin of these mysterious cosmic explosions, as well as the physics of theirfireballs. however, grbs nearer than z=0.2 are extremely rare, with anestimated rate of localisation of one every decade. here, we report thediscovery of bright optical afterglow emission from grb 030329. our promptdissemination and the brilliance of the afterglow resulted in extensivefollowup (more than 65 telescopes) from radio through x-ray bands, as well asmeasurement of the redshift, z=0.169. the gamma-ray and afterglow properties ofgrb 030329 are similar to those of cosmological grbs (after accounting for thesmall distance), making this the nearest known cosmological grb. observationshave already securely identified the progenitor as a massive star that explodedas a supernova, and we anticipate futher revelations of the grb phenomenon fromstudies of this source.

astro-ph;0509891	the progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts from an extended sample  of events	the detection of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hardgamma-ray bursts (shbs) is one of the most exciting recent astronomicaldiscoveries. indications that shb progenitors belong to old stellarpopulations, in contrast to those of the long-soft grbs, provide a strong clueabout their physical nature. definitive conclusions however are limited by thesmall number of shbs with known hosts. here, we present our investigation ofshbs previously localized by the interplanetary network (ipn) using new andarchival optical and x-ray observations. we show that we can likely identifythe host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasingthe sample of shbs with known hosts and/or distances. in particular, wedetermine that the bright shb 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy clusterabell 1892, making it probably the nearest shb currently known. we show thatthe brightest galaxy within the error box of shb 000607, at z=0.14, is mostlikely the host galaxy of this event. additionally, we rule out the existenceof galaxy overdensities (down to ~21mag) near the locations of two other shbs,and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. we combine our shb samplewith events discovered recently by the swift and hete-2 missions, andinvestigate the properties of the extended sample. comparison to sne ia showsthat the progenitors of shbs are typically older, implying a typical life timeof several gy. we also show that it is unlikely that there is a significantpopulation of progenitors with life time shorter than 1gy. this resultdisfavors the popular model of ns-ns mergers as the progenitors of shbs.

astro-ph;0510566	swift and optical observations of grb 050401	we present the results of the analysis of gamma-ray and x-ray data of grb050401 taken with the swift satellite, together with a series of ground-basedfollow-up observations. the swift x-ray light curve shows a clear break atabout 4900 seconds after the grb. the decay indices before and after the breakare consistent with a scenario of continuous injection of radiation from the'central engine' of the grb to the fireball. alternatively, this behaviourcould result if ejecta are released with a range of lorentz factors with theslower shells catching up the faster at the afterglow shock position. the twoscenarios are observationally indistinguishable. the grb 050401 afterglow isquite bright in the x-ray band but weak in the optical, with an optical tox-ray flux ratio similar to those of 'dark bursts'. we detect a significantamount of absorption in the x-ray spectrum, with n_h = (1.7 +/- 0.2) x 10^22cm^-2 at a redshift of z=2.9, which is typical of a dense circumbust medium.such high column density implies an unrealistic optical extinction of 30magnitudes if we adopt the galactic extinction law, which would not consistentwith optical detection of the afterglow. this suggests that the extinction lawis different from the galactic one.

astro-ph;0601293	the broadband afterglow of grb 030328	we here report on the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric monitoringof the optical afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 030328 detected byhete-2. we found that a smoothly broken power-law decay provides the best fitof the optical light curves, with indices alpha_1 = 0.76 +/- 0.03, alpha_2 =1.50 +/- 0.07, and a break at t_b = 0.48 +/- 0.03 d after the grb. polarizationis detected in the optical v-band, with p = (2.4 +/- 0.6)% and theta = (170 +/-7) deg. optical spectroscopy shows the presence of two absorption systems at z= 1.5216 +/- 0.0006 and at z = 1.295 +/- 0.001, the former likely associatedwith the grb host galaxy. the x-ray-to-optical spectral flux distributionobtained 0.78 days after the grb was best fitted using a broken power-law, withspectral slopes beta_opt = 0.47 +/- 0.15 and beta_x = 1.0 +/- 0.2. thediscussion of these results in the context of the "fireball model" shows thatthe preferred scenario is a fixed opening angle collimated expansion in ahomogeneous medium.

astro-ph;0601455	the afterglow, energetics and host galaxy of the short-hard gamma-ray  burst 051221a	we present detailed optical, x-ray and radio observations of the brightafterglow of the short gamma-ray burst 051221a obtained with gemini, swift/xrt,and the very large array, as well as optical spectra from which we measure theredshift of the burst, z=0.5464. at this redshift the isotropic-equivalentprompt energy release was about 1.5 x 10^51 erg, and using the standardafterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy issimilar, e_k,iso ~ 8.4 x 10^51 erg. an observed jet break at t ~ 5 daysindicates that the opening angle is ~ 7 degrees and the total beaming-correctedenergy is therefore ~ 2.5 x 10^49 erg, comparable to the values inferred forprevious short grbs. we further show that the burst experienced an episode ofenergy injection by a factor of 3.4 between t=1.4 and 3.4 hours, which wasaccompanied by reverse shock emission in the radio band. this result providescontinued evidence that the central engines of short grbs may be activesignificantly longer than the duration of the burst and/or produce a wide rangeof lorentz factors. finally, we show that the host galaxy of grb051221a isactively forming stars at a rate of about 1.6 m_solar/yr, but at the same timeexhibits evidence for an appreciable population of old stars (~ 1 gyr) and nearsolar metallicity. the lack of bright supernova emission and the lowcircumburst density (n ~ 10^-3 cm^-3) continue to support the idea that shortbursts are not related to the death of massive stars and are instead consistentwith a compact object merger. given that the total energy release is a factorof ~ 10 larger than the predicted yield for a neutrino annihilation mechanism,this suggests that magnetohydrodynamic processes may be required to power theburst.

astro-ph;0603689	hst and spitzer observations of the host galaxy of grb 050904: a  metal-enriched, dusty starburst at z=6.295	we present deep hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescopeobservations of the host galaxy of grb 050904 at z=6.295. the host is detectedin the h-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. from these detections, and limitsin the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolutemagnitude, m(uv)=-20.7 mag, or ~l*, a substantial star formation rate of 15solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. acomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies atz&gt;5.5 reveals that the host of grb 050904 would evade detection and/orconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectablely-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (a[1200]~1.5mag). this suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 arecurrently being accounted for. most importantly, using the metallicity ofz~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observationsindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- andluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z&gt;6. the easeof measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggeststhat in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, agrb mission with dedicated near-ir follow-up can provide unique information onthe evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.

astro-ph;0604093	physics of the grb 030328 afterglow and its environment	we report on the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric, monitoring ofthe optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst (grb) 030328 detected by hete-2.photometry, collected at 7 different telescopes, shows that a smoothly brokenpowerlaw decay, with indices alpha_1 = 0.76 +/- 0.03, alpha_2 = 1.50 +/- 0.07and a break at t_b = 0.48 +/- 0.03 days after the grb, provides the best fit ofthe optical afterglow decline. this shape is interpreted as due to collimatedemission, for which we determine a jet opening angle theta_{jet} of about 3.2degrees. an achromatic bump starting around 0.2 d after the grb is possiblymarginally detected in the optical light curves. optical spectroscopy shows thepresence of two rest-frame ultraviolet metal absorption systems at z = 1.5216+/- 0.0006 and at z = 1.295 +/- 0.001, the former likely associated with thegrb host galaxy. analysis of the absorption lines at z = 1.5216 suggests thatthe host of this grb may be a damped lyman-alpha absorber. the optical v-bandafterglow appears polarized, with p= (2.4 +/- 0.6) % and theta = (170 +/- 7)degrees, suggesting an asymmetric blastwave expansion. an x-ray-to-opticalspectral flux distribution of the grb 030328 afterglow was obtained at 0.78days after the grb and fitted using a broken powerlaw, with an optical spectralslope beta_{opt} = 0.47 +/- 0.15, and an x-ray slope beta_{x} = 1.0 +/- 0.2.the discussion of these results in the context of the "fireball model" showsthat the preferred scenario for this afterglow is collimated structured jetwith fixed opening angle in a homogeneous medium.

astro-ph;0604389	relativistic ejecta from xrf 060218 and the rate of cosmic explosions	over the last decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) including thesubclass of x-ray flashes (xrfs) have been revealed to be a rare variety oftype ibc supernova (sn). while all these events result from the death ofmassive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of grbs and xrfs exceed thoseof ordinary type ibc sne by many orders of magnitude. the essential physicalprocess that causes a dying star to produce a grb or xrf, and not just an sn,remains the crucial open question. here we present radio and x-ray observationsof xrf 060218 (associated with sn 2006aj), the second nearest grb identifiedto-date, which allow us to measure its total energy and place it in the largercontext of cosmic explosions. we show that this event is 100 times lessenergetic but ten times more common than cosmological grbs. moreover, it isdistinguished from ordinary type ibc sne by the presence of 10^48 erg coupledto mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed,rapidly rotating compact source) which produces x-rays for weeks after theexplosion. this suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the keyphysical distinction between grbs/xrfs and ordinary sne, while the nature ofthe central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts fromlow-luminosity, spherical events like xrf 060218.

astro-ph;0604580	an energetic afterglow from a distant stellar explosion	we present the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the high redshift(z=6.295) burst grb 050904. the peak flux density for this burst is similar totypical low-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grb). we further show that beyond aredshift of order unity, the flux density of radio afterglows are largelyinsensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. by combining the existingx-ray, near-infrared and radio measurements, we derive estimates for thekinetic energy and opening angle of the blast wave, and for the density of thecircumburst medium into which it expands. both the kinetic and radiated energyindicate that grb 050904 was an unusally energetic burst (10**52 erg). moreimportantly, we are able to make an in situ measurement of the densitystructure of the circumburst medium. we conclude that grb 050904 exploded intoa constant density medium with n=680 cm**-3, which is two orders of magnitudeabove the nominal value for low-redshift grbs. the next generation ofcentimeter (evla) and millimeter radio instuments (alma) will be able toroutinely detect events like grb 050904 and use them to study magnetic fields,and the atomic and molecular gas in the high redshift universe.

astro-ph;0608183	multi-wavelength observations of grb 050820a: an exceptionally energetic  event followed from start to finish	we present observations of the unusually bright and long gamma-ray burst grb050820a, one of the best-sampled broadband data sets in the swift era. thegamma-ray light curve is marked by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before themain event; the lack of any intervening emission suggests that it is due to aphysical mechanism distinct from the grb itself. the large time lag between theprecursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in thegamma-ray, x-ray, and optical band-passes, something only achieved for ahandful of events to date. while the contemporaneous x-rays are the low-energytail of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the gamma-rayflux. instead, the early-time optical data appear mostly consistent with theforward shock synchrotron peak passing through the optical, and are thereforelikely the beginning of the afterglow. on hour time scales after the burst, thex-ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with an adiabatic expansion ofthe shock into the surrounding region, but rather indicate that there is aperiod of energy injection. observations at late times allow us to constrainthe collimation angle of the relativistic outflow to theta = 6.8 - 9.3 degrees.our estimates of both the kinetic energy of the afterglow and the promptgamma-ray energy release make grb 050820a one of the most energetic events forwhich such values could be determined.

astro-ph;0611128	a new population of high redshift short-duration gamma-ray bursts	the redshift distribution of the short-duration grbs is a crucial, butcurrently fragmentary, clue to the nature of their progenitors. here we presentoptical observations of nine short grbs obtained with gemini, magellan, and thehubble space telescope. we detect the afterglows and host galaxies of two shortbursts, and host galaxies for two additional bursts with known opticalafterglow positions, and five with x-ray positions (&lt;6'' radius). in eight ofthe nine cases we find that the most probable host galaxies are faint,r~23-26.5 mag, and are therefore starkly different from the first few short grbhosts with r~17-22 mag and z&lt;0.5. indeed, we measure spectroscopic redshifts ofz~0.4-1.1 for the four brightest hosts. a comparison to large field galaxysamples, as well as the hosts of long grbs and previous short grbs, indicatesthat the fainter hosts likely reside at z&gt;1. our most conservative limit isthat at least half of the five hosts without a known redshift reside at z&gt;0.7(97% confidence level), suggesting that about 1/3-2/3 of all short grbsoriginate at higher redshifts than previously determined. this has twoimportant implications: (i) we constrain the acceptable age distributions to awide lognormal (sigma&gt;1) with tau~4-8 gyr, or to a power law, p(tau)~tau^n,with -1&lt;n&lt;0; and (ii) the inferred isotropic energies,e_{gamma,iso}~10^50-10^52 erg, are significantly larger than ~10^48-10^49 ergfor the low redshift short grbs, indicating a large spread in energy release orjet opening angles. finally, we re-iterate the importance of short grbs aspotential gravitational wave sources and find a conservative advanced ligodetection rate of ~2-6 yr^-1.

astro-ph;0703192	grb 060505: a possible short-duration gamma-ray burst in a star forming  region at redshift of 0.09	on 2006 may 5, a four second duration, low energy, ~10^49 erg, gamma-rayburst (grb) was observed, spatially associated with a z=0.0894 galaxy. here, wereport the discovery of the grb optical afterglow and observations of itsenvironment using gemini-south, hubble space telescope (hst), chandra, swiftand the very large array. the optical afterglow of this grb is spatiallyassociated with a prominent star forming region in the sc-type galaxy 2dfgrss173z112. its proximity to a star forming region suggests that the progenitordelay time, from birth to explosion, is smaller than about 10 myr. our hst deepimaging rules out the presence of a supernova brighter than an absolutemagnitude of about -11 (or -12.6 in case of ``maximal'' extinction) at abouttwo weeks after the burst, and limits the ejected mass of radioactive nickel 56to be less than about 2x10^-4 solar mass (assuming no extinction). although itwas suggested that grb 060505 may belong to a new class of long-duration grbswith no supernova, we argue that the simplest interpretation is that thephysical mechanism responsible for this burst is the same as for short-durationgrbs.
