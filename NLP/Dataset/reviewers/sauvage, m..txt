1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.1611	far-infrared line imaging of the starburst ring in ngc 1097 with the  herschel/pacs spectrometer	ngc 1097 is a nearby sbb galaxy with a seyfert nucleus and a bright starburstring. we study the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in thering using spatially resolved far-infrared spectral maps of the circumnuclearstarburst ring of ngc 1097, obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board theherschel space telescope. in particular, we map the important ism cooling anddiagnostic emission lines of [oi] 63 $\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, [nii] 122$\mu$m, [cii] 158 $\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m. we observe that in the [oi] 63$\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, and [nii] 122 $\mu$m line maps, the emission isenhanced in clumps along the ne part of the ring. we observe evidence of rapidrotation in the circumnuclear ring, with a rotation velocity of ~220$ kms$^{-1}$ (inclination uncorrected) measured in all lines. the [oi] 63$\mu$m/[cii] 158 $\mu$m ratio varies smoothly throughout the central region,and is enhanced on the northeastern part of the ring, which may indicate astronger radiation field. this enhancement coincides with peaks in the [oi] 63$\mu$m and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m maps. variations of the [nii] 122 $\mu$m/[nii] 205$\mu$m ratio correspond to a range in the ionized gas density between 150 and400 cm$^{-3}$.

1005.1615	star formation triggered by the galactic hii region rcw 120: first  results from the herschel space observatory	by means of different physical mechanisms, the expansion of hii regions canpromote the formation of new stars of all masses. rcw 120 is a nearby galactichii region where triggered star formation occurs. this region is well-studied -there being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. however, it issurrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtainan unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establishwhether very young protostars are present. we attempt to identify all youngstellar objects (ysos), especially those previously undetected at shorterwavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into thestar formation history in this region. we use herschel-pacs and -spire imagesto determine the distribution of ysos observed in the field. we use a spectralenergy distribution fitting tool to derive the ysos physical properties.herschel-pacs and -spire images confirm the existence of a young source andallow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 msun) class 0 object(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massivecondensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. this source was notdetected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the mispgal 70 micron data.several other red sources are detected at herschel wavelengths and coincidewith the peaks of the millimeter condensations. sed fitting results for thebrightest herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive class 0 thatforms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around rcw 120. theysos observed on the borders of rcw 120 are younger than its ionizing star,which has an age of about 2.5 myr.

1005.1865	the herschel revolution: unveiling the morphology of the high mass star  formation sites n44 and n63 in the lmc	we study the structure of the medium surrounding sites of high-mass starformation to determine the interrelation between the hii regions and theenvironment from which they were formed. the density distribution of thesurroundings is key in determining how the radiation of the newly formed starsinteracts with the surrounds in a way that allows it to be used as a starformation tracer. we present new herschel/spire 250, 350 and 500 mum data oflha 120-n44 and lha 120-n63 in the lmc. we construct average spectral energydistributions (seds) for annuli centered on the ir bright part of the starformation sites. the annuli cover ~10-~100 pc. we use a phenomenological dustmodel to fit these seds to derive the dust column densities, characterise theincident radiation field and the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonmolecules. we see a factor 5 decrease in the radiation field energy density asa function of radial distance around n63. n44 does not show a systematic trend.we construct a simple geometrical model to derive the 3-d density profile ofthe surroundings of these two regions. herschel/spire data have proven veryefficient in deriving the dust mass distribution. we find that the radiationfield in the two sources behaves very differently. n63 is more or lessspherically symmetric and the average radiation field drops with distance. n44shows no systematic decrease of the radiation intensity which is probably dueto the inhomogeneity of the surrounding molecular material and to the complexdistribution of several star forming clusters in the region.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1942	the effects of star formation on the low-metallicity ism: ngc4214 mapped  with herschel/pacs spectroscopy	we present herschel/pacs spectroscopic maps of the dwarf galaxy nc4214observed in 6 far infrared fine-structure lines: [c ii] 158mu, [o iii] 88mu, [oi] 63mu, [o i] 146mu, [n ii] 122mu, and [n ii] 205mu. the maps are sampled tothe full telescope spatial resolution and reveal unprecedented detail on ~ 150pc size scales. we detect [c ii] emission over the whole mapped area, [o iii]being the most luminous fir line. the ratio of [o iii]/[c ii] peaks at about 2toward the sites of massive star formation, higher than ratios seen in dustystarburst galaxies. the [c ii]/co ratios are 20 000 to 70 000 toward the 2massive clusters, which are at least an order of magnitude larger than spiralor dusty starbursts, and cannot be reconciled with single-slab pdr models.toward the 2 massive star-forming regions, we find that l[cii] is 0.5 to 0.8%of the ltir . all of the lines together contribute up to 2% of ltir . theseextreme findings are a consequence of the lower metallicity and young,massive-star formation commonly found in dwarf galaxies. these conditionspromote large-scale photodissociation into the molecular reservoir, which isevident in the fir line ratios. this illustrates the necessity to move tomultiphase models applicable to star-forming clusters or galaxies as a whole.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1005.2592	the youngest massive protostars in the large magellanic cloud	we demonstrate the unique capabilities of herschel to study very youngluminous extragalactic young stellar objects (ysos) by analyzing a centralstrip of the large magellanic cloud obtained through the heritage sciencedemonstration program. we combine pacs 100 and 160, and spire 250, 350, and 500microns photometry with 2mass (1.25-2.17 microns) and spitzer irac and mips(3.6-70 microns) to construct complete spectral energy distributions (seds) ofcompact sources. from these, we identify 207 candidate embedded ysos in theobserved region, ~40% never-before identified. we discuss their position infar-infrared color-magnitude space, comparing with previously studied,spectroscopically confirmed ysos and maser emission. all have red colorsindicating massive cool envelopes and great youth. we analyze four exampleysos, determining their physical properties by fitting their seds withradiative transfer models. fitting full seds including the herschel datarequires us to increase the size and mass of envelopes included in the models.this implies higher accretion rates (greater than or equal to 0.0001 m_sun/yr),in agreement with previous outflow studies of high-mass protostars. our resultsshow that herschel provides reliable longwave seds of large samples ofhigh-mass ysos; discovers the youngest ysos whose seds peak in herschel bands;and constrains the physical properties and evolutionary stages of ysos moreprecisely than was previously possible.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.2787	dust in the bright supernova remnant n49 in the lmc	we investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (snr) n49 inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) as observed with the herschel spaceobservatory. n49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecularcloud along its eastern edge. we have used pacs and spire to measure the far irflux densities of the entire snr and of a bright region on the eastern edge ofthe snr where the snr shock is encountering the molecular cloud. using thesefluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate thedust mass associated with n49 to be about 10 msun. the bulk of the dust in oursimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 k, similar to that ofnearby molecular clouds. unfortunately, as a result of the limited angularresolution of herschel at the wavelengths sampled with spire, the uncertaintiesare fairly large. assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with thesnr is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the snrarises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significantx-ray emission. the total amount of warm 50-60 k dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 msun,depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicategrains. this provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust inn49.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3115	filamentary structures and compact objects in the aquila and polaris  clouds observed by herschel	our pacs and spire images of the aquila rift and part of the polaris flareregions, taken during the science demonstration phase of herschel discoveredfascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physicallyrelated to compact cores. we briefly describe a new multi-scale,multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measuretheir parameters in our herschel images. all of the extracted starless cores(541 in aquila and 302 in polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrowfilaments. with its combination of the far-ir resolution and sensitivity,herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in aquilaand 59 arcsec in polaris (9000 au in both regions). our first results ofobservations with herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores mayoriginate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thinfilaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. to unravel the roles of theprocesses, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;these follow-up observations are planned.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.4023	the displaced dusty ism of ngc 3077: tidal stripping in the m 81 triplet	we present the detection of extended (~30 kpc^2) dust emission in the tidal\hi\ arm near ngc 3077 (member of the m\,81 triplet) using spire on boardherschel. dust emission in the tidal arm is typically detected where the \hi\column densities are &gt;10^21 cm^-2. the spire band ratios show that the dust inthe tidal arm is significantly colder (~13 k) than in ngc 3077 itself (~31 k),consistent with the lower radiation field in the tidal arm. the total dust massin the tidal arm is ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun (assuming beta=2), i.e. substantiallylarger than the dust mass associated with ngc 3077 (~2 x 10^5 m_sun). wheredust is detected, the dust-to-gas ratio is 6+/-3 x 10^-3, consistent within theuncertainties with what is found in ngc 3077 and nearby spiral galaxies withgalactic metallicities. the faint hii regions in the tidal arm can not beresponsible for the detected enriched material and are not the main source ofthe dust heating in the tidal arm. we conclude that the interstellar medium(atomic hi, molecules and dust) in this tidal feature was pre-enriched andstripped off ngc 3077 during its recent interaction (~3 x 10^8 yr ago) with m82 and m 81. this implies that interaction can efficiently remove heavyelements and enriched material (dust, molecular gas) from galaxies. asinteractions were more frequent at large lookback times, it is conceivable thatthey could substantially contribute (along with galactic outflows) to theenrichment of the intergalactic medium.

1209.6057	physical conditions in the gas phases of the giant hii region lmc-n11  unveiled by herschel - i. diffuse [cii] and [oiii] emission in lmc-n11b	(abridged) the magellanic clouds provide a nearby laboratory for metal-poordwarf galaxies. the low dust abundance enhances the penetration of uv photonsinto the interstellar medium (ism), resulting in a relatively larger fillingfactor of the ionized gas. furthermore, there is likely a hidden molecular gasreservoir probed by the [cii]157um line. we present herschel/pacs maps inseveral tracers, [cii], [oi]63um,145um, [nii]122um, [niii]57um, and [oiii]88umin the hii region n11b in the large magellanic cloud. halpha and [oiii]5007aimages were used as complementary data to investigate the effect of dustextinction. observations were interpreted with photoionization models to inferthe gas conditions and estimate the ionized gas contribution to the [cii]emission. photodissociation regions (pdrs) are probed through polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). we first study the distribution and properties ofthe ionized gas. we then constrain the origin of [cii]157um by comparing totracers of the low-excitation ionized gas and of pdrs. [oiii] is dominated byextended emission from the high-excitation diffuse ionized gas; it is thebrightest far-infrared line, ~4 times brighter than [cii]. the extent of the[oiii] emission suggests that the medium is rather fragmented, allowing far-uvphotons to permeate into the ism to scales of &gt;30pc. furthermore, by comparing[cii] with [nii], we find that 95% of [cii] arises in pdrs, except toward thestellar cluster for which as much as 15% could arise in the ionized gas. wefind a remarkable correlation between [cii]+[oi] and pah emission, with [cii]dominating the cooling in diffuse pdrs and [oi] dominating in the densest pdrs.the combination of [cii] and [oi] provides a proxy for the total gas cooling inpdrs. our results suggest that pah emission describes better the pdr gasheating as compared to the total infrared emission.

1211.4257	the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the  herschel pacs photometer psf and noise	we investigate the effect of the "high-pass filter" data reduction techniqueon the herschel pacs psf and noise of the pacs maps at the 70, 100 and 160 umbands and in medium and fast scan speeds. this branch of the pacs photometerpipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-sourceobservations.the calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal appliedby the pacs pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulationsobtained by "polluting" real pacs timelines with fake sources at different fluxlevels. the effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final mapnoise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high dataredundancy. we show that the running median removal can cause significant fluxlosses at any flux level. we analyse the advantages and disadvantages ofseveral masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circularpatches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of fluxloss. we provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for severalmasking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as afunction of the source flux. we also show that, for stacking analysis, theimpact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly theclustering effect. the analysis of the global noise and noise components of thepacs maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise isthe high-pass filter width. we also provide simple fitting functions to buildthe error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlationcorrection factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameterspace.

1212.1208	the co-to-h2 conversion factor and dust-to-gas ratio on kiloparsec  scales in nearby galaxies	we present kiloparsec (kpc) spatial resolution maps of the co-to-h2conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (dgr) in 26 nearby,star-forming galaxies. we have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and dgr byassuming that the dgr is approximately constant on kpc scales. with thisassumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, co integratedintensity and hi column density to solve for both alpha_co and dgr with noassumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolutionfar-ir maps from the herschel key program kingfish, 12co j=(2-1) maps from theiram 30m large program heracles and hi 21-cm line maps from things. we use afixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co resultson the more typically used 12co j=(1-0) scale and show using literaturemeasurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. intotal, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and dgr. on average,alpha_co = 3.1 msun pc^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standarddeviation of 0.3 dex. within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile ofalpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. however, most galaxies exhibita lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, onaverage. in some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10below the standard milky way (mw) value of alpha_co,mw =4.4 msun pc^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1. while for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,dgr is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriatealpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

1302.2825	the thermal dust emission in the n158-n159-n160 (lmc) star forming  complex mapped by spitzer, herschel and laboca	we present a study of the infrared/submm emission of the lmc star formingcomplex n158-n159-n160. combining observations from the spitzer space telescope(3.6-70um), the herschel space observatory (100-500um) and laboca (870um)allows us to work at the best angular resolution available now for anextragalactic source. we observe a remarkably good correlation between spireand laboca emission and resolve the low surface brightnesses emission. we usethe spitzer and herschel data to perform a resolved spectral energydistribution (sed) modelling of the complex. using mbb, we derive a globalemissivity index beta_c of 1.47. if beta cold is fixed to 1.5, we find anaverage temperature of 27k. we also apply the galliano et al. (2011) modellingtechnique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of thestar formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of pahs or thedust mass surface density of the region. we observe that the pah fractionstrongly decreases in the hii regions. this decrease coincides with peaks inthe mean radiation field intensity map. the dust surface densities follow thefir distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 msolar (2.8 times lessthan when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. we find anon-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud n159 south (showing nomassive sf). we also investigate the drivers of the herschel/pacs and spiresubmm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) andthe xco conversion factor in the region n159. we finally model individualregions to analyse variations in the sed shape across the complex and the 870umemission in more details. no measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems tobe detected in these regions.

1304.1541	star formation rates in resolved galaxies: calibrations with near and  far infrared data for ngc5055 and ngc6946	we use the near--infrared br\gamma hydrogen recombination line as a referencestar formation rate (sfr) indicator to test the validity and establish thecalibration of the {\it herschel} pacs 70 \mu m emission as a sfr tracer forsub--galactic regions in external galaxies. br\gamma offers the doubleadvantage of directly tracing ionizing photons and of being relativelyinsensitive to the effects of dust attenuation. for our first experiment, weuse archival cfht br\gamma and ks images of two nearby galaxies: ngc\,5055 andngc\,6946, which are also part of the {\it herschel} program kingfish (keyinsights on nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel). we use theextinction corrected br\gamma emission to derive the sfr(70) calibration forh{\sc ii} regions in these two galaxies. a comparison of the sfr(70)calibrations at different spatial scales, from 200 pc to the size of the wholegalaxy, reveals that about 50% of the total 70\mu m emission is due to dustheated by stellar populations that are unrelated to the current star formation.we use a simple model to qualitatively relate the increase of the sfr(70)calibration coefficient with decreasing region size to the star formationtimescale. we provide a calibration for an unbiased sfr indicator that combinesthe observed h\alpha with the 70 \mu m emission, also for use in h{\sc ii}regions. we briefly analyze the pacs 100 and 160 \mu m maps and find thatlonger wavelengths are not as good sfr indicators as 70\mu m, in agreement withprevious results. we find that the calibrations show about 50% differencebetween the two galaxies, possibly due to effects of inclination.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1309.6338	cold dust but warm gas in the unusual elliptical galaxy ngc 4125	data from the herschel space observatory have revealed an unusual ellipticalgalaxy, ngc 4125, which has strong and extended submillimeter emission fromcold dust but only very strict upper limits to its co and hi emission.depending on the dust emissivity, the total dust mass is 2-5x10^6 msun. whilethe neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is extremely low (&lt; 12-30), including theionized gas traced by [cii] emission raises this limit to &lt; 39-100. the dustemission follows a similar r^{1/4} profile to the stellar light and the dust tostellar mass ratio is towards the high end of what is found in nearbyelliptical galaxies. we suggest that ngc 4125 is currently in an unusual phasewhere evolved stars produced in a merger-triggered burst of star formation arepumping large amounts of gas and dust into the interstellar medium. in thisscenario, the low neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is explained by the gas beingheated to temperatures &gt;= 10^4 k faster than the dust is evaporated. ifgalaxies like ngc 4125, where the far-infrared emission does not trace neutralgas in the usual manner, are common at higher redshift, this could havesignificant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies andgalaxy evolution.

1312.0944	alma observations of cool dust in a low-metallicity starburst,  sbs0335-052	we present atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) cycle 0 band 7observations of an extremely metal-poor dwarf starburst galaxy in the localuniverse, sbs0335-052 (12+log(o/h)~7.2). with these observations, dust isdetected at 870micron (alma band 7), but 87% of the flux in this band is due tofree-free emission from the starburst. we have compiled a spectral energydistribution (sed) of sbs0335-052 that spans almost 6 orders of magnitude inwavelength and fit it with a spherical dust shell heated by a single-agestellar population; the best-fit model gives a dust mass of (3.8+/-0.6)x10^4msun. we have also constructed a sed including herschel archival data forizw18, another low-metallicity dwarf starburst (12+log(o/h)=7.17), and fit itwith a similar model to obtain a dust mass of (3.4+/-1.0)x10^2 msun. comparedwith their atomic gas mass, the dust mass of sbs0335-052 far exceeds theprediction of a linear trend of dust-to-gas mass ratio with metallicity, whileizw18 falls far below. we use gas scaling relations to assess a putativemissing gas component in both galaxies and find that the missing, possiblymolecular, gas in sbs0335-052 is a factor of 6 times higher than the valueinferred from the observed hi column density; in izw18 the missing component is4 times smaller. ultimately, despite their similarly low metallicity, thedifferences in gas and dust column densities in sbs0335-052 and izw18 suggestthat metal abundance does not uniquely define star-formation processes. at somelevel, self-shielding and the survival of molecules may depend just as much ongas and dust column density as on metallicity. the effects of low metallicitymay at least be partially compensated for by large column densities in theinterstellar medium.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1410.8493	jet-induced star formation by a microquasar	theoretical and observational work show that jets from agn can trigger starformation. however, in the milky way the first -and so far- only clear case ofrelativistic jets inducing star formation has been found in the surroundings ofthe microquasar grs 1915+105. here we summarize the multiwavelengthobservations of two compact star formation iras sources axisymmetricallylocated and aligned with the position angle of the sub-arcsec relativistic jetsfrom the stellar black hole binary grs 1915+105 (mirabel &amp; rodriguez 1994). theobservations of these two star forming regions at centimeter (rodriguez &amp;mirabel 1998), millimeter and infrared (chaty et al. 2001) wavelengths hadsuggested -despite the large uncertainties in the distances a decade ago- thatthe jets from grs 1915+105 are triggering along the radio jet axis theformation of massive stars in a radio lobe of bow shock structure. recently,reid et al.(2014) found that the jet source and the iras sources are at thesame distance, enhancing the evidence for the physical association between thejets from grs 1915+105 and star formation in the iras sources. we conclude thatas jets from agn, jets from microquasars can trigger the formation of massivestars, but at distances of a few tens of parsecs. although star formationinduced by microquasar jets may not be statistically significant in the milkyway, jets from stellar black holes may have been important to trigger starformation during the re-ionization epoch of the universe (mirabel et al. 2011).because of the relative proximity of grs 1915+105 and the associated starforming regions, they may serve as a nearby laboratory to gain insight into thephysics of jet-trigger star formation elsewhere in the universe.

1501.03634	star-formation rates from young-star counts and the structure of the ism  across the ngc346/n66 complex in the smc	the rate at which interstellar gas is converted into stars, and itsdependence on environment, is one of the pillars on which our understanding ofthe visible universe is build. we present a comparison of the surface densityof young stars (sigma_*) and dust surface density (sigma_d) across ngc346 (n66)in 115 independent pixels of 6x6 pc^2. we find a correlation between sigma_*and sigma_d with a considerable scatter. a power law fit to the data yields asteep relation with an exponent of 2.6+-0.2. we convert sigma_d to gas surfacedensity (sigma_g) and sigma_* to star formation rate (sfr) surface densities(sigma_sfr), using simple assumptions for the gas-to-dust mass ratio and theduration of star formation. the derived total sfr (4+-1 10^-3 m_sun/yr) isconsistent with sfr estimated from the ha emission integrated over the hanebula. on small scales the sigma_sfr derived using ha systematicallyunderestimates the count-based sigma_sfr, by up to a factor of 10. this is dueto ionizing photons escaping the area, where the stars are counted. we findthat individual 36 pc^2 pixels fall systematically above integrateddisc-galaxies in the schmidt-kennicutt diagram by on average a factor of ~7.the ngc346 average sfr over a larger area (90 pc radius) lies closer to therelation but remains high by a factor of ~3. the fraction of the total mass(gas plus young stars) locked in young stars is systematically high (~10 percent) within the central 15 pc and systematically lower outside (2 per cent),which we interpret as variations in star formation efficiency. the inner 15 pcis dominated by young stars belonging to a centrally condensed cluster, whilethe outer parts are dominated by a dispersed population. therefore, theobserved trend could reflect a change of star formation efficiency betweenclustered and non-clustered star-formation.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

astro-ph;0005376	mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish agns from starbursts	we present new mid-infrared (mir) diagnostics to distinguish emission ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) from that originating in starburst regions. ourmethod uses empirical spectroscopic criteria based on the fact that miremission from star forming or active galaxies arises mostly from hii regions,photo-dissociation regions (pdrs) and agns. the analysis of the strength of the6.2micron unidentified infrared band (uib) and the mir continuum shows thatuibs are very faint or absent in regions harboring the intense and hardradiation fields of agns and pure hii regions, where the uib carriers could bedestroyed. the mir signature of agns is the presence of an important continuumin the 3-10micron band which originates from very hot dust heated by theintense agn radiation field. using these two distinct spectral properties foundin our mir templates, we build diagnostic diagrams which provide quantitativeestimates of the agn, pdr and hii region contribution in a given mir spectrum.this new mir classification can be used to reveal the presence of agns highlyobscured by large columns of dust.

astro-ph;0104087	the impact of bars on the mid-infrared dust emission of spiral galaxies:  global and circumnuclear properties	we study the mid-infrared properties of a sample of 69 nearby spiralgalaxies, selected to avoid seyfert activity contributing a significantfraction of the central energetics, or strong tidal interaction, and to havenormal infrared luminosities. these observations were obtained with isocam,which provides an angular resolution of the order of 10 arcsec (half-powerdiameter of the point spread function) and low-resolution spectro-imaginginformation. between 5 and 18 microns, we mainly observe two dust phases,aromatic infrared bands and very small grains, both out of thermal equilibrium.on this sample, we show that the global f15/f7 colors of galaxies are veryuniform, the only increase being found in early-type strongly barred galaxies,consistent with previous iras studies. the f15/f7 excesses are unambiguouslydue to galactic central regions where bar-induced starbursts occur. however,the existence of strongly barred early-type galaxies with normal circumnuclearcolors indicates that the relationship between a distortion of thegravitational potential and a central starburst is not straightforward. as thephysical processes at work in central regions are in principle identical inbarred and unbarred galaxies, and since this is where the mid-infrared activityis mainly located, we investigate the mid-infrared circumnuclear properties ofall the galaxies in our sample. we show how surface brightnesses and colors arerelated to both the available molecular gas content and the mean age of stellarpopulations contributing to dust heating. therefore, the star formation historyin galactic central regions can be constrained by their position in acolor-surface brightness mid-infrared diagram.

astro-ph;0104088	the relationship between star formation rates and mid-infrared emission  in galactic disks	the halpha and mid-infrared mean disk surface brightnesses are compared in asample of nearby spirals observed by isocam. this shows that, in spiral disks,dust emission at 7 and 15 microns provides a reasonable star formation tracer.the fact that the 15 to 7 micron flux ratio is nearly constant in variousglobal exciting conditions indicates a common origin, namely the aromaticinfrared band carriers, and implies that at these wavelengths, dust emissionfrom the disks of normal galaxies is dominated by photodissociation regions andnot by hii regions themselves. we use this newly-found correlation between themid-infrared and the halpha line to investigate the nature of the link betweenthe far-infrared (60 and 100 microns) and halpha. although the separation ofthe central regions from the disk is impossible to achieve in the far-infrared,we show that a circumnuclear contribution to the dust emission, having noequivalent counterpart in halpha, is most likely responsible for the well-knownnon-linearity between far-infrared and halpha fluxes in spiral galaxies. wederive a calibration of 7 and 15 micron fluxes in terms of star formation ratesfrom a primary calibration of halpha in the literature, and also outline theapplicability limits of the proposed conversion, which should not be blindlyextrapolated to objects whose nature is unknown.

astro-ph;0205401	extended mid-infrared emission from vv 114: probing the birth of a ulirg	we present our 5-16 micron spectro-imaging observations of vv114, an infraredluminous early-stage merger, taken with the isocam camera on-board iso. we findthat only 40% of the mid-infrared (mir) flux is associated with a compactnuclear region, while the rest of the emission originates from a rather diffusecomponent extended over several kpc. this is in stark contrast with the verycompact mir starbursts usually seen in luminous infrared galaxies. a secondarypeak of mir emission is associated with an extra-nuclear star forming regionwhich displays the largest halpha equivalent width in the whole system.comparing our data with the distribution of the molecular gas and cold dust, aswell as with radio observations, it becomes evident that the conversion ofmolecular gas into stars can be triggered over large areas at the very firststages of an interaction. the presence of a very strong continuum at 5 micronsin one of the sources indicates that an enshrouded active galactic nucleus maycontribute to 40% of its mir flux. we finally note that the relative variationsin the uv to radio spectral properties between the merging galaxies provideevidence that the extinction-corrected star formation rate of similar objectsat high z, such as those detected in optical deep surveys, can not beaccurately derived from their rest-frame uv properties.

astro-ph;0311154	dust enshrouded star-forming activity in arp 299	we present mid-infrared spectro-imaging (5 - 16 microns) observations of theinfrared luminous interacting system arp 299 (=mrk171 =ic694+ngc3690) obtainedwith the isocam instrument aboard iso. our observations show that nearly 40% ofthe total emission at 7 and 15 microns is diffuse, originating from theinteracting disks of the galaxies. moreover, they indicate the presence oflarge amounts of hot dust in the main infrared sources of the system and largeextinctions toward the nuclei. while the observed spectra have an overallsimilar shape, mainly composed of unidentified infrared bands (uib) in theshort wavelength domain, a strong continuum at ~ 13 microns and a deep silicateabsorption band at 10 microns, their differences reveal the varying physicalconditions of each component. for each source, the spectral energy distribution(sed) can be reproduced by a linear combination of a uib "canonical" spectraltemplate and a hot dust continuum due to a 230-300 k black body, afterindependently applying an extinction correction to both of them. we find thatthe uib extinction does not vary much throughout the system (a_v ~ 5 mag)suggesting that most uibs originate from less enshrouded regions. ic694 appearsto dominate the infrared emission of the system and our observations supportthe interpretation of a deeply embedded nuclear starburst located behind anabsorption of about 40 mag. the central region of ngc3690 displays a hardradiation field characterized by a [neiii]/[neii] ratio &gt; 1.8. it also hosts astrong continuum from 5 to 16 microns which can be explained as thermalemission from a deeply embedded (a_v ~ 60 mag) compact source, consistent withthe mid-infrared signature of an active galactic nucleus (agn), and inagreement with recent x-ray findings.

astro-ph;0312029	dust emission in early-type galaxies: the mid-infrared view	we present mid-infrared (mir) maps for a sample of 18 early-type galaxiesobserved at 4.5, 6.7 and 15 microns with the isocam instrument on board the isosatellite with a 6'' spatial resolution. we model the spectral energydistribution (sed) of these galaxies using the stellar evolutionary synthesismodel pegase and we derive the mir excess over the stellar component. we thenexplore the nature of this excess in terms of dust and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon molecules (pahs). we find that out of 18 galaxies, 10 show excessat 6.7 microns (due to the presence of pah features) and 14 show excess at 15microns (due to the presence of warm dust). in two galaxies, where a morecomplete wavelength coverage exists, an excess around 9.7 microns is seen(presumably due to silicate dust emission), while two other galaxies aretotally devoid of dust. we also examine the morphology of the galaxies in thesewavelengths by plotting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles as well as themir color profiles. we find that for the majority of the galaxies the 4.5micron emission is well described by a de vaucouleurs profile. the 6.7 and 15micron emission is smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy while only a fewgalaxies show mir emission which is more concentrated close to the center. twodwarf galaxies in our sample show patchy distributions of the mir emissionwhile two other galaxies show edge-on disks. with color-color diagrams wedelineate the regions occupied by late-type and early-type galaxies. finally weshow that the mir excess found in strong radio galaxies like ngc 4486 (m87) canbe explained by synchrotron emission.

astro-ph;0402388	warm dust and aromatic bands as quantitative probes of star-formation  activity	we combine samples of spiral galaxies and starburst systems observed withisocam to investigate the reliability of mid-infrared (mir) dust emission as aquantitative tracer of star formation (sf) activity. the total sample coversvery diverse galactic environments and probes a much wider dynamic range in sfrate density than previous similar studies. we find that both the monochromatic15 micron continuum and the 5-8.5 micron emission constitute excellentindicators of the sf rate as quantified by the lyman continuum luminosityl_lyc, within specified validity limits which are different for the twotracers. normalized to projected surface area, the 15 micron luminosity s_15ctis directly proportional to s_lyc over several orders of magnitude. two regimesare distinguished from the relative offsets in the observed relation: theproportionality factor increases by a factor of ~ 5 between quiescent disks inspiral galaxies, and moderate to extreme star-forming environments incircumnuclear regions of spirals and in starburst systems. the transitionoccurs near s_lyc ~ 10^2 l_sun pc^{-2} and is interpreted as due to very smalldust grains starting to dominate the emission at 15 microns over aromaticspecies above this threshold. the 5-8.5 micron luminosity per unit area is alsoproportional to s_lyc, with a single conversion factor from the most quiescentobjects in the sample up to s_lyc ~ 10^4 l_sun pc^{-2}, where the relation thenflattens. the turnover is attributed to depletion of aromatic band carriers inthe harsher conditions prevailing in extreme starbursts. the observed relationsprovide empirical calibrations useful for estimating sf rates from mid-irobservations in deeply embedded hii regions and obscured starbursts, and forpredictions from evolutionary synthesis models.

astro-ph;0508027	dissecting the spiral galaxy m83: mid-infrared emission and comparison  with other tracers of star formation	we present a detailed mid-infrared study of the nearby, face-on spiral galaxym83 based on isocam data. m83 is a unique case study, since a wide variety ofmir broad-band filters as well as spectra, covering the wavelength range of 4to 18\mu m, were observed and are presented here. emission maxima trace thenuclear and bulge area, star-formation regions at the end of the bar, as wellas the inner spiral arms. the fainter outer spiral arms and interarm regionsare also evident in the mir map. spectral imaging of the central 3'x3' (4 kpc x4 kpc) field allows us to investigate five regions of different environments.the various mir components (very small grains, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) molecules, ionic lines) are analyzed for different regions throughout thegalaxy. in the total 4\mu m to 18\mu m wavelength range, the pahs dominate theluminosity, contributing between 60% in the nuclear and bulge regions and 90%in the less active, interarm regions. throughout the galaxy, the underlyingcontinuum emission from the small grains is always a smaller contribution inthe total mir wavelength regime, peaking in the nuclear and bulge components.the implications of using broad-band filters only to characterize themid-infrared emission of galaxies, a commonly used isocam observation mode, arediscussed. we present the first quantitative analysis of new h-alpha and 6cmvla+effelsberg radio continuum maps of m83. the distribution of the miremission is compared with that of the co, hi, r band, h-alpha and 6cm radio. astriking correlation is found between the intensities in the two mid-infraredfilter bands and the 6cm radio continuum. to explain the tightmid-infrared-radio correlation we propose the anchoring of magnetic field linesin the photoionized shells of gas clouds.

(2005) for a larger survey. combined effects of metallicityand radiation field seem to be playing important roles in the observed behaviorof pahs in the low metallicity systems.

astro-ph;9910297	the isocam/lw detector dark current behaviour	we describe the calibration, measurements and data reduction, of the darkcurrent of the isocam/lw detector. we point-out the existence of twosignificant drifts of the lw dark-current, one throughout the iso mission, on atimescale of days, another within each single revolution, on a timescale ofhours. we also show the existence of a dependence of the dark current on thetemperature of the isocam detector.  by characterizing all these effects through polynomial fittings, we build amodel for the lw calibration dark, that depends on the epoch of observation(parametrized with the revolution number and the time elapsed in that givenrevolution since the activation) and on the temperature of the isocam detector.the model parameters are tuned for each of isocam/lw pixel.  we show that the modelling is very effective in taking into account thedark-current variations and allows a much cleaner dark subtraction than using abrute average of several calibration dark images.  the residuals of the lw model-dark subtraction are, on average, similar tothe pre-launch expectation.
