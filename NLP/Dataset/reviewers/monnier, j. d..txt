0905.0120	detection of non-radial pulsation and faint companion in the symbiotic  star ch cyg	we have detected asymmetry in the symbiotic star ch cyg through themeasurement of precision closure-phase with the ionic beam combiner, at theiota interferometer. the position of the asymmetry changes with time and iscorrelated with the phase of the 2.1-yr period found in the radial velocitymeasurements for this star. we can model the time-dependent asymmetry either asthe orbit of a low-mass companion around the m giant or as an asymmetric, 20%change in brightness across the m giant. we do not detect a change in the sizeof the star during a 3 year monitoring period neither with respect to time norwith respect to wavelength. we find a spherical dust-shell with an emissionsize of 2.2+/-0.1 d* fwhm around the m giant star. the star to dust flux ratiois estimated to be 11.63+/-0.3. while the most likely explanation for the 20%change in brightness is non-radial pulsation we argue that a low-mass companionin close orbit could be the physical cause of the pulsation. the combinedeffect of pulsation and low-mass companion could explain the behaviour revealedby the radial-velocity curves and the time-dependent asymmetry detected in theclosure-phase data. if ch cyg is a typical long secondary period variable thenthese variations could be explained by the effect of an orbiting low-masscompanion on the primary star.

0905.0154	imaging the asymmetric dust shell around ci cam with long baseline  optical interferometry	we present the first high angular resolution observation of the b[e]star/x-ray transient object ci cam, performed with the two-telescope infraredoptical telescope array (iota), its upgraded three-telescope version (iota3t)and the palomar testbed interferometer (pti). visibilities and closure phaseswere obtained using the ionic-3 integrated optics beam combiner. ci cam wasobserved in the near-infrared h and k spectral bands, wavelengths well suitedto measure the size and study the geometry of the hot dust surrounding ci cam.the analysis of the visibility data over an 8 year period from soon after the1998 outburst to 2006 shows that the dust visibility has not changed over theyears. the visibility data shows that ci cam is elongated which confirms thedisc-shape of the circumstellar environment and totally rules out thehypothesis of a spherical dust shell. closure phase measurements show directevidence of asymmetries in the circumstellar environment of ci cam and weconclude that the dust surrounding ci cam lies in an inhomogeneous disc seen atan angle. the near-infrared dust emission appears as an elliptical skewedgaussian ring with a major axis a = 7.58 +/- 0.24 mas, an axis ratio r = 0.39+/- 0.03 and a position angle theta = 35 +/- 2 deg.

0905.3495	mid-infrared size survey of young stellar objects: description of keck  segment-tilting experiment and basic results	the mid-infrared properties of pre-planetary disks are sensitive to thetemperature and flaring profiles of disks for the regions where planetformation is expected to occur. in order to constrain theories of planetformation, we have carried out a mid-infrared (wavelength 10.7 microns) sizesurvey of young stellar objects using the segmented keck telescope in a novelconfiguration. we introduced a customized pattern of tilts to individual mirrorsegments to allow efficient sparse-aperture interferometry, allowing fullaperture synthesis imaging with higher calibration precision than traditionalimaging. in contrast to previous surveys on smaller telescopes and with poorercalibration precision, we find most objects in our sample are partiallyresolved. here we present the main observational results of our survey of 5embedded massive protostars, 25 herbig ae/be stars, 3 t tauri stars, 1 fu orisystem, and 5 emission-line objects of uncertain classification. the observedmid-infrared sizes do not obey the size-luminosity relation found atnear-infrared wavelengths and a companion paper will provide further modellinganalysis of this sample. in addition, we report imaging results for a few ofthe most resolved objects, including complex emission around embedded massiveprotostars, the photoevaporating circumbinary disk around mwc 361a, and thesubarcsecond binaries t tau, fu ori and mwc 1080.

0906.2241	imaging and modeling rapidly rotating stars: alpha cephei and alpha  ophiuchi	we present sub-milliarcseond resolution imaging and modeling of two nearbyrapid rotators alpha cephei and alpha ophiuchi, obtained with the chara array -the largest optical/ir interferometer in the world. incorporating a gravitydarkening model, we are able to determine the inclination, the polar andequatorial radius and temperature, as well as the fractional rotation speed ofthe two stars with unprecedented precision. the polar and equatorial regions ofthe two stars have ~2000k temperature gradient, causing their apparenttemperatures and luminosities to be dependent on their viewing angles. ourmodeling allow us to determine the true effective temperatures and luminositiesof alpha cep and alpha oph, permitting us to investigate their true locationson the h-r diagram. these properties in turn give us estimates of the massesand ages of the two stars within a few percent of error using stellar evolutionmodels. also, based on our gravity darkening modeling, we propose a new methodto estimate the masses of single stars in a more direct way through vsin(i)measurements and precise geometrical constraint. lastly, we investigate thedegeneracy between the inclination and the gravity darkening coefficient, whichespecially affects the modeling of alpha oph. although incorporating vsin(i)has lifted the degeneracy to some extent, higher resolution observations arestill needed to further constrain the parameters independently.

0910.3869	the pulsation of chi cygni imaged by optical interferometry; a novel  technique to derive distance and mass of mira stars	we present infrared interferometric imaging of the s-type mira star chicygni. the object was observed at four different epochs in 2005-2006 with theiota optical interferometer (h band). images show up to 40% variation in thestellar diameter, as well as significant changes in the limb darkening andstellar inhomogeneities. model fitting gave precise time-dependent values ofthe stellar diameter, and reveals presence and displacement of a warm molecularlayer. the star radius, corrected for limb darkening, has a mean value of 12.1mas and shows a 5.1mas amplitude pulsation. minimum diameter was observed atphase 0.94+/-0.01. maximum temperature was observed several days later at phase1.02+/-0.02. we also show that combining the angular acceleration of themolecular layer with co (delta v = 3) radial velocity measurements yields a5.9+/-1.5 mas parallax. the constant acceleration of the co molecules -- during80% of the pulsation cycle -- lead us to argument for a free-falling layer. theacceleration is compatible with a gravitational field produced by a2.1(+1.5/-0.7) solar mass star. this last value is in agreement withfundamental mode pulsator models. we foresee increased development oftechniques consisting in combining radial velocity with interferometric angularmeasurements, ultimately allowing total mapping of the speed, density, andposition of the diverse species in pulsation driven atmospheres.

1006.1651	spatially and spectrally resolved hydrogen gas within 0.1 au of t tauri  and herbig ae/be stars	we present near-infrared observations of t tauri and herbig ae/be stars witha spatial resolution of a few milli-arcseconds and a spectral resolution of~2000. our observations spatially resolve gas and dust in the inner regions ofprotoplanetary disks, and spectrally resolve broad-linewidth emission from thebrackett gamma transition of hydrogen gas. we use the technique ofspectro-astrometry to determine centroids of different velocity components ofthis gaseous emission at a precision orders of magnitude better than theangular resolution. in all sources, we find the gaseous emission to be morecompact than or distributed on similar spatial scales to the dust emission. weattempt to fit the data with models including both dust and brackettgamma-emitting gas, and we consider both disk and infall/outflow morphologiesfor the gaseous matter. in most cases where we can distinguish between thesetwo models, the data show a preference for infall/outflow models. in all cases,our data appear consistent with the presence of some gas at stellocentric radiiof ~0.01 au. our findings support the hypothesis that brackett gamma emissiongenerally traces magnetospherically driven accretion and/or outflows in youngstar/disk systems.

1006.3485	the inner regions of protoplanetary disks	to understand how planetary systems form in the dusty disks aroundpre-main-sequence stars a detailed knowledge of the structure and evolution ofthese disks is required. while this is reasonably well understood for theregions of the disk beyond about 1 au, the structure of these disks inward of 1au remains a puzzle. this is partly because it is very difficult to spatiallyresolve these regions with current telescopes. but it is also because thephysics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts toevaporate, is poorly understood. with infrared interferometry it has becomepossible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner au ofprotoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. these observations havepartly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questionsand puzzles. moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of theseregions is extremely challenging. in this review we give a rough overview ofthe history and recent developments in this exciting field of astrophysics.

1008.1727	probing local density inhomogeneities in the circumstellar disk of a be  star using the new spectro-astrometry mode at the keck interferometer	we report on the successful science verification phase of a new observingmode at the keck interferometer, which provides a line-spread function widthand sampling of 150km/s at k'-band, at a current limiting magnitude of k'~7magwith spatial resolution of lam/2b ~2.7mas and a measured differential phasestability of unprecedented precision (3mrad at k=5mag, which represents 3uas onsky or a centroiding precision of 10^-3). the scientific potential of this modeis demonstrated by the presented observations of the circumstellar disk of theevolved be-star 48lib. in addition to indirect methods such as multi-wavelengthspectroscopy and polaritmetry, the here described spectro-interferometricastrometry provides a new tool to directly constrain the radial densitystructure in the disk. we resolve for the first time several pfund emissionlines, in addition to brgam, in a single interferometric spectrum, and withadequate spatial and spectral resolution and precision to analyze the radialdisk structure in 48lib. the data suggest that the continuum and pf-emissionoriginates in significantly more compact regions, inside of the brgam emissionzone. thus, spectro-interferometric astrometry opens the opportunity todirectly connect the different observed line profiles of brgam and pfund in thetotal and correlated flux to different disk radii. the gravitational potentialof a rotationally flattened be star is expected to induce a one-armed densityperturbation in the circumstellar disk. such a slowly rotating disk oscillationhas been used to explain the well known periodic v/r spectral profilevariability in these stars, as well as the observed v/r cycle phase shiftsbetween different disk emission lines. the differential line properties andlinear constraints set by our data lend support to the existence of aradius-dependent disk density perturbation.

1108.3698	hot exozodiacal dust resolved around vega with iota/ionic	although debris discs have been detected around a significant number ofmain-sequence stars, only a few of them are known to harbour hot dust in theirinner part where terrestrial planets may have formed. thanks to infraredinterferometric observations, it is possible to obtain a direct measurement ofthese regions, which are of prime importance for preparing future exo-earthcharacterisation missions. in this context, we have resolved the exozodiacaldust disc around vega with the help of infrared stellar interferometry andestimated the integrated h-band flux originating from the first few aus of thedebris disc. using precise h-band interferometric measurements obtained withthe 3-telescope iota/ionic interferometer (mount hopkins, arizona), thoroughmodelling of both interferometric data (squared visibility and closure phase)and spectral energy distribution was performed to constrain the nature of thenear-infrared excess emission. the most straightforward scenario consists in acompact dust disc producing a thermal emission that is largely dominated bysmall grains located between 0.1 and 0.3 au from vega and accounting for 1.23+/- 0.45% of the near-infrared stellar flux for our best-fit model. this fluxratio is shown to vary slightly with the geometry of the model used to fit ourinterferometric data (variations within +/-0.19%). initially revealed by k-bandchara/fluor observations, the presence of hot exozodiacal dust in the vicinityof vega is confirmed by our h-band iota/ionic measurements at the 3-sigmalevel. whereas the origin of the dust is still uncertain, its presence and thepossible connection with the outer disc suggest that the vega system iscurrently undergoing major dynamical perturbations.

1109.5183	toward direct detection of hot jupiters with precision closure phase:  calibration studies and first results from the chara array	direct detection of thermal emission from nearby hot jupiters has greatlyadvanced our knowledge of extrasolar planets in recent years. since hot jupitersystems can be regarded as analogs of high contrast binaries, ground-basedinfrared long baseline interferometers have the potential to resolve them anddetect their thermal emission with precision closure phase - a method that isimmune to the systematic errors induced by the earth's atmosphere. in thiswork, we present closure phase studies toward direct detection of nearby hotjupiters using the chara interferometer array outfitted with the mircinstrument. we carry out closure phase simulations and conduct a large numberof observations for the best candidate {\upsion} and. our experiments suggestthe method is feasible with highly stable and precise closure phases. however,we also find much larger systematic errors than expected in the observations,most likely caused by dispersion across different wavelengths. we find thatusing higher spectral resolution modes (e.g., r=150) can significantly reducethe systematics. by combining all calibrators in an observing run together, weare able to roughly recalibrate the lower spectral resolution data, allowing usto obtain upper limits of the star-planet contrast ratios of {\upsion} and bacross the h band. the data also allow us to get a refined stellar radius of1.625\pm0.011 r\odot. our best upper limit corresponds to a contrast ratio of2.1\times10^3:1 with 90% confidence level at 1.52{\mu}m, suggesting that we arestarting to have the capability of constraining atmospheric models of hotjupiters with interferometry. with recent and upcoming improvements ofchara/mirc, the prospect of detecting emission from hot jupiters with closurephases is promising.

1201.6415	the relationship between gamma cassiopeiae's x-ray emission and its  circumstellar environment	\gamma cas is the prototypical classical be star and is best known for itsvariable hard x-ray emission. to elucidate the reasons for this emission, wemounted a multiwavelength campaign in 2010 centered around 4 xmm observations.the observational techniques included long baseline optical interferometry(lboi), monitoring by an automated photometric telescope and halphaobservations. because gamma cas is also known to be in a binary, we measuredhalpha radial velocities and redetermined its period as 203.55+/-0.2 days andan eccentricity near zero. the lboi observations suggest that the star'sdecretion disk was axisymmetric in 2010, has an inclination angle near 45^o,and a larger radius than previously reported. the be star began an "outburst"at the beginning of our campaign, made visible by a disk brightening andreddening during our campaign. our analyses of the new high resolution spectradisclosed many attributes found from spectra obtained in 2001 (chandra) and2004 (xmm). as well as a dominant hot 14 kev thermal component, these familiarones included: (i) a fluorescent feature of fe k stronger than observed atprevious times, (ii) strong lines of n vii and ne xi lines indicative ofoverabundances, and (iii) a subsolar fe abundance from k-shell lines but asolar abundance from l-shell ions. we also found that 2 absorption columns arerequired to fit the continuum. while the first one maintained its historicalaverage of 1x10^21 cm^-2, the second was very large and doubled to 7.4x10^23cm^-2 during our x-ray observations. although we found no clear relationbetween this column density and orbital phase, it correlates well with the diskbrightening and reddening both in the 2010 and earlier observations. thus, theinference from this study is that much (perhaps all?) of the x-ray emissionfrom this source originates behind matter ejected by gamma cas into our line ofsight.

1204.4363	imaging the heart of astrophysical objects with optical long-baseline  interferometry	the number of publications of aperture-synthesis images based on opticallong-baseline interferometry measurements has recently increased due to easieraccess to visible and infrared interferometers. the interferometry techniquehas now reached a technical maturity level that opens new avenues for numerousastrophysical topics requiring milli-arcsecond model-independent imaging. inwriting this paper our motivation was twofold: 1) review and publicizeemblematic excerpts of the impressive corpus accumulated in the field ofoptical interferometry image reconstruction; 2) discuss future prospects forthis technique by selecting four representative astrophysical science cases inorder to review the potential benefits of using optical long baselineinterferometers. for this second goal we have simulated interferometric datafrom those selected astrophysical environments and used state-of-the-art codesto provide the reconstructed images that are reachable with current orsoon-to-be facilities. the image reconstruction process was "blind" in thesense that reconstructors had no knowledge of the input brightnessdistributions. we discuss the impact of optical interferometry in those fourastrophysical fields. we show that image reconstruction software successfullyprovides accurate morphological information on a variety of astrophysicaltopics and review the current strengths and weaknesses of such reconstructions.we investigate how to improve image reconstruction and the quality of the imagepossibly by upgrading the current facilities. we finally argue that opticalinterferometers and their corresponding instrumentation, existing or to come,with 6 to 10 telescopes, should be well suited to provide images of complexsceneries.

1205.0754	imaging the algol triple system in h band with the chara interferometer	algol (beta per) is an extensively studied hierarchical triple system whoseinner pair is a prototype semi-detached binary with mass transfer occurringfrom the sub-giant secondary to the main-sequence primary. we present here theresults of our algol observations made between 2006 and 2010 at the charainterferometer with the michigan infrared combiner in the h band. the use offour telescopes with long baselines allows us to achieve better than 0.5 masresolution and to unambiguously resolve the three stars. the inner and outerorbital elements, as well as the angular sizes and mass ratios for the threecomponents are determined independently from previous studies. we report asignificantly improved orbit for the inner stellar pair with the consequence ofa 15% change in the primary mass compared to previous studies. we alsodetermine the mutual inclination of the orbits to be much closer toperpendicularity than previously established. state-of-the-art imagereconstruction algorithms are used to image the full triple system. inparticular an image sequence of 55 distinct phases of the inner pair orbit isreconstructed, clearly showing the roche-lobe-filling secondary revolvingaround the primary, with several epochs corresponding to the primary andsecondary eclipses.

1206.1364	disentangling confused stars at the galactic center with long baseline  infrared interferometry	we present simulations of keck interferometer astra and vlti gravityobservations of mock star fields in orbit within ~50 milliarcseconds of sgr a*.dual-field phase referencing techniques, as implemented on astra and plannedfor gravity, will provide the sensitivity to observe sgr a* with infraredinterferometers. our results show an improvement in the confusion noise limitover current astrometric surveys, opening a window to study stellar sources inthe region. since the keck interferometer has only a single baseline, theimprovement in the confusion limit depends on source position angles. thegravity instrument will yield a more compact and symmetric psf, providing animprovement in confusion noise which will not depend as strongly on positionangle. our keck results show the ability to characterize the star field ascontaining zero, few, or many bright stellar sources. we are also able todetect and track a source down to mk~18 through the least confused regions ofour field of view at a precision of ~200 microarcseconds along the baselinedirection. this level of precision improves with source brightness. our gravityresults show the potential to detect and track multiple sources in the field.gravity will perform ~10 microarcsecond astrometry on a mk=16.3 source and ~200microarcsecond astrometry on a mk=18.8 source in six hours of monitoring acrowded field. monitoring the orbits of several stars will provide the abilityto distinguish between multiple post-newtonian orbital effects, including thosedue to an extended mass distribution around sgr a* and to low-order generalrelativistic effects. early characterizations of the field by astra includingthe possibility of a precise source detection, could provide valuableinformation for future gravity implementation and observation.

1208.0958	the keck aperture masking experiment: dust enshrouded red giants	while the importance of dusty asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars to galacticchemical enrichment is widely recognised, a sophisticated understanding of thedust formation and wind-driving mechanisms has proven elusive due in part tothe difficulty in spatially-resolving the dust formation regions themselves. wehave observed twenty dust-enshrouded agb stars as part of the keck aperturemasking experiment, resolving all of them in multiple near-infrared bandsbetween 1.5 microns and 3.1 microns. we find 45% of the targets to showmeasurable elongations that, when correcting for the greater distances of thetargets, would correspond to significantly asymmetric dust shells on par withthe well-known cases of irc+10216 or cit6. using radiative transfer models, wefind the sublimation temperature of 1130 +- 90 k and 1170 +- 60 k for silicatesand amorphous carbon respectively, both somewhat lower than expected fromlaboratory measurements and vastly below temperatures inferred from the inneredge of yso disks. the fact that o-rich and c-rich dust types showed the samesublimation temperature was surprising as well. for the most optically-thickshells (tau &gt; 2 at 2.2 microns), the temperature profile of the inner dustshell is observed to change substantially, an effect we suggest could arisewhen individual dust clumps become optically-thick at the highest mass-lossrates.

1302.1817	multiplicity of galactic cepheids from long-baseline interferometry i.  chara/mirc detection of the companion of v1334 cygni	we aim at determining the masses of cepheids in binary systems, as well astheir geometric distances and the flux contribution of the companions. thecombination of interferometry with spectroscopy will offer a unique andindependent estimate of the cepheid masses. using long-baseline interferometryat visible and infrared wavelengths, it is possible to spatially resolve binarysystems containing a cepheid down to milliarcsecond separations. based on theresulting visual orbit and radial velocities, we can then derive thefundamental parameters of these systems, particularly the masses of thecomponents and the geometric distance. we therefore performed interferometricobservations of the first-overtone mode cepheid v1334 cyg with the chara/mirccombiner. we report the first detection of a cepheid companion usinglong-baseline interferometry. we detect the signature of a companion orbitingv1334 cyg at two epochs. we measure a flux ratio between the companion and thecepheid f = 3.10+/-0.08%, giving an apparent magnitude mh = 8.47+/-0.15mag. thecombination of interferometric and spectroscopic data have enabled the uniquedetermination of the orbital elements: p = 1938.6+/-1.2 days, tp = 2 443616.1+/-7.3, a = 8.54+/-0.51mas, i = 124.7+/-1.8{\deg}, e = 0.190+/-0.013,{\omega} = 228.7+/-1.6{\deg}, and {\omega} = 206.3+/-9.4{\deg}. we derive aminimal distance d ~ 691 pc, a minimum mass for both stars of 3.6 msol, with aspectral type earlier than b5.5v for the companion star. our measured fluxratio suggests that radial velocity detection of the companion usingspectroscopy is within reach, and would provide an orbital parallax andmodel-free masses.

1304.1560	the h-band emitting region of the luminous blue variable p cygni:  spectrophotometry and interferometry of the wind	we present the first high angular resolution observations in the nearinfraredh-band (1.6 microns) of the luminous blue variable star p cygni. we obtainedsix-telescope interferometric observations with the chara array and the mircbeam combiner. these show that the spatial flux distribution is larger thanexpected for the stellar photosphere. a two component model for the star(uniform disk) plus a halo (two-dimensional gaussian) yields an excellent fitof the observations, and we suggest that the halo corresponds to flux emittedfrom the base of the stellar wind. this wind component contributes about 45% ofthe h-band flux and has an angular fwhm = 0.96 mas, compared to the predictedstellar diameter of 0.41 mas. we show several images reconstructed from theinterferometric visibilities and closure phases, and they indicate a generallyspherical geometry for the wind. we also obtained near-infraredspectrophotometry of p cygni from which we derive the flux excess compared to apurely photospheric spectral energy distribution. the h-band flux excessmatches that from the wind flux fraction derived from the two component fits tothe interferometry. we find evidence of significant near-infrared fluxvariability over the period from 2006 to 2010 that appears similar to thevariations in the h-alpha emission flux from the wind. future interferometricobservations may be capable of recording the spatial variations associated withtemporal changes in the wind structure.

1306.5184	a new interferometer architecture combining nulling with phase closure  measurements	imaging the direct light signal from a faint exoplanet against theoverwhelming glare of its host star presents one of the fundamental challengesto modern astronomical instrumentation. achieving sufficient signal-to-noisefor detection by direct imaging is limited by three basic physical processes:aberration of the wavefronts (both instrumental and atmospheric), photon noise,and detector noise. in this paper, we advance a novel optical setup whichsynthesizes the advantages of two different techniques: nulling interferometryto mitigate photon noise, and closure phase to combat optical aberrations. ourdesign, which employs technology from integrated optics and photonics, isintended to combine the advantageous aspects of both a coronagraph and anon-redundant interferometer inside a single optical device. we show that suchan instrument would have a dynamic range limited either by i) the readout noise(if perfect co-phasing), or ii) the photon noise due to stellar flux leakage(in the case of imperfect nulling). this concept is optimal when the readoutnoise is not the main limitation, ie, for space interferometry or for groundbased observations of bright stellar hosts (apparent magnitude brighter than10).

1306.5937	optical interferometry of early-type stars with pavo@chara. i.  fundamental stellar properties	we present interferometric observations of 7 main-sequence and 3 giant starswith spectral types from b2 to f6 using the pavo beam combiner at the charaarray. we have directly determined the angular diameters for these objects withan average precision of 2.3%. we have also computed bolometric fluxes usingavailable photometry in the visible and infrared wavelengths, as well asspace-based ultraviolet spectroscopy. combined with precise \textit{hipparcos}parallaxes, we have derived a set of fundamental stellar properties includinglinear radius, luminosity and effective temperature. fitting the latter tocomputed isochrone models, we have inferred masses and ages of the stars. theeffective temperatures obtained are in good agreement (at a 3% level) withnearly-independent temperature estimations from spectroscopy. they validaterecent sixth-order polynomial (b-v)-$t_\mathrm{eff}$ empirical relations\citep{boyajian2012a}, but suggest that a more conservative third-ordersolution \citep{vanbelle2009} could adequately describe the(v-k)-$t_\mathrm{eff}$ relation for main-sequence stars of spectral type a0 andlater. finally, we have compared mass values obtained combining surface gravitywith inferred stellar radius (\textit{gravity mass}) and as a result of thecomparison of computed luminosity and temperature values with stellarevolutionary models (\textit{isochrone mass}). the strong discrepancy betweenisochrone and gravity mass obtained for one of the observed stars,$\gamma$\,lyr, suggests that determination of the stellar atmosphere parametersshould be revised.

1307.2488	a near-infrared interferometric survey of debris disc stars. iii. first  statistics based on 42 stars observed with chara/fluor	(abridged) dust is expected to be ubiquitous in extrasolar planetary systemsowing to the dynamical activity of minor bodies. inner dust populations are,however, still poorly known because of the high contrast and small angularseparation with respect to their host star. we aim to determine the level ofnear-infrared exozodiacal dust emission around a sample of 42 nearby mainsequence stars with spectral types ranging from a to k and to investigate itscorrelation with various stellar parameters and with the presence of cold dustbelts. we use high-precision k-band visibilities obtained with the fluorinterferometer on the shortest baseline of the chara array. the calibratedvisibilities are compared with the expected visibility of the stellarphotosphere to assess whether there is an additional, fully resolvedcircumstellar emission. near-infrared circumstellar emission amounting to about1% of the stellar flux is detected around 13 of our 42 target stars. follow-upobservations showed that one of them (eps cep) is associated with a stellarcompanion, while another one was detected around what turned out to be a giantstar (kap crb). the remaining 11 excesses found around single main sequencestars are most probably associated with hot circumstellar dust, yielding anoverall occurrence rate of 28+8-6% for our (biased) sample. we show that theoccurrence rate of bright exozodiacal discs correlates with spectral type,k-band excesses being more frequent around a-type stars. it also correlateswith the presence of detectable far-infrared excess emission in the case ofsolar-type stars. this study provides new insight into the phenomenon of brightexozodiacal discs, showing that hot dust populations are probably linked toouter dust reservoirs in the case of solar-type stars. for a-type stars, noclear conclusion can be made regarding the origin of the detected near-infraredexcesses.

0801.4752	towards a small prototype planet finding interferometer: the next step  in planet finding and characterization in the infrared	during the last few years, considerable effort has been directed towardslarge-scale (&gt;&gt; $1 billion us) missions to detect and characterize earth-likeplanets around nearby stars, such as the terrestrial planet finderinterferometer (tpf-i) and darwin missions. however, technological andbudgetary issues as well as shifting science priorities will likely preventthese missions from entering phase a until the next decade. the secondaryeclipse technique using the spitzer space telescope has been used to directlymeasure the temperature and emission spectrum of extrasolar planets. however,only a small fraction of known extrasolar planets are in transiting orbits.thus, a simplified nulling interferometer, which produces an artificial eclipseor occultation, and operates in the near- to mid-infrared (e.g. ~ 3 to 8 or 10microns), can characterize the atmospheres of this much larger sample of theknown but non-transiting exoplanets. many other scientific problems can beaddressed with a system like this, including imaging debris disks, activegalactic nuclei, and low mass companions around nearby stars. we discuss therationale for a probe-scale mission in the $600-800 million range, which wename here as the small prototype planet finding interferometer (sppfi).

1403.3343	sparco : a semi-parametric approach for image reconstruction of  chromatic objects	the emergence of optical interferometers with three and more telescopesallows image reconstruction of astronomical objects at the milliarcsecondscale. however, some objects contain components with very different spectralenergy distributions (sed; i.e. different temperatures), which produces strongchromatic effects on the interferograms that have to be managed with care byimage reconstruction algorithms. for example, the gray approximation for theimage reconstruction process results in a degraded image if the total (u,v)-coverage given by the spectral supersynthesis is used. the relative fluxcontribution of the central object and an extended structure changes withwavelength for different temperatures. for young stellar objects, the knowncharacteristics of the central object (i.e., stellar sed), or even the fit ofthe spectral index and the relative flux ratio, can be used to model thecentral star while reconstructing the image of the extended structureseparately. methods. we present a new method, called sparco (semi-parametricalgorithm for the image reconstruction of chromatic objects), which describesthe spectral characteristics of both the central object and the extendedstructure to consider them properly when reconstructing the image of thesurrounding environment. we adapted two image-reconstruction codes (macim,squeeze, and mira) to implement this new prescription. sparco is applied usingmacim, squeeze and mira on a young stellar object model and also on literaturedata on hr5999 in the near-infrared with the vlti. this method paves the way toimproved aperture-synthesis imaging of several young stellar objects withexisting datasets. more generally, the approach can be used on astrophysicalsources with similar features such as active galactic nuclei, planetarynebulae, and asymptotic giant branch stars.

0808.0932	first resolved images of the eclipsing and interacting binary beta lyrae	we present the first resolved images of the eclipsing binary beta lyrae,obtained with the chara array interferometer and the mirc combiner in the hband. the images clearly show the mass donor and the thick disk surrounding themass gainer at all six epochs of observation. the donor is brighter andgenerally appears elongated in the images, the first direct detection ofphotospheric tidal distortion due to roche-lobe filling. we also confirmexpectations that the disk component is more elongated than the donor and isrelatively fainter at this wavelength. image analysis and model fitting foreach epoch were used for calculating the first astrometric orbital solution forbeta lyrae, yielding precise values for the orbital inclination and positionangle. the derived semi-ma jor axis also allows us to estimate the distance ofbeta lyrae; however, systematic differences between the models and the imageslimit the accuracy of our distance estimate to about 15%. to address theseissues, we will need a more physical, self-consistent model to account for allepochs as well as the multi-wavelength information from the eclipsing lightcurves.

astro-ph;0111510	radio properties of pinwheel nebulae	a small number of dusty wolf-rayet stars have been resolved into pinwheelnebulae, defined by their ``rotating'' spiral dust shells observed in theinfrared. this morphology is naturally explained by dust formation associatedwith colliding winds in a binary system. in order to confirm and furtherexplore this hypothesis, we have observed the known pinwheel nebulae (wr 104and wr 98a) as well as the suspected binary wr 112 at multiple radiowavelengths with the very large array to search for non-thermal radio emissionfrom colliding winds. the spectrum of each target is nearly flat between 5 and22 ghz, consistent with the presence of non-thermal emission that is reduced atlow frequencies by free-free absorption. this emission must lie outside theradio ``photosphere,'' leading us to estimate a lower limit to the physicalsize of the non-thermal emitting region that is larger than expected fromcurrent theory. based on a radio and infrared comparison to wr 104 and 98a, weconclude that wr 112 is a likely candidate pinwheel nebula, but its temporalvariability indicates an eccentric binary orbit or a pinwheel viewed nearlyedge-on. a sensitive radio survey of ir-bright wrs would stringently test thehypothesis that colliding winds lie at the heart of_all_ dusty wr systems. wealso discuss the effects of dust obscuration in the ultra-violet and howradio-determined mass-loss rates of pinwheel nebulae (and dusty wr stars ingeneral) may be underestimated due to shadowing effects.

astro-ph;9810024	the last gasps of vy cma: aperture synthesis and adaptive optics imagery	we present new observations of the red supergiant vy cma at 1.25 micron, 1.65micron, 2.26 micron, 3.08 micron and 4.8 micron. two complementaryobservational techniques were utilized: non-redundant aperture masking on the10-m keck-i telescope yielding images of the innermost regions at unprecedentedresolution, and adaptive optics imaging on the eso 3.6-m telescope at la sillaattaining extremely high (~10^5) peak-to-noise dynamic range over a wide field.for the first time the inner dust shell has been resolved in the near-infraredto reveal a one-sided extension of circumstellar emission within 0.1" (~15r_star) of the star. the line-of-sight optical depths of the circumstellar dustshell at 1.65 micron, 2.26 micron, and 3.08 micron have been estimated to be1.86 +/- 0.42, 0.85 +/- 0.20, and 0.44 +/- 0.11. these new results allow thebolometric luminosity of vy~cma to be estimated independent of the dust shellgeometry, yielding l_star ~ 2x10^5 l_sun. a variety of dust condensations,including a large scattering plume and a bow-shaped dust feature, were observedin the faint, extended nebula up to 4" from the central source. while theorigin of the nebulous plume remains uncertain, a geometrical model isdeveloped assuming the plume is produced by radially-driven dust grains formingat a rotating flow insertion point with a rotational period between 1200-4200years, which is perhaps the stellar rotational period or the orbital period ofan unseen companion.

astro-ph;9904034	mid-infrared spectra of late-type stars: long-term evolution	recent ground-based mid-infrared spectra of 29 late-type stars, most withsubstantial dust shells, are compared to ground-based spectra of these starsfrom the 1960s and 1970s and to iras-lrs spectra obtained in 1983. the spectraof about half the stars show no detectable changes, implying that theirdistributions of circumstellar material and associated dust grain propertieshave changed little over this time interval. however, many of the stars withstrong silicate features showed marked changes. in nearly all cases thesilicate peak has strengthened with respect to the underlying continuum,although there is one case (vy~cma) in which the silicate feature has almostcompletely disappeared. this suggests that, in general, an oxygen-rich starexperiences long periods of gradual silicate feature strengthening, punctuatedby relatively rare periods when the feature weakens. we discuss variousmechanisms for producing the changes, favoring the slow evolution of theintrinsic dust properties (i.e., the chemical composition or grain structure).although most iras spectra agree well with ground-based spectra, there are anumber of cases where they fall well outside the expected range of uncertainty.in almost all such cases the slopes of the red and blue lrs spectra do notmatch in their region of overlap.

astro-ph;9909282	pinwheel nebula around wr 98a	we present the first near-infrared images of dusty wolf-rayet star wr 98a.aperture masking interferometry has been utilized to recover images at thediffraction-limit of the keck-i telescope, ~&lt;50 mas at 2.2 micron. multi-epochobservations spanning about one year have resolved the dust shell into a``pinwheel'' nebula, the second example of a new class of dust shell firstdiscovered around wr 104 (tuthill, monnier, &amp; danchi 1999a). interpreting thecollimated dust outflow in terms of an interacting winds model, the binaryorbital parameters and apparent wind speed are derived: a period of 565 +/- 50days, a viewing angle of 35 +/- 6 degrees from the pole, and a wind speed of 99+/- 23 mas/yr. this period is consistent with a possible ~588 day periodicityin the infrared light curve (williams et al. 1995), linking the photometricvariation to the binary orbit. important implications for binary stellarevolution are discussed by identifying wr 104 and wr 98a as members of a classof massive, short-period binaries whose orbits were circularized during aprevious red supergiant phase. the current component separation in each systemis similar to the diameter of a red supergiant, indicating that the supergiantphase was likely terminated by roche-lobe overflow, leading to the presentwolf-rayet stage.

0810.3701	dust in the inner regions of debris disks around a stars	we present infrared interferometric observations of the inner regions of twoa-star debris disks, beta leo and zeta lep, using the fluor instrument at thechara interferometer on both short (30 m) and long (&gt;200 m) baselines. for thetarget stars, the short baseline visibilities are lower than expected for thestellar photosphere alone, while those of a check star, delta leo, are not. weinterpret this visibility offset of a few percent as a near-infrared excessarising from dust grains which, due to the instrumental field of view, must belocated within several au of the central star. for beta leo, the near-infraredexcess producing grains are spatially distinct from the dust which produces thepreviously known mid-infrared excess. for zeta lep, the near-infrared excessmay be spatially associated with the mid-infrared excess producing material. wepresent simple geometric models which are consistent with the near andmid-infrared excess and show that for both objects, the near-infrared producingmaterial is most consistent with a thin ring of dust near the sublimationradius with typical grain sizes smaller than the nominal radiation pressureblowout radius. finally, we discuss possible origins of the near-infraredemitting dust in the context of debris disk evolution models.

0811.1642	the keck aperture masking experiment: spectro-interferometry of 3 mira  variables from 1.1 to 3.8 microns	we present results from a spectro-interferometric study of the miras o cet, rleo and w hya obtained with the keck aperture masking experiment from 1998 septo 2002 jul. the spectrally dispersed visibility data permit fitting withcircularly symmetric brightness profiles such as a simple uniform disk. thestellar angular diameter obtained over up to ~ 450 spectral channels spaningthe region 1.1-3.8 microns is presented. use of a simple uniform diskbrightness model facilitates comparison between epochs and with existing dataand theoretical models. strong size variations with wavelength were recordedfor all stars, probing zones of h2o, co, oh, and dust formation. comparisonwith contemporaneous spectra extracted from our data show a stronganti-correlation between the observed angular diameter and flux. thesevariations consolidate the notion of a complex stellar atmosphere consisting ofmolecular shells with time-dependent densities and temperatures. our findingsare compared with existing data and pulsation models. the models were found toreproduce the functional form of the wavelength vs. angular diameter curvewell, although some departures are noted in the 2.8-3.5 micron range.
