0904.0674	old stellar population synthesis: new age and mass estimates for mayall  ii = g1	mayall ii = g1 is one of the most luminous globular clusters (gcs) in m31.here, we determine its age and mass by comparing multicolor photometry withtheoretical stellar population synthesis models. based on far- andnear-ultraviolet galex photometry, broad-band ubvri, and infrared jhk_s 2massdata, we construct the most extensive spectral energy distribution of g1 todate, spanning the wavelength range from 1538 to 20,000 a. a quantitativecomparison with a variety of simple stellar population (ssp) models yields amean age that is consistent with g1 being among the oldest building blocks ofm31 and having formed within ~1.7 gyr after the big bang. irrespective of thessp model or stellar initial mass function adopted, the resulting massestimates (of order $10^7 m_\odot$) indicate that g1 is one of the most massivegcs in the local group. however, we speculate that the cluster's exceptionallyhigh mass suggests that it may not be a genuine gc. we also derive that g1 maycontain, on average, $(1.65\pm0.63)\times10^2 l_\odot$ far-ultraviolet-bright,hot, extreme horizontal-branch stars, depending on the ssp model adopted. on ageneric level, we demonstrate that extensive multi-passband photometry coupledwith ssp analysis enables one to obtain age estimates for old ssps to a similaraccuracy as from integrated spectroscopy or resolved stellar photometry,provided that some of the free parameters can be constrained independently.

0905.4337	variable stars in the field of the open cluster ngc 2126	we report the results of a time-series ccd photometric survey of variablestars in the field of the open cluster ngc 2126. in about one square degreefield covering the cluster, a total number of 21 variable candidates aredetected during this survey, of which 16 are newly found. the periods,classifications and spectral types of 14 newly discovered variables arediscussed, which consist of six eclipsing binaries systems, three pulsatingvariable stars, three long period variables, one rs cvn star, and one w uma or$\delta$ scuti star. in addition, there are two variable candidates, theproperties of which cannot be determined in this paper. by a method based onfitting spectral energy distributions(seds) of stars with theoretical ones, themembership probabilities and the fundamental parameters of this cluster aredetermined. as a result, five variables are probably members of ngc 2126. thefundamental parameters of the this cluster are determined as: the metallicityto be 0.008 $z_\odot$, the age $\log(t)$= 8.95, the distance modulus$(m-m)_{0}$= 10.34 and the reddening value $e(b-v)$=0.55 mag.

0909.3737	the orbits of open clusters in the galaxy	we present and analyze kinematics and orbits for a sample of 488 openclusters in the galaxy. the velocity ellipsoid for our present sample isderived as ($\sigma_{u}$, $\sigma_{v}$, $\sigma_{w})$=$(28.7$, 15.8, 11.0) kms$^{-1}$ which represents a young thin disc population. we also confirm thatthe velocity dispersions increase with the age of cluster subsample. the orbitsof open clusters are calculated with three galactic gravitational potentialmodels. the errors of orbital parameters are also calculated considering theintrinsic variation of the orbital parameters and the effects of observationaluncertainties. the observational uncertainties dominate the errors of derivedorbital parameters. the vertical motions of clusters calculated using differentgalactic disc models are rather different. the observed radial metallicitygradient of clusters is derived with a slope of $b=-0.070\pm0.011$ dexkpc$^{-1}$. the radial metallicity gradient of clusters based on theirapogalactic distances is also derived with a slope of $b=-0.082\pm0.014$ dexkpc$^{-1}$. the distribution of derived orbital eccentricities for openclusters is very similar to the one derived for the field population of dwarfsand giants in the thin disc.

1001.3939	spectral energy distributions and age estimates of 104 m31 globular  clusters	we present photometry of 104 m31 globular clusters (gcs) and gc candidates in15 intermediate-band filters of the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc)photometric system. the gcs and gc candidates were selected from the revisedbologna catalog (v.3.5). we obtain the cluster ages by comparing thephotometric data with up-to-date theoretical synthesis models. the photometricdata used are {\sl galex} far- and near-ultraviolet and 2mass near-infrared$jhk_{\rm s}$ magnitudes, combined with optical photometry. the ages of oursample clusters cover a large range, although most clusters are younger than 10gyr. combined with the ages obtained in our series of previous papers focusingon the m31 gc system, we present the full m31 gc age distribution. the m31 gcsystem contains populations of young and intermediate-age gcs, as well as the`usual' complement of well-known old gcs, i.e., gcs of similar age as themajority of the galactic gcs. in addition, young gcs (and gc candidates) aredistributed nearly uniformly in radial distance from the center of m31, whilemost old gcs (and gc candidates) are more strongly concentrated.

1004.1002	the correlations between the intrinsic colors and spectroscopic  metallicities of m31 globular clusters	we present the correlations between the spectroscopic metallicities andninety-three different intrinsic colors of m31 globular clusters, includingseventy-eight batc colors and fifteen sdss and near infrared ugrizk colors. thebatc colors were derived from the archival images of thirteen filters (from cto p), which were taken by beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) multicolorsky survey with a 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope. the spectroscopicmetallicities adopted in our work were from literature. we fitted thecorrelations of seventy-eight different batc colors and the metallicities for123 old confirmed globular clusters, and the result implies that correlationcoefficients of twenty-three colors r&gt;0.7. especially, for the colors$(f-k)_0$, $(f-o)_0$, and $(h-k)_0$, the correlation coefficients are r&gt;0.8.meanwhile, we also note that the correlation coefficients (r) approach zero for$(g-h)_0$, $(k-m)_0$, $(k-n)_0$, and $(m-n)_0$, which are likely to beindependent of metallicity. similarity, we fitted the correlations ofmetallicity and ugrizk colors for 127 old confirmed gcs. the result indicatesthat all these colors are metal-sensitive (r&gt;0.7), of which $(u-k)_0$ is themost metal-sensitive color. our work provides an easy way to simply estimatethe metallicity from colors.

1008.2993	determination of fundamental properties of an m31 globular cluster from  main-sequence photometry	m31 globular cluster b379 is the first extragalactic cluster, the age ofwhich was determined by main-sequence photometry. in this method, the age of acluster is obtained by fitting its cmd with stellar evolutionary models.however, different stellar evolutionary models use different parameters ofstellar evolution, such as range of stellar masses, different opacities andequations of state, and different recipes, and so on. so, it is interesting tocheck whether different stellar evolutionary models can give consistent resultsfor the same cluster. brown et al. (2004a) constrained the age of b379 bycomparing its cmd with isochrones of the 2006 vandenberg models. using sspmodels of bc03 and its multi-photometry, ma et al. (2007) independentlydetermined the age of b379, which is in good agreement with the determinationof brown et al. (2004a). the bc03 models are calculated based on the padovaevolutionary tracks. it is necessary to check whether the age of b379 which,being determined based on the padova evolutionary tracks, is in agreement withthe determination of brown et al. (2004a). so, in this paper, we re-determineits age using isochrones of the padova stellar evolutionary models. inaddition, the metal abundance, the distance modulus, and the reddening valuefor b379 are also determined in this paper. the results obtained in this paperare consistent with the previous determinations, which including the ageobtained by brown et al. (2004a). so, this paper confirms the consistence ofthe age scale of b379 between the padova isochrones and the 2006 vandenbergisochrones, i.e. the results' comparison between brown et al. (2004a) and ma etal. (2007) is meaningful. the results obtained in this paper are: themetallicity [m/h]=-0.325, the age $\tau=11.0\pm1.5$ gyr, the reddening valuee(b-v)=0.08, and the distance modulus $(m-m)_{0}=24.44\pm0.10$.

1009.3582	an updated catalog of m31 globular-like clusters: ubvri photometry,  ages, and masses	we present an updated ubvri photometric catalog containing 970 objects in thefield of m31, selected from the revised bologna catalog (rbc v.4.0), including965, 967, 965, 953, and 827 sources in the individual ubvri bands,respectively, of which 205, 123, 14, 126, and 109 objects do not havepreviously published photometry. photometry is performed using archival imagesfrom the local group galaxies survey, which covers 2.2 deg^2 along the majoraxis of m31. we focus on 445 confirmed `globular-like' clusters and candidates,comprising typical globular and young massive clusters. the ages and masses ofthese objects are derived by comparison of their observed spectral-energydistributions with simple stellar population synthesis. approximately half ofthe clusters are younger than 2 gyr, suggesting that there has been significantrecent active star formation in m31, which is consistent with previous results.we note that clusters in the halo (r_ projected&gt;30kpc) are composed of twodifferent components, older clusters with ages &gt;10 gyr and younger clusterswith ages around 1 gyr. the spatial distributions show that the young clusters(&lt;2 gyr) are spatially coincident with the galaxy's disk, including the `10 kpcring,' the `outer ring,' and the halo of m31, while the old clusters (&gt; 2 gyr)are spatially correlated with the bulge and halo. we also estimate the massesof the 445 confirmed clusters and candidates in m31 and find that our estimatesagree well with previously published values. we find that none of the youngdisk clusters can survive the inevitable encounters with giant molecular cloudsin the galaxy's disk and that they will eventually disrupt on timescales of afew gyr. specifically, young disk clusters with a mass of 10^4 m_\odot areexpected to dissolve within 3.0 gyr and will, thus, not evolve to becomeglobular clusters.

0708.4083	metal abundance properties of m81 globular cluster system	this paper is the third in the series of papers on m81 globular clusters. inthis paper, we present spatial and metal abundance properties of 95 m81globular clusters, which comprise nearly half of all the m81 globular clustersystem. these globular clusters are divided into two m81 metallicity groups bya kmm test. our results show that, the metal-rich clusters did not demonstratea centrally concentrated spatial distribution as ones in m31, and metal-poorclusters tend to be less spatially concentrated. in other words, thedistribution of the metal-rich clusters in m81 is not very similar to that ofm31. most of the metal-rich clusters distribute at projected radii of 4-8 kpc.it is also noted that the metal-rich clusters distribute within the inner 20kpc, and the metal-poor ones do out to radii of ~40 kpc. like our galaxy andm31, the metallicity distribution of globular clusters in m81 alonggalactocentric radius suggests that some dissipation occurred during theformation of the globular cluster system, i.e. smooth, pressure-supportedcollapse models of galaxies are unlikely to produce such radial distribution ofmetallicity presented in this paper. there is not evident correlation betweenglobular cluster luminosity and metallicity in m81 globular clusters. theoverwhelming conclusion of this paper seems to be that a more complete andthorough cluster search is needed in m81.

1101.3375	multicolor photometry study of the galaxy cluster a2589: dynamics,  luminosity function and star formation history	in this paper we present a multicolor photometry for a2589 ($z=0.0414$) with15 intermediate bands in the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) systemwhich covers an optical wavelength range from 3000 \aa\ to 10000 \aa. thespectral energy distributions (seds) for more than 5000 sources are achieveddown to {\it v} $\sim$ 20 mag in about 1 deg$^{2}$ field. a2589 has been alsocovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) in photometric mode only. across-identification of the batc-detected galaxies with the sdss photometriccatalog achieves 1199 galaxies brighter than $i=19.5$ mag, among which 68member galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts are found. after combiningthe sdss five-band photometric data and the batc seds, the technique ofphotometric redshift is applied to these galaxies for selecting faint membergalaxies. the color-magnitude relation is taken as a further restriction ofearly-type cluster galaxies. as a result, 106 galaxies are newly selected asmember galaxies. spatial distribution of member galaxies shows a north-southelongation which agrees with the x-ray brightness profile and the orientationof central cd galaxy, ngc 7647. no substructures are detected on the basis ofpositions and radial velocities of cluster galaxies, indicating that a2589 is awell-relaxed system. the luminosity function of a2589 exhibits a peak at $m_{r}\sim -20$ mag and a dip at $m_{r} \sim -19 $ mag. the low-density outer regionsare the preferred habitat of faint galaxies. with the evolutionary populationsynthesis model, pegase, the environmental effect on the star formationproperties for 68 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies is studied. theoutlier faint galaxies tend to have longer time scales of star formation,shorter mean stellar ages, and lower metallicities of interstellar medium,which can be interpreted in the context of hierarchical cosmological scenario.

1104.5177	stellar population properties and evolution analysis of ngc 628 with the  panchromatic photometry	panchromatic spectral energy distribution (sed) from the ultraviolet (uv),optical to infrared (ir) photometry of ngc 628, combined with the evolutionarystellar population synthesis, is used to derive the spatially resolved age,metallicity and reddening maps. these parameter distributions show that thebulge of this galaxy is a disk-like pseudobulge, which has the s{\'e}rsic indexclose to the exponential law, rich gas, and a young circumnuclear ringstructure. we also discover the disk has two distinct regions with differentradial age and metallicity gradients. the inner region is older and has a muchsteeper age gradient than the outer region of the disk. both these two regionsand the central young structure can be seen in the radial profile of theoptical color. based on the age and reddening distributions, we consider thatthe pseudobulge and disk are likely to have grown via the secular evolution,which is the redistribution of mass and energy through the angular momentumtransport caused by the non-axisymmetric potential of the spirals. however,possible gas accretion events could affect the outer region of the disk, due toabundant h{\sc i} gas accumulating in the outer disk.

1105.3284	multicolor photometry of the galaxies in abell 1775: substructures,  luminosity functions, and star-formation properties	an optical photometric observation in 15 bands was carried out for nearbygalaxy cluster abell 1775 by the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc)multi-color system. over 5000 sources' spectral energy distributions (seds)were obtained. since this cluster has also been observed by the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss), the batc seds were combined with the sdss five-bandphotometric data. using the combined seds, 146 faint galaxies were selected asnew member galaxies by the photometric redshift technique. based on thepositions, redshifts and 20-band seds of member galaxies, dynamicalsubstructures and luminosity functions (lfs) of a1775 were investigated. theprevious reported bimodal structure of a1775 has been confirmed: a poorsubcluster with lower redshift, a1775a, is located ~14' southeast to the mainconcentration a1775b. after taking into account the new supplemented membergalaxies, a new subcluster a1775c was found along the aligned direction ofa1775a and a1775b. the different lf faint ends of the two subclusters indicatethat a1775b is a more dynamically evolved system, while a1775a is stilldynamically young. by the starlight spectral synthesis code, the star-formation histories of the member galaxies were studied. the dependence of themean stellar ages upon the hubble type was confirmed, and the environmentaleffect on star-formation activities for galaxies in a1775b has been explored.

1108.2121	spectroscopic study of globular clusters in the halo of m31 with  xinglong 2.16m telescope	we present the spectroscopic observations for 11 confirmed globular clustersof m31 with the omr spectrograph on 2.16m telescope at xinglong site ofnational astronomical observatories, chinese academy of sciences. nine of oursample clusters are located in the halo of m31 and the most remote one is outto a projected radius of 78.75 kpc from the galactic center. for all our sampleclusters, we measured the lick absorption-line indices and the radialvelocities. it is noted that most gcs of our sample are distinct from the hirotation curve of m31 galaxy, especially for b514, mcgc5, h12 and b517,suggesting that most of our sample clusters do not have kinematic associationwith the star forming young disk of the galaxy. we fitted the absorption lineindices with the updated stellar population model thomas et al. (2010) with twodifferent tracks of cassisi and padova, separately, by applying the$\chi^2-$minimization method. the fitting results show that all our sampleclusters are older than 10 gyr, and metal-poor ($-0.91 \le $ [fe/h] $\le -2.38$dex). after merging the spectroscopic metallicity of our work with thepreviously published ones, we extended the cluster sample out to a projectedradius of 117 kpc from the galaxy's center. we found the metallicity gradientfor all the confirmed clusters exists with a slope of $-0.028\pm0.001$ dexkpc$^{-1}$. however, the slope turns to be $-0.018\pm0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ forall the halo clusters, which is much shallower. if we only consider the outerhalo clusters with $r_{\rm p}&gt;25$ kpc, the slope becomes $-0.010\pm0.002$ dexkpc$^{-1}$ and if one cluster g001 is excluded from the outer halo sample, theslope is $-0.004\pm0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. thus we conclude that metallicitygradient for m31 outer halo clusters is not significant, which agrees well withthe previous findings.

1208.1112	characterizing ultraviolet and infrared observational properties for  galaxies. i. influences of dust attenuation and stellar population age	the correlation between infrared-to-ultraviolet luminosity ratio andultraviolet color, i.e. the irx-uv relation, was regarded as a prevalent recipefor correcting extragalactic dust attenuation. considerable dispersion in thisrelation discovered for normal galaxies, however, complicates its usability. inorder to investigate the cause of the dispersion, in this paper, we select fivenearby spiral galaxies, and perform spatially resolved studies on each of thegalaxies, with a combination of ultraviolet and infrared imaging data. wemeasure all positions within each galaxy and divide the extracted regions intoyoung and evolved stellar populations. by means of this approach, we attempt todiscover separate effects of dust attenuation and stellar population age on theirx-uv relation for individual galaxies. in this work, in addition to dustattenuation, stellar population age is interpreted to be another parameter inthe irx-uv function, and the diversity of star formation histories is suggestedto disperse the age effects. at the same time, strong evidence shows thenecessity of more parameters in the interpretation of observational data, suchas variations in attenuation/extinction law. fractional contributions ofdifferent components to the integrated luminosities of the galaxies suggestthat the integrated measurements of galaxies which comprise differentpopulations would weaken the effect of the age parameter on irx-uv diagrams.the dependance of the irx-uv relation on luminosity and radial distance ingalaxies presents weak trends, which offers an implication of selectiveeffects. the two-dimensional maps of the uv color and theinfrared-to-ultraviolet ratio are displayed and show a disparity in the spatialdistributions between the two parameters in galaxies, which offers a spatialinterpretation of the scatter in the irx-uv relation.

1208.6078	type iin supernova sn 2010jl: optical observations for over 500 days  after explosion	we present extensive optical observations of a type iin supernova (sn) 2010jlfor the first 1.5 years after the discovery. the ubvri light curvesdemonstrated an interesting two-stage evolution during the nebular phase, whichalmost flatten out after about 90 days from the optical maximum. sn 2010jl hasone of the highest intrinsic h_alpha luminosity ever recorded for a sn iin,especially at late phase, suggesting a strong interaction of sn ejecta with thedense circumstellar material (csm) ejected by the progenitor. this is alsoindicated by the remarkably strong balmer lines persisting in the opticalspectra. one interesting spectral evolution about sn 2010jl is the appearanceof asymmetry of the balmer lines. these lines can be well decomposed into anarrow component and an intermediate-width component. the intermediate-widthcomponent showed a steady increase in both strength and blueshift with timeuntil t ~ 400 days after maximum, but it became less blueshifted at t ~ 500days when the line profile appeared relatively symmetric again. owing to that apure reddening effect will lead to a sudden decline of the light curves and aprogressive blueshift of the spectral lines, we therefore propose that theasymmetric profiles of h lines seen in sn 2010jl is unlikely due to theextinction by newly formed dust inside the ejecta, contrary to the explanationby some early studies. based on a simple csm-interaction model, we speculatethat the progenitor of sn 2010jl may suffer a gigantic mass loss (~ 30-50m_sun) in a few decades before explosion. considering a slow moving stellarwind (e.g., ~ 28 km/s) inferred for the preexisting, dense csm shell and theextremely high mass-loss rate (1-2 m_sun per yr), we suggest that theprogenitor of sn 2010jl might have experienced a red supergiant stage andexplode finally as a post-red supergiant star with an initial mass above 30-40m_sun.

1208.6419	age and mass studies for young star clusters in m31 from seds-fit	in this paper, we present photometry for young star clusters in m31, whichare selected from caldwell et al. these star clusters have been observed aspart of the beijing--arizona--taiwan--connecticut (batc) multicolor sky surveyfrom 1995 february to 2008 march. the batc images including these star clustersare taken with 15 intermediate-band filters covering 3000--10000 \aa. combinedwith photometry in the {\sl galex} far- and near-ultraviolet, broad-band$ubvri$, sdss $ugriz$, and infrared $jhk_{\rm s}$ of two micron all sky survey,we obtain their accurate spectral energy distributions (seds) from 1538-20000\aa. we derive these star clusters' ages and masses by comparing their sedswith stellar population synthesis models. our results are in good agreementwith previous determinations. the mean value of age and mass of young clusters($&lt;2$ gyr) is about 385 myr and $2\times 10^4 {m_\odot}$, respectively. thereare two distinct peaks in the age distribution, a highest peak at age $\sim$ 60myr and a secondary peak around 250 myr, while the mass distribution shows asingle peak around $10^4 {m_\odot}$. a few young star clusters have two-bodyrelaxation times greater than their ages, indicating that those clusters havenot been well dynamically relaxed and therefore have not established thethermal equilibrium. there are several regions showing aggregations of youngstar clusters around the 10 kpc ring and the outer ring, indicating that thedistribution of the young star clusters is well correlated with m31'sstar-forming regions. the young massive star clusters (age $\leq 100$ myr andmass $\geq 10^4 {m_\odot}$) show apparent concentration around the ringsplitting region, suggesting a recent passage of a satellite galaxy (m32)through m31 disk.

1211.2069	metal abundance and kinematical properties of m81 globular cluster  system	in this paper, we presented metal abundance properties of 144 m81 globularclusters. these globulars consist of the largest globular cluster sample in m81till now. our main results are: the distribution of metallicities are bimodal,with metallicity peaks at [fe/h]\sim-1.51 and -0.58, and the metal-poorglobular clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated than the metal-richones; the metal-rich globular clusters in m81 do not demonstrate a centrallyconcentrated spatial distribution as the metal-rich ones in m31 do; like ourgalaxy and m31, the globular clusters in m81 have a small radial metallicitygradient. these results are consistent with those obtained based on a smallsample of m81 globular clusters. in addition, this paper showed that there isevidence that a strong rotation of the m81 globular cluster system around theminor axis exists, and that rotation is present in the metal-rich globularcluster subsample, while the metal-poor globular cluster subsample shows noevidence for rotation. the most significant difference between the rotation ofthe metal-rich and metal-poor globular clusters occurs at intermediateprojected galactocentric radii. the results of this paper confirm theconclusion of schroder et al. that m81's metal-rich globular clusters atintermediate projected radii were associated with a thick disk of m81.

1304.3017	gradients of stellar population properties and evolution clues in a  nearby galaxy m 101	multi-band photometric images from ultraviolet and optical to infrared arecollected to derive spatially resolved properties of a nearby scd type galaxy m101. with evolutionary stellar population synthesis models, two-dimensionaldistributions and radial profiles of age, metallicity, dust attenuation, andstar formation timescale in the form of the sandage star formation history areobtained. when fitting with the models, we use the irx-$a_\mathrm{fuv}$relation, found to depend on a second parameter of birth rate b (ratio ofpresent and past-averaged star formation rate), to constrain the dustattenuation. there are obvious parameter gradients in the disk of m101, whichsupports the theory of an "inside-out disk" growth scenario. two distinct discregions with different gradients of age and color are discovered, similar toanother late-type galaxy ngc 628. the metallicity gradient of the stellarcontent is flatter than that of h {\sc ii} regions. the stellar disk isoptically thicker inside than outside and the global dust attenuation of thisgalaxy is lower, compared with galaxies of similar and earlier morphologicaltype. we highlight that a variational star formation timescale describes thereal star formation history of a galaxy. the timescale increases steadily fromthe center to the outskirt. we also confirm that the bulge in this galaxy is adisk-like pseudobulge, whose evolution is likely to be induced by some secularprocesses of the small bar with relatively young age, rich metal, and muchdust.

1307.4467	the stellar metallicity distribution of the milky way from the batc  survey	using the stellar atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature andmetallicity derived from sdss spectra for 2200 main sequence (ms) stars whichwere also observed by beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut (batc)photometric system, we develop the polynomial photometric calibration method toevaluate the stellar effective temperature and metallicity for batc multi-colorphotometric data. this calibration method has been applied to about 160 000 msstars from 67 batc observed fields. those stars have colors and magnitudes inthe ranges 0.1 &lt; d - h &lt; 1.4 and 14.0 &lt; d &lt; 21.0. we find that there is a peakof metallicity distribution at [fe/h] ~ -1.5 in the distance from the galacticplane |z| &gt; 5 kpc which corresponds to the halo component and a peak at [fe/h]~ -0.7 in the region 2 &lt; |z| &lt; 5 kpc where is dominated by the thick diskstars. the mean stellar metallicity smoothly decreases from -0.65 to -0.78 inthe interval 0.5 &lt; |z|&lt; 2 kpc. metallicity distributions in the halo and thethick disk seem invariant with the distance from the galactic plane.

1403.3490	estimation of absolute magnitude-dependent galactic model parameters in  intermediate latitude with sdss and scuss	based on sdss and south galactic cap of u-band sky survey (scuss) early data,we use star counts method to estimate the galactic structure parameters in anintermediate latitude with 10,180 main-sequence (ms) stars in absolutemagnitude interval of $4 \leq m_r \leq 13$. we divide the absolute magnitudeinto five intervals:$4 \leq m_r &lt; 5$, $5 \leq m_r &lt; 6$, $6 \leq m_r &lt; 8$, $8\leq m_r &lt; 10$, $10 \leq m_r \leq 13$, and estimate the galactic structureparameters in each absolute magnitude interval to explore their possiblevariation with the absolute magnitude. our study shows the parameters depend onabsolute magnitude. for the thin disk, the intrinsic faint ms stars have largelocal space density and they tend to stay close to the galactic plane. aplausible explanation is that faint ms stars with long lifetime experience longgravitational interaction time result in a short scaleheight. however, for thethick disk, the parameters show a complex trend with absolute magnitude, whichmay imply the complicated original of the thick disk. for the halo, theintrinsic faint ms stars have large local density and small axial ratio, whichindicate a flattened inner halo and a more spherical outer halo.

1404.4444	new 2mass near-infrared photometry for globular clusters in m31	we present 2mass $jhk_{\rm s}$ photometry for 913 star clusters andcandidates in the field of m31, which are selected from the latest revisedbologna catalog of m31 globular clusters (gcs) and candidates. the photometricmeasurements in this paper supplement this catalog, and provide a mostcomprehensive and homogeneous photometric catalog for m31 gcs in the $jhk_{\rms}$ bandpasses. in general, our photometry is consistent with previousmeasurements. the globular cluster luminosity function (gclf) peaks for theconfirmed gcs derived by fitting a $t_5$ distribution using maximum likelihoodmethod are: $j_0 = 15.348_{-0.208}^{+0.206}$, $h_0 = 14.703_{-0.180}^{+0.176}$,and ${k_{\rm s}}_0 = 14.534_{-0.146}^{+0.142}$, all of which agree well withprevious studies. the gclfs are different between metal-rich (mr) andmetal-poor (mp), inner and outer subpopulations, as that mp clusters arefainter than their mr counterparts, and the inner clusters are brighter thanthe outer ones, which confirm previous results. the nir colors of the gccandidates are on average redder than those of the confirmed gcs, which lead toan obscure bimodal distribution of the color indices. the relation of$(v-k_{\rm s})_0$ and metallicity shows a notable departure from linearity,with a shallower slope towards the redder end. the color-magnitude diagram(cmd) and color-color diagram show that many gc candidates are located out ofthe evolutionary tracks, suggesting that some of them may be false m31 gccandidates. the cmd also shows that the initial mass function of m31 gcs coversa large range, and the majority of the clusters have initial masses between$10^3$ and $10^6$ $m_{\odot}$.

1507.08018	photometry of variable stars from thu-naoc transient survey i: the first  2 years	in this paper, we report the detections of stellar variabilities from thefirst 2-year observations of sky area of about 1300 square degrees from thetsinghua university-naoc transient survey (tnts). a total of 1237 variablestars (including 299 new ones) were detected with brightness &lt; 18.0 mag andmagnitude variation &gt;= 0.1 mag on a timescale from a few hours to few hundreddays. among such detections, we tentatively identified 661 rr lyrae stars, 431binaries, 72 semiregular pulsators, 29 mira stars, 11 slow irregular variables,11 rs canum venaticorum stars, 7 gamma doradus stars, 5 long period variables,3 w virginis stars, 3 delta scuti stars, 2 anomalous cepheids, 1 cepheid, and 1nove-like star based on their time-series variability index js and their phaseddiagrams. moreover, we found that 14 rr lyrae stars show the blazhko effect and67 contact eclipsing binaries exhibit the o'connell effect. since the periodand amplitude of light variations of rr lyrae variables depend on theirchemical compositions, their photometric observations can be used toinvestigate distribution of metallicity along the direction perpendicular tothe galactic disk. we find that the metallicity of rr lyrae stars shows largescatter at regions closer to the galactic plane (e.g., -3.0 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0) buttends to converge at [fe/h]~ -1.7 at larger galactic latitudes. this variationmay be related to that the rrab lyrae stars in the galactic halo come fromglobular clusters with different metallicity and vertical distances, i.e. ooiand ooii populations, favoring for the dual-halo model.

astro-ph;0209460	photometric redshift determination with the batc multicolor system	in this paper, we present the methodology of photometric redshiftdetermination with the batc 15-color system by using hyperz program. bothsimulated galaxies and real galaxies with known redshifts were used to estimatethe accuracy of redshifts inferred from the multicolor photometry. from thetest with simulated galaxies, the uncertainty in the inferred redshifts isabout $0.02\sim0.03$ for a given range of photometric uncertainty of $0.05 \sim0.10$. the results with the 27 real galaxies are in good agreement with thesimulated ones. the advantage of using batc intermediate-band system to deriveredshift is clear through the comparison with the ubvri broad-band system. theaccuracy in redshift determination with batc system is mainly affected by theselection of filters and the photometric uncertainties in the observation. whenwe take the limiting magnitudes of the 15 filters into account, we find thatredshift can be determined with good accuracy for galaxies with redshifts lessthan 0.5, using only filters with central wavelengths shorter than 6000 a.

astro-ph;0603392	determination of the hubble constant, the intrinsic scatter of  luminosities of type ia sne, and evidence for non-standard dust in other  galaxies	a sample of 109 type ia supernovae (sne ia) with recession velocity &lt; 30,000km s^{-1}, is compiled from published sne ia light curves to explore theexpansion rate of the local universe. based on the color parameter delta c_{12}and the decline rate delta m_{15}, we found that the average absorption toreddening ratio for sn ia host galaxies to be r_{ubvi} = 4.37+/-0.25,3.33+/-0.11, 2.30+/-0.11, 1.18+/-0.11, which are systematically lower than thestandard values in the milky way. we investigated the correlations of theintrinsic luminosity with light curve decline rate, color index, and supernovaenvironmental parameters. in particular, we found sne ia in e/s0 galaxies to bebrighter close to the central region than those in the outer region, which maysuggest a possible metallicity effect on sn luminosity. the dependence of snluminosity on galactic environment disappears after corrections for theextinction and delta c_{12}. the hubble diagrams constructed using 73 hubbleflow sne ia yield a 1-sigma scatter of &lt;0.12 mag in bvi bands and ~0.16 mag inu band. the luminosity difference between normal sne ia and peculiar objects(including sn 1991bg-like and 1991t-like events) has now been reduced to within0.15 mag via delta c_{12} correction. we use the same precepts to correct thenearby sne ia with cepheid distances and found that the fully correctedabsolute magnitudes of sne ia are: m_{b} = -19.33+/-0.06 mag, m_{v} =-19.27+/-0.05 mag. we deduced a value for the hubble constant of h_{0} = 72 +/-6 (total) km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}.

astro-ph;0605547	optical monitoring of bl lacertae object oj 287: a 40-day period?	we present the results of our optical monitoring of the bl lacertae object oj287 during the first half of 2005. the source did not show large-amplitudevariations during this period and was in a relatively quiescent state. apossible period of 40 days was derived from its light curves in three batcwavebands. a bluer-when-brighter chromatism was discovered, which is differentfrom the extremely stable color during the outburst in 1994--96. the differentcolor behaviors imply different variation mechanisms in the two states. we thenre-visited the optical data on oj 287 from the oj-94 project and found as wella probable period of 40 days in its optical variability during the late-1994outburst. the results suggest that two components contribute to the variabilityof oj 287 during its outburst state. the first component is the normal {\slblazar} variation. this component has an amplitude similar to that of thequiescent state and also may share a similar periodicity. the second componentcan be taken as a `low-frequency modulation' to the first component. it may beinduced by the interaction of the assumed binary black holes in the center ofthis object. the 40-day period may be related to the helical structure of themagnetic field at the base of the jet, or to the orbital motion close to thecentral primary black hole.

astro-ph;0607407	evolution of galaxy luminosity function and luminosity function by  density environment at 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.5	using galaxy sample observed by the batc large-field multi-color sky surveyand galaxy data of sdss in the overlapped fields, we study the dependence ofthe restframe $r$-band galaxy luminosity function on redshift and onlarge-scale environment. the large-scale environment is defined by isodensitycontour with density contrast \delta\rho/\rho. the data set is a compositesample of 69,671 galaxies with redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 and r &lt; 21.5 mag. theredshifts are composed by three parts: 1) spectroscopic redshifts in sdss forlocal and most luminous galaxies; 2) 20-color photometric redshifts derivedfrom batc and sdss; 3) 5-color photometric redshifts in sdss. we find that thefaint-end slope \alpha steepens slightly from -1.21 at z ~ 0.06 to -1.35 at z ~0.4, which is the natural consequence of the hierarchical formation ofgalaxies. the luminosity function also differs with different environments. thevalue of \alpha changes from -1.21 at underdense regions to -1.37 at overdenseregions and the corresponding m* brightens from -22.26 to -22.64. this suggeststhat the fraction of faint galaxies is larger in high density regions than inlow density regions.

astro-ph;0608712	galactic structure studies from batc survey	we present an analysis of the photometric parallaxes of stars in 21 batcfields carried out with the national astronomical observatories (naoc) 60/90 cmschmidt telescope in 15 intermediate-band filters from 3000 to 10000 {\aa}. inthis study, we have adopted a three-component (thin disk, thick disk and halo)model to analyze star counts information. by calculating the stellar spacedensity as a function of distance from the galactic plane, we determine thatthe range of scale height for the thin disk varies from 220 to 320 pc. although220 pc seems an extreme value, it is close to the lower limit in theliterature. the range of scale height for the thick disk is from 600 to 1100pc, and the corresponding space number density normalization is 7.0-1.0% of thethin disk. we find that the scale height of the disk may be variable withobserved direction, which cannot simply be attributed to statistical errors.possibly the main reasons can be attributed to the disk (mainly the thick disk)is flared, with a scale height increasing with radius. the structure isconsistent with merger origin for the thick disk formation. adopting a devaucouleurs $r^{1/4}$ law halo, we also find that the axis ratio towards thegalactic center is somewhat flatter ($\sim 0.4$), while the shape of the haloin the anticentre and antirotation direction is rounder with $c/a&gt; 0.4$. ourresults show that star counts in different lines of sight can be used directlyto obtain a rough estimate of the shape of the stellar halo. our solutionssupport the galactic models with a flattened inner halo, possibly it is formedby a merger early in the galaxy's history.

astro-ph;0612142	optical monitoring of bl lacertae object s5 0716+714 with a novel  multi-peak interference filter	we at first introduce a novel photometric system, which consists of a schmidttelescope, an objective prism, a ccd camera, and, especially, a multi-peakinterference filter. the multi-peak interference filter enables light in multipassbands to pass through it simultaneously. the light in different passbandsis differentially refracted by the objective prism and is focused on the ccdseparately, so we have multi "images" for each object on the ccd frames. thissystem enables us to monitor blazars exactly simultaneously in multi wavebandson a single telescope, and to accurately trace the color change during thevariation. we used this novel system to monitor the bl lacertae object s50716+714 during 2006 january and february and achieved a very high temporalresolution. the object was very bright and very active during this period. twostrong flares were observed, with variation amplitudes of about 0.8 and 0.6mags in the $v'$ band, respectively. strong bluer-when-brighter correlationswere found for both internight and intranight variations. no apparent time lagwas observed between the $v'$- and $r'$-band variations, and the observedbluer-when-brighter chromatism may be mainly attributed to the larger variationamplitude at shorter wavelength. in addition to the bluer-when-brighter trend,the object also showed a bluer color when it was more active. the observedvariability and its color behaviors are consistent with the shock-in-jet model.

astro-ph;0612368	age constraints for an m31 globular cluster from seds-fit	we have constrained the age of the globular cluster s312 in the andromedagalaxy (m31) by comparing its multicolor photometry with theoretical stellarpopulation synthesis models. this is both a check on the age of this globularcluster, as well a check on our methodology. main-sequence photometry has beenthe most direct method for determining the age of a star cluster. s312 wasobserved as part of the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) multicolorsky survey from 1995 february to 2003 december. the photometry of batc imagesfor s312 was taken with 9 intermediate-band filters covering 5000-10000\aa.combined with photometry in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) of {\sl galex},broad-band $ubvr$ and infrared $jhk_s$ of 2mass, we obtained the accuratespectral energy distributions (seds) of s312 from 2267-20000\aa. a quantitativecomparison to simple stellar population models yields an age of$9.5_{-0.99}^{+1.15}$ gyr, which is in very good agreement with the previousdetermination by main-sequence photometry. s312 has a mass of$9.8\pm{1.85}\times 10^5 \rm m_\odot$, and is a medium-mass globular cluster inm31. by analysis of errors of ages determined based on the sed fitting methodof this paper, secure age constraints are derived with errors of $&lt; 3$ gyr forages younger than 9 gyr. in fact, the theoretical seds are not sensitive to thevariation of age for ages greater than $\sim 10$ gyr. therefore, for globularclusters as old as the majority of the galactic gcs, our method do notdistinguish them accurately. we emphasize that our results show that even withmultiband photometry spanning nuv to $k_s$, our age constraints from sedfitting are distressingly uncertain, which has implications for age derivationsin extragalactic globular cluster systems.

astro-ph;0701282	batc 13-band photometry of open cluster ngc 7789	we present 13-band ccd intermediate-band spectrophotometry of a fieldcentered on the open cluster ngc 7789 from 400 to nearly 1000 nm, taken withbeijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) multi-color survey photometricsystem. by comparing observed spectral energy distributions of ngc 7789 starswith theoretical ones, the fundamental parameters of this cluster are derived:an age of $1.4\pm0.1$ gyr, a distance modulus $(m-m)_{0}=11.27\pm0.04$, areddening $e(b-v)=0.28\pm0.02$, and a metallicity with the solar composition$z=0.019$. when the surface density profile for member stars with limitingmagnitudes of 19.0 in the batc $e$ band ($\lambda_{\textrm{eff}}=4925$ \aa) isfitted by king model, the core radius $r_{c}=7.52\arcmin$ and the tidal radius$r_{t}=28.84\arcmin$ are derived for ngc 7789. the observed mass function (mf)for main sequence stars of ngc 7789 with masses from 0.95 to 1.85 $m_{\odot}$is fitted with a power-law function $\phi(m)\propto m^{\alpha}$ and the slope$\alpha=-0.96$ is derived. strong mass segregation in ngc 7789 is reflected inthe significant variation of the concentration parameters $c_{0}=\log(r_{t}/r_{c})$ for member stars of ngc 7789 within different mass ranges:$c_{0}=1.02$ for most of massive stars; $c_{0}=0.37$ for the lowest-mass msstars. strong mass segregation in ngc 7789 is also indicated in the significantvariation of the slopes $\alpha$ in different spatial regions of the cluster:the mf for stars within the core region has $\alpha=-0.71$, much flatter thanthat for stars in external regions of the cluster ($\alpha=-1.20$).

astro-ph;9604178	deep wide-field spectrophotometry of the open cluster m67	we present nine color ccd intermediate-band spectrophotometry of a two squaredegree field centered on the old open cluster m67, from 3890$\rm \aa$ to nearly1$\mu$. these observations are taken as a part of the batc(beijing-arizona-taipei-connecticut) color survey of the sky, for bothscientific and calibration reasons. with these data we show that the batcsurvey can reach its goal of obtaining spectrophotometry to a zero pointaccuracy of 0.01 mag, and down to v = 21 with 0.3 mag random error. we fit thecolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) with worthey's theoretical models. the netresult is the excellent fit of the 4.0 gyr, [fe/h] = $-0.10$ model to our data,including a good fit to the main sequence (ms) turn-off. our data areconsistent with a toy model with 50\% of the stars in m67 being binaries and arandom distribution of binary mass-ratios, although other models with differentmass-ratio distributions cannot be ruled out. the spatial distribution and massfunction (mf) of stars in m67 show marked effects of dynamical evolution andevaporation of stars from the cluster. blue stragglers and binary stars are themost condensed within the cluster, with degree of condensation depending onmass.we find m67 to have an elongated shape, oriented at an angle of$15^{\circ}$ relative to the galactic plane. within its tidal radius, theobserved mf of m67 between 1.2 $\rm m_\odot$ and $\rm 0.8 m_\odot$ has asalpeter slope $\rm \eta = -1.93 \pm 0.66$. for stars of mass below 0.8 $\rmm_\odot$, $\rm \eta \sim 0$. it is plausible that the leveling-off of the mf atlower masses is a result of evaporation of lower mass stars in this mass rangeat a rate of one every $\sim 10^7$ years. if so, it is plausible that the imfof m67 has the canonical field value of $\rm \eta = -2.0$.

astro-ph;9806395	ring structure and warp of ngc5907 -- interaction with dwarf galaxies	the edge-on, nearby spiral galaxy ngc5907 has long been used as the prototypeof a ``non-interacting'' warped galaxy. we report here the discovery of twointeractions with companion dwarf galaxies that substantially change thispicture. first, a faint ring structure is discovered around this galaxy that islikely due to the tidal disruption of a companion dwarf spheroidal galaxy. thering is elliptical in shape with the center of ngc5907 close to one of thering's foci. this suggests the ring material is in orbit around ngc5907. nogaseous component to the ring has been detected either with deep h$\alpha$images or in very large array (vla) hi 21-cm line maps. the visible material inthe ring has an integrated luminosity &lt;= 10^8 l_sun and its brightest part hasa color r-i ~ 0.9. all of these properties are consistent with the ring being atidally-disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxy. second, we find that ngc5907 has adwarf companion galaxy, pgc54419, projected to be only 36.9 kpc from the centerof ngc5907, close in radial velocity (\delta v = 45 km s^{-1}) to the giantspiral galaxy. this dwarf is seen at the tip of the hi warp and in thedirection of the warp. hence, ngc5907 can no longer be considered``non-interacting,'' but is obviously interacting with its dwarf companionsmuch as the milky way interacts with its dwarf galaxies. these results, coupledwith the finding by others that dwarf galaxies tend to be found around giantgalaxies, suggest that tidal interaction with companions, even if containing amere 1% of the mass of the parent galaxy, might be sufficient to excite thewarps found in the disks of many large spiral galaxies.
