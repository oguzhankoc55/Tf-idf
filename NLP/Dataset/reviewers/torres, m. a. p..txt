0901.4018	an evolved donor star in the long-period cataclysmic variable hs  0218+3229	context. we present time-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of hs0218+3229, a new long-period cataclysmic variable discovered within the hamburgquasar survey. it is one of the few systems that allow a dynamical measurementof the masses of the stellar components. aims. we combine the analysis oftime-resolved optical spectroscopy and r-band photometry with the aim ofmeasuring the mass of the white dwarf and the donor star and the orbitalinclination. methods. cross-correlation of the spectra with k-type dwarftemplates is used to derive the radial velocity curve of the donor star. anoptimal subtraction of the broadened templates is performed to measure therotational broadening and constrain the spectral type of the donor. finally, anellipsoidal model is fitted to the r-band light curve to obtain constraintsupon the orbital inclination of the binary system. results. the orbital periodof hs 0218+3229 is found to be 0.297229661 +- 0.000000001 d (7.13351186 +-0.00000002 h), and the amplitude of the donor's radial velocity curve is k2 =162.4 +- 1.4 km/s. modelling the ellipsoidal light curves gives an orbitalinclination in the range i = 59 +- 3 deg. a rotational broadening between 82.4+- 1.2 km/s and 89.4 +- 1.3 km/s is found when assuming zero and continuum limbdarkening, respectively. the secondary star has most likely a spectral type k5and contributes ~ 80-85% to the r-band light. our analysis yields a mass ratioof 0.52 &lt; q &lt; 0.65, a white dwarf mass of 0.44 &lt; m1(msol) &lt; 0.65, and a donorstar mass of 0.23 &lt; m2(msol) &lt; 0.44. conclusions. we find that the donor starin hs 0218+3229 is significantly undermassive for its spectral type. it istherefore very likely that it has undergone nuclear evolution prior to theonset of mass transfer.

0704.1129	sw sextantis stars: the dominant population of cvs with orbital periods  between 3-4 hours	[abridged] we present time-series optical photometry of five new cvsidentified by the hamburg quasar survey. the eclipses observed in hs 0129+2933,hs 0220+0603, and hs 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. hs0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)h. time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new cvs (with the exception of hs0805+3822) is also presented. radial velocity studies provided an orbitalperiod of 3.55 h for hs 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observedphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. the spectroscopicbehaviour clearly identifies these new cvs as new sw sextantis stars. these newadditions increase the number of known sw sex stars to 35. almost 40 per centof the total sw sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating therequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and themodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. on the other hand,the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becomingmore pronounced. in fact, almost half the cvs which populate the 3-4.5 h periodinterval are definite members of the class. these statistics are confirmed byour results from the hamburg quasar survey cvs. remarkably, 54 per cent of thehamburg nova-like variables have been identified as sw sex stars with orbitalperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. the observation of this pile-up of systems closeto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with thestandard theory of cv evolution, as the sw sex stars are believed to have thehighest mass transfer rates among cvs. finally, we review the full range ofcommon properties that the sw sex stars exhibit.

0902.3960	optical spectroscopy and doppler tomography of cygnus x-2	we present phase resolved optical spectroscopy and doppler tomography ofv1341 cygni, the optical counterpart to the neutron star low mass x-ray binarycygnus x-2. we derive a radial velocity curve for the secondary star, finding aprojected radial velocity semi-amplitude of k2 = 79 +/- 3 km/s, leading to amass function of 0.51 +/- 0.06 msun, ~30% lower than the previous estimate. wetentatively attribute the lower value of k2 (compared to that obtained by otherauthors) to variations in the x-ray irradiation of the secondary star atdifferent epochs of observations. the limited phase coverage and/or longertimebase of previous observations may also contribute to the difference in k2.our value for the mass function implies a primary mass of 1.5 +/- 0.3 msun,somewhat lower than previous dynamical estimates, but consistent with the valuefound by analysis of type-i x-ray bursts from this system. our dopplertomography of the broad he ii 4686 line reveals that most of the emission fromthis line is produced on the irradiated face of the donor star, with littleemission from the accretion disc. in contrast, the doppler tomogram of the niii 4640.64 bowen blend line shows bright emission from near the gasstream/accretion disc impact region, with fainter emission from the gas streamand secondary star. this is the first lmxb for which the bowen blend isdominated by emission from the gas stream/accretion disc impact region, withoutcomparable emission from the secondary star. this has implications for theinterpretation of bowen blend doppler tomograms of other lmxbs for which theephemeris may not be accurately known.

0908.2817	a relativistic type ibc supernova without a detected gamma-ray burst	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) mark the explosive death of somemassive stars and are a rare sub-class of type ibc supernovae (sne ibc). theyare distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativisticoutflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and along-lived radio afterglow. to date, central engine-driven sne have beendiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expectedthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivityor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. in thisframework, the recovery of undetected grbs may be possible through radiosearches for sne ibc with relativistic outflows. here we report the discoveryof luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type ibc sn 2009bb,which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.the lack of a coincident grb makes sn 2009bb the first engine-driven sndiscovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. a comparison with our extensiveradio survey of sne ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines islow, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferredrate of nearby grbs. our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radiosurveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearestengine-driven sne. a similar result for a different supernova is reportedindependently.

0909.2632	following the 2008 outburst decay of the black hole candidate h1743-322  in x-ray and radio	in this paper we report on radio (vla and atca) and x-ray (rxte, chandra andswift) observations of the outburst decay of the transient black hole candidateh1743-322 in early 2008. we find that the x-ray light curve followed anexponential decay, leveling off towards its quiescent level. the exponentialdecay timescale is ~4 days and the quiescent flux corresponds to a luminosityof 3x10^32 (d/7.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. this together with the relation betweenquiescent x-ray luminosity and orbital period reported in the literaturesuggests that h1743-322 has an orbital period longer than ~10 hours. both theradio and x-ray light curve show evidence for flares. the radio - x-raycorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. this is muchlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black holetransients before. the radio spectral index measured during one of the radioflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, whichindicates that the radio emission is optically thin. this is unlike what hasbeen found before in black hole sources in the low-hard state. we attribute theradio flares and the low index for the radio - x-ray correlation to thepresence of shocks downstream the jet flow, triggered by ejection eventsearlier in the outburst. we find no evidence for a change in x-ray power lawspectral index during the decay, although the relatively high extinction of n_h=2.3x10^22 cm^-2 limits the detected number of soft photons and thus theaccuracy of the spectral fits.

0909.3991	time-resolved spectroscopy of the pulsating cv gw lib	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova gw libraeduring its rare april 2007 super-outburst and compare these with quiescentepochs. the data provide the first opportunity to track the evolution of theprincipal spectral features. in the early stages of the outburst, the opticallythick disc dominates the optical and the line components show clear orbitalradial velocity excursions. in the course of several weeks, optically thinregions become more prominent as strong emission lines replace the broad discabsorption.  post-outburst spectroscopy covering the i-band illustrates the advantages ofcaii relative to the commonly used balmer lines when attempting to constrainbinary parameters. due to the lower ionisation energy combined with smallerthermal and shear broadening of these lines, a sharp emission component is seento be moving in between the accretion disc peaks in the caii line. no suchcomponent is visible in the balmer lines. we interpret this as an emissioncomponent originating on the hitherto unseen mass donor star.  while our conservative dynamical limits place a hard upper limit on thebinary mass ratio of q&lt;0.23, we favour a significantly lower value near q~0.06.pulsation modeling suggests a wd mass ~1 m_sun. this, paired with a low massdonor, near the empirical sequence of an evolved cv close to the period bounce,appears to be consistent with all the observational constraints to date.[abridged]

1204.2735	the black hole candidate xte j1752-223 towards and in quiescence:  optical and simultaneous x-ray - radio observations	we present optical, x-ray and radio observations of the black hole transient(bht) xte j1752-223 towards and in quiescence. optical photometry shows thatthe quiescent magnitude of xte j1752-223 is fainter than 24.4 magnitudes in thei'-band. a comparison with measurements of the source during its 2009-2010outburst shows that the outburst amplitude is more than 8 magnitudes in thei'-band. known x-ray properties of the source combined with the faintness ofthe quiescence optical counterpart and the large outburst optical amplitudepoint towards a short orbital period system (porb&lt;~6.8 h) with an m type (orlater) mass donor, at a distance of 3.5&lt;~d&lt;~8 kpc. simultaneous x-ray and radiodata were collected with chandra and the evla, allowing constraints to beplaced on the quiescent x-ray and radio flux of xte j1752-223. furthermore,using data covering the final stage of the outburst decay, we investigated thelow luminosity end of the x-ray - radio correlation for this source andcompared it with other bhts. we found that xte j1752-223 adds to the number ofoutliers with respect to the `standard' x-ray - radio luminosity relation.furthermore, xte j1752-223 is the second source, after the bht h1743-322, thatshows a transition from the region of the outliers towards the `standard'correlation at low luminosity. finally, we report on a faint, variable x-raysource we discovered with chandra at an angular distance of ~2.9" to xtej1752-223 and at a position angle consistent with that of the radio jetspreviously observed from the bht. we discuss the possibility that we detectedx-ray emission associated with a jet from xte j1752-223.

1211.1040	identification of galactic bulge survey x-ray sources with tycho-2 stars	we identify 69 x-ray sources discovered by the galactic bulge survey (gbs)that are coincident with, or very close to bright stars in the tycho-2 catalog.additionally, two other gbs sources are resolved binary companions to tycho-2stars where both components are separately detected in x-rays. most of theseare likely to be real matches, but we identify nine objects with large andsignificant x-ray to optical offsets as either detections of resolved binarycompanions or chance alignments. we collate known spectral types for theseobjects, and also examine 2mass colors, variability information from theall-sky automated survey (asas), and x-ray hardness ratios for the brightestobjects. nearly a third of the stars are found to be optically variable,divided roughly evenly between irregular variations and periodic modulations.all fall among the softest objects identified by the gbs. the sample forms avery mixed selection, ranging in spectral class from o9 to m3. in some casesthe x-ray emission appears consistent with normal coronal emission fromlate-type stars, or wind emission from early-types, but the sample alsoincludes one known algol, one w uma system, two be stars, and several x-raybright objects likely to be coronally active stars or binaries. surprisingly, asubstantial fraction of the spectroscopically classified, non-coincidentalsample (12 out of 38 objects) have late b or a type counterparts. many of theseexhibit redder near-ir colors than expected for their spectral type and/orvariability, and it is likely that the x-rays originate from a late-typecompanion star in most or all of these objects.

1211.1194	cxogbsj174444.7-260330: a new long orbital period cataclysmic variable  in a low state	we present phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of a source discoveredwith the chandra galactic bulge survey (gbs), cxogbsj174444.7-260330 (aka cx93and cx153 in the previously published gbs list). we find two possible valuesfor the orbital period p, differing from each other by 13 seconds. the mostlikely solution is p =5.69014(6) hours. the optical lightcurves showellipsoidal modulations, whose modeling provides an inclination of 32+-1degrees for the most likely p. the spectra are dominated by a k5v companionstar (the disc veiling is &lt;~5%). broad and structured emission from the balmerlines is also detected, as well as fainter emission from hei. from theabsorption lines we measure k2 =117+-8km/s and v sin i = 69+-7km/s. by solvingthe system mass function we find m1=0.8+-0.2msun for the favored p and i,consistent with a white dwarf accretor, and m2=0.6+-0.2msun. we estimate adistance in the range 400-700 pc. although in a low accretion state, bothspectroscopy and photometry provide evidence of variability on a timescale ofmonths or faster. besides finding a new, long orbital period cataclysmicvariable in a low accretion state, this work shows that the design of the gbsworks efficiently to find accreting x-ray binaries in quiescence, highlightingthat the spectra of cvs in a low-accretion state can at times appear suggestiveof a quiescent neutron star or a black hole system.

1310.0224	identification of twenty-three accreting binaries in the galactic bulge  survey	(abridged:) we present the identification of optical counterparts to 23galactic bulge survey x-ray sources. we report their accurate coordinates andoptical spectra acquired at the vlt and magellan. all sources are classified asaccreting binaries according to their emission line characteristics. todistinguish accreting binaries from chromospherically active objects we developand explain criteria based on halpha and hei 5786,6678 emission line propertiesavailable in the literature. the spectroscopic properties and photometricvariability of all the objects are discussed and a classification of the sourceis given where possible. among the 23 systems, at least 9 of them show anaccretion-dominated optical spectrum (cx28, cx63, cx70, cx128, cx142, cx207,cx522, cx794, cx1011) and another 6 show photospheric lines from a late-typedonor star in addition to accretion disc emission (cx44, cx93, cx137, cx154,cx377 and cx1004) indicating that they are probably accreting binaries inquiescence or in a low accretion rate state. two sources are confirmed to beeclipsing: cx207 and cx794. cx207 shows a broad asymmetric halpha profileblue-shifted by &gt;300 km/s. such line profile characteristics are consistentwith a magnetic (polar) cv. cx794 is an eclipsing nova-like cv in the periodgap. time-resolved photometry and the large broadening of the halpha emissionlines in cx446 (2100 km/s fwhm) suggest that this is also an eclipsing orhigh-inclination accreting binary. finally, the low-accretion rate sourcecx1004 shows a double-peaked halpha profile with a fwhm of 2100 km/s. thissupports a high inclination or even eclipsing system. whether the compactobject is a white dwarf in an eclipsing cv or a black hole primary in ahigh-inclination lmxb remains to be established.

1310.2597	cxogbs~j173620.2--293338: a candidate symbiotic x-ray binary associated  with a bulge carbon star	the galactic bulge survey is a wide but shallow x-ray survey of regions aboveand below the plane in the galactic bulge. it was performed using the chandrax-ray observatory's acis camera. the survey is primarily designed to find andclassify low luminosity x-ray binaries. the combination of the x-ray depth ofthe survey and the accessibility of optical and infrared counterparts makesthis survey ideally suited to identification of new symbiotic x-ray binaries inthe bulge. we consider the specific case of the x-ray source cxogbsj173620.2-293338. it is coincident to within 1 arcsec with a very red star,showing a carbon star spectrum and irregular variability in the opticalgravitational lensing experiment data. we classify the star as a late c-r typecarbon star based on its spectral features, photometric properties, andvariability characteristics, although a low-luminosity c-n type cannot be ruledout. the brightness of the star implies it is located in the bulge, and itsphotometric properties overall are consistent with the bulge carbon starpopulation. given the rarity of carbon stars in the bulge, we estimate theprobability of such a close chance alignment of any galactic bulge surveysource with a carbon star to be &lt;1e-3 suggesting that this is likely to be areal match. if the x-ray source is indeed associated with the carbon star, thenthe x-ray luminosity is around 9e32 erg/s. its characteristics are consistentwith a low luminosity symbiotic x-ray binary, or possibly a low accretion ratewhite dwarf symbiotic.

1310.7238	discovery of a new kind of explosive x-ray transient near m86	we present the discovery of a new type of explosive x-ray flash in chandraimages of the old elliptical galaxy m86. this unique event is characterised bythe peak luminosity of 6x10^42 erg/s for the distance of m86, the presence ofprecursor events, the timescale between the precursors and the main event(~4,000 s), the absence of detectable hard x-ray and gamma-ray emission, thetotal duration of the event and the detection of a faint associated opticalsignal. the transient is located close to m86 in the virgo cluster at thelocation where gas and stars are seen protruding from the galaxy probably dueto an ongoing wet minor merger. we discuss the possible mechanisms for thetransient and we conclude that the x-ray flash could have been caused by thedisruption of a compact white dwarf star by a ~10^4 msun black hole.alternative scenarios such that of a foreground neutron star accreting anasteroid or the detection of an off-axis (short) gamma-ray burst cannot beexcluded at present.

1501.02017	gemini spectroscopy of galactic bulge sources: a population of hidden  accreting binaries revealed?	we present gemini spectroscopy for 21 candidate optical counterparts to x-raysources discovered in the galactic bulge survey (gbs). for the majority of the21 sources, the optical spectroscopy establishes that they are indeed thelikely counterparts. one of the criteria we used for the identification was thepresence of an ha emission line. the spectra of several sources revealed an haemission line only after careful subtraction of the f or g stellar spectralabsorption lines. in a sub-class of three of these sources the residual halphaemission line is broad (&gt; 400 km/s) which suggests that it is formed in anaccretion disk, whereas in other cases the line width is such that we currentlycannot determine whether the line emission is formed in an active star/binaryor in an accretion disk. gbs source cx377 shows this hidden accretion behaviourmost dramatically. the previously-identified broad ha emission of this sourceis not present in its gemini spectra taken about 1 year later. however, broademission is revealed after subtracting an f6 template star spectrum. the geminispectra of three sources (cx446, cx1004, and cxb2) as well as the presence ofpossible eclipses in light curves of these sources suggest that these sourcesare accreting binaries viewed under a high inclination.

1503.08634	radio monitoring of the hard state jets in the 2011 outburst of maxi  j1836-194	maxi j1836-194 is a galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary that wasdiscovered in 2011 when it went into outburst. in this paper, we present thefull radio monitoring of this system during its `failed' outburst, in which thesource did not complete a full set of state changes, only transitioning as faras the hard intermediate state. observations with the karl g. jansky very largearray (vla) and australia telescope compact array (atca) show that the jetproperties changed significantly during the outburst. the vla observationsdetected linearly polarised emission at a level of ~1% early in the outburst,increasing to ~3% as the outburst peaked. high-resolution images with the verylong baseline array (vlba) show a ~15 mas jet along the position angle $-21 \pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the electric vector position angle found from ourpolarisation results ($-21 \pm 4^\circ$), implying that the magnetic field isperpendicular to the jet. astrometric observations suggest that the systemrequired an asymmetric natal kick to explain its observed space velocity.comparing quasi-simultaneous x-ray monitoring with the 5 ghz vla observationsfrom the 2011 outburst shows an unusually steep hard-state radio/x-raycorrelation of $l_{\rm r} \propto l_{\rm x}^{1.8\pm0.2}$, where $l_{\rm r}$ and$l_{\rm x}$ denote the radio and x-ray luminosities, respectively. with atcaand swift monitoring of the source during a period of re-brightening in 2012,we show that the system lay on the same steep correlation. due to the lowinclination of this system, we then investigate the possibility that theobserved correlation may have been steepened by variable doppler boosting.

1503.08874	vlt spectroscopy of the black hole candidate swift j1357.2-0933 in  quiescence	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the counterpart to thehigh-inclination black hole low-mass x-ray binary swift j1357.2-0933 inquiescence. absorption features from the mass donor star were not detected.instead the spectra display prominent broad double-peaked halpha emission andweaker hei emission lines. from the halpha peak-to-peak separation we constrainthe radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star to &gt; 789 km/s. furtheranalysis through radial velocity and equivalent width measurements indicatesthat the halpha line is free of variability due to s-wave components or disceclipses. from our data and previous observations during outburst, we concludethat long-term radial velocity changes ascribed to a precessing disc were oflow amplitude or not present. this implies that the centroid position of theline should closely represent the systemic radial velocity. using the derivedsystemic velocity of -150 km/s and the best available limits on the sourcedistance, we infer that the black hole is moving towards the plane in itscurrent galactic orbit unless the proper motion is substantial. finally, thedepth of the central absorption in the double peaked profiles adds support forswift j1357.2-0933 as a high-inclination system. on the other hand, we arguethat the low hydrogen column density inferred from x-ray fitting suggests thatthe system is not seen edge-on.

1507.04663	total eclipse of the heart: the am cvn gaia14aae / assasn-14cn	we report the discovery and characterisation of a deeply eclipsing amcvn-system, gaia14aae (= assasn-14cn). gaia14aae was identified independentlyby the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn; shappee et al. 2014)and by the gaia science alerts project, during two separate outbursts. a thirdoutburst is seen in archival pan-starrs-1 (ps1; schlafly et al. 2012; tonry etal. 2012; magnier et al. 2013) and asas-sn data. spectroscopy reveals a hot,hydrogen-deficient spectrum with clear double-peaked emission lines, consistentwith an accreting double degenerate classification. we use follow-up photometryto constrain the orbital parameters of the system. we find an orbital period of49.71 min, which places gaia14aae at the long period extremum of theoutbursting am cvn period distribution. gaia14aae is dominated by the lightfrom its accreting white dwarf. assuming an orbital inclination of 90 degreesfor the binary system, the contact phases of the white dwarf lead to lowerlimits of 0.78 m solar and 0.015 m solar on the masses of the accretor anddonor respectively and a lower limit on the mass ratio of 0.019. gaia14aae isonly the third eclipsing am cvn star known, and the first in which the wd istotally eclipsed. using a helium wd model, we estimate the accretor's effectivetemperature to be 12900+-200 k. the three out-burst events occurred within 4months of each other, while no other outburst activity is seen in the previous8 years of catalina real-time transient survey (crts; drake et al. 2009),pan-starrs-1 and asas-sn data. this suggests that these events might berebrightenings of the first outburst rather than individual events.

1509.00315	discovery of a red supergiant counterpart to rx~j004722.4-252051, a ulx  in ngc 253	we present two epochs of near-infrared spectroscopy of the candidate redsupergiant counterpart to rx~j004722.4-252051, a ulx in ngc 253. we measureradial velocities of the object and its approximate spectral type bycross-correlating our spectra with those of known red supergiants. ourvlt/x-shooter spectrum is best matched by that of early m-type supergiants,confirming the red supergiant nature of the candidate counterpart. the radialvelocity of the spectrum, taken on 2014, august 23, is $417 \pm 4$ km/s. thisis consistent with the radial velocity measured in our spectrum taken withmagellan/mmirs on 2013, june 28, of $410 \pm 70$ km/s, although the large erroron the latter implies that a radial velocity shift expected for a black hole oftens of $m_\odot$ can easily be hidden. using nebular emission lines we findthat the radial velocity due to the rotation of ngc 253 is 351 $\pm$ 4 km/s atthe position of the ulx. thus the radial velocity of the counterpart confirmsthat the source is located in ngc 253, but also shows an offset with respect tothe local bulk motion of the galaxy of 66 $\pm$ 6 km/s. we argue that the mostlikely origin for this displacement lies either in a sn kick, requiring asystem containing a $\gtrsim 50$ $m_\odot$ black hole, and/or in orbital radialvelocity variations in the ulx binary system, requiring a $\gtrsim 100$$m_\odot$ black hole. we therefore conclude that rx~j004722.4-252051 is astrong candidate for a ulx containing a massive stellar black hole.

(2010) as a candidatehyperluminous x-ray source (hlx), x-ray bright supernova or recoilingsupermassive black hole at $l_x = 2.2 \times 10^{41}$ erg/s (if associated withthe galaxy at 182 mpc). we detect a new outburst of the source in a chandraimage obtained on nov 20, 2014 and show that the x-ray count rate varies by afactor $&gt; 60$. new hst/wfc3 observations obtained in 2014 show that the opticalcounterpart is still visible at $g' = 27.1 \pm 0.1$, $1 \pm 0.1$ magnitudefainter than in the discovery hst/acs observation from 2003. this opticalvariability strongly suggests that the optical and x-ray source are related.furthermore, these properties strongly favour an hlx nature of the source overthe alternative scenarios. we therefore conclude that cxo j122518.6+144545 ismost likely an outbursting hlx. it is only the second such object to bediscovered, after hlx-1 in eso 243-49. its high x-ray luminosity makes it astrong candidate to host an intermediate mass black hole.

astro-ph;0007232	detection of the old stellar component of the major galactic bar	we present near-ir colour--magnitude diagrams and star counts for a number ofregions along the galactic plane. it is shown that along the l=27 b=0 line ofsight there is a feature at 5.7 +-0.7kpc with a density of stars at least afactor two and probably more than a factor five times that of the disc at thesame position. this feature forms a distinct clump on an h vs. j-h diagram andis seen at all longitudes from the bulge to about l=28, but at no longitudegreater than this. the distance to the feature at l=20 is about 0.5kpc furtherthan at l=27 and by l=10 it has merged with, or has become, the bulge. giventhat at l=27 and l=21 there is also a clustering of very young stars, the onlycomponent that can reasonably explain what is seen is a bar with half length ofaround 4kpc and a position angle of about 43+-7.

astro-ph;0302068	time-resolved spectroscopy of the m15 x-ray binary ac211/x2127+119	we present time-resolved spectroscopy acquired during two epochs (spacedapart by ~15 days) of the eclipsing low mass x-ray binary ac211/x2127+119 inthe globular cluster m15. the spectra show variations in the heii 4686 emissionline not only modulated on the orbital period, but also on time-scales of a fewdays. during the first epoch of observation, the emission line shows a strongs-wave superimposed on the average double-peaked profile. the line exhibits noevidence of rotational disturbance at the orbital phases when the eclipse isobserved in the optical continuum. during the second epoch, no double-peak ors-wave component is present. the hei absorption lines detected by other authorsare not present in our spectra. a doppler image of the heii 4686 for the firstepoch supports the presence of the accretion disc. no hotspot is detected,although enhanced emission at v_x=30km/s, v_y=160 km/s is observed. we discussthe implications of this emission in the context of an x-ray heated donor star,in which case a high mass ratio and neutron star primary are implied. finally,we speculate on the possibility of a misaligned secondary star in ac211.

astro-ph;0405509	mmt observations of the black hole candidate xte j1118+480 near and in  quiescence	we report on the analysis of new and previously published mmt optical spectraof the black hole binary xte j1118+480 during the decline from the 2000outburst to true quiescence. from cross-correlation with template stars, wemeasure the radial velocity of the secondary to derive a new spectroscopicephemeris. the observations acquired during approach to quiescence confirm theearlier reported modulation in the centroid of the double-peaked halphaemission line. additionally, our data combined with the results presented byzurita et al. (2002) provide support for a modulation with a periodicity inagreement with the expected precession period of the accretion disk of ~52 day.doppler images during the decline phase of the halpha emission line showevidence for a hotspot and emission from the gas stream: the hotspot isobserved to vary its position, which may be due to the precession of the disk.the data available during quiescence show that the centroid of the halphaemission line is offset by about -100 km/s from the systemic velocity whichsuggests that the disk continues to precess. a halpha tomogram reveals emissionfrom near the donor star after subtraction of the ring-like contribution fromthe accretion disk which we attribute to chromospheric emission. no hotspot ispresent suggesting that accretion from the secondary has stopped (or decreasedsignificantly) during quiescence. finally, a comparison is made with the blackhole xrn gro j0422+32: we show that the halpha profile of this system alsoexhibits a behaviour consistent with a precessing disk.

astro-ph;0410348	time-resolved photometry of the nova remnants dm gem, cp lac, gi mon,  v400 per, ct ser and xx tau	we present the first results of a photometric survey of poorly studied novaremnants in the northern hemisphere. the main results are as follows: dm gemshows a modulation at 0.123 d (probably linked to the orbit) and rapidvariations at ~22 min. a moderate resolution spectrum taken at the time of thephotometric observations shows intense heii 4686 and bowen emission,characteristic of an intermediate polar or a sw sex star. variability at 0.127d and intense flickering (or quasi-periodic oscillations) are the main featuresof the light curve of cp lac. a 0.1-mag dip lasting for ~45 min is observed ingi mon, which could be an eclipse. a clear modulation (probably related to theorbital motion) either at 0.179 d or 0.152 d is observed in the b-band lightcurve of v400 per. the results for ct ser point to an orbital period close to0.16 d. intense flickering is also characteristic of this old nova. finally, xxtau shows a possible periodic signal near 0.14 d and displays fast variabilityat ~24 min. its brightness seems to be modulated at ~5 d. we relate this longperiodicity to the motion of an eccentric/tilted accretion disc in the binary.

astro-ph;0505120	chandra observations of the millisecond x-ray pulsar igr j00291+5934 in  quiescence	in this paper we report on our analysis of three chandra observations of theaccretion-powered millisecond x-ray pulsar igr j00291+5934 obtained during thelate stages of the 2004 outburst. we also report the serendipitous detection ofthe source in quiescence by rosat during mjd 48830-48839. the detected 0.3-10kev source count rates varied significantly between the chandra observationsfrom (7.2+-1.2)x10^-3, (6.8+-0.9)x10^-3, and (1.4+-0.1)x10^-2 counts per secondfor the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd chandra observation, on mjd 53371.88, 53383.99, and53407.57, respectively. the count rate for the 3rd observation is 2.0+-0.4times as high as that of the average of the first two observations. theunabsorbed 0.5-10 kev source flux for the best-fit power-law model to thesource spectrum was (7.9+-2.5)x10^-14, (7.3+-2.0)x10^-14, and(1.17+-0.22)x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd chandraobservation, respectively. we find that this source flux is consistent withthat found by rosat [~(5.4+-2.4)x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1]. under the assumptionthat the interstellar extinction, n_h, does not vary between the observations,we find that the blackbody temperature during the 2nd chandra observation issignificantly higher than that during the 1st and 3rd observation. furthermore,the effective temperature of the neutron star derived from fitting an absorbedblackbody or neutron star atmosphere model to the data is rather high incomparison with many other neutron star soft x-ray transients in quiescence,even during the 1st and 3rd observation. if we assume that the source quiescentluminosity is similar to that measured for two other accretion poweredmillisecond pulsars in quiescence, the distance to igr j00291+5934 is 2.6-3.6kpc.

astro-ph;0506055	hs 0943+1404, a true intermediate polar	we have identified a new intermediate polar, hs 0943+1404, as part of ourongoing search for cataclysmic variables in the hamburg quasar survey. theorbital and white dwarf spin periods determined from time-resolved photometryand spectroscopy are porb ~= 250 min and pspin = 69.171 +- 0.001 min,respectively. the combination of a large ratio pspin/porb ~= 0.3 and a longorbital period is very unusual compared to the other known intermediate polars.the magnetic moment of the white dwarf is estimated to be mu1 ~ 10^{34} g cm^3,which is in the typical range of polars. our extensive photometry shows that hs0943+1404 enters into deep (~ 3 mag) low states, which are also acharacteristic feature of polars. we therefore suggest that the system is atrue ``intermediate'' polar that will eventually synchronise, that is, atransitional object between intermediate polars and polars. the opticalspectrum of hs 0943+1404 also exhibits a number of unusual emission lines, mostnoticeably nii 5680, which is likely to reflect enhanced nitrogen abundances inthe envelope of the secondary.

astro-ph;0602222	the 2005 outburst of the halo black hole x-ray transient xte j1118+480	we present optical and infrared monitoring of the 2005 outburst of the haloblack hole x-ray transient xte j1118+480. we measured a total outburstamplitude of ~5.7+-0.1 mag in the r band and ~5 mag in the infrared j, h andk_s bands. the hardness ratio hr2 (5-12 kev/3-5 kev) from the rxte/asm data is1.53+-0.02 at the peak of the outburst indicating a hard spectrum. both theshape of the light curve and the ratio l_x (1-10 kev)/l_opt resemble themini-outbursts observed in gro j0422+32 and xte j1859+226. during earlydecline, we find a 0.02-mag amplitude variation consistent with a superhumpmodulation, like the one observed during the 2000 outburst. similarly, xtej1118+480 displayed a double-humped ellipsoidal modulation distorted by asuperhump wave when settled into a near-quiescence level, suggesting that thedisk expanded to the 3:1 resonance radius after outburst where it remaineduntil early quiescence. the system reached quiescence at r=19.02+-0.03 aboutthree months after the onset of the outburst. the optical rise preceded thex-ray rise by at most 4 days. the spectral energy distributions (seds) at thedifferent epochs during outburst are all quasi-power laws with f_nuproportional to nu^alpha increasing toward the blue. at the peak of theoutburst we derived alpha=0.49+-0.04 for the optical data alone andalpha=0.1+-0.1 when fitting solely the infrared. this difference between theoptical and the infrared seds suggests that the infrared is dominated by adifferent component (a jet?) whereas the optical is presumably showing the diskevolution.

astro-ph;0703497	swift observations of the cooling accretion disk of xte j1817-330	the black hole candidate x-ray transient xte j1817-330 was observed by theswift satellite over 160 days of its 2006 outburst with the xrt and uvotinstruments. at the start of the observations, the xrt spectra show that the0.6-10 kev emission is dominated by an optically thick, geometrically thinaccretion disk with an inner disk temperature of $\sim0.8$ kev, indicating thatthe source was in a high/soft state during the initial outburst phase. wetracked the source through its decline into the low/hard state with theaccretion disk cooling to $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{kev}$ and the inner disk radiusconsistent with the innermost stable circular orbit at all times. furthermore,the x-ray luminosity roughly follows $l_x \propto t^4$ during the decline,consistent with a geometrically stable blackbody. these results are thestrongest evidence yet obtained that accretion disks do not automaticallyrecede after a state transition, down to accretion rates as low as $0.001l_{edd}$. meanwhile, the near-uv flux does not track the x-ray disk flux, andis well in excess of what is predicted if the near-uv emission is from viscousdissipation in the outer disk. the strong correlation between the hard x-rayflux and the near-uv flux, which scale as $l_x^{0.5}$, indicate thatreprocessed emission is most likely the dominate contribution to the near-uvflux. we discuss our results within the context of accretion disks and theoverall accretion flow geometry in accreting black holes.
