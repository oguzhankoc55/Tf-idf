0901.2936	are most low-luminosity agn really obscured?	at low eddington ratio (mdot), two effects make it harder to detect agn givensome selection criteria. first, even with fixed accretion physics, agn arediluted/less luminous relative to their hosts; the magnitude of this depends onhost properties and so on luminosity and redshift. second, they may transitionto a radiatively inefficient state, changing sed shape and dramaticallydecreasing in optical/ir luminosity. these effects lead to differences inobserved agn samples, even at fixed bolometric luminosity and after correctionfor obscuration. the true eddington ratio distribution may depend strongly onluminosity, but this will be seen only in surveys robust to dilution andradiative inefficiency (x-ray or narrow-line samples); selection effects implythat agn in optical samples will have uniformly high mdot. this also impliesthat different selection methods yield systems with different hosts: theclustering of faint optical/ir sources will be weaker than that of x-raysources, and optical/ir seyferts will reside in more disk-dominated galaxieswhile x-ray selected seyferts will preferentially occupy early-type systems. ifobserved mdot distributions are correct, a large fraction of low-luminosity agncurrently classified as 'obscured' are in fact diluted and/or radiativelyinefficient, not obscured by gas or dust. this is equally true if x-rayhardness is used as a proxy for obscuration, since radiatively inefficient sedsnear mdot~0.01 are x-ray hard. these effects can explain most of the claimedluminosity/redshift dependence in the 'obscured' agn population, with the trueobscured fraction as low as 20%.

0901.4111	the effects of gas on morphological transformation in mergers:  implications for bulge and disk demographics	transformation of disks into spheroids via mergers is a well-accepted elementof galaxy formation models. however, recent simulations have shown that bulgeformation is suppressed in increasingly gas-rich mergers. we investigate theglobal implications of these results in a cosmological framework, usingindependent approaches: empirical halo-occupation models (where galaxies arepopulated in halos according to observations) and semi-analytic models. inboth, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the over-production ofspheroids: low and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to bebulge-dominated (b/t~0.5 at &lt;10^10 m_sun), with almost no bulgeless systems),even if they have avoided major mergers. including the different physicalbehavior of gas in mergers immediately leads to a dramatic change: bulgeformation is suppressed in low-mass galaxies, observed to be gas-rich (givingb/t~0.1 at &lt;10^10 m_sun, with a number of bulgeless galaxies in good agreementwith observations). simulations and analytic models which neglect thesimilarity-breaking behavior of gas have difficulty reproducing the strongobserved morphology-mass relation. however, the observed dependence of gasfractions on mass, combined with suppression of bulge formation in gas-richmergers, naturally leads to the observed trends. discrepancies betweenobservations and models that ignore the role of gas increase with redshift; inmodels that treat gas properly, galaxies are predicted to be lessbulge-dominated at high redshifts, in agreement with the observations. wediscuss implications for the global bulge mass density and future observationaltests.

0901.4337	recovering stellar population properties and redshifts from broad-band  photometry of simulated galaxies: lessons for sed modeling	we present a detailed analysis of our ability to determine stellar masses,ages, reddening and extinction values, and star formation rates ofhigh-redshift galaxies by modeling broad-band seds with stellar populationsynthesis. in order to do so, we computed synthetic optical-to-nir seds formodel galaxies taken from hydrodynamical merger simulations placed at redshifts1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3. viewed under different angles and during different evolutionaryphases, the simulations represent a wide variety of galaxy types (disks,mergers, spheroids). we show that simulated galaxies span a wide range in sedsand color, comparable to these of observed galaxies. in all star-formingphases, dust attenuation has a large effect on colors, seds, and fluxes. thebroad-band seds were then fed to a standard sed modeling procedure andresulting stellar population parameters were compared to their true values.disk galaxies generally show a decent median correspondence between the trueand estimated mass and age, but suffer from large uncertainties. during themerger itself, we find larger offsets (e.g., log m_recovered - log m_true =-0.13^{+0.10}_{-0.14}). e(b-v) values are generally recovered well, but theestimated total visual absorption av is consistently too low, increasingly sofor larger optical depths. since the largest optical depths occur during thephases of most intense star formation, it is for the highest sfrs that we findthe largest underestimates. the masses, ages, e(b-v), av, and sfr of mergerremnants (spheroids) are very well reproduced. we discuss possible biases insed modeling results caused by mismatch between the true and template starformation history, dust distribution, metallicity variations and agncontribution.

0903.2479	compact high-redshift galaxies are the cores of the most massive  present-day spheroids	observations suggest that effective radii of high-z massive spheroids are asmuch as a factor ~6 smaller than low-z galaxies of comparable mass. given theapparent absence of low-z counterparts, this has often been interpreted asindicating that the high density, compact red galaxies must be 'puffed up' bysome mechanism. we compare the ensemble of high-z observations with largesamples of well-observed low-z ellipticals. at the same physical radii, thestellar surface mass densities of low and high-z systems are comparable.moreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift iscomparable to or larger than that observed at z&gt;1-2, consistent with thecontinuous buildup of spheroids over this time. the entire population ofcompact, high-z red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density coresof present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density fromz=2 to z=0. the primary difference between low and high-z systems is thus theobserved low-density material at large radii in low-z spheroids (rather thanthe high-density material in high-z spheroids). such low-density material mayeither (1) assemble at z&lt;2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z&gt;2.mock observations of low-z massive systems show that the high-z observations donot yet probe sufficiently low surface brightness material to detect the lowsurface density 'wings' (if present). thus, if the high-z galaxies resemble themost massive systems today, their inferred effective radii could beunder-estimated by factors ~2-4. this difference arises because massive systemsat low redshift are not well-fit by single sersic profiles. we discussimplications of our results for physical models of galaxy evolution.

0903.3949	the small scatter in bh-host correlations &amp; the case for self-regulated  bh growth	supermassive black holes (bhs) obey tight scaling relations between theirmass and their host galaxy properties such as total stellar mass, velocitydispersion, and potential well depth. this has led to the development ofself-regulated models for bh growth, in which feedback from the central bhhalts its own growth upon reaching a critical threshold. however, models havealso been proposed in which feedback plays no role: so long as a fixed fractionof the host gas supply is accreted, relations like those observed can bereproduced. here, we argue that the scatter in the observed bh-hostcorrelations, and its run with scale, presents a demanding constraint on anymodel for these correlations, and that it favors self-regulated models of bhgrowth. we show that the scatter in the stellar mass fraction within a radius rin observed ellipticals and spheroids increases strongly at small r. at fixedtotal stellar mass (or host velocity dispersion), on very small scales near thebh radius of influence, there is an order-of-magnitude scatter in the amount ofgas that must have entered and formed stars. in short, the bh appears to 'knowmore' about the global host galaxy potential on large scales than the stars andgas supply on small scales. this is predicted in self-regulated models;however, models where there is no feedback would generically predictorder-of-magnitude scatter in the bh-host correlations. likewise, models inwhich the bh feedback in the 'bright' mode does not regulate the growth of thebh itself, but sets the stellar mass of the galaxy by inducing star formationor blowing out a mass in gas much larger than the galaxy stellar mass, aredifficult to reconcile with the scatter on small scales.

0904.0649	quasar feedback: more bang for your buck	we propose a two-stage model for the effects of feedback from a bright quasaron the cold gas in a galaxy. it is difficult for feedback from near theaccretion disk to directly impact dense molecular clouds at ~kpc. but if suchfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ism (a relatively'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, acombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectivelyexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. such expansiondramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material andmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorptionof the incident quasar radiation field. even a moderate effect of this naturecan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionizedand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. since the amount ofmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field ismore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has beenaltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate amoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order ofmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.instead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initialfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of theluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, thismechanism could be efficient. this amounts to hot gas outflow rates from nearthe accretion disk of only 5-10% of the bh accretion rate.

0706.3706	modeling the dust properties of z ~ 6 quasars with art^2 --  all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree	the detection of large quantities of dust in z ~ 6 quasars by infrared andradio surveys presents puzzles for the formation and evolution of dust in theseearly systems. previously (li et al. 2007), we showed that luminous quasars atz &gt; 6 can form through hierarchical mergers of gas-rich galaxies. here, wecalculate the dust properties of simulated quasars and their progenitors usinga three-dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code, art^2 --all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree. art^2incorporates a radiative equilibrium algorithm for dust emission, an adaptivegrid for inhomogeneous density, a multiphase model for the ism, and asupernova-origin dust model. we reproduce the sed and dust properties of sdssj1148+5251, and find that the infrared emission are closely associated with theformation and evolution of the quasar host. the system evolves from a cold to awarm ulirg owing to heating and feedback from stars and agn. furthermore, theagn has significant implications for the interpretation of observation of thehosts. our results suggest that vigorous star formation in merging progenitorsis necessary to reproduce the observed dust properties of z~6 quasars,supporting a merger-driven origin for luminous quasars at high redshifts andthe starburst-to-quasar evolutionary hypothesis.

0905.2411	color distributions, number and mass densities of massive galaxies at  1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3: comparing observations with merger simulations	we present a comparison between the observed color distribution, number andmass density of massive galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 and a model by hopkins et al.that relates the quasar and galaxy population on the basis of gas-rich mergers.in order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after agas-rich merger involving quasar activity, we confront photometry of massive (m&gt; 4x10^10 msun) galaxies extracted from the fires, goods-south, and musycsurveys, together spanning an area of 496 arcmin^2, with synthetic photometryfrom hydrodynamical merger simulations. as in the hopkins et al. (2006b) model,we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. wefind that the synthetic u-v and v-j colors of galaxies that had a quasar phasein their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterizedby a quiescent stellar population. at z ~ 2.6, the observed number and massdensity of quiescent red galaxies with m &gt; 4x10^10 msun is consistent with themodel in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in thepast. at z ~ 1.9, 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predictedby the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars. the merger model alsopredicts a large number of galaxies undergoing merger-driven star formation. wefind that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30-50% of theobserved massive star-forming galaxies. however, their colors do not matchthose of observed star-forming galaxies. in particular, the colors of dusty redgalaxies are not reproduced by the simulations. several possible origins ofthis discrepancy are discussed. the observational constraints on the validityof the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties instellar population synthesis and radiative transfer.

0906.5357	mergers and bulge formation in lambda-cdm: which mergers matter?	we use a suite of semi-empirical models to predict galaxy merger rates andcontributions to bulge growth as functions of merger mass, redshift, and massratio. the models use empirical halo occupation constraints to identifymergers, together with high-resolution simulations to quantify how mergers withdifferent properties contribute to the bulge population. we find good agreementwith a variety of observational constraints, and provide fitting functions formerger rates and contributions to bulge growth. we identify several robustconclusions. (1) major mergers dominate formation and assembly of l* bulges andthe spheroid mass density, minor mergers contribute ~30%. (2) this ismass-dependent: bulge formation is dominated by more minor mergers inlower-mass systems. at higher masses, bulges form in major mergers near l*, butsubsequently assemble in minor mergers. (3) the minor/major contribution isalso morphology-dependent: higher b/t systems form in more major mergers, lowerb/t systems form in situ from minor mergers. (4) low-mass galaxies, beinggas-rich, require more major mergers to reach the same b/t as high-masssystems. (5) absolute merger rates increase with galaxy mass. (6) predictedrates agree well with observations, but suggest that some morphology-selectedsamples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) predicted rates agreewith integrated growth in bulge mass with cosmic time, but with factor ~2uncertainty - half the bulge mass density could come from non-mergers. weconsider ~1000 model variations and quantify resulting uncertainties.conclusions regarding the major/minor contribution to bulge growth are veryrobust, absolute merger rates have systematic factor ~2 uncertainties.

0908.4088	a maximum stellar surface density in dense stellar systems	we compile observations of the surface mass density profiles of dense stellarsystems, including globular clusters in the milky way and nearby galaxies,massive star clusters in nearby starbursts, nuclear star clusters in dwarfspheroidals and late-type disks, ultra-compact dwarfs, and galaxy spheroidsspanning the range from low-mass cusp bulges and ellipticals to massive coreellipticals. we show that in all cases the maximum stellar surface densityattained in the central regions of these systems is similar, sigma_max ~ 10^11m_sun/kpc^2 (~20 g/cm^2), despite the fact that the systems span 7 orders ofmagnitude in total stellar mass m_star, 5 in effective radius r_e, and have awide range in effective surface density m_star/r_e^2. the surface density limitis reached on a wide variety of physical scales in different systems and isthus not a limit on three-dimensional stellar density. given the very differentformation mechanisms involved in these different classes of objects, we arguethat a single piece of physics likely determines sigma_max. the radiationfields and winds produced by massive stars can have a significant influence onthe formation of both star clusters and galaxies, while neither supernovae norblack hole accretion are important in star cluster formation. we thus concludethat feedback from massive stars likely accounts for the observed sigma_max,plausibly because star formation reaches an eddington-like flux that regulatesthe growth of these diverse systems. this suggests that current models ofgalaxy formation, which focus on feedback from supernovae and active galacticnuclei, are missing a crucial ingredient.

0909.2039	discriminating between the physical processes that drive spheroid size  evolution	massive galaxies at high-z have smaller effective radii than those today, butsimilar central densities. their size growth therefore relates primarily to theevolving abundance of low-density material. various models have been proposedto explain this evolution, which have different implications for galaxy, star,and bh formation. we compile observations of spheroid properties as a functionof redshift and use them to test proposed models. evolution in progenitorgas-richness with redshift gives rise to initial formation of smaller spheroidsat high-z. these systems can then evolve in apparent or physical size viaseveral channels: (1) equal-density 'dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor'dry' mergers with less-dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, (4) evolutionin stellar populations &amp; mass-to-light-ratio gradients, (5) age-dependent biasin stellar mass estimators, (6) observational fitting/selection effects. if anyone of these is tuned to explain observed size evolution, they make distinctpredictions for evolution in other galaxy properties. only model (2) isconsistent with observations as a dominant effect. it is the only model whichallows for an increase in m_bh/m_bulge with redshift. still, the amount ofmerging needed is larger than that observed or predicted. we therefore comparecosmologically motivated simulations, in which all these effects occur, &amp; showthey are consistent with all the observational constraints. effect (2), whichbuilds up an extended low-density envelope, does dominate the evolution, buteffects 1,3,4, &amp; 6 each contribute ~20% to the size evolution (a net factor~2). this naturally also predicts evolution in m_bh-sigma similar to thatobserved.

0909.3306	when should we treat galaxies as isolated?	traditionally, secular evolution is defined as evolution of systems where theinternal growth of structure and instabilities dominates the growth viaexternal drivers (e.g. accretion/mergers). most study has focused on 'isolated'galaxies, where seed asymmetries may represent realistic cosmologicalsubstructure, but subsequent evolution ignores galaxy growth. large-scale modesin the disk then grow on a timescale of order a disk rotation period (0.1-1gyr). if, however, galaxies evolve cosmologically on a shorter timescale, thenit may not be appropriate to consider them 'isolated.' we outline simplescalings to ask whether the timescale for secular evolution is shorter than thetimescale for cosmological accretion and mergers. this is the case in a narrow,but important range of perturbation amplitudes corresponding to substructure ormode/bar fractional amplitudes 0.01-0.1, a range of interest for observedstrong bars and pseudobulges. at smaller amplitudes &lt;&lt;0.1, systems are notisolated: typical disks will grow by accretion at a comparable level over evena single dynamical time. at larger amplitudes &gt;&gt;0.1, the evolution is no longersecular; direct gravitational evolution of the seed swamps the internal diskresponse. we derive criteria for when disks can be well-approximated as'isolated' as a function of mass, redshift, and disk stability. the relevantparameter space shrinks at higher mass, higher disk stability, and higher-z asaccretion rates increase. cosmological rates of galaxy evolution also define amaximum bar/mode lifetime of practical interest, of ~0.1/h(z). longer-livedmodes will de-couple from their drivers (if driven) and encounter cosmologicaleffects.

0910.4582	a new empirical method to infer the starburst history of the universe  from local galaxy properties	the centers of bulges are formed dissipationally via gas inflows over shorttimescales: the 'starburst' mode of star formation (sf). recent work has shownthat detailed observations can be used to separate the stellar mass profile ofthese 'burst relic' components in local systems. together with the assumptionthat some kennicutt-schmidt law holds, and that the burst was indeed adissipational gas-rich event, we show that the observed profiles can beinverted to obtain the time and space-dependent sf history of each burst.performing this with a large sample of well-studied spheroids, we show that theimplied bursts scale in magnitude, mass, peak sfr, and spatial extent withgalaxy mass in simple manner, and provide fits to these correlations. burstmasses are ~10% the total spheroid mass; timescales a mass-independent ~10^8yr; peak sfr ~m_burst/t_burst; and they decay in power-law fashion ~t^-2.4.sizes are ~0.1 r_e(spheroid), but grow with time. combined with measurements ofthe nuclear stellar population ages of these systems (i.e. burst times), it ispossible to re-construct the burst contribution to the distribution of sfrs andir luminosity functions at all redshifts. the burst lf agrees well withobserved ir lfs at the brightest luminosities, at z=0-2. at low-l, bursts arealways unimportant; the transition to their importance increases from ulirgluminosities at z~0 to hylirg luminosities at z~2. at all redshifts, bursts area small fraction (~5-10%) of the total sfr density. we discuss possibleimplications of tension between maximum relic stellar mass densities in massivesystems, and estimated number counts of brightest sub-millimeter galaxies.

0911.1131	mergers, agn, and 'normal' galaxies: contributions to the distribution  of star formation rates and infrared luminosity functions	we use a novel method to predict the contribution of normal star-forminggalaxies, merger-induced bursts, and obscured agn, to ir luminosity functions(lfs) and global sfr densities. we use empirical halo occupation constraints topopulate halos with galaxies and determine the distribution of normal andmerging galaxies. each system can then be associated with high-resolutionhydrodynamic simulations. we predict the distribution of observed luminositiesand sfrs, from different galaxy classes, as a function of redshift from z=0-6.we provide fitting functions for the predicted lfs, quantify the uncertainties,and compare with observations. at all redshifts, 'normal' galaxies dominate thelf at moderate luminosities ~l* (the 'knee'). merger-induced burstsincreasingly dominate at l&gt;&gt;l*; at the most extreme luminosities, agn areimportant. however, all populations increase in luminosity at higher redshifts,owing to increasing gas fractions. thus the 'transition' between normal andmerger-dominated sources increases from the lirg-ulirg threshold at z~0 tobright hyper-lirg thresholds at z~2. the transition to dominance by obscuredagn evolves similarly, at factor of several higher l_ir. at all redshifts,non-merging systems dominate the total luminosity/sfr density, withmerger-induced bursts constituting ~5-10% and agn ~1-5%. bursts contributelittle to scatter in the sfr-stellar mass relation. in fact, many systemsidentified as 'ongoing' mergers will be forming stars in their 'normal'(non-burst) mode. counting this as 'merger-induced' star formation leads to astronger apparent redshift evolution in the contribution of mergers to the sfrdensity.

0912.3257	how do massive black holes get their gas?	we use multi-scale sph simulations to follow the inflow of gas from galacticscales to &lt;0.1pc, where the gas begins to resemble a traditional keplerianaccretion disk. the key ingredients are gas, stars, black holes (bhs),self-gravity, star formation, and stellar feedback. we use ~100 simulations tosurvey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for theism physics. we generate initial conditions for our simulations of galacticnuclei (&lt;~300pc) using galaxy scale simulations, including both major mergersand isolated bar-(un)stable disk galaxies. for sufficiently gas-rich,disk-dominated systems, a series of gravitational instabilities generates largeaccretion rates of up to 1-10 m_sun/yr onto the bh (at &lt;&lt;0.1pc); sufficient tofuel the most luminous quasars. the bh accretion rate is highly time variable,given fixed conditions at ~kpc. at &gt;~10pc, our simulations resemble the 'barswithin bars' model, but the gas exhibits diverse morphologies, includingspirals, rings, clumps, and bars; their duty cycle is modest, complicatingattempts to correlate bh accretion with nuclear morphology. at ~1-10pc, thegravitational potential becomes dominated by the bh and bar-like modes are nolonger present. however, the gas becomes unstable to a standing, eccentric diskor a single-armed spiral mode (m=1), driving the gas to sub-pc scales. propertreatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravityof both the stars and gas. we predict correlations between bhar and sfr atdifferent galactic nuclei: nuclear sf is more tightly coupled to agn activity,but correlations exist at all scales.

1002.1079	the nuclear stellar disk in andromeda: a fossil from the era of black  hole growth	the physics of angular momentum transport from galactic scales (~10-100 pc)to much smaller radii is one of the oustanding problems in our understanding ofthe formation and evolution of super-massive black holes (bhs). seeminglyunrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk ofunknown origin orbiting the bh in m31, and possibly many other systems. we showthat these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.multi-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to bh scales show that whensufficient gas is driven towards a bh, gravitational instabilities form alopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. thelopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, drivinginflows that fuel the growth of the bh and produce quasar-level luminosities.the same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines andthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galacticnuclei and the cosmic x-ray background. the stellar relic of this disk is longlived and retains the eccentric pattern. simulations that yield quasar-levelaccretion rates produce relic stellar disks with kinematics, eccentricpatterns, precession rates, and surface density profiles in reasonableagreement with observations of m31. the observed properties of nuclear stellardisks can thus be used to constrain the formation history of super-massive bhs.

1003.4733	a physical model for the origin of the diffuse cosmic infrared  background	we present a physical model for origin of the cosmic diffuse infraredbackground (cdirb). by utilizing the observed stellar mass function and itsevolution as input to a semi-empirical model of galaxy formation, we isolatethe physics driving diffuse ir emission. the model includes contributions fromthree primary sources of ir emission: steady-state star formation owing toisolated disk galaxies, interaction-driven bursts of star formation owing toclose encounters and mergers, and obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). wefind that most of the cdirb is produced by equal contributions from objects atz=0.5-1 and z&gt;1, as suggested by recent observations. of those sources, thevast majority of the emission originates in systems with low to moderate irluminosities (l_{ir}&lt;10^{12} $l_sun); the most luminous objects contributesignificant flux only at high-redshifts (z&gt;2). all star formation in ongoingmergers accounts for &lt;10% of the total at all wavelengths and redshifts, whileemission directly attributable to the interaction-driven burst itself accountsfor &lt;5%. we furthermore find that obscured agn contribute &lt;1-2% of the cdirb atall wavelengths and redshifts, with a strong upper limit of less than 4% of thetotal emission. finally, since electron-positron pair production interactionswith the cdirb represent the primary source of opacity to very high energy(vhe: e_\gamma &gt; 1 tev) \gamma-rays, the model provides predictions for theoptical depth of the universe to the most energetic photons. we find that thesepredictions agree with observations of high-energy cutoffs at tev energies innearby blazars, and suggest that while the universe is extremely opticallythick at &gt;10 tev, the next generation of vhe \gamma-ray telescopes canreasonably expect detections from out to 50-150 mpc.

1006.0488	a non-parametric estimate of mass 'scoured' in galaxy cores	we present a simple estimate of the mass 'deficits' in cored spheroids, as afunction of galaxy mass and radius within the galaxy. previous attempts tomeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profileat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumedfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. wetake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profilesof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series ofphysical radii (m(&lt;r)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the samestellar mass. there is a significant bimodality in this distribution at smallradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core andcusp populations (the deficit delta_m(&lt;r)). we construct the scoured massprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functionalform. the mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (delta_m(&lt;r) r^{1.3-1.8})from a significant but small mass at r&lt;10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2m_bh at ~100pc. at larger radii there is no statistically significantseparation between populations; the upper limit to the cumulative scoured massat ~kpc is ~2-4 m_bh. this does not depend strongly on stellar mass. thedispersion in m(&lt;r) appears larger in the core population, possibly reflectingthe fact that scouring increases the scatter in profile shapes. these resultsare in good agreement with models of scouring from bh binary systems.

1007.2647	an analytic model of angular momentum transport by gravitational  torques: from galaxies to massive black holes	we present analytic calculations of angular momentum transport and gas inflowin galaxies, from scales of ~kpc to deep in the potential of a central blackhole (bh). we compare these analytic calculations to numerical simulations anduse them to develop a sub-grid model of bh growth that can be incorporated intosemi-analytic models or cosmological simulations. both analytic calculationsand simulations argue that the strongest torque on gas arises whennon-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential producesorbit crossings and shocks in the gas. this is true both at large radii ~0.01-1kpc, where bar-like modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and atsmaller radii &lt;10 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric disk dominates. thetraditional orbit crossing criterion is not always adequate to predict thelocations of, and inflow due to, shocks in gas+stellar disks with finite soundspeeds. we derive a modified criterion that predicts the presence of shocks instellar dominated systems even absent formal orbit crossing. we then deriveanalytic expressions for the loss of angular momentum and the resulting gasinflow rates in the presence of such shocks. we test our analytic predictionsusing hydrodynamic simulations at a range of galactic scales, and show thatthey successfully predict the mass inflow rates and quasi-steady gas surfacedensities with small scatter (0.3 dex). we use our analytic results toconstruct a new estimate of the bh accretion rate given galaxy properties atlarger radii. this captures the key scalings in the numerical simulations.alternate estimates such as the local viscous accretion rate or the sphericalbondi rate fail systematically to reproduce the simulations.

1008.4127	on sizes, kinematics, m/l gradients, and light profiles of massive  compact galaxies at z~2	we present a detailed analysis of the structure and resolved stellarpopulations of simulated merger remnants, and compare them to observations ofcompact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2. we find that major merging is a viablemechanism to produce systems of ~ 10^11 msun and ~ 1 kpc size, provided the gasfraction at the time of final coalescence is high (~ 40%), and provided thatthe progenitors are compact star-forming galaxies, as expected at highredshift. their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocitydispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position inthe (v_{maj}/sigma, ellipticity) diagram traces the upper envelope of thedistribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. the simulated mergerremnants show time- and sightline-dependent m/l ratio gradients that resultfrom a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity,and extinction. the median ratio of effective radius in rest-frame v-band lightto that in mass surface density is ~ 2 during the quiescent remnant phase. thisis typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which weexpect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. finally, thesimulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profileshape. the simulated remnants are typically best fit by high (n &gt;&gt; 4) sersicindices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy(median n ~ 2.3). limiting early star formation in the progenitors may berequired to prevent the simulated merger remnants from having extended wings.

1008.4584	do sub-millimeter galaxy number counts provide evidence for a top-heavy  imf?	theoretical models have had difficulty matching the observed number densityof sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs), causing some authors (e.g., baugh et al.2005) to suggest that smgs provide evidence for a top-heavy initial massfunction (imf). to test this claim, we have, for the first time, combinedhigh-resolution 3-d hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging massive,gas-rich galaxies, radiative transfer, and a semi-empirical merger rate modelto predict the number density of smgs. our model can reproduce the observed smgnumber density even when using a standard (kroupa) imf. the agreement is due toa combination of relatively long sub-mm duty cycles for mergers (a few times10^8 years for our most massive models), which owe to our combination ofhigh-resolution 3-d hydrodynamic simulations and dust radiative transfer;sufficient number densities of massive, gas-rich mergers; and the decrease insub-mm counts observed by recent deep/wide surveys (e.g., austermann et al.2010) relative to previous surveys. our results suggest that the observed smgnumber counts do not provide evidence for a top-heavy imf at high redshift.

1009.4702	origins, structure, and inflows of m=1 modes in quasi-keplerian disks	simulations show eccentric disks (m=1 modes) forming around quasi-keplerianpotentials, a topic of interest for fueling quasars, forming super-massive bhs,planet formation and migration, explaining the origin and properties of nucleareccentric stellar disks like that in m31, and driving the formation of theobscuring agn torus. we consider the global, linear normal m=1 modes incollisionless disks, without the restriction that the disk mass be negligiblerelative to the central (keplerian) mass. we derive their structure and keyresonance features, and show how they arise, propagate inwards, and drive bothinflow/outflow and eccentricities in the disk. we compare with hydrodynamicsimulations of such disks around a super-massive bh, with star formation, gascooling, and feedback. we derive the dependence of the normal mode structure ondisk structure, mass profiles, and thickness, and mode pattern speeds andgrowth rates. we show that, if the disk at some radii has mass of &gt;~10% thecentral point mass, the modes are linearly unstable and are self-generating.they arise as 'fast modes' with pattern speed of order the local angularvelocity at these radii. the characteristic global normal modes have patternspeeds comparable to the linear growth rate, of order (g*m_0*r_0^{-3})^{1/2},where m_0 is the central mass and r_{0} is the radius where the enclosed diskmass ~m_{0}. they propagate inwards by exciting eccentricities towards smallerand smaller radii, until at small radii these are 'slow modes.' with moderateamplitude, the global normal modes can lead to shocks and significant gasinflows at near-eddington rates at all radii inside several ~r_0.

1011.3045	an explanation for the slopes of stellar cusps in galaxy spheroids	the stellar surface mass density profiles at the centers of typical ~l* andlower-mass spheroids exhibit power law 'cusps' with $\sigma \propto r^(-n)$,where 0.5&lt;n&lt;1 for radii ~1-100 pc. observations and theory support models inwhich these cusps are formed by dissipative gas inflows and nuclear starburstsin gas-rich mergers. at these comparatively large radii, stellar relaxation isunlikely to account for or strongly modify the cuspy stellar profiles. we arguethat the power-law surface density profiles observed are a natural consequenceof the gravitational instabilities that dominate angular momentum transport inthe gravitational potential of a central massive black hole. the dominant modeat these radii is an m=1 lopsided/eccentric disk instability, in which starstorquing the gas can drive rapid inflow and accretion. such a mode firstgenerically appears at large radii and propagates inwards by excitingeccentricities at smaller and smaller radii, where m*(&lt;r)&lt;&lt;m_bh. when thestellar surface density profile is comparatively shallow with n&lt;1/2, the modescannot efficiently propagate to r=0 and so gas piles up and star formationsteepens the profile. but if the profile is steeper than n=1, the inwardspropagation of eccentricity is strongly damped, suppressing inflow and bringingn down again. together these results produce an equilibrium slope of 1/2 &lt; n &lt;1 in the potential of the central black hole. these physical arguments aresupported by nonlinear numerical simulations of gas inflow in galactic nuclei.together, these results naturally explain the observed stellar density profilesof 'cusp' elliptical galaxies.

1101.1299	relation between globular clusters and supermassive black holes in  ellipticals as a manifestation of the black hole fundamental plane	we analyze the relation between the mass of the central supermassive blackhole (mbh) and the number of globular clusters (ngc) in elliptical galaxies andbulges as a ramification of the black hole fundamental plane, the theoreticallypredicted and observed multi-variable correlation between mbh and bulge bindingenergy. although the tightness of the mbh-ngc correlation suggests an unlikelycausal link between supermassive black holes and globular clusters, such acorrespondence can exhibit small scatter even if the physical relationship isindirect. we show that the relatively small scatter of the mbh-ngc relationowes to the mutual residual correlation of mbh and ngc with stellar mass whenthe velocity dispersion is held fixed. thus, present observations lend evidencefor feedback-regulated models in which the bulge binding energy is mostimportant; they do not necessarily imply any `special' connection betweenglobular clusters and mbh. this raises the question of why ngc traces theformation of ellipticals and bulges sufficiently well to be correlated withbinding energy.

1101.4230	dynamical delays between starburst and agn activity in galaxy nuclei	observations of agn have suggested a possible delay between the peak of starformation (on some scale) and agn activity. inefficient fueling (and/orfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but weargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. weshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamicalreasons. if some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales willquickly become gas-dominated. as the gas density peaks, so does the sfr.however, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relativelyinefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, thestars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.moreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong diskinstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel thebh; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. bh growth cantherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it hassignificantly depleted to the point where the bh is finally 'starved.' both ofthese effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak ofbh growth can lag the peak in the sfr measured at a given scale by a timescalecorresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 localdynamical times). this predicts that the inferred delay will vary in a specificmanner with the radius over which the star formation rate is measured. wediscuss possible implications for the role of agn feedback in suppressing starformation activity.

1101.4940	self-regulated star formation in galaxies via momentum input from  massive stars	feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in shapingthe galaxy mass function, the structure of the interstellar medium (ism), andthe low efficiency of star formation, but the exact form of the feedback isuncertain. in this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novelnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum impartedto the ism by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. we employ a realisticcooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to &lt;100k, sothat the ism becomes highly inhomogeneous. despite this, our simulated galaxiesreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses toform giant molecular clouds (gmcs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,stellar feedback disperses the gmcs, repopulating the diffuse ism. thiscollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of smc-like dwarfs, themilky-way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. the simulated global star formationefficiencies are consistent with the observed kennicutt-schmidt relation.moreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numericallyimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and densityscaling. this is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, starformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very densegas available for forming stars. in contrast, in simulations without stellarfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-inducedturbulence, the ism experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. inthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceedobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,demonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of starformation in galaxies.

1108.3086	the origins of agn obscuration: the 'torus' as a dynamical, unstable  driver of accretion	multi-scale simulations have made it possible to follow gas inflows ontomassive black holes (bhs) from galactic scales to the accretion disk. whensufficient gas is driven towards the bh, gravitational instabilitiesgenerically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. the lopsidedstellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuelrapid bh growth. here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'invoked to explain obscured agn. the disk is generically thick and hascharacteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of thetorus. the scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii aresubstantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing thevertical support. rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes andwarps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. other properties commonlyattributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:misalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local sfr andturbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on agnluminosity or sfr. we compare the predicted torus properties with observationsof gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and sfr densitiesin agn nuclei, and find that they are consistent. we argue that it is notpossible to reproduce these observations and the observed column density (n_h)distribution without a clumpy gas distribution, but allowing for clumping onsmall scales the predicted n_h distribution is in good agreement withobservations from 10^20-27 cm^-2. we examine how n_h scales with galaxy and agnproperties, and find that agn feedback may be necessary to explain some trendswith luminosity and/or redshift. the torus is not merely a bystander or passivefuel source for accretion, but is itself the mechanism driving accretion.

1110.4636	the structure of the interstellar medium of star forming galaxies	we present numerical methods for including stellar feedback in galaxy-scalesimulations. we include heating by sne (i &amp; ii), gas recycling andshock-heating from o-star &amp; agb winds, hii photoionization, and radiationpressure from stellar photons. the energetics and time-dependence are takendirectly from stellar evolution models. we implement these in simulations withpc-scale resolution, modeling galaxies from smc-like dwarfs and mw analogues tomassive z~2 starburst disks. absent feedback, gas cools and collapses withoutlimit. with feedback, the ism reaches a multi-phase steady state in which gmcscontinuously form, disperse, and re-form. our primary results include: (1) starforming galaxies generically self-regulate at toomre q~1. most of the volume isin diffuse hot gas with most of the mass in dense gmc complexes. the phasestructure and gas mass at high densities are much more sensitive probes ofstellar feedback physics than integrated quantities (toomre q or gas velocitydispersion). (2) different feedback mechanisms act on different scales:radiation &amp; hii pressure are critical to prevent runaway collapse of dense gasin gmcs. sne and stellar winds dominate the dynamics of volume-filling hot gas;however this primarily vents out of the disk. (3) the galaxy-averaged sfr isdetermined by feedback. for given feedback efficiency, restricting starformation to molecular gas or modifying the cooling function has little effect;but changing feedback mechanisms directly translates to shifts off thekennicutt-schmidt relation. (4) self-gravity leads to marginally-bound gmcswith an ~m^-2 mass function with a cutoff at the jeans mass; they live a fewdynamical times before being disrupted by stellar feedback and turn ~1-10% oftheir mass into stars (increasing from dwarfs through starburst galaxies).low-mass gmcs are preferentially unbound.

1110.4638	stellar feedback in galaxies and the origin of galaxy-scale winds	feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in drivinggalactic super-winds that enrich the igm and shape the galaxy mass function andmass-metallicity relation. in previous papers, we introduced new numericalmethods for implementing stellar feedback on sub-gmc through galactic scales ingalaxy simulations. this includes radiation pressure (uv through ir), sne(type-i &amp; ii), stellar winds ('fast' o-star through 'slow' agb winds), and hiiphotoionization. here, we show that these feedback mechanisms drive galacticwinds with outflow rates as high as ~10-20 times the galaxy sfr. themass-loading efficiency (wind mass loss rate divided by sfr) scales inverselywith circular velocity, consistent with momentum-conservation expectations. westudy the contributions of each feedback mechanism to galactic winds in a rangeof galaxy models, from smc-like dwarfs &amp; mw-analogues to z~2 clumpy disks. inmassive, gas-rich systems (local starbursts and high-z galaxies), radiationpressure dominates the wind generation. for mw-like spirals and dwarf galaxiesthe gas densities are much lower, and shock-heated gas from sne and stellarwinds dominates production of large-scale outflows. in all models, however,winds have a multi-phase structure that depends on interactions betweenmultiple feedback mechanisms operating on different spatial &amp; time scales: anysingle mechanism fails to reproduce the winds observed. we provide fittingfunctions for wind mass-loading and velocities as a function of galaxyproperties, for use in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. thesediffer from typically-adopted formulae with explicit dependence on gas surfacedensity that can be very important in both low-density dwarf galaxies andhigh-density gas-rich galaxies.

1111.1236	why are agn and host galaxies misaligned?	it is well-established observationally that the characteristic angularmomentum axis on small scales around agn, traced by radio jets and the putativetorus, is not well-correlated with the large-scale angular momentum axis of thehost galaxy. in this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally inhigh-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport andinflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near agn, triggered either during galaxymergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. sudden misalignments cansometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightlyoff-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smoothand trace only global gravitational instabilities. when several nested,self-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble inthe potential of the outer modes. resonant angular momentum exchange can flipor re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without thepresence of massive clumps. we therefore do not expect that agn and their hostgalaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment bean indicator of the agn fueling mechanism. we discuss implications of thisconclusion for agn feedback and bh spin evolution. the misalignments may meanthat even bhs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up tomaximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies andinefficient jet formation. even more random orientations are possible if thereis further, un-resolved clumpiness in the gas, and more ordered accretion mayoccur if the inflow is slower and not self-gravitating.

1111.2863	an excursion-set model for the structure of gmcs and the ism	the ism is governed by supersonic turbulence on a range of scales. we usethis to develop a rigorous excursion-set model for the formation and timeevolution of dense gas structures (gmcs, massive clumps, and cores). supersonicturbulence drives the density distribution to a lognormal with dispersionincreasing with mach number; we generalize this to include scales &gt;h (the diskscale height), and use it to construct the statistical properties of thedensity field smoothed on a scale r. we then compare conditions forself-gravitating collapse including thermal, turbulent, and rotational support.we show this becomes a well-defined barrier crossing problem. as such, an exact'bound object mass function' can be derived, from scales of the sonic length toabove the disk jeans mass. this agrees remarkably well with observed gmc massfunctions in the mw and other galaxies; the only inputs are the mass and sizeof the galaxies (to normalize the model). this explains the mass functioncutoff and its power-law slope (close to, but shallower than, -2). the modelalso predicts the linewidth-size and size-mass relations of clouds and thedependence of their residuals on surface density/pressure. we use this topredict the spatial correlation function/clustering of clouds and starclusters; these also agree well with observations. we predict the size/massfunction of ism 'bubbles' or 'holes', and show this can account for observed hihole distributions without any local feedback. we generalize the model toconstruct time-dependent 'merger/fragmentation trees' which can be used tofollow cloud evolution and construct semi-analytic models for the ism. weprovide explicit recipes to construct the trees. we use a simple example toshow that, if clouds are not destroyed in ~1-5 crossing times, then all ismmass would be trapped in collapsing objects even if the large-scale turbulencewere maintained.

1111.6591	stellar feedback &amp; bulge formation in clumpy disks	we use numerical simulations of isolated galaxies to study the effects ofstellar feedback on the formation and evolution of giant star-forming gas'clumps' in high-redshift, gas-rich galaxies. such galactic disks are unstableto the formation of bound gas-rich clumps whose properties initially dependonly on global disk properties, not the microphysics of feedback. insimulations without stellar feedback, clumps turn an order-unity fraction oftheir mass into stars and sink to the center, forming a large bulge and kickingmost of the stars out into a much more extended stellar envelope. by contrast,strong radiative stellar feedback disrupts even the most massive clumps afterthey turn ~10-20% of their mass into stars, in a timescale of ~10-100 myr,ejecting some material into a super-wind and recycling the rest of the gas intothe diffuse ism. this suppresses the bulge formation rate by direct 'clumpcoalescence' by a factor of several. however, the galactic disks do undergosignificant internal evolution in the absence of mergers: clumps form anddisrupt continuously and torque gas to the galactic center. the resultingevolution is qualitatively similar to bar/spiral evolution in simulations witha more homogeneous ism.

1202.2122	why do stars form in clusters? an analytic model for stellar correlation  functions	recently, we have shown that if the ism is governed by super-sonic turbulentflows, the excursion-set formalism can be used to calculate the statistics ofself-gravitating objects over a wide range of scales. on the largestself-gravitating scales ('first crossing'), these correspond to gmcs, and onthe smallest non-fragmenting self-gravitating scales ('last crossing'), toprotostellar cores. here, we extend this formalism to rigorously calculate theauto and cross-correlation functions of cores (and by extension, young stars)as a function of spatial separation and mass, in analogy to the cosmologicalcalculation of halo clustering. we show that this generically predicts thatstar formation is very strongly clustered on small scales: stars form inclusters, themselves inside gmcs. outside the binary-star regime, the projectedcorrelation function declines as a weak power-law, until a characteristic scalewhich corresponds to the characteristic mass scale of gmcs. on much largerscales the clustering declines such that star formation is not strongly biasedon galactic scales, relative to the actual dense gas distribution. the precisecorrelation function shape depends on properties of the turbulent spectrum, butits qualitative behavior is quite general. the predictions agree well withobservations of young star and core autocorrelation functions over ~4 dex inradius. clustered star formation is a generic consequence of supersonicturbulence if most of the power in the velocity field, hence the contributionto density fluctuations, comes from large scales. the distribution ofself-gravitating masses near the sonic length is then imprinted by fluctuationson larger scales. we similarly show that the fraction of stars formed in'isolated' modes should be small (\lesssim10%).

1204.0063	3-d radiative transfer calculations of radiation feedback from massive  black holes: outflow of mass from the dusty "torus"	observational and theoretical arguments suggest that the momentum carried inmass outflows from agn can reach several times l / c, corresponding to outflowrates of hundreds of solar masses per year. radiation pressure on lines alonemay not be sufficient to provide this momentum deposition, and the transfer ofreprocessed ir radiation in dusty nuclear gas has been postulated to providethe extra enhancement. the efficacy of this mechanism, however, will besensitive to multi-dimensional effects such as the tendency for the reprocessedradiation to preferentially escape along sight-lines of lower column density.we use monte carlo radiative transfer calculations to determine the radiationforce on dusty gas residing within approximately 10 parsecs from an accretingsuper-massive black hole. we calculate the net rate of momentum deposition inthe surrounding gas and estimate the mass-loss rate in the resulting outflow asa function of solid angle for different black hole luminosities,sightline-averaged column densities, clumping parameters, and opening angles ofthe dusty gas. we find that these dust-driven winds carry momentum fluxes of1-5 times l / c and correspond to mass-loss rates of 10-100 solar masses peryear for a 10^8 solar mass black hole radiating at or near its eddington limit.these results help to explain the origin of high velocity molecular and atomicoutflows in local ulirgs, and can inform numerical simulations of galaxyevolution including agn feedback.

1204.2835	variations in the stellar imf: from bottom to top	we use a recently-developed analytic model for the ism structure from scalesof gmcs through star-forming cores to explore how the pre-stellar core massfunction (cmf) and, by extrapolation, stellar initial mass function (imf)should depend on both local and galactic properties. if the ism issupersonically turbulent, the statistical properties of the density fieldfollow from the turbulent velocity spectrum, and the excursion set formalismcan be applied to analytically calculate the mass function of collapsing coreson the smallest scales on which they are self-gravitating (non-fragmenting).two parameters determine the model: the disk-scale mach number m_h (which setsthe shape of the cmf), and the absolute velocity (to assign an absolute scale).for 'normal' variation in disk properties and core gas temperatures in the mwand local galaxies, there is almost no variation in the predicted high-massbehavior of the cmf/imf. the slope is always close to salpeter down to &lt;1m_sun. we predict modest variation in the sub-solar regime, mostly fromvariation in m_h, but within the observed scatter in sub-solar imfs in localregions. for fixed galaxy properties, there is little variation in shape or'upper mass limit' with parent gmc mass. however, in extreme starbursts (e.g.ulirgs) we predict a bottom-heavy cmf. this agrees with the imf inferred forthe centers of virgo ellipticals, believed to form in such a nuclear starburst.the cmf is bottom heavy despite the gas temperature being an order of magnitudelarger, because m_h is also much larger. larger m_h values make the 'parent'cloud mass (turbulent jeans mass) larger, but promote fragmentation to smallerscales; this steepens the slope of the low-mass cmf and shifts the turnovermass. the model may predict a top-heavy cmf for the sub-pc disks around sgr a*,but the relevant input parameters are uncertain.

1206.0011	star formation in galaxy mergers with realistic models of stellar  feedback &amp; the interstellar medium	we use simulations with realistic models for stellar feedback to study galaxymergers. these high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation anddestruction of individual gmcs and star clusters. the final starburst isdominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due toglobal torques. the resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.the gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 m_sun) gmcs andsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 m_sun). however, in contrastto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form thecentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center ofthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses gmcs after they turn severalpercent of their mass into stars. most of the mass that reaches the nucleusdoes so in the form of gas. the kennicutt-schmidt law emerges naturally as aconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of thesmall-scale star formation microphysics. the same mechanisms that drive thisrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from irphotons, extend over seven decades in sfr to regulate star formation in themost extreme starbursts (densities &gt;10^4 m_sun/pc^2). feedback also drivessuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the windmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higherpost-starburst sfrs in the presence of stellar feedback. strong agn feedback isrequired to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. we compare thepredicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disksurvival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve gmcs or feedback.global galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and starformation rates can differ significantly.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1206.5006	a general class of lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods  and implications for fluid mixing problems	various formulations of smooth-particle hydrodynamics (sph) have beenproposed, intended to resolve certain difficulties in the treatment of fluidmixing instabilities. most have involved changes to the algorithm which eitherintroduce artificial correction terms or violate arguably the greatestadvantage of sph over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy,momentum, and angular momentum. here, we show how a class of alternative sphequations of motion (eom) can be derived self-consistently from a discreteparticle lagrangian (guaranteeing manifest conservation) in a manner whichtremendously improves treatment of instabilities and contact discontinuities.saitoh &amp; makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize theeom does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the 'standard'approach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, canbe incorporated into the rigorous lagrangian formulation that retains idealconservation properties and includes the 'grad-h' terms that account forvariable smoothing lengths. we derive a general eom for any choice of volumeelement (particle 'weights') and method of determining smoothing lengths. wethen specify this to a 'pressure-entropy formulation' which resolves problemsin the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. implementing this in a newversion of the gadget code, we show it leads to good performance in mixingexperiments (e.g. kelvin-helmholtz &amp; blob tests). and conservation ismaintained even in strong shock/blastwave tests, where formulations withoutmanifest conservation produce large errors. this also improves the treatment ofsub-sonic turbulence, and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers.the code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense. thisprovides a general framework for self-consistent derivation of different'flavors' of sph.

1209.0459	dense molecular gas: a sensitive probe of stellar feedback models	we show that the mass fraction of gmc gas (n&gt;100 cm^-3) in dense (n&gt;&gt;10^4cm^-3) star-forming clumps, observable in dense molecular tracers(l_hcn/l_co(1-0)), is a sensitive probe of the strength and mechanism(s) ofstellar feedback. using high-resolution galaxy-scale simulations with pc-scaleresolution and explicit models for feedback from radiation pressure,photoionization heating, stellar winds, and supernovae (sne), we makepredictions for the dense molecular gas tracers as a function of gmc and galaxyproperties and the efficiency of stellar feedback. in models with weak/nofeedback, much of the mass in gmcs collapses into dense sub-units, predictingl_hcn/l_co(1-0) ratios order-of-magnitude larger than observed. by contrast,models with feedback properties taken directly from stellar evolutioncalculations predict dense gas tracers in good agreement with observations.changing the strength or timing of sne tends to move systems along, rather thanoff, the l_hcn-l_co relation (because sne heat lower-density material, not thehigh-density gas). changing the strength of radiation pressure (which actsefficiently in the highest density gas), however, has a much stronger effect onl_hcn than on l_co. we predict that the fraction of dense gas (l_hcn/l_co(1-0))increases with increasing gmc surface density; this drives a trend inl_hcn/l_co(1-0) with sfr and luminosity which has tentatively been observed.our results make specific predictions for enhancements in the dense gas tracersin unusually dense environments such as ulirgs and galactic nuclei (includingthe galactic center).

1209.2413	submillimetre galaxies in a hierarchical universe: number counts,  redshift distribution, and implications for the imf	high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs) are some of the most rapidlystar-forming galaxies in the universe. historically, galaxy formation modelshave had difficulty explaining the observed number counts of smgs. we combine asemi-empirical model with 3-d hydrodynamical simulations and 3-d dust radiativetransfer to predict the number counts of unlensed smgs. because the stellarmass functions, gas and dust masses, and sizes of our galaxies are constrainedto match observations, we can isolate uncertainties related to the dynamicalevolution of galaxy mergers and the dust radiative transfer. the number countsand redshift distributions predicted by our model agree well with observations.isolated disc galaxies dominate the faint (s_1.1 &lt; ~1 mjy, or s_850 &lt; ~2 mjy)population. the brighter sources are a mix of merger-induced starbursts andgalaxy-pair smgs; the latter subpopulation accounts for ~30 - 50 per cent ofall smgs at all s_1.1 &gt; ~0.5 mjy (s_850 &gt; ~1 mjy). the mean redshifts are ~3.0- 3.5, depending on the flux cut, and the brightest sources tend to be athigher redshifts. because the galaxy-pair smgs will be resolved into multiplefainter sources by alma, the bright alma counts should be as much as 2 timesless than those observed using single-dish telescopes. the agreement betweenour model, which uses a kroupa imf, and observations suggests that the imf inhigh-redshifts starbursts need not be top-heavy; if the imf were top-heavy, ourmodel would over-predict the number counts. we conclude that the difficultysome models have reproducing the observed smg counts is likely indicative ofmore general problems -- such as an under-prediction of the abundance ofmassive galaxies or a star formation rate--stellar mass relation normalisationlower than that observed -- rather than a problem specific to the smgpopulation.

1210.0903	a general theory of turbulent fragmentation	we develop an analytic framework to understand fragmentation in turbulent,self-gravitating media. previously, we showed some properties of turbulence canbe predicted with the excursion-set formalism. here, we generalize to fullytime-dependent gravo-turbulent fragmentation &amp; collapse. we show that turbulentsystems are always gravitationally unstable (in a probabilistic sense). thefragmentation mass spectra, size/mass relations, correlation functions, rangeof scales over which fragmentation occurs, &amp; time-dependent rates offragmentation are predictable. we show how this depends on bulk turbulentproperties (mach numbers &amp; power spectra). we also generalize to includerotation, complicated equations of state, collapsing/expanding backgrounds,magnetic fields, intermittency, &amp; non-normal statistics. we derive howfragmentation is suppressed with 'stiffer' equations of state or differentdriving mechanisms. suppression appears at an 'effective sonic scale' wheremach(r,rho)~1. gas becomes stable below this scale for polytropic gamma&gt;4/3,but fragmentation still occurs on larger scales. the scale-free nature ofturbulence and gravity generically drives mass spectra and correlationfunctions towards universal shapes, with weak dependence on many properties ofthe media. correlated fluctuation structures, non-gaussian densitydistributions, &amp; intermittency have surprisingly small effects on thefragmentation process. this is because fragmentation cascades on small scalesare 'frozen in' when large-scale modes push the 'parent' region above thecollapse threshold; though they collapse, their statistics are only weaklymodified by the collapse process. with thermal support, structure develops'top-down' in time via fragmentation cascades; but strong rotational supportreverses this to 'bottom-up' growth via mergers &amp; introduces a maximalinstability scale distinct from the toomre scale.

1210.6347	modeling mid-infrared diagnostics of obscured quasars and starbursts	we analyze the link between active galactic nuclei (agn) and mid-infraredflux using dust radiative transfer calculations of starbursts realized inhydrodynamical simulations. focusing on the effects of galaxy dust, we evaluatediagnostics commonly used to disentangle agn and star formation inultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). we examine these quantities as afunction of time, viewing angle, dust model, agn spectrum, and agn strength inmerger simulations representing two possible extremes of the ulirg population:one is a typical gas-rich merger at z ~ 0, and the other is characteristic ofextremely obscured starbursts at z ~ 2 to 4. this highly obscured burst beginsstar-formation-dominated with significant pah emission, and ends with a ~10^9yr period of red near-ir colors. at coalescence, when the agn is most luminous,dust obscures the near-infrared agn signature, reduces the relative emissionfrom polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), and enhances the 9.7 micronabsorption by silicate grains. although generally consistent with previousinterpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguouslyestimate the agn luminosity fraction in all cases. motivated by thesimulations, we show that a combination of the extinction feature at 9.7micron, the pah strength, and a near-infrared slope can simultaneouslyconstrain the agn fraction and dust grain distribution for a wide range ofobscuration. we find that this indicator, accessible to the james webb spacetelescope, may estimate the agn power as tightly as the hard x-ray flux alone,thereby providing a valuable future cross-check and constraint for largesamples of distant ulirgs.

1211.3119	a model for (non-lognormal) density distributions in isothermal  turbulence	we propose a new, physically motivated fitting function for density pdfs inturbulent gas. although it is known that when gas is isothermal, the pdf isapproximately lognormal in the core, high-resolution simulations show largedeviations from exact log-normality. the proposed function provides anextraordinarily accurate description of the density pdfs in simulations withmach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. compared to alognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders ofmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). thisis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excludingmagnetic fields. deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter tthat increases with the compressive mach number. the proposed distribution canbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)velocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,and we provide a simple interpretation of the density pdf as the product of acontinuous-time relaxation process. as such the parameter t is consistent withthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structurefunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming moreintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. it provides a newand unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not justvelocity) structure of turbulence. we show that this naturally explains someapparent contradictory results in the literature based on use of differentmoments of the density pdf, as well as differences based on whethervolume-weighted or mass-weighted quantities are measured. we show how these arefundamentally related to the fact that mass conservation requires violations oflog-normal statistics.

1301.0841	resolving the generation of starburst winds in galaxy mergers	we study galaxy super-winds driven in major mergers, using pc-resolutionsimulations with detailed models for stellar feedback that canself-consistently follow the formation/destruction of gmcs and generation ofwinds. the models include molecular cooling, star formation at high densitiesin gmcs, and gas recycling and feedback from sne (i&amp;ii), stellar winds, andradiation pressure. we study mergers of systems from smc-like dwarfs and milkyway analogues to z~2 starburst disks. multi-phase super-winds are generated inall passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 m_sun/yr. however, the windmass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by sfr) is similar to that inisolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxyproperties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of themerger. winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build upcomplex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at arange of radii. the winds have complex velocity and phase structure, withmaterial at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,ionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedbackmechanisms. these simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,where simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-inducedstarbursts. but despite large mass-loading factors (&gt;~10) in the winds, thepeak sfrs are comparable to those in 'no wind' simulations. wind accelerationdoes not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum andform stars, while blowing out gas that would not have participated in thestarburst in the first place. considerable wind material is not unbound, andfalls back on the disk at later times post-merger, leading to higherpost-starburst sfrs in the presence of stellar feedback. this may require agnfeedback to explain galaxy quenching.

1301.2600	turbulent disks are never stable: fragmentation and turbulence-promoted  planet formation	a fundamental assumption in our understanding of disks is that when thetoomre q&gt;&gt;1, the disk is stable against fragmentation into self-gravitatingobjects (and so cannot form planets via direct collapse). but if disks areturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that canproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. here, we use arecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of thesefluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragmentsformed in a turbulent keplerian disk. turbulent disks are never completelystable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of formingself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations insuch disks. modest sub-sonic turbulence above mach number ~0.1 can produce afew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~myr timescales,even if q&gt;&gt;1 and cooling is slow (t_cool&gt;&gt;t_orbit). in trans-sonic turbulencethis extends to q~100. we derive the true q-criterion needed to suppress suchevents, which scales exponentially with mach number. we specify to turbulencedriven by mri, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria interms of q and the cooling time. cooling times &gt;~50*t_dyn may be required tocompletely suppress fragmentation. these gravoturbulent events produce massspectra peaked near ~m_disk*(q*m_disk/m_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,increasing with distance from the star). we apply this to protoplanetary diskmodels and show that even minimum mass solar nebulae could experiencestochastic collapse events, provided a source of turbulence.

1301.4500	accretion does not drive the turbulence in galactic disks	rapid accretion of cold gas plays a crucial role in getting gas intogalaxies. it has been suggested that this accretion proceeds along narrowstreams that might also directly drive the turbulence in galactic gas,dynamical disturbances, and bulge formation. in cosmological simulations,however, it is impossible to isolate and hence disentangle the effect ofaccretion from internal instabilities and mergers. moreover, in mostcosmological simulations, the phase structure and turbulence in the ism arisingfrom stellar feedback are treated in a sub-grid manner, so that feedback cannotgenerate ism turbulence. in this paper we therefore test the effects of coldstreams in extremely high-resolution simulations of otherwise isolated galaxydisks using detailed models for star formation and feedback; we then include orexclude mock cold flows falling onto the galaxies with accretion rates,velocities and geometry set to maximize their effect on the disk. we find: (1)turbulent velocity dispersions in gas disks are identical with or without thecold flow; the energy injected by the flow is dissipated where it meets thedisk. (2) in runs without stellar feedback, the presence of a cold flow hasessentially no effect on runaway local collapse, resulting in star formationrates (sfrs) that are far too large. (3) disks in runs with feedback and coldflows have higher sfrs, but only insofar as they have more gas. (4) becauseflows are extended relative to the disk, they do not trigger strong resonantresponses and so induce weak morphological perturbation (bulge formation viainstabilities is not accelerated). (5) however, flows can thicken the disk bydirect contribution of out-of-plane streams. we conclude that while inflows arecritical over cosmological timescales to determine the supply and angularmomentum of gas disks, they have weak instantaneous dynamical effects ongalaxies.

1303.0285	the meaning and consequences of star formation criteria in galaxy models  with resolved stellar feedback	we consider the effects of different star formation criteria on galacticscales, in high-resolution simulations with explicitly resolved gmcs andstellar feedback. we compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the localvirial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to highdensity in a free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) amolecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a jeans-instabilityrequirement, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter than dynamical times,and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. we consider these both mw-like andhigh-density (starburst) galaxies. with feedback present, all models produceidentical integrated star formation rates (sfrs), in agreement with thekennicutt relation. without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude excessivesfrs. this is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the sf law.however, the spatial and density distribution of sf depend strongly on the sfcriteria. because cooling rates are generally fast and gas is turbulent,criteria (4)-(7) are 'weak' and spread sf uniformly over the disk (abovedensities n~0.01-0.1 cm^-3). a molecular criterion (3) localizes to higherdensities, but still a wide range; for z z_solar, it is similar to a densitythreshold at n~1 cm^-3 (well below mean densities in the mw center orstarbursts). fixed density thresholds (2) can always select the highestdensities, but must be adjusted for simulation resolution and galaxyproperties; the same threshold that works in a mw-like simulation will selectnearly all gas in a starburst. binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively selectthe largest over-densities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, andautomatically predict clustered sf. we argue that this sf model is mostphysically-motivated and presents significant numerical advantages inlarge-dynamic range simulations.

1307.7147	a simple phenomenological model for grain clustering in turbulence	we propose a simple model for density fluctuations of aerodynamic grains,embedded in a turbulent, gravitating gas disk. the model combines a calculationfor the behavior of a group of grains encountering a single turbulent eddy,with a hierarchical approximation of the eddy statistics. this makes analyticpredictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of graindensities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximumgrain densities reached. we predict how these scale as a function of grain dragtime t_stop, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio, strength of turbulence(alpha), and detailed disk properties. we test these against numericalsimulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. the simulations agreewell with the predictions, spanning t_stop*omega ~ 1e-4 - 10, alpha ~ 1e-10 -1e-2, and grain-to-gas mass ratio ~0-3. results from 'turbulent concentration'simulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case.vortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grainshierarchically. for small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnovertime comparable to the stopping time, but fluctuations are also damped by localgas-grain drift. for large grains, shear and gravity lead to a much broaderrange of eddy scales driving fluctuations, with most power on the largestscales. the grain density distribution has a log-poisson shape, withfluctuations for large grains up to factors &gt;1000. we provide simple analyticexpressions for the predictions, and discuss implications for planetesimalformation, grain growth, and the structure of turbulence.

1309.6321	do we expect most agn to live in disks?	recent observations have indicated that a large fraction of the low tointermediate luminosity agn population lives in disk-dominated hosts, while themore luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts, in conflict with someprevious model predictions. we therefore build and compare a semi-empiricalmodel for agn fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger'triggering.' in particular, we show that the 'stochastic accretion' model - inwhich fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising wheneverdense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the presentobservations at low/intermediate luminosities. however it falls short of thehigh-luminosity population. we combine this with models for majormerger-induced agn fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, andpredict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated agn hostgalaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. we compile and compareobservational constraints from z~0-2. the models and observations genericallyshow a transition from disk to bulge dominance in hosts near the seyfert-quasartransition, at all redshifts. 'stochastic' fueling dominates agn by number(dominant at low luminosity), and dominates bh growth below the knee in thepresent-day bh mass function (&lt;10^7 m_sun). however it accounts for just ~10%of bh mass growth at masses &gt;10^8 m_sun. in total, fueling in disky hostsaccounts for ~30% of the total agn luminosity density/bh mass density. thecombined model also accurately predicts the agn luminosity function andclustering/bias as a function of luminosity and redshift; however, we arguethat these are not sensitive probes of bh fueling mechanisms.

1311.2073	galaxies on fire (feedback in realistic environments): stellar feedback  explains cosmologically inefficient star formation	we present a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxyformation to z=0, spanning halo masses ~10^8-10^13 m_sun, and stellar masses~10^4-10^11. our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both themulti-phase ism (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. the stellarfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directlyfrom stellar population models. these sources of stellar feedback, with zeroadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halomass up to m_halo~10^12 m_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, mw-mass disks, andsmall groups). by extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with thestellar mass function for m_star&lt;10^11 m_sun. we predict weak redshiftevolution in the m_star-m_halo relation, consistent with current constraints toz&gt;6. we find that the m_star-m_halo relation is insensitive to numericaldetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. simulations with onlysupernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularlyin dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating andradiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt gmcs and enable efficient couplingof later supernovae to the gas. star formation rates agree well with theobserved kennicutt relation at all redshifts. the galaxy-averaged kennicuttrelation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gasinto stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation viastellar feedback. feedback reduces star formation rates considerably andproduces a reservoir of gas that leads to rising late-time star formationhistories significantly different from the halo accretion history. feedbackalso produces large short-timescale variability in galactic sfrs, especially indwarfs. many of these properties are not captured by common 'sub-grid' galacticwind models.

0802.0508	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: i. gas-rich merger  remnants	we study the origin and properties of 'extra' or 'excess' central light inthe surface brightness profiles of gas-rich merger remnants. combining a largeset of hydrodynamical simulations with data on observed mergers (spanning abroad range of profiles at various masses and degrees of relaxation), we showhow to robustly separate the physically meaningful extra light -- stellarpopulations formed in a compact central starburst during a gas-rich merger --from the outer profile established by violent relaxation acting on starsalready present in the progenitors prior to the final merger. this separationis sensitive to the profile treatment, and we demonstrate that certain fittingprocedures can yield physically misleading results. we show that our methodreliably recovers the younger starburst population, and examine how theproperties of this component scale with mass, gas content, and other aspects ofthe progenitors. we consider the time evolution of profiles in different bands,and estimate biases introduced by observational studies at different times andwavelengths. we show that extra light is ubiquitous in observed and simulatedgas-rich merger remnants, with sufficient mass (~3-30% of the stellar mass) toexplain the discrepancy in the maximum phase-space densities of ellipticals andtheir progenitor spirals. the nature of this central component providespowerful new constraints on the formation histories of observed systems.

1401.2458	jumping the gap: the formation conditions and mass function of  pebble-pile planetesimals	in a turbulent proto-planetary disk, dust grains undergo large densityfluctuations and under the right circumstances, these grain overdensities canovercome shear, turbulent, and gas pressure support to collapse underself-gravity (forming a "pebble pile" planetesimal). using a simple analyticmodel for the fluctuations predicted in simulations, we estimate therate-of-formation and mass function of self-gravitating, rapidly-collapsingplanetesimal-mass bodies formed by this mechanism. the statistics of thisprocess depend sensitively on the size/stopping time of the grains, disksurface density, and turbulent mach numbers. however, when it occurs, wepredict that the resulting planetesimal mass function is broad andquasi-universal, with a slope dn/dm~1/m^(1-2), spanning a size/mass range~10-1e4 km (~1e-9-5.0 m_earth). collapse to planetesimal through super-earthmasses is possible. the key condition is that grain density fluctuations reachlarge amplitudes on large scales, where gravitational instability proceeds mosteasily (collapse of small grains is strongly suppressed by turbulentvorticity). we show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formationin terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop &gt; f(q,z,alpha)).in a mmsn, this requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au.at small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders. however,because density fluctuations depend super-exponentially on tau_stop (inverselyproportional to disk surface density), lower-density disks are more unstable.in fact, we predict that cm-sized grains at ~1au will form pebble piles in adisk with ~10% the mmsn density, so planet formation at ~au may genericallyoccur late, as disks are evaporating. we also predict that conditions becomeprogressively more favorable for pebble-pile formation around lower-mass,cooler stars.

1406.5509	some stars are totally metal: a new mechanism driving dust across  star-forming clouds, and consequences for planets, stars, and galaxies	dust grains in neutral gas behave as aerodynamic particles, so they candevelop large density fluctuations independent of gas density fluctuations.specifically, gas turbulence can drive order-of-magnitude 'resonant'fluctuations in the dust on scales where the gas stopping/drag timescale iscomparable to the turbulent eddy turnover time. here we show that for largegrains (size &gt;0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently largemolecular clouds (radii &gt;1-10 pc, masses &gt;10^4 m_sun), this scale becomeslarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),so large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. as aresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds shouldexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found inlarge grains. this naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,certain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,and may explain the 'uv upturn' in early-type galaxies. it will alsodramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, bypreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous orsilicate grains. the relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply withcloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions forclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. because of the selectivesorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.we also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when thesefluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded withabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'(z~1)! assuming the cores collapse, these totally metal stars would be rare (1in 10^4 in clusters where this occurs), but represent a fundamentally newstellar evolution channel.

1407.7039	galactic r-process enrichment by neutron star mergers in cosmological  simulations of a milky way-mass galaxy	we quantify the stellar abundances of neutron-rich r-process nuclei incosmological zoom-in simulations of a milky way-mass galaxy from the feedbackin realistic environments project. the galaxy is enriched with r-processelements by binary neutron star (ns) mergers and with iron and other metals bysupernovae. these calculations include key hydrodynamic mixing processes notpresent in standard semi-analytic chemical evolution models, such as galacticwinds and hydrodynamic flows associated with structure formation. we explore arange of models for the rate and delay time of ns mergers, intended to roughlybracket the wide range of models consistent with current observationalconstraints. we show that ns mergers can produce [r-process/fe] abundanceratios and scatter that appear reasonably consistent with observationalconstraints. at low metallicity, [fe/h]&lt;-2, we predict there is a wide range ofstellar r-process abundance ratios, with both supersolar and subsolarabundances. low-metallicity stars or stars that are outliers in their r-processabundance ratios are, on average, formed at high redshift and located at largegalactocentric radius. because ns mergers are rare, our results are not fullyconverged with respect to resolution, particularly at low metallicity. however,the uncertain rate and delay time distribution of ns mergers introduces anuncertainty in the r-process abundances comparable to that due to finitenumerical resolution. overall, our results are consistent with ns mergers beingthe source of most of the r-process nuclei in the universe.

1407.7525	no more active galactic nuclei in clumpy disks than in smooth galaxies  at z~2 in candels / 3d-hst	we use candels imaging, 3d-hst spectroscopy, and chandra x-ray data toinvestigate if active galactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially fueled byviolent disk instabilities funneling gas into galaxy centers at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4. weselect galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number ofclumps and degree of patchiness as proxies. the candels visual classificationsystem is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matchedcomparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. we notethat, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates,the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulgescompared to the clumpy galaxies. the lack of smooth extended disks is probablya general feature of the z~2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directlycompare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift.we find that z~2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced agn fractions selectedby integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatiallyresolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena ratherthan nuclear agns. meanwhile the x-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, andintermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable agn fractions derived fromboth individual detections and stacked non-detections. the data demonstratethat agn fueling modes at z~1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities orsecular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpygalaxies.

1409.7395	gizmo: a new class of accurate, mesh-free hydrodynamic simulation  methods	we present two new lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematiccomparison with moving-mesh, sph, and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. thenew methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of bothsmoothed-particle hydrodynamics (sph) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement(amr) schemes. they are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupledto a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a riemann solver acting over thevolume 'overlap.' we implement and test a parallel, second-order version of themethod with self-gravity &amp; cosmological integration, in the code gizmo: thismaintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superiorangular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does notrequire 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to movewith the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. we consider a largesuite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appearcompetitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly inangular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. the new methodshave many advantages vs. sph: proper convergence, good capturing offluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' &amp; numericalviscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, &amp; sharp shock-capturing.advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramaticallyreduced advection errors &amp; numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors,accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation andelimination of 'grid alignment' effects. we can, for example, follow hundredsof orbits of gaseous disks, while amr and sph methods break down in a feworbits. however, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.' these differences areimportant for a range of astrophysical problems.

1411.2979	mapping the core mass function to the initial mass function	it has been shown that fragmentation within self-gravitating, turbulentmolecular clouds ("turbulent fragmentation") can naturally explain the observedproperties of protostellar cores, including the core mass function (cmf). here,we extend recently-developed analytic models for turbulent fragmentation tofollow the time-dependent hierarchical fragmentation of self-gravitating cores,until they reach effectively infinite density (and form stars). we show thatturbulent fragmentation robustly predicts two key features of the imf. first, ahigh-mass power-law scaling very close to the salpeter slope, which is ageneric consequence of the scale-free nature of turbulence and self-gravity. wepredict the imf slope (-2.3) is slightly steeper then the cmf slope (-2.1),owing to the slower collapse and easier fragmentation of large cores. second, aturnover mass, which is set by a combination of the cmf turnover mass (a couplesolar masses, determined by the `sonic scale' of galactic turbulence, and soweakly dependent on galaxy properties), and the equation of state (eos). a"soft" eos with polytropic index $\gamma&lt;1.0$ predicts that the imf slopebecomes "shallow" below the sonic scale, but fails to produce the full turnoverobserved. an eos which becomes "stiff" at sufficiently low surface densities$\sigma_{\rm gas} \sim 5000\,m_{\odot}\,{\rm pc^{-2}}$, and/or models whereeach collapsing core is able to heat and effectively stiffen the eos of amodest mass ($\sim 0.02\,m_{\odot}$) of surrounding gas, are able to reproducethe observed turnover. such features are likely a consequence of more detailedchemistry and radiative feedback.

0804.2672	the self-regulated growth of supermassive black holes	we present a series of simulations of the self--regulated growth ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) in galaxies via three different fuelingmechanisms: major mergers, minor mergers, and disk instabilities. the smbhs inall three scenarios follow the same black hole fundamental plane (bhfp) andcorrelation with bulge binding energy seen in simulations of major mergers, andobserved locally. furthermore, provided that the total gas supply issignificantly larger than the mass of the smbh, its limiting mass is notinfluenced by the amount of gas available or the efficiency of black holegrowth. this supports the assertion that smbhs accrete until they reach acritical mass at which feedback is sufficient to unbind the gas locally,terminating the inflow and stalling further growth. at the same time, whileminor and major mergers follow the same projected correlations (e.g., the$m_{bh}-\sigma$ and magorrian relations), smbhs grown via disk instabilities donot, owing to structural differences between the host bulges. this finding issupported by recent observations of smbhs in pseudobulges and bulges in barredsystems, as compared to those hosted by classical bulges. taken together, thisprovides support for the bhfp and binding energy correlations as being more"fundamental" than other proposed correlations in that they reflect thephysical mechanism driving the co-evolution of smbhs and spheroids.

1501.03155	gusty, gaseous flows of fire: galactic winds in cosmological simulations  with explicit stellar feedback	we present an analysis of the galaxy-scale gaseous outflows from the fire(feedback in realistic environments) simulations. this suite of hydrodynamiccosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of star-forming giantmolecular clouds to $z=0$, and features an explicit stellar feedback model onsmall scales. our simulations reveal that high redshift galaxies undergo burstsof star formation followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflows that ejectmuch of the ism and temporarily suppress star formation. at low redshift,however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to l*-progenitors developstable disks and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formationthat does not drive outflows far into the halo. mass-loading factors for windsin l*-progenitors are $\eta \approx 10$ at high redshift, but decrease to $\eta\ll 1$ at low redshift. although lower values of $\eta$ are expected as halosgrow in mass over time, we show that the strong suppression of outflows withdecreasing redshift cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. circumgalacticoutflow velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically rangebetween one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. much of theejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the circumgalacticmedium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel further star formation.however, a fraction of the gas that leaves the virial radius through galacticwinds is never regained, causing most halos with mass $m_h \le 10^{12}m_{\odot}$ to be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by $z=0$.

1502.02036	forged in fire: cusps, cores, and baryons in low-mass dwarf galaxies	we present ultra-high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of$m_*\simeq10^{4-6.3}m_{\odot}$ dwarf galaxies that form within$m_{v}=10^{9.5-10}m_{\odot}$ dark matter halos. our simulations rely on thefire implementation of star formation feedback and were run with high enoughforce and mass resolution to directly resolve stellar and dark matter structureon the ~200 pc scales of interest for classical and ultra-faint dwarfs in thelocal group. the resultant galaxies sit on the $m_*$ vs. $m_{v}$ relationrequired to match the local group stellar mass function. they have bursty starformation histories and also form with half-light radii and metallicities thatbroadly match those observed for local dwarfs at the same stellar mass. wedemonstrate that it is possible to create a large (~1 kpc) dark matter core ina cosmological simulation of an $m_*\simeq10^{6.5}m_{\odot}$ dwarf galaxy thatresides within an $m_{v}=10^{10}m_{\odot}$ halo -- precisely the scale ofinterest for resolving the too big to fail problem. however, these large coresare not ubiquitous and appear to correlate closely with the star formationhistories of the dwarfs: dark matter cores are largest in systems that formtheir stars late ($z\lesssim2$), after the early epoch of cusp building mergershas ended. our $m_*\simeq10^4m_{\odot}$ dwarf retains a cuspy dark matter halodensity profile that matches almost identically that of a dark-matter only runof the same system. despite forming in a field environment, this very low massdwarf has observable properties that match closely to those of ultra-faintsatellite galaxies of the milky way, including a uniformly old stellarpopulation (&gt;10 gyr). though ancient, most of the stars in our ultra-faint formafter reionization; the uv field acts mainly to suppress fresh gas accretion,not to boil away gas that is already present in the proto-dwarf.

1503.07880	the difficulty of getting high escape fractions of ionizing photons from  high-redshift galaxies: a view from the fire cosmological simulations	we present a series of high-resolution (20-2000 msun, 0.1-4 pc) cosmologicalzoom-in simulations at z~6 from the feedback in realistic environment (fire)project. these simulations cover halo masses 10^9-10^11 msun and rest-frameultraviolet magnitude muv = -9 to -19. these simulations include explicitmodels of the multi-phase ism, star formation, and stellar feedback, whichproduce reasonable galaxy properties at z = 0-6. we post-process the snapshotswith a radiative transfer code to evaluate the escape fraction (fesc) ofhydrogen ionizing photons. we find that the instantaneous fesc has large timevariability (0.01%-20%), while the time-averaged fesc over long time-scalesgenerally remains ~5%, considerably lower than the estimate in manyreionization models. we find no strong dependence of fesc on galaxy mass orredshift. in our simulations, the intrinsic ionizing photon budgets aredominated by stellar populations younger than 3 myr, which tend to be buried indense birth clouds. the escaping photons mostly come from populations between3-10 myr, whose birth clouds have been largely cleared by stellar feedback.however, these populations only contribute a small fraction of intrinsicionizing photon budgets according to standard stellar population models. weshow that fesc can be boosted to high values, if stellar populations older than3 myr produce more ionizing photons than standard stellar population models (asmotivated by, e.g., models including binaries). by contrast, runaway stars withvelocities suggested by observations can enhance fesc by only a small fraction.we show that "sub-grid" star formation models, which do not explicitly resolvestar formation in dense clouds with n &gt;&gt; 1 cm^-3, will dramaticallyover-predict fesc.

1504.02097	the origin and evolution of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation	we use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the feedback inrealistic environment (fire) project to study the galaxy mass-metallicityrelations (mzr) from z=0-6. these simulations include explicit models of themulti-phase ism, star formation, and stellar feedback. the simulations coverhalo masses mhalo=10^9-10^13 msun and stellar mass mstar=10^4-10^11 msun at z=0and have been shown to produce many observed galaxy properties from z=0-6. forthe first time, our simulations agree reasonably well with the observedmass-metallicity relations at z=0-3 for a broad range of galaxy masses. wepredict the evolution of the mzr from z=0-6 aslog(zgas/zsun)=12+log(o/h)-9.0=0.35[log(mstar/msun)-10]+0.93 exp(-0.43 z)-1.05and log(zstar/zsun)=[fe/h]-0.2=0.40[log(mstar/msun)-10]+0.67 exp(-0.50 z)-1.04,for gas-phase and stellar metallicity, respectively. our simulations suggestthat the evolution of mzr is associated with the evolution of stellar/gas massfractions at different redshifts, indicating the existence of a universalmetallicity relation between stellar mass, gas mass, and metallicities. in oursimulations, galaxies above mstar=10^6 msun are able to retain a large fractionof their metals inside the halo, because metal-rich winds fail to escapecompletely and are recycled into the galaxy. this resolves a long-standingdiscrepancy between "sub-grid" wind models (and semi-analytic models) andobservations, where common sub-grid models cannot simultaneously reproduce themzr and the stellar mass functions.

1504.02466	sweating the small stuff: simulating dwarf galaxies, ultra-faint dwarf  galaxies, and their own tiny satellites	we present fire/gizmo hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of isolated darkmatter halos, two each at the mass of classical dwarf galaxies ($m_{\rm vir}\simeq 10^{10} m_{\odot}$) and ultra-faint galaxies ($m_{\rm vir} \simeq 10^9m_{\odot}$), and with two feedback implementations. the resultant centralgalaxies lie on an extrapolated abundance matching relation from $m_{\star}\simeq 10^6$ to $10^4 m_{\odot}$ without a break. every host is filled withsubhalos, many of which form stars. our dwarfs with $m_{\star} \simeq 10^6m_{\odot}$ each have 1-2 well-resolved satellites with $m_{\star} = 3-200\times 10^3 m_{\odot}$. even our isolated ultra-faint galaxies havestar-forming subhalos. if this is representative, dwarf galaxies throughout theuniverse should commonly host tiny satellite galaxies of their own. we combineour results with the elvis simulations to show that targeting $\sim 50~ \rmkpc$ regions around nearby isolated dwarfs could increase the chances ofdiscovering ultra-faint galaxies by $\sim 35\%$ compared to random halopointings, and specifically identify the region around the phoenix dwarf galaxyas a good potential target.  the well-resolved ultra-faint galaxies in our simulations ($m_{\star} \simeq3 - 30 \times 10^3 m_{\odot}$) form within $m_{\rm peak} \simeq 0.5 - 3 \times10^9 m_{\odot}$ halos. each has a uniformly ancient stellar population ($ &gt; 10~\rm gyr$) owing to reionization-related quenching. more massive systems, incontrast, all have late-time star formation. our results suggest that $m_{\rmhalo} \simeq 5 \times 10^9 m_{\odot}$ is a probable dividing line between haloshosting reionization "fossils" and those hosting dwarfs that can continue toform stars in isolation after reionization.

1504.03685	the creation and persistence of a misaligned gas disc in a simulated  early-type galaxy	massive early-type galaxies commonly have gas discs which are kinematicallymisaligned with the stellar component. these discs feel a torque from the starsand the angular momentum vectors are expected to align quickly. we presentresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulationof a massive early-type galaxy from the feedback in realistic environmentsproject. this galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a stronggalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. the galaxy subsequentlyreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120degrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. this misalignment persistsfor about 2 gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.the time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is muchlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significantamount of mass for about 1.5 gyr after the merger, during which the angularmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellartorques. once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas discdecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar componentin about 6 dynamical times. during the late evolution of the misaligned gasdisc, the centre aligns faster than the outskirts, resulting in a warped disc.we discuss the observational consequences of the long survival of ourmisaligned gas disc and how our results can be used to calibrate merger rateestimates from observed gas misalignments.

1505.02783	accurate, meshless methods for magneto-hydrodynamics	recently, we developed a pair of meshless finite-volume lagrangian methodsfor hydrodynamics: the 'meshless finite mass' (mfm) and 'meshless finitevolume' (mfv) methods. these capture advantages of both smoothed-particlehydrodynamics (sph) and adaptive mesh-refinement (amr) schemes. here, we extendthese to include ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (mhd). the mhd equations aresecond-order consistent and conservative. we augment these with adivergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains div*b~0 to high accuracy. weimplement these in the code gizmo, together with a state-of-the-artimplementation of sph mhd. in every one of a large suite of test problems, thenew methods are competitive with moving-mesh and amr schemes using constrainedtransport (ct) to ensure div*b=0. they are able to correctly capture the growthand structure of the magneto-rotational instability (mri), mhd turbulence, andthe launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than amrcodes. compared to sph, the mfm/mfv methods exhibit proper convergence at fixedneighbor number, sharper shock capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, div*berrors, and diffusion. still, 'modern' sph is able to handle most of our tests,at the cost of much larger kernels and 'by hand' adjustment of artificialdiffusion parameters. compared to amr, the new meshless methods exhibitenhanced 'grid noise' but reduced advection errors and numerical diffusion,velocity-independent errors, and superior angular momentum conservation andcoupling to n-body gravity solvers. as a result they converge more slowly onsome problems (involving smooth, slowly-moving flows) but more rapidly onothers (involving advection or rotation). in all cases, divergence-controlbeyond the popular powell 8-wave approach is necessary, or else all methods weconsider will systematically converge to unphysical solutions.

0805.3533	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: ii. 'cusp' ellipticals	we study the origin and properties of 'extra' or 'excess' central light inthe surface brightness profiles of cusp or power-law ellipticals. dissipationalmergers give rise to two-component profiles: an outer profile established byviolent relaxation acting on stars present in the progenitors prior to thefinal merger, and an inner stellar population comprising the extra light,formed in a compact starburst. combining a large set of hydrodynamicalsimulations with data that span a broad range of profiles and masses, we showthat this picture is borne out -- cusp ellipticals are indeed 'extra light'ellipticals -- and examine how the properties of this component scale withglobal galaxy properties. we show how to robustly separate the 'extra' light,and demonstrate that observed cusps are reliable tracers of the degree ofdissipation in the spheroid-forming merger. we show that the typical degree ofdissipation is a strong function of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gasfractions at each mass. we demonstrate a correlation between extra lightcontent and effective radius at fixed mass: systems with more dissipation aremore compact. the outer shape of the light profile does not depend on mass,with a mean outer sersic index ~2.5. we explore how this relates to shapes,kinematics, and stellar population gradients. simulations with the gas contentneeded to match observed profiles also reproduce observed age, metallicity, andcolor gradients, and we show how these can be used as tracers of the degree ofdissipation in spheroid formation.

1509.07877	a constrained-gradient method to control divergence errors in numerical  mhd	in numerical magnetohydrodynamics (mhd), a major challenge is maintainingzero magnetic field-divergence (div-b). constrained transport (ct) schemes canachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to veryspecific methods. for more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ale) methods,'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-b errors, however they can stillbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematicdeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. here wepropose a new constrained gradient (cg) scheme which augments these with ahybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with areconstruction. this iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,globally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. we emphasize that, unlike'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numericallyunstable div-b terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. weimplement this in the mesh-free code gizmo and compare a wide range of testproblems. compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our cg method reducesthe maximum div-b errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dexbelow the typical errors if no div-b cleaning is used). by preventing largediv-b even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematicerrors at jumps. in every problem, the accuracy of our cg results is comparableto ct methods. the cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the cgcorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical mhdmethods. while for many problems, we find dedner-type cleaning schemes aresufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where usingonly the simplest powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,order-of-magnitude errors.

1510.02477	the fundamentally different dynamics of dust and gas in molecular clouds	we study the behavior of large dust grains in turbulent molecular clouds(mcs). in primarily neutral regions, dust grains move as aerodynamic particles,not necessarily with the gas. we therefore directly simulate, for the firsttime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,magnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of mcs. we show that, under theseconditions, grains with sizes a &gt;0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scalevariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). the dust can formhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emissionand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gasfilaments. sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the samelocation. the 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dustgrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal sizerange. the dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100cm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. however, because thedensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than inthe subsonic case. our results are applicable to mcs of essentially all sizesand densities, but we note how lorentz forces and other physics (neglectedhere) may change them in some regimes. we discuss the potentially dramaticconsequences for star formation, dust growth and destruction, and dust-basedobservations of mcs.

1510.03869	(star)bursts of fire: observational signatures of bursty star formation  in galaxies	galaxy formation models exhibit remarkable success in reproducing observedrelations such as the relation between galaxies' star formation rates (sfrs)and stellar masses and the stellar mass--halo mass relation. we demonstratethat comparisons of the short-timescale variability in galaxy sfrs withobservational data provide an additional useful constraint on the physics ofgalaxy formation feedback. we apply sfr indicators with different sensitivitytimescales to galaxies from the feedback in realistic environments (fire)simulations. we find that the sfr--stellar mass relation has a significantlygreater scatter when the halpha-derived sfr is considered compared with whenthe far-ultraviolet (fuv)-based sfr is used. this difference is a directconsequence of bursty star formation because the fire galaxies exhibitorder-of-magnitude sfr variations over timescales of a few myr. consequently,low-mass galaxies can go through both quenched (in terms of the 10-myr averagedsfr) and starburst phases within a 200-myr period. we also find that thehalpha/fuv ratios are very similar to those observed for local galaxies,although there is a population of simulated galaxies with lower halpha/fuvratios than observed at stellar masses smaller than 10^9.5 solar masses. theinterpretation is that our sample of fire galaxies is slightly more bursty thanthe observed sample of galaxies in the vicinity of the galaxy. a possibleexplanation is that despite the very high resolution of the simulations, thesfr variability and thus halpha/fuv ratios may not be fully converged. wesuggest that future cosmological simulations should compare the halpha/fuvratios of their galaxies with observations to constrain the feedback modelsemployed.

1510.05650	how stellar feedback simultaneously regulates star formation and drives  outflows	we present an analytic model for how momentum deposition from stellarfeedback simultaneously regulates star formation and drives outflows in aturbulent interstellar medium (ism). because the ism is turbulent, a givenpatch of ism exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. thehigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence andself-regulating local star formation. sufficiently low-density patches,however, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region canself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. in theturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\gtrsim 0.3$,the ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity issufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ism has surfacedensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamicaltime. the resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\eta \equiv m_{\rmout}/m_{\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times thecircular velocity. at low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed forlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent mach number, declinerapidly; the ism is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drivewinds with large mass-loading factors. crucially, our model predicts thatstellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at $z \lesssim 1$ in$m_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ galaxies. this mechanism allows massivegalaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then 'shut down'those outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth,extended thin stellar disk. we provide simple fitting functions for $\eta$ thatshould be useful for sub-resolution and semi-analytic models.

1511.01095	the no-spin zone: rotation vs dispersion support in observed and  simulated dwarf galaxies	we perform a systematic bayesian analysis of rotation vs. dispersion support($v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$) in $40$ dwarf galaxies throughout the local volume(lv) over a stellar mass range $10^{3.5} m_{\rm \odot} &lt; m_{\star} &lt; 10^8m_{\rm \odot}$. we find that the stars in $\sim 90\%$ of the lv dwarf galaxiesstudied -- both satellites and isolated systems -- are dispersion-supported. inparticular, we show that $7/10$ *isolated* dwarfs in our sample have stellarpopulations with $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma &lt; 0.6$. all have $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma\lesssim 2$. these results challenge the traditional view that the stars ingas-rich dwarf irregulars (dirrs) are distributed in cold,rotationally-supported stellar disks, while gas-poor dwarf spheroidals (dsphs)are kinematically distinct in having dispersion-supported stars. we see noclear trend between $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$ and distance to the closest $\rml_{\star}$ galaxy, nor between $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$ and $m_{\star}$ withinour mass range. we apply the same bayesian analysis to four fire hydrodynamiczoom-in simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies ($10^9 m_{\odot} &lt; m_{\rm vir} &lt;10^{10} m_{\rm \odot}$) and show that the simulated *isolated* dirr galaxieshave stellar ellipticities and stellar $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$ ratios that areconsistent with the observed population of dirrs *and* dsphs without the needto subject these dwarfs to any external perturbations or tidal forces. we positthat most dwarf galaxies form as puffy, dispersion-supported systems, ratherthan cold, angular momentum-supported disks. if this is the case, thentransforming a dirr into a dsph may require little more than removing its gas.

0806.1739	how do disks survive mergers?	we develop a physical model for how galactic disks survive and/or aredestroyed in interactions. based on dynamical arguments, we show gas primarilyloses angular momentum to internal torques in a merger. gas within somecharacteristic radius (a function of the orbital parameters, mass ratio, andgas fraction of the merging galaxies), will quickly lose angular momentum tothe stars sharing the perturbed disk, fall to the center and be consumed in astarburst. a similar analysis predicts where violent relaxation of the stellardisks is efficient. our model allows us to predict the stellar and gas contentthat will survive to re-form a disk in the remnant, versus being violentlyrelaxed or contributing to a starburst. we test this in hydrodynamicsimulations and find good agreement as a function of mass ratio, orbitalparameters, and gas fraction, in simulations spanning a wide range in theseproperties and others, including different prescriptions for gas physics andfeedback. in an immediate sense, the amount of disk that re-forms can beunderstood in terms of well-understood gravitational physics, independent ofdetails of ism gas physics or feedback. this allows us to explicitly quantifythe requirements for such feedback to (indirectly) enable disk survival, bychanging the pre-merger gas content and distribution. the efficiency of diskdestruction is a strong function of gas content: we show how and whysufficiently gas-rich major mergers can, under general conditions, yieldsystems with small bulges (b/t&lt;0.2). we provide prescriptions for inclusion ofour results in semi-analytic models.

0806.2325	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: iii. 'core' ellipticals  and 'missing' light	we investigate how 'extra' central light in the surface brightness profilesof cusp ellipticals relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. cuspelliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting onstars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipationalstarbursts. core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)cusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve acompact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).comparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how toobservationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals. wedemonstrate that these survive re-mergers and reliably trace the dissipation inthe initial gas-rich merger(s). the typical degree of dissipation is a strongfunction of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions. we find acorrelation between dissipation and effective radius: systems with moredissipation are more compact. the survival of this component and scattering ofstars into the envelope naturally explain high-sersic index profilescharacteristic of massive core ellipticals. this is also closely related to thekinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst componentsfrom their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/coreellipticals. we show that it is critical to adopt physically motivated profileswhen attempting to quantify how much mass has been 'scoured' or scattered outof the inner regions by binary black holes. estimates of scoured mass ignoringmulti-component structure can be strongly biased, potentially explainingobserved systems with large inferred core masses in apparent conflict withcore-scouring models.

1512.03834	are the formation and abundances of metal-poor stars the result of dust  dynamics?	large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relativeto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. small, high-redshift galaxies (beforereionization) represent ideal environments for this process. we show via simplearguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected inlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. this can haveimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremelymetal-poor stars. low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almostimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity istoo low for fragmentation to occur. the abundances of these 'promoted' starsmay contain interesting signatures, as the cno abundances (concentrated inlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and mg and si (in large silicate grains)can be enhanced or fluctuate independently. remarkably, otherwise puzzlingabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standardcore-collapse sne yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. wealso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements inthese species agrees with our simulations. moreover, we confirm mg and si arecorrelated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in localsilicate grains. meanwhile [mg/ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from puresne yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,preferentially in the [c/fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. this suggests that (1)dust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratiofluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) lightelement abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dustwhere they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis.

0806.2861	the radical consequences of realistic satellite orbits for the heating  and implied merger histories of galactic disks	previous models of galactic disk heating in interactions invoke restrictiveassumptions not necessarily valid in modern lcdm contexts: that satellites andorbits are rigid and circular, with slow decay over many orbital times fromdynamical friction. this leads to a linear scaling of disk heating withsatellite mass: disk heights and velocity dispersions scale ~m_sat/m_disk. inturn, observed disk thicknesses present strong constraints on merger histories:the implication for the milky way is that &lt;5% of its mass could come frommergers since z~2, in conflict with cosmological predictions. morerealistically, satellites merge on nearly radial orbits, and once near thedisk, resonant interactions efficiently remove angular momentum while tidaleffects strip mass, leading to rapid merger/destruction in a couple offree-fall plunges. under these conditions the proper heating efficiency isnon-linear in mass ratio, ~(m_sat/m_disk)^2. we derive the scaling of diskscale heights and velocity dispersions as a function of mass ratio and disk gascontent in this regime, and show this accurately describes the results ofsimulations with proper 'live' halos and disks. under realistic circumstances,disk heating in minor mergers is suppressed by an order of magnitude relativeto expectations of previous models. we show that the milky way disk could haveabsorbed ~5-10 1:10 mass-ratio mergers since z=2, in agreement withcosmological models. these distinctions lead to dramatic differences in whichmass ratios are most important for disk heating and in the isophotal shapes ofdisk+bulge systems.

0806.3974	dissipation and the fundamental plane: observational tests	we develop observational tests of the idea that dissipation in gas-richmergers produces the fundamental plane (fp) and related correlations obeyed byellipticals. the fp 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratioof stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. models arguethat mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield largermass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar r_e andhigher m_stellar/m_tot within that r_e. such starbursts leave a characteristicimprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outerprofile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. inprevious work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observedprofiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in theoriginal spheroid-forming merger(s). applying this to a large sample ofobserved ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the fp and itstilt are driven by dissipation. at fixed mass, ellipticals formed in moredissipational events are smaller and have higher m_stellar/m_tot. at fixeddegree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the fp. we show that the dynamicalmass estimator r_e*sigma^2/g is a good estimator of the true mass: the observedfp tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. removing theeffects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same fp correlations asdisks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the fp tilt.

0807.2868	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: iv. evolution in the  scaling relations of spheroids	we develop a model for the origins and redshift evolution of spheroid scalingrelations. we consider spheroid sizes, velocity dispersions, masses, profileshapes (sersic indices), and black hole (bh) masses, and their relatedscalings. our approach combines advantages of observational constraints in halooccupation models and hydrodynamic merger simulations. this allows us toseparate the relative roles of dissipation, dry mergers, formation time, andprogenitor evolution, and identify their effects on scalings at each redshift.dissipation is the most important factor determining spheroid sizes andfundamental plane (fp) scalings, and can account for the fp tilt anddifferences between disk and spheroid scalings. because disks at high-z havehigher gas fractions, mergers are more gas-rich, yielding more compactspheroids. this predicts mass-dependent evolution in spheroid sizes, inagreement with observations. this relates to subtle evolution in the fp,important to studies that assume a fixed intrinsic fp. this also predicts mildevolution in bh-host correlations, towards larger bhs at higher z. dry mergersare significant, but only for massive systems which form early: they formcompact, but undergo dry mergers (consistent with observations) such that theirsizes at later times are similar to spheroids of similar mass formed morerecently. we model descendants of observed compact high-z spheroids: most willbecome cores of bcgs, with sizes, velocity dispersions, and bh massesconsistent with observations, but we identify a fraction that might survive toz=0 intact.

0808.1227	a semi-analytic model for the co-evolution of galaxies, black holes, and  active galactic nuclei	we present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growthof supermassive black holes (bh) and their host galaxies within the context ofthe lcdm cosmological framework. in our model, the energy emitted by accretingblack holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galacticscale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jetsthat heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. we present acomprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observationalmeasurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as coldgas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formationrates. we find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponentialcutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densitiesat z~0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely,quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. we also find that our model ofself-regulated bh growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between bhmass and bulge mass. we explore the global formation history of galaxies in ourmodels, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation,stellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. we find that models assuming the"concordance" lcdm cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass athigh redshift (z&gt;2). a model with less small-scale power predicts less starformation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellarmass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas inquasar absorption systems at high redshift (z~3-4).

(2004) reddening. extension tolonger wavelengths using a subset of 1886 sdss-2mass matches confirms theseresults at high significance. we carry out monte-carlo simulations that matchthe observed distribution of quasar spectral energy distributions using alorentzian dust reddening distribution; 2% of quasars selected by the main sdsstargeting algorithm (i.e., which are not extincted out of the sample) havee_{b-v} &gt; 0.1; less than 1% have e_{b-v} &gt; 0.2, where the extinction isrelative to quasars with modal colors. reddening is uncorrelated with thepresence of intervening narrow-line absorption systems, but reddened quasarsare much more likely to show narrow absorption at the redshift of the quasarthan are unreddened quasars. thus the reddening towards quasars is dominated bysmc-like dust at the quasar redshift.

astro-ph;0409652	cluster alignments and ellipticities in lcdm cosmology	the ellipticities and alignments of clusters of galaxies, and their evolutionwith redshift, are examined in the context of a lambda-dominated cold darkmatter cosmology. we use a large-scale, high-resolution n-body simulation tomodel the matter distribution in a light cone containing ~10^6 clusters out toredshifts of z=3. cluster ellipticities are determined as a function of mass,radius, and redshift, both in 3d and in projection. we find strong clusterellipticities: the mean ellipticity increases with redshift from 0.3 at z=0 to0.5 at z=3, for both 3d and 2d ellipticities; the evolution is well-fit bye=0.33+0.05z. the ellipticities increase with cluster mass and with clusterradius; the main cluster body is more elliptical than the cluster cores, butthe increase of ellipticities with redshift is preserved. using the fittedcluster ellipsoids, we determine the alignment of clusters as a function oftheir separation. we find strong alignment of clusters for separations &lt;100mpc/h; the alignment increases with decreasing separation and with increasingredshift. the evolution of clusters from highly aligned and elongated systemsat early times to lower alignment and elongation at present reflects thehierarchical and filamentary nature of structure formation. these measures ofcluster ellipticity and alignment will provide a new test of the currentcosmological model when compared with upcoming cluster surveys.

astro-ph;0502241	a physical model for the origin of quasar lifetimes	we propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which observational quasarlifetimes and an intrinsic lifetime of rapid accretion are stronglydistinguished by the physics of obscuration by surrounding gas and dust.quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, but for a large part ofthe accretion lifetime are heavily obscured by the large gas densities poweringaccretion. in this phase, starbursts and black hole growth are fueled but thequasar is buried. eventually, feedback from accretion energy dispersessurrounding gas, creating a window in which the black hole is observableoptically as a quasar, until accretion rates drop below those required tomaintain a quasar luminosity. we model this process and measure the unobscuredand intrinsic quasar lifetimes in a hydrodynamical simulation of a major galaxymerger. the source luminosity is determined from the black hole accretion rate,calculated from local gas properties. we calculate the column density ofhydrogen to the source along multiple lines of sight and use these columndensities and gas metallicities to determine b-band attenuation of the source.defining the observable quasar lifetime as the total time with an observedb-band luminosity above some limit l_b,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 myr forl_b,min=10^11 l_sun (m_b=-23), in good agreement with observationallydetermined quasar lifetimes. this is significantly smaller than the intrinsiclifetime ~100 myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. the ratio of observedto intrinsic lifetime is also strong function of both the limiting luminosityand the observed frequency.

astro-ph;0504156	x-ray emission from hot gas in galaxy mergers	we examine x-ray emission produced from hot gas during collisions and mergersof disk galaxies. to study this process, we employ simulations that incorporatecosmologically motivated disk-galaxy models and include the effects ofradiative cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and accretingsupermassive black holes. we find that during a merger, the colliding gas inthe disks is shock-heated to x-ray-emitting temperatures. the x-ray luminosityis spatially extended, rises during the initial stages of the merger, and peakswhen the galactic centers coalesce. when a physical model for accreting blackholes is included, the resulting feedback can drive powerful winds thatcontribute significantly to the amount and metallicity of hot gas, both ofwhich increase the x-ray luminosity. in terms of their stellar kinematics andstructural properties, the merger remnants in our simulations resembleelliptical galaxies. we find that the x-ray luminosities of the remnants withb-band luminosities in the range l_b ~ 10^10 - 10^11 lsun are consistent withobservations, while remnants with smaller or larger masses are underluminous inx-rays. moreover, because the majority of the merger remnants are broadlyconsistent with the observed scaling relations between temperature, b-bandluminosity and x-ray luminosity we conclude that major mergers are a viablemechanism for producing the x-ray halos of large, luminous elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0504190	black holes in galaxy mergers: evolution of quasars	based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a modelin which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassiveblack holes in galaxies. nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collisiontriggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the durationof the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas anddust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and uvwavelengths. eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas andexpels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. between buried and deadphases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminousquasar. because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution ofobscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of thisphase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposedluminosity threshold. we determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as afunction of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10myr for bright quasars in the optical b-band, in good agreement with empiricalestimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 myr,naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. however,observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the ir and hard x-ray bandsas attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. weobtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which thequasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agreesremarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution fromthe sdss for appropriate luminosity thresholds.

astro-ph;0504253	luminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes: reconciling the optical and x-ray  quasar luminosity functions	we consider implications of our new model of quasar lifetimes and lightcurves for the quasar luminosity function (lf) at different frequencies andredshifts. in our picture, quasars evolve rapidly and the lifetime depends onboth their instantaneous and peak luminosities. the bright end of the lf tracesthe peak intrinsic quasar activity, but the faint end consists of quasars whichare either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses andluminosities, or are in sub-eddington quiescent states going into or coming outof a period of peak activity. the 'break' in the observed lf correspondsdirectly to the maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities,which falls off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. we study this modelusing simulations of galaxy mergers which successfully reproduce a wide rangeof observed quasar phenomena, including the observed column densitydistribution. by combining quasar lifetimes and the distribution of maximumquasar luminosities determined from the observed hard x-ray lf with thecorresponding luminosity and host-system dependent column densities, we producethe expected soft x-ray and b-band lfs. our predictions agree exceptionallywell with the observed lfs at all observed luminosities, over the redshiftrange considered (z &lt; 1), without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about anobscured population of sources. our results also suggest that observedcorrelations in hard x-ray samples between the obscured fraction of quasars andluminosity can be explained in the context of our model by the expulsion ofsurrounding gas due to heating from accretion feedback energy as a quasar nearsits peak luminosity and final black hole mass.

astro-ph;0506038	the evolution of the m-sigma relation	(abridged) we examine the evolution of the black hole mass - stellar velocitydispersion (m-sigma) relation over cosmic time using simulations of galaxymergers that include feedback from supermassive black hole growth. we considermergers of galaxies varying the properties of the progenitors to match thoseexpected at redshifts z=0-6. we find that the slope of the resulting m-sigmarelation is the same at all redshifts considered. for the same feedbackefficiency that reproduces the observed amplitude of the m-sigma relation atz=0, there is a weak redshift-dependence to the normalization that results froman increasing velocity dispersion for a given galactic stellar mass. we developa formalism to connect redshift evolution in the m-sigma relation to thescatter in the local relation at z=0. we show that the scatter in the localrelation places severe constraints on the redshift evolution of both thenormalization and slope of the m-sigma relation. furthermore, we demonstratethat cosmic downsizing introduces a black hole mass-dependent dispersion in them-sigma relation and that the skewness of the distribution about the locallyobserved m-sigma relation is sensitive to redshift evolution in thenormalization and slope. in principle, these various diagnostics provide amethod for differentiating between theories for producing the m-sigma relation.in agreement with existing constraints, our simulations imply that hierarchicalstructure formation should produce the relation with small intrinsic scatter.

astro-ph;0507361	the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering	we investigate the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering, inspired bynumerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporate black hole growth.these simulations have motivated a new interpretation of the quasar luminosityfunction. in this picture, the bright end of the quasar luminosity functionconsists of quasars radiating nearly at their peak luminosities, while thefaint end consists mainly of very similar sources, but at dimmer phases intheir evolution. we combine this model with the statistics of dark matter halosthat host quasar activity. we find that, since bright and faint quasars aremostly similar sources seen in different evolutionary stages, a broad range inquasar luminosities corresponds to only a narrow range in the masses of quasarhost halos. on average, bright and faint quasars reside in similar host halos.consequently, we argue that quasar clustering should depend only weakly onluminosity. this prediction is in qualitative agreement with recentmeasurements of the luminosity dependence of the quasar correlation function(croom et al. 2005) and the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function(adelberger &amp; steidel 2005). future precision clustering measurements from sdssand 2df, spanning a large range in luminosity, should provide a strong test ofour model.

astro-ph;0508299	the evolution in the faint-end slope of the quasar luminosity function	(abridged) based on numerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporateblack hole (bh) growth, we predict the faint end slope of the quasar luminosityfunction (qlf) and its evolution with redshift. our simulations have yielded anew model for quasar lifetimes where the lifetime depends on both theinstantaneous and peak quasar luminosities. this motivates a new interpretationof the qlf in which the bright end consists of quasars radiating at nearlytheir peak luminosities, but the faint end is mostly made up of quasars in lessluminous phases of evolution. the faint-end qlf slope is then determined by thefaint-end slope of the quasar lifetime for quasars with peak luminosities nearthe observed break. we determine this slope from the quasar lifetime as afunction of peak luminosity, based on a large set of simulations spanning awide variety of host galaxy, merger, bh, and ism gas properties. brighter peakluminosity (higher bh mass) systems undergo more violent evolution, and expeland heat gas more rapidly in the final stages of quasar evolution, resulting ina flatter faint-end slope (as these objects fall below the observed break inthe qlf more rapidly). therefore, as the qlf break luminosity moves to higherluminosities with increasing redshift, implying a larger typical quasar peakluminosity, the faint-end qlf slope flattens. from the quasar lifetime as afunction of peak luminosity and this interpretation of the qlf, we predict thefaint-end qlf slope and its evolution with redshift in good agreement withobservations. although bhs grow anti-hierarchically (with lower-mass bhs formedprimarily at lower redshifts), the observed change in slope and differential orluminosity dependent density evolution in the qlf is completely determined bythe luminosity-dependent quasar lifetime and physics of quasar feedback.

astro-ph;0510369	how much mass do supermassive black holes eat in their old age?	we consider the distribution of local supermassive black hole eddingtonratios and accretion rates, accounting for the dependence of radiativeefficiency and bolometric corrections on the accretion rate. we find that blackhole mass growth, both of the integrated mass density and the masses of mostindividual objects, must be dominated by an earlier, radiatively efficient,high accretion rate stage, and not by the radiatively inefficient low accretionrate phase in which most local supermassive black holes are currently observed.this conclusion is particularly true of supermassive black holes in ellipticalhost galaxies, as expected if they have undergone merger activity in the pastwhich would fuel quasar activity and rapid growth. we discuss models of thetime evolution of accretion rates and show that they all predict significantmass growth in a prior radiatively efficient state. the only way to avoid thisconclusion is through careful fine-tuning of the accretion/quasar timescale toa value that is inconsistent with observations. our results agree with a widerange of observational inferences drawn from the quasar luminosity function andx-ray background synthesis models, but our approach has the virtue of beingindependent of the modeling of source populations. models in which black holesspend the great majority of their time in low accretion rate phases are thuscompletely consistent both with observations implying mass gain in relativelyshort, high accretion rate phases and with the local distribution of accretionrates.

astro-ph;0601621	observational evidence for the co-evolution of galaxy mergers, quasars,  and the blue/red galaxy transition	we compile a number of observations to estimate the time-averaged rate offormation or buildup of red sequence galaxies, as a function of mass andredshift. comparing this with the mass functions of mergers and quasar hosts,and independently comparing their clustering properties as a function ofredshift, we find that these populations trace the same mass distribution, withsimilar evolution, at redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;~1.5. knowing one of the quasar, merger, orelliptical mass/luminosity functions, it is possible to predict the others.allowing for greater model dependence, we compare the rate of early-typebuildup with the implied merger and quasar triggering rates as a function ofmass and redshift and find agreement. over this redshift range, observed mergerfractions can account for the entire bright quasar luminosity function andbuildup of the red sequence at all but the highest masses at low redshift(&gt;~10^11 m_solar at z&lt;~0.3) where 'dry' mergers appear to dominate. thissupports a necessary prediction of theories where mergers between gas-richgalaxies produce ellipticals with an associated phase of quasar activity, afterwhich the remnant becomes red. these populations trace a similar characteristictransition mass, possibly reflecting the mass above which the ellipticalpopulation is mostly (&gt;~50%) assembled at a given redshift, which increaseswith redshift over the observed range in a manner consistent with suggestionsthat cosmic downsizing may apply to red galaxy assembly as well as starformation. these mass distributions as a function of redshift do not uniformlytrace the all/red/blue galaxy population, ruling out models in which quasaractivity is generically associated with star formation or is long lived in'old' systems.

astro-ph;0602290	the relation between quasar and merging galaxy luminosity functions and  the merger-induced star formation rate of the universe	using a model for self-regulated growth of black holes (bhs) in mergersinvolving gas-rich galaxies, we study the relationship between quasars and thepopulation of merging galaxies and predict the merger-induced star formationrate density of the universe. mergers drive nuclear gas inflows, fuelingstarbursts and 'buried quasars' until accretion feedback expels the gas,rendering a briefly visible optical quasar. star formation is shut down andaccretion declines, leaving a passively evolving remnant with propertiestypical of red, elliptical galaxies. based on evolution of these events in oursimulations, we demonstrate that the observed statistics of merger rates,luminosity functions (lfs) and mass functions, sfr distributions, specificsfrs, quasar and quasar host galaxy lfs, and elliptical/red galaxy lfs areself-consistent and follow from one another as predicted by the mergerhypothesis. we use our simulations to de-convolve both quasar and merginggalaxy lfs to determine the birthrate of black holes of a given final mass andmerger rates as a function of stellar mass. we use this to predict the merginggalaxy lf in several observed wavebands, color-magnitude relations, massfunctions, absolute and specific sfr distributions and sfr density, and quasarhost galaxy lfs, as a function of redshift from z=0-6. we invert this andpredict e.g. quasar lfs from observed merger lfs or sfr distributions. ourresults agree well with observations, but idealized models of quasarlightcurves are ruled out by comparison of merger and quasar observations at&gt;99.9% confidence. using only observations of quasars, we estimate thecontribution of mergers to the sfr density of the universe even to highredshifts z~4.

astro-ph;0603180	fueling low-level agn activity through the stochastic accretion of cold  gas	using a simple description of feedback from black hole (bh) growth, wedevelop an analytic model for the fueling of seyferts (low-luminosity agn) andtheir relation to their host galaxies, eddington ratio distributions, andcosmological evolution. we derive a solution for evolution of accretion ratesin a feedback-driven blast wave, applicable to large-scale outflows from brightquasars in galaxy mergers, low-luminosity agn, and bhs in supernova remnants.under the assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central smbhat a rate set by the dynamics of that gas, our solution determines the seyfertlight curve evolution. we use this to predict the seyfert luminosity function(lf), duty cycles, lifetimes, and distribution of host morphologies, eddingtonratios, and obscuration as a function of agn luminosity and mass, and findagreement with observations at z=0. we consider the breakdown of contributionsfrom this and stellar wind accretion and merger-driven activity. we makespecific predictions for the weak evolution of the seyfert lf with redshift (lfof non-merger driven activity), and for changes in both the slope and scatterof the m_bh-sigma relation at low-m_bh. quiescent fueling dominates over a wideluminosity range (-14 &gt; m_b &gt; -22) at z=0, where most bh growth occurs aroundm_bh~10^7 m_sun, in s0 and sa/b galaxies. however, quasar activity fromgas-rich mergers evolves more rapidly with redshift, and by z=1 quiescentfueling is important only at luminosities an order of magnitude or more belowthe lf break. although non-merger driven fueling is important for bh growth andthe m_bh-sigma relation at low m_bh, it does not significantly contribute tothe total bh mass density or cosmological backgrounds.

astro-ph;0605652	feedback-driven evolution of the far-infrared spectral energy  distributions of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we calculate infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) from simulationsof major galaxy mergers and study the effect of agn and starburst drivenfeedback on the evolution of the sed as a function of time. we use aself-consistent three-dimensional radiative equilibrium code to calculate theemergent seds and to make images. to facilitate a simple description of ourfindings, we describe our results in reference to an approximate analyticsolution for the far-ir sed. we focus mainly on the luminous infrared galaxy(lirg) and ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) phases of evolution. wecontrast the seds of simulations performed with agn feedback to simulationsperformed with starburst driven wind feedback. we find that the feedbackprocesses critically determine the evolution of the sed. changing the source ofillumination (whether stellar or agn) has virtually no impact on thereprocessed far-infrared sed. we find that agn feedback is particularlyeffective at dispersing gas and rapidly injecting energy into the ism. theobservational signature of such powerful feedback is a warm sed. in general,simulations performed with starburst driven winds have colder spectra andreprocess more of their emission into the infrared, resulting in higherinfrared to bolometric luminosities compared to (otherwise equivalent)simulations performed with agn feedback. we depict our results in iras bands,as well as in spitzer's mips bands, and in herschel's pacs bands.

astro-ph;0605678	an observational determination of the bolometric quasar luminosity  function	we combine a large set of quasar luminosity function (qlf) measurements fromthe rest-frame optical, soft and hard x-ray, and near- and mid-infrared bandsto determine the bolometric qlf in the redshift interval z=0-6. accounting forthe observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of spectralenergy distribution (sed) shapes, and their dependence on luminosity, makes itpossible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides abaseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey.we infer the qlf break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z~4.5 and confirmat high significance (&gt;10sigma) previous claims of a flattening in both thefaint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. with the best-fit estimates of thecolumn density distribution and quasar sed, which both depend on luminosity, asingle bolometric qlf self-consistently reproduces the observed qlfs in allbands and at all redshifts for which we compile measurements. ignoring thisluminosity dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric qlf and thereis no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. we calculate theexpected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic x-raybackground, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find they areconsistent with existing measurements. the peak in the total quasar luminositydensity is well-constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. we provide a number of fittingfunctions to the bolometric qlf and its manifestations in various bands, and ascript to return the qlf at arbitrary frequency and redshift from these fits,as the most simple inferences from the qlf measured in a single band can bemisleading.

astro-ph;0607446	kinematic structure of merger remnants	we use numerical simulations to study the kinematic structure of remnantsformed from mergers of equal-mass disk galaxies. in particular, we show thatremnants of dissipational mergers, which include the radiative cooling of gas,star formation, feedback from supernovae, and the growth of supermassive blackholes, are smaller, rounder, have, on average, a larger central velocitydispersion, and show significant rotation compared to remnants ofdissipationless mergers. the increased rotation speed of dissipational remnantsowes its origin to star formation that occurs in the central regions during thegalaxy merger. we have further quantified the anisotropy, three-dimensionalshape, minor axis rotation, and isophotal shape of each merger remnant, findingthat dissipational remnants are more isotropic, closer to oblate, have themajority of their rotation along their major axis, and are more disky thandissipationless remnants. individual remnants display a wide variety ofkinematic properties. a large fraction of the dissipational remnants are oblateisotropic rotators. many dissipational, and all of the dissipationless, areslowly rotating and anisotropic. the remnants of gas-rich major mergers canwell-reproduce the observed distribution of projected ellipticities, rotationparameter (v/\sigma)*, kinematic misalignments, psi, and isophotal shapes. thedissipationless remnants are a poor match to this data. our results support themerger hypothesis for the origin of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies providedthat the progenitor disks are sufficiently gas-rich, however our remnants are apoor match to the bright ellipticals that are slowly rotating and uniformlyboxy.

astro-ph;0608091	an upper limit to the degree of evolution between supermassive black  holes and their host galaxies	we describe a model-independent integral constraint which defines an upperlimit to the allowed degree of evolution in the ratio of black hole (bh) massto host galaxy luminosity or mass, as a function of redshift. essentially, ifthe bh/host ratio is excessive at redshift z, then it would imply that thetotal mass density in bhs above some m_bh(min) is larger at that redshift thanat z=0, which is impossible. this argument requires no knowledge of host or bhproperties, only a lower limit to the observed luminosity density in thebrightest galaxies at some z. we calculate this upper limit from a variety ofluminosity and mass functions in different bands from redshifts z=0-2. we showthat it is consistent with passive evolution of spheroid populations (with afixed m_bh/m_host relation) in all cases, and provides tighter constraints thanhave generally been obtained previously, ruling out at &gt;6 sigma observationaland theoretical estimates suggesting that m_bh/m_host was significantly largerat high redshifts than locally, although relatively weak (factor ~2 by z=2)evolution is still allowed. we discuss a variety of possible 'loopholes' orchanges in the bh/host populations and correlations, and show that theytypically lower the upper limits and strengthen our conclusions.

astro-ph;0608190	formation of z ~ 6 quasars from hierarchical galaxy mergers	the discovery of luminous quasars at redshift z ~ 6 indicates the presence ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) of mass ~10^9 msun when the universe was lessthan one billion years old. this finding presents several challenges fortheoretical models. here, we present the first multi-scale simulations that,together with a self-regulated model for the smbh growth, produce a luminousquasar at z ~ 6.5 in the lcdm paradigm. we follow the hierarchical assemblyhistory of the most massive halo in a ~ 3 gpc^3 volume, and find that this haloof ~ 8x 10^{12} msun forming at z ~ 6.5 after several major mergers is able toreproduce a number of observed properties of sdss j1148+5251, the most distantquasar detected at z =6.42 (fan et al. 2003). moreover, the smbhs grow throughgas accretion below the eddington limit in a self-regulated manner owing tofeedback. we find that the progenitors experience significant star formation(up to 10^4 msun/yr) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellarmass of the quasar host reaches 10^{12} msun at z ~ 6.5, consistent withobservations of significant metal enrichment in sdss j1148+5251. our resultsprovide a viable formation mechanism for z ~ 6 quasars in the standard lcdmcosmology, and demonstrate a common, merger-driven origin for the rarestquasars and the fundamental smbh-host correlation in a hierarchicaluniverse.(abridged)

astro-ph;0610860	an evolutionary model for submillimeter galaxies	[abridged]we calculate multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (seds)(spanning optical to millimeter wavelengths) from simulations of major galaxymergers with black hole feedback which produce submillimeter bright galaxies(smgs), using a self-consistent three-dimensional radiative transfer code. wereproduce correlations for local agn observed in spitzer space telescope's iracbands, and make definitive predictions for infrared x-ray correlations thatshould be testable by combining observations by spitzer and the upcomingherschel mission with x-ray surveys. our dynamical approach allows us todirectly correlate observed clustering in the data as seen in irac color-colorplots with the relative amount of time the system spends in a region ofcolor-color space. we also find that this clustering is positively correlatedwith the stars dominating in their contribution to the total bolometricluminosity. we present photo albums spanning the lifetime of smgs, from theirinfancy in the pre-merger phase to the final stage as an elliptical galaxy, asseen in the observed $3.6 \micron$ and $450 \micron$ band to visuallyillustrate some of the morphological differences between mergers of differingorbital inclination and progenitor redshift. we find that smgs are a broaderclass of systems than starbursts or quasars. we introduce a simple, heuristicclassification scheme on the basis of the $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm x}$ ratios ofthese galaxies, which may be interpreted qualitatively as an evolutionaryscheme, as these galaxies evolve in $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm x}$ while transitingfrom the pre-merger stage, through the quasar phase, to a merger remnant.

astro-ph;0611792	the co-formation of spheroids and quasars traced in their clustering	we compare observed clustering of quasars and galaxies as a function ofredshift, mass, luminosity, &amp; color/morphology, to constrain models of quasarfueling and spheroid-bh co-evolution. high redshift quasars are shown to bedrawn from progenitors of local early-type galaxies, with the characteristicquasar luminosity l* reflecting a characteristic mass of 'active' bh/hostpopulations at each redshift. evolving observed high-z quasar clustering to z=0predicts a trend of clustering in 'quasar remnants' as a function of stellarmass identical to that observed for early-types. however, quasar clusteringdoes not simply reflect observed early (or late)-type populations; at eachredshift, quasars cluster as an 'intermediate' population. comparing with theage of elliptical stellar populations reveals that this 'intermediate'population represents those ellipticals undergoing or terminating their finalsignificant star formation at each epoch. assuming that quasar triggering isassociated with the formation/termination epoch of ellipticals predicts quasarclustering at all observed redshifts without any model dependence orassumptions about quasar light curves, lifetimes, or accretion rates. this isnot true for disks or quasar halos: i.e. quasars do not generically trace starformation, disks, or halo assembly. quasar clustering at all z is consistentwith a constant halo mass ~4x10^{12} m_sun, similar to local 'group scales.'the observations support a scenario in which major mergers trigger quasaractivity and dominate bright, high-z quasar populations. we show thatmeasurements of quasar clustering versus luminosity at z~1 can be used toconstrain different lower-luminosity agn fueling mechanisms, and that high-zclustering is sensitive to whether or not systems 'shut down' growth at z&gt;3.

astro-ph;0701351	a theoretical interpretation of the black hole fundamental plane	we examine the origin and evolution of correlations between properties ofsupermassive black holes (bhs) and their host galaxies using simulations ofmajor galaxy mergers, including the effects of gas dissipation, cooling, starformation, and bh accretion and feedback. we demonstrate that the simulationspredict the existence of a bh 'fundamental plane' (bhfp), of the form m_bhsigma^(3.0+-0.3)*r_e^(0.43+-0.19) or m_bhm_bulge^(0.54+-0.17)*sigma^(2.2+-0.5), similar to relations foundobservationally. the simulations indicate that the bhfp can be understoodroughly as a tilted intrinsic correlation between bh mass and spheroid bindingenergy, or the condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-drivenoutflow. while changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters,progenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ism gas pressurization, and otherparameters can drive changes in e.g. sigma at fixed m_bulge, and thereforechanges in the m_bh-sigma or m_bh-m_bulge relations, the bhfp is robust. giventhe empirical trend of decreasing r_e for a given m_bulge at high redshift, thebhfp predicts that bhs will be more massive at fixed m_bulge, in good agreementwith recent observations. this evolution in the structural properties of mergerremnants, to smaller r_e and larger sigma (and therefore larger m_bh,conserving the bhfp) at a given m_bulge, is driven by the fact that bulgeprogenitors have characteristically larger gas fractions at high redshifts.adopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with redshift, oursimulations predict the observed trends in both r_e(m_bulge) and m_bh(m_bulge).

astro-ph;0702082	is the dependence of spectral index on luminosity real in optically  selected agn samples?	we critically examine the dependence of spectral index on luminosity inoptically selected agn samples. an analysis of optically selected high-redshiftquasars showed an anti-correlation of $\alpha_{ox}$, the spectral index betweenthe rest-frame 2500 a and 2 kev, with optical luminosity (miyaji et al. 2006).we examine this relationship by means of monte carlo simulations and concludethat a constant spectral index independent of optical luminosity is stillconsistent with this high-z sample. we further find that that contributions oflarge dispersions and narrow range of optical luminosity are most important forthe apparent, yet artificial, $\alpha_{ox} - l_o$ correlation reported. we alsoexamine another, but more complete low-z optical selected agn sub-sample fromsteffen et al. (2006), and our analysis shows that a constant spectral indexindependent of optical luminosity is also consistent with the data. bycomparing x-ray and optical luminosity functions, we find that a luminosityindependent spectral index is in fact more preferred than the luminositydependent spectral index model. we also discuss the selection effects caused byflux limits, which might systematically bias the $l_x - l_o$ relation and causediscrepancy in optically selected and x-ray selected agn samples. to correctlyestablish a dependence of spectral index of agns on their luminosity, a largerand more complete sample is needed and consequences of luminosity dispersionsand selection effects in flux limited samples must be taken into accountproperly.

0809.3789	quasars are not light-bulbs: testing models of quasar lifetimes with the  observed eddington ratio distribution	we use the observed distribution of eddington ratios as a function ofsupermassive black hole (bh) mass to constrain models of agn lifetimes andlightcurves. given the observed agn luminosity function, a model for agnlifetimes (time above a given luminosity) translates directly to a predictededdington ratio distribution. models for self-regulated bh growth, in whichfeedback produces a 'blowout' decay phase after some peak luminosity (shuttingdown accretion) make specific predictions for the lifetimes distinct from thoseexpected if agn are simply gas starved (without feedback) and very differentfrom simple phenomenological 'light bulb' models. present observations of theeddington ratio distribution, spanning 5 decades in eddington ratio, 3 in bhmass, and redshifts z=0-1, agree with the predictions of self-regulated models,and rule out 'light-bulb', pure exponential, and gas starvation models at highsignificance. we compare the eddington ratio distributions at fixed bh mass andfixed luminosity (both are consistent, but the latter are much lessconstraining). we present empirical fits to the lifetime distribution and showhow the eddington ratio distributions place tight limits on agn lifetimes atvarious luminosities. we use this to constrain the shape of the typical agnlightcurve, and provide simple analytic fits. given independent constraints onepisodic lifetimes, most local bhs must have gained their mass in no more thana couple of bright episodes, in agreement with merger-driven fueling models.

0706.1243	a cosmological framework for the co-evolution of quasars, supermassive  black holes, and elliptical galaxies: i. galaxy mergers &amp; quasar activity	(abridged) we develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in theevolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. combining halo massfunctions (mfs) with empirical halo occupation models, we calculate where majorgalaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts.we compare with observed merger mfs, clustering, fractions, and small-scaleenvironments, and show that this yields robust estimates in good agreement withobservations. making the simple ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers causequasar activity, we demonstrate that this naturally reproduces the observedrise and fall of the quasar luminosity density from z=0-6, as well as quasarlfs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshiftand luminosity. the observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales is anatural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regionswith excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. we show that quasar environmentsat all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determinedsmall group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. wecontrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/diskinstabilities, and show that while these modes probably dominate at seyfertluminosities, the constraints from clustering (large and small-scale),pseudobulge populations, disk mfs, luminosity density evolution, and hostgalaxy colors argue that they must be a small contributor to the z&gt;1 quasarluminosity density.

0812.2915	a characteristic division between the fueling of quasars and seyferts:  five simple tests	given the existence of the m_bh-sigma relation, models of self-regulatedblack hole (bh) growth require both a fuel supply and growth of the host bulgeto deepen the potential, or else the system will either starve or self-regulatewithout sustained activity. this suggests that bright quasars must be triggeredin major mergers: a large fraction of the galaxy must be converted to new bulgemass in a dynamical time or less. low-luminosity agn, in contrast, requirelittle bulge growth and small gas supplies, and could be triggered in morecommon non-merger events. this predicts a transition to merger-induced fuelingaround the traditional quasar-seyfert luminosity divide (growth of bh massesabove/below 10^7 m_sun). we compile observations to test several predictions ofsuch a division, including: (1) a transition to bulge-dominated hosts. (2) atransition between 'pseudobulges' and 'classical' bulges hosting the remnantbhs: pseudobulges are formed in secular processes and minor mergers, whereasclassical bulges are relics of major mergers. (3) an increase in the amplitudeof small-scale clustering where mergers are more efficient. (4) differentredshift evolution, with gas-rich merger rates rising to redshifts z&gt;2 whilesecular processes are relatively constant in time. (5) an increasing prominenceof post-starburst features in more luminous systems. our compilation ofobservations provides tentative evidence for the predicted division around theseyfert-quasar threshold. we discuss how future observations can improve theseconstraints and break degeneracies between different fueling models.
