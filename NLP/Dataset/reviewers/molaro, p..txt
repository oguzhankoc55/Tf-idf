0903.4174	first stars xii. abundances in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars,and  comparison with the giants	context:the detailed chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor (emp) starsare key guides to understanding the early chemical evolution of the galaxy.most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experiencedinternal mixing later. aims: we aim to compare the results for giants with new,accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 emp turnoff stars.methods:vlt/uves spectra at r ~45,000 and s/n~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) areanalysed with osmarcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrum code to deriveabundances for c, mg, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, co, ni, zn, sr, and ba. results:for ca, ni, sr, and ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sampleof emp giants, at all metallicities. however, our abundances of c, sc, ti, cr,mn and co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. mg and siabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [mg/fe] values are slightly revised),while zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [fe/h] (6 starsonly). conclusions:for c, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have anastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomingsin the analysis. approximate computations of granulation (3d) effects yieldsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is anunlikely explanation, except perhaps for c, cr, and mn. nlte computations forna and al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike thelte results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements aswell. meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data forgalactic chemical evolution models.

0908.4148	metal-rich absorbers at high redshifts: abundance patterns	(abbreviated) from six spectra of high-z qsos, we select eleven metal-rich,z&gt;=z_solar, and optically-thin to the ionizing radiation, n(hi)&lt;10^17 cm^-2,absorption systems ranging between z=1.5 and z=2.9 and revealing lines ofdifferent ions in subsequent ionization stages. the majority of the systems (10from 11) show abundance patterns which relate them to outflows from low andintermediate mass stars. all systems have sub-kpc linear sizes along theline-of-sight with many less than 20 pc. in several systems, silicon isdeficient, presumably due to the depletion onto dust grains in the envelopes ofdust-forming stars and the subsequent gas-dust separation. at any value of[c/h], nitrogen can be either deficient, [n/c]&lt;0, or enhanced, [n/c]&gt;0, whichsupposes that the nitrogen enrichment occurs irregularly. in some cases, thelines of mgii 2796, 2803 appear to be shifted, probably as a result of anenhanced content of heavy isotopes 25mg and 26mg in the absorbing gas relativeto the solar isotopic composition. seven absorbers are characterized by lowmean ionization parameter u, log u&lt;-2.3, among them only one system has aredshift z&gt;2 whereas all others are found at z ~= 1.8. comparing the spacenumber density of metal-rich absorbers with the comoving density ofstar-forming galaxies at z ~= 2, we estimate that the circumgalactic volume ofeach galaxy is populated by 10^7 - 10^8 such absorbers with total mass&lt;=1/100th of the stellar galactic mass. possible effects of high metal contenton the peak values of star-forming and agn activities at z~2 are discussed.

0911.3732	searching for chameleon-like scalar fields with the ammonia method	(abridged) the ammonia method, which has been proposed to explore theelectron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, is applied to nearby dark cloudsin the milky way. this ratio, which is measured in different physicalenvironments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) densities of baryonicmatter is supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalar field models, which predictstrong dependence of both masses and coupling constant on the local matterdensity. high resolution spectral observations of molecular cores in lines ofnh3 (j,k) = (1,1), hc3n j = 2-1, and n2h+ j = 1-0 were performed at three radiotelescopes to measure the radial velocity offsets, deltav = v_rot - v_inv,between the inversion transition of nh3 (1,1) and the rotational transitions ofother molecules with different sensitivities to the parameter dmm = (mu_obs -mu_lab)/mu_lab. the measured values of deltav exhibit a statisticallysignificant velocity offset of 23 +/- 4_stat +/- 3_sys m/s. when interpreted interms of the electron-to-proton mass ratio variation, this infers that dmm =(2.2 +/- 0.4_stat +/- 0.3_sys)x10^{-8}. if only a conservative upper bound isconsidered, then the maximum offset between ammonia and the other molecules is|deltav| &lt;= 30 m/s. this gives the most accurate reference point at z = 0 fordmm: |dmm| &lt;= 3x10^{-8}.

0911.3853	spatial and temporal variations of fundamental constants	spatial and temporal variations in the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu, andin the fine-structure constant, alpha, are predicted in non-standard modelsaimed to explain the nature of dark energy. among them the so-calledchameleon-like scalar field models predict strong dependence of masses andcoupling constants on the local matter density. to explore such models weestimated the parameters delta mu/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab and deltaalpha/alpha = (alpha_obs - alpha_lab)/alpha_lab in two essentially differentenvironments, - terrestrial (high density) and interstellar (low density), -from radio astronomical observations of cold prestellar molecular cores in thedisk of the milky way. we found that delta mu/mu = (22 +/- 4_stat +/-3_sys)x10^{-9}, and |delta alpha/alpha| &lt; 1.1x10^{-7}. if only a conservativeupper limit is considered, then |delta mu/mu| &lt;= 3x10^{-8}. we also reviewedand re-analyzed the available data on the cosmological variation of alphaobtained from fei and feii systems in optical spectra of quasars. we show thatstatistically significant evidence for the changing alpha at the level of10^{-6} has not been provided so far. the most stringent constraint on |deltaalpha/alpha| &lt; 2x10^{-6} was found from the feii system at z = 1.15 towards thebright quasar he0515-4414. the limit of 2x10^{-6} corresponds to the utmostaccuracy which can be reached with available to date optical facilities.

1004.0783	searching for spatial variations of alpha^2/mu in the milky way	(abridged) a procedure is suggested to explore the value of f = alpha^2/mu,where mu = m_e/m_p is the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and alpha is thefine-structure constant. the fundamental physical constants, which are measuredin different physical environments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar)densities of baryonic matter are supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalarfield models, which predict that both masses and coupling constant may dependon the local matter density. the parameter delta f/f = (f_obs - f_lab)/f_labcan be estimated from the radial velocity offset, delta v = v_rot-v_fs, betweenthe low-laying rotational transitions in carbon monoxide 13co and thefine-structure transitions in atomic carbon [ci]. a model-dependent constrainton delta alpha/alpha can be obtained from delta f/f using delta mu/muindependently measured from the ammonia method. currently available radioastronomical datasets provide an upper limit on |delta v| &lt; 110 m/s (1sigma).when interpreted in terms of the spatial variation of f, this gives |delta f/f|&lt; 3.7*10^-{7}. an order of magnitude improvement of this limit will allow us totest independently a non-zero value of delta mu/mu = (2.2 +/- 0.4_stat +/-0.3_sys)*10^{-8} recently found with the ammonia method. taking into accountthat the ammonia method restricts the spatial variation of mu at the level of|delta mu/mu| &lt;= 3*10^{-8} and assuming that delta f/f is the same in theentire interstellar medium, one obtains that the spatial variation of alphadoes not exceed the value |delta alpha/alpha| &lt; 2*10^{-7}. since extragalacticgas clouds have densities similar to those in the interstellar medium, thebound on delta alpha/alpha is also expected to be less than 2*10^{-7} at highredshift if no significant temporal dependence of alpha is present.

1008.1160	searching for chameleon-like scalar fields with the ammonia method. ii.  mapping of cold molecular cores in nh3 and hc3n lines	(abridged) in our previous work we found a statistically significant offsetdelta v = 27 m/s between the radial velocities of the hc3n(2-1) and nh3(1,1)transitions observed in molecular cores from the milky way. this may indicatethat the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, increases by 3x10^{-8}when measured under interstellar conditions with matter densities of more than10 orders of magnitude lower as compared with laboratory (terrestrial)environments. we now map four molecular cores l1498, l1512, l1517, and l1400kselected from our previous sample in order to estimate systematic effects indelta v due to possible velocity gradients. we find that in two cores l1498 andl1512 the nh3(1,1) and hc3n(2-1) transitions closely trace the same materialand show an offset of delta v = 26.9 +/- 1.2_stat +/- 3.0_sys m/s throughoutthe entire clouds. the measured velocity offset, being expressed in terms ofdelta mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab, gives delta mu = (26 +/- 1_stat +/-3_sys)x10^{-9}.

1012.0642	searching for chameleon-like scalar fields	using the 32-m medicina, 45-m nobeyama, and 100-m effelsberg telescopes wefound a statistically significant velocity offset delta v = 27 +/- 3 m/s(1sigma) between the inversion transition in nh3(1,1) and low-j rotationaltransitions in n2h+(1-0) and hc3n(2-1) arising in cold and dense molecularcores in the milky way. systematic shifts of the line centers caused byturbulent motions and velocity gradients, possible non-thermal hyperfinestructure populations, pressure and optical depth effects are shown to be lowerthan or about 1 m/s and thus can be neglected in the total error budget. thereproducibility of delta v at the same facility (effelsberg telescope) on ayear-to-year basis is found to be very good. since the frequencies of theinversion and rotational transitions have different sensitivities to variationsin mu = m_e/m_p, the revealed non-zero delta v may imply that mu changes whenmeasured at high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) matter densities aspredicted by chameleon-like scalar field models - candidates to the dark energycarrier. thus we are testing whether scalar field models have chameleon-typeinteractions with ordinary matter. the measured velocity offset corresponds tothe ratio delta mu/mu = (mu_space - mu_lab)/mu_lab of (26 +/- 3)x10^{-9}(1sigma).

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

1102.2967	first measurement of mg isotope abundances at high redshifts and  accurate estimate of delta alpha/alpha	(abridged) we use a high-resolution spectrum of the quasar he0001-2340observed with the uves/vlt to measure mg isotope abundances in the interveningabsorption-line systems at high redshifts. line profiles are preparedaccounting for possible shifts between the individual exposures. due to uniquecomposition of the selected systems - the presence of several transitions ofthe same ion - we can test the local accuracy of the wavelength scalecalibration which is the main source of errors in the sub-pixel line positionmeasurements. in the system at zabs = 0.45 which is probably a fragment of theoutflow caused by sn ia explosion of high-metallicity white dwarf(s) wemeasured velocity shifts of mgii and mgi lines relative to other lines (fei,feii, cai, caii): delta v(mgii) = -0.44 +/- 0.05 km/s and delta v(mgi) = -0.17+/- 0.17$ km/s. this translates into the isotopic ratio 24mg:25mg:26mg = (19+/- 11):(22 +/- 13):(59 +/- 6) with a strong relative overabundance of heavy mgisotopes, (25mg+26mg)/24mg = 4, as compared to the solar ratio 24mg:25mg:26mg =79:10:11, and (25mg+26mg)/24mg = 0.3. at zabs = 1.58, we put a strongconstraint on a putative variation of alpha: delta alpha/alpha = (-1.5 +/-2.6)x10^{-6} which is one of the most stringent limits obtained from opticalspectra of qsos. we reveal that the wavelength calibration in the range above7500 a is subject to systematic wavelength-dependent drifts.

1203.2612	an extremely primitive halo star	the early universe had a chemical composition consisting of hydrogen, heliumand traces of lithium1, almost all other elements were created in stars andsupernovae. the mass fraction, z, of elements more massive than helium, iscalled "metallicity". a number of very metal poor stars have been found some ofwhich, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen andoxygen. for theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of starswith metallicities lower than z=1.5e-5, it has been suggested that low massstars (m&lt;0.8m\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form untilthe interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated tolie in the range 1.5e-8\leqz\leq1.5e-6, although competing theories claimingthe contrary do exist. here we report the chemical composition of a star with avery low z\leq6.9e-7 (4.5e-5 of that of the sun) and a chemical pattern typicalof classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment ofcarbon, nitrogen and oxygen. this shows that low mass stars can be formed atvery low metallicity. lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicityextension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. lithiumdepletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperaturesabove two million k in its history, which points to rather particular formationcondition or internal mixing process, for low z stars.

1206.1298	pre-ms depletion, accretion and primordial 7li	we reconsider the role of pre-main sequence (pre-ms) li depletion on thebasis of new observational and theoretical evidence: i) new observations ofhalpha emissions in young clusters show that mass accretion could be continuingtill the first stages of the ms, ii) theoretical implications fromhelioseismology suggest large overshooting values below the bottom of theconvective envelopes. we argue here that a significant pre-ms 7li destruction,caused by efficient overshoot mixing, could be followed by a matter accretionafter 7li depletion has ceased on ms thus restoring li almost to the pristinevalue. as a test case we show that a halo dwarf of 0.85 msun with an extendedovershooting envelope starting with an initial abundance of a(li) = 2.74 wouldburn li completely, but an accretion rate of the type 1e-8xe^{-t/3e6} msunyr$^{-1}$ would restore li to end with an a(li) = 2.31. a self-regulatingprocess is required to produce similar final values in a range of differentstellar masses to explain the popii spite plateau. however, this frameworkcould explain why open cluster stars have lower li abundances than thepre-solar nebula, the absence of li in the most metal poor dwarfs and a numberof other features which lack of a satisfactory explanation.

1305.1884	the uves large program for testing fundamental physics: i bounds on a  change in alpha towards quasar he 2217-2818	absorption line systems detected in quasar spectra can be used to compare thevalue of the fine-structure constant, {\alpha}, measured today on earth withits value in distant galaxies. in recent years, some evidence has emerged ofsmall temporal and also spatial variations of {\alpha} on cosmological scaleswhich may reach a fractional level of ~ 10 ppm (parts per million). to testthese claims we are conducting a large program with the vlt uves . we areobtaining high-resolution (r ~ 60000 and high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 100)uves spectra calibrated specifically for this purpose. here we analyse thefirst complete quasar spectrum from this program, that of he 2217-2818. weapply the many multiplet method to measure {\alpha} in 5 absorption systemstowards this quasar: zabs = 0.7866, 0.9424, 1.5558, 1.6279 and 1.6919. the mostprecise result is obtained for the absorber at zabs = 1.6919 where 3 fe iitransitions and al ii {\lambda}1670 have high s/n and provide a wide range ofsensitivities to {\alpha}. the absorption profile is complex, with several verynarrow features, and requires 32 velocity components to be fitted to the data.our final result for the relative variation in {\alpha} in this system isdelta{\alpha}/{\alpha} = +1.3 +/- 2.4stat +/- 1.0sys ppm. this is one of thetightest current bounds on {\alpha} variation from an individual absorber. theabsorbers towards quasar he 2217-2818 reveal no evidence for variation in{\alpha} at the 3 ppm precision level (1{\sigma} confidence). if the recentlyreported 10 ppm dipolar variation of {\alpha} across the sky were correct, theexpectation at this sky position is (3.2-5.4) +/-1.7 ppm depending on dipolemodel used . our constraint of delta{\alpha}/{\alpha}=+1.3+/-2.4stat +/-1.0sysppm is not inconsistent with this expectation.

1308.5113	strongly star-forming rotating disks in a complex merging system at z =  4,7 as revealed by alma	we performed a kinematical analysis of the [cii] line emission of the br1202-0725 system at z~4,7 using alma observations. the most prominent sourcesof this system are a quasar and a submillimeter galaxy, separated by aprojected distance of about 24 kpc and characterized by very high sfr, higherthan 1000 msun/yr. however, the alma observations reveal that these galaxiesapparently have undisturbed rotating disks, which is at variance with thecommonly accepted scenario in which strong star formation activity is inducedby a major merger. we also detected faint components which, after spectraldeblending, were spatially resolved from the main qso and smg emissions. therelative velocities and positions of these components are compatible withorbital motions within the gravitational potentials generated by the qso hostgalaxy and the smg, suggesting that they are smaller galaxies in interaction orgas clouds in accretion flows of tidal streams. we did not find any clearspectral evidence for outflows caused by agn or stellar feedback. this suggeststhat the high star formation rates might be induced by interactions or minormergers with these companions, which do not affect the large-scale kinematicsof the disks, however. our kinematical analysis also indicates that the qso andthe smg have similar mdyn, mostly in the form of molecular gas, and that theqso host galaxy and the smg are seen close to face-on with slightly differentdisk inclinations: the qso host galaxy is seen almost face-on (i~15), while thesmg is seen at higher inclinations (i~25). finally, the ratio between the blackhole mass of the qso, obtained from xshooter spectroscopy, and the mdyn of thehost galaxy is similar to value found in very massive local galaxies,suggesting that the evolution of black hole galaxy relations is probably betterstudied with dynamical than with stellar host galaxy masses.

(2010) on a single order and extends the detection ofthe distortions to the whole analyzed region revealing that the precise shapevaries with wavelength. a new data reduction is implemented to deal with ccdpixel inequalities to obtain a wavelength corrected solar spectrum. by usingthis spectrum we provide a new lfc calibrated solar atlas with 400 linepositions in the range of 476-530, and 175 lines in the 534-585 nm range. thenew lfc atlas improves the accuracy of individual lines by a significant factorreaching a mean value of about 10 m/s. the lfc--based solar line wavelengthsare essentially free of major instrumental effects and provide a reference forabsolute solar line positions. we suggest that future lfc observations could beused to trace small radial velocity changes of the whole solar photosphericspectrum in connection with the solar cycle and for direct comparison with thepredicted line positions of 3d radiative hydrodynamical models of the solarphotosphere.

astro-ph;0605056	first stars ix -mixing in extremely metal-poor giants. variation of the  12c/13c, [na/mg] and [al/mg] ratios	extremely metal-poor (emp) stars preserve a fossil record of the compositionof the ism when the galaxy formed. it is crucial, however, to verify whetherinternal mixing has modified their surface. we aim to understand the cnoabundance variations found in some, but not all emp field giants analysedearlier. mixing beyond the first dredge-up of standard models is required, andits origin needs clarification.the 12c/13c ratio is the most robust diagnosticof deep mixing, because it is insensitive to the adopted stellar parameters andshould be uniformly high in near-primordial gas. we have measured 12c and 13cabundances in 35 emp giants from high-quality vlt/uves spectra. correlationswith other abundance data are used to study the depth of mixing.the 12c/13cratio is found to correlate with [c/fe] (and li/h), and clearly anti-correlatewith [n/fe]. evidence for such deep mixing is observed in giants above logl/lsolar = 2.6, brighter than in less metal-poor stars, but matching the bumpin the luminosity function in both cases. three of the mixed stars are alsona-and al-rich, another signature of deep mixing, but signatures of the oncycle are not clearly seen in these stars. extra mixing processes clearly occurin luminous rgb stars. the na-and al-rich giants could be agb stars themselves,but an inhomogeneous early ism or pollution from a binary companion remainpossible alternatives (abridged).

astro-ph;0608112	first stars x. the nature of three unevolved carbon-enhanced metal-poor  stars	from high-resolution vlt/uves spectra (r~43,000), we determine abundances orupper limits for li, c, n, o, and other important elements, as well as 12c/13cisotopic ratio for three carbon enhanced metal poor stars. all three stars have-3.30 &lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= -2.85 and moderate to high cno abundances. cs 22958-042 isone of the most carbon-rich cemp stars known ([c/fe] = +3.2), while cs29528-041 (one of the few n-enhanced metal-poor stars known) is one of the mostnitrogen rich ([n/fe] = +3.0). oxygen is very high in cs 31080-095 ([o/fe] =+2.35) and in cs 22958-042 ([o/fe] = +1.35). all three stars exhibit [sr/fe] &lt;0; ba is not detected in cs 22958-042 ([ba/fe] &lt; -0.53), but it is moderatelyenhanced ([ba/fe] ~ 1) in the other two stars. cs 22958-042 displays one of thelargest sodium overabundances yet found in cemp stars ([na/fe] = +2.8). cs22958-042 has 12c/13c = 9, similar to most other cemp stars without enhancedneutron-capture elements, while 12c/13c &lt;= 40 in cs 31080-095. cs 31080-095 andcs 29528-041 have a(li) ~ 1.7, below the spite plateau, while li is notdetected in cs 22958-042. cs 22958-042 is a cemp-no star, but the other twostars are in no known class of cemp star and thus either constitute a new classor are a link between the cemp-no and cemp-s classes, adding complexity to theabundance patterns for cemp stars. we interpret the abundance patterns in ourstars to imply that current models for the presumed agb binary progenitors lackan extra-mixing process, similar to those apparently operating in rgb stars.

astro-ph;9605039	chemical evolution of dla systems	high redshift dla systems suggest that the relative abundances of elementsmight be roughly solar, although with absolute abundances of more than twoorders of magnitude below solar. the result comes from observations of the[sii/znii] ratio, which is a reliable diagnostic of the true abundance, andfrom dla absorbers with small dust depletion and negligible hii contamination.in particular, in two dla systems nitrogen is detected and at remarkably highlevels (vladilo et al. 1995, molaro et al. 1995, green et al. 1995, kulkarni etal. 1996). here we compare the predictions from chemical evolution models ofgalaxies of different morphological type with the abundances and abundanceratios derived for such systems. we conclude that solar ratios and relativelyhigh nitrogen abundances can be obtained in the framework of a chemicalevolution model assuming short but intense bursts of star formation, which inturn trigger enriched galactic winds, and a primary origin for nitrogen inmassive stars. such a model is the most successful in describing the chemicalabundances of dwarf irregular galaxies and in particular of the peculiar galaxyizw18. thus, solar ratios at very low absolute abundances, if confirmed, seemto favour dwarf galaxies rather than spirals as the progenitors of at leastsome of the dla systems.

astro-ph;9606063	the shape of the ionizing uv background at $z\sim 3.7$ from the metal  absorption systems of q$0000-2619$	spectra of the \ze~$=4.12$ quasar q$0000-2619$ have been obtained in therange $\lambda\lambda = 4880-8115$ \aa~with a resolution of 13 \kms~andsignal--to--noise ratio of $s/n=15-60$ per resolution element. the mode of thedistribution of the doppler parameters for the \lya~lines is $\simeq 25$ \kms.the fraction of lines with $10&lt;b&lt;20$ \kms~is 17\%. the doppler values derivedfrom uncontaminated \lyb~lines are smaller than those obtained from thecorresponding ly$\alpha$ lines, indicating the contribution of non saturated,non resolved components in the \lya~profiles. the integrated uv backgroundestimated from the proximity effect is found to be $j \sim 7 \times 10^{-22}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$~hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. this value is consistent withprevious estimates obtained at a lower $z$, implying no appreciable redshiftevolution of the uvb up to $z=4$. 13 metal systems are identified, five ofwhich previously unknown. the analysis of the associated metal systems suggestsabundances generally below the solar value with an average [c/h] $\sim -0.5$.this value is about one order of magnitude higher than that found inintervening systems at about the same redshift. the analysis of the interveningmetal line systems has revealed in particular the presence of three opticallythin systems with $\log n_{hi}\sim 15$ showing associated civ and siivabsorptions. in order to make the observed column densities consistent with[si/c] ratios lower than 10 times the solar value, it is necessary to assume alarge jump in the spectrum of the ionizing uv background beyond the heii edge($j_{912}/j_{228}\gsim 1000$). this result, if confirmed in other spectra atthe same redshift is suggestive of a possible dominance of a stellar ionizingemissivity over the declining quasar one at $z &gt; 3$.

astro-ph;9709242	lithium in very metal poor thick disk stars	a search for lithium is performed on seven metal poor dwarfs withmetallicities ranging from [fe/h]=-1.5 down to [fe/h]=-3.0 but showingdisk-like kinematics. these stars belong to the metal poor tail of the galacticthick disk and they may be also the result of an accretion event (beers andsommer-larsen 1995). the li 6707.8 a line is present in all the seven dwarfs.the weighted average of the li abundance for the stars is a(li)=2.20 (+/-0.06)and is consistent within the errors with the plateau li abundance ofa(li)=2.24(+/- 0.012) found in genuine halo stars in the same range ofmetallicities (bonifacio and molaro 1997). one of the stars, cs 22182-24, showssomewhat lower li abundance (a(li)=1.6(+/-0.40)) and is a candidate to being ali-poor star. whether this group of stars belongs to the oldest stars in thedisk or to the old population of an external galaxy accreted by the milky way,the present observations provide support to the universality of a pre-galacticli abundance as is observed in the galactic halo stars.

astro-ph;9710025	the $z=0.558$ absorption system towards pks 0118-272: a candidate damped  ly $\alpha$ system at low redshift	we present a spectroscopic and imaging study of the z=0.558 mgii absorptionsystem towards the bl lac pks 0118-272. at the absorber redshift we detectlines of the low ionization species mgi, mgii, caii, tiii, mnii, and feii. thecolumn densities of these species are typical of the interstellar gas in thedisk of the galaxy. by assuming dust-free gas with solar abundances we infern(hi) &gt; 2.5 x 10^19 cm^-2. the high value of this conservative lower limitindicates that the absorber is a damped ly alpha system. we find [ti/fe] =+0.3, in agreement with [ti/fe] measurements in dla absorbers, but [mn/fe] =+0.4, at variance with the values [mn/fe]&lt;0 common to dla systems. the measured[ti/fe] and [mn/fe] ratios match remarkably well the differential depletionpattern of low-density interstellar clouds in the galaxy. unlike high-redshiftdla systems (z&gt;2), the z=0.558 absorber seems to originate in a galaxy that hasalready attained the abundances and dust content of present-day disk galaxies.the analysis of our imaging data lends support to the presence of anintervening galaxy. after careful subtraction of the bl lac image, an object at1.6 arcsec from pks 0118-272 is detected. at the absorber redshift theprojected distance (14 h_50^-1 kpc) and the absolute magnitude (m_r ~ -22.3) ofthis companion are consistent with those found for galaxies associated withlow-redshift dla systems.

astro-ph;9712227	cs 22957-027: a carbon-rich extremely-metal-poor star	we present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of theextremely-metal-poor star cs 22957-027, which beers et al (1992) noted toexhibit a rather strong g-band. for teff = 4839 k, derived from broadbandphotometry, our analysis obtains log g = 2.25, and a very low metallicity of[fe/h]=-3.43 +/- 0.12. the carbon-to-iron ratio is found to be enhanced byabout 2 dex relative to the solar value, similar to the handful of othercarbon-rich metal-deficient stars discussed by norris et al (1997a) and barbuyet al (1997). from the 12c13c (1,0) swan bandhead and 13ch lines the isotoperatio 12c/13c is about 10, indicating a 13c enrichment. nitrogen is also foundto be enhanced by about 1 dex. the s-process elements sr and ba are,surprisingly, found to be under-abundant relative to solar, with [sr/fe]=-0.91and [ba/fe]=-0.93. the star's low luminosity requires that the chemicalenrichment arises from mass transfer from an evolved companion, rather thanself-polluting dredge-up processes. however, the s-process elements sr and baare unusually low, with a solar ratio to one another, at variance with whatfound in the ``classical'' ch stars. finally we note that a feature due to 13chis present in coincidence with the th ii 401.9129 nm resonance line. the blendis of relevance for the nucleo-chronology use of the th ii line in theseextremely metal poor stars, when significant 13c is present.

astro-ph;9807082	nitrogen abundances in damped ly alpha galaxies	nitrogen abundances have been derived in damped ly alpha (dla) galaxies atzabs = 2.309, 2.827 and 3.025 toward the qsos 0100+1300, 1425+6039 and0347-3819 respectively. the behaviour of nitrogen relative to iron-peak andalpha-elements has been investigated by considering all the extant nideterminations for a total of 9 dla galaxies. we have estimated the fraction ofiron locked into dust grains to convert the observed [n/fe] ratios into overall(dust plus gas) relative abundances, [n/fe]corr. the ratios [n/alpha] have beenmostly determined by using sulphur as a tracer of alpha-elements which isunaffected by dust. the [n/fe] and [n/alpha] ratios show high dispersions, ofone order of magnitude or more, which have no equivalent in otherelement-to-element ratios in dlas. the lowest values of the [n/fe]corr and[n/alpha] ratios are at variance with the values measured in galactic halostars of similar metallicity suggesting that part of the dla galaxies do notfollow the chemical evolution of the milky way. the dla nitrogen abundances andtheir dispersion show some similarities with those observed in dwarf galaxies.the behaviour of nitrogen abundance ratios can be ascribed, in general to thedelayed release of nitrogen in the course of evolution. however it is difficultto conciliate this interpretation with the lowest [n/alpha] values measured,since an expected enhancement of alpha-elements respect to the iron-peakelements is not observed simultaneously in these dla galaxies. in two cases,relatively high [n/alpha] values are observed which require also a more complexchemical evolution to be explained.

astro-ph;9906057	abundances of metal-weak thick-disc candidates	high resolution spectra of 5 candidate metal-weak thick-disc stars suggestedby beers &amp; sommer-larsen (1995) are analyzed to determine their chemicalabundances. the low abundance of all the objects has been confirmed withmetallicity reaching [fe/h]=-2.9. however, for three objects, the astrometricdata from the hipparcos catalogue suggests they are true halo members. theremaining two, for which proper-motion data are not available, may havedisc-like kinematics. it is therefore clear that it is useful to addressproperties of putative metal-weak thick-disc stars only if they possess fullkinematic data. for cs 22894-19 the abundance pattern similar to those oftypical halo stars is found, suggesting that chemical composition is not auseful discriminant between thick-disc and halo stars. cs 29529-12 is found tobe c enhanced with [c/fe]=+1.0; other chemical peculiarities involve the sprocess elements: [sr/fe]=-0.65 and [ba/fe]=+0.62, leading to a high [ba/sr]considerably larger than what is found in more metal-rich carbon-rich stars,but similar to lp 706-7 and lp 625-44 discussed by norris et al (1997a).hipparcos data have been used to calculate the space velocities of 25 candidatemetal-weak thick-disc stars, thus allowing us to identify 3 bona fide members,which support the existence of a metal-poor tail of the thick-disc, at variancewith a claim to the contrary by ryan &amp; lambert (1995).
