hep-ph;9910214	preheating of the nonminimally coupled inflaton field	we investigate preheating of an inflaton field $\phi$ coupled nonminimally toa spacetime curvature. in the case of a self-coupling inflaton potential$v(\phi)=\lambda \phi^4/4$, the dynamics of preheating changes by the effect ofthe negative $\xi$. we find that the nonminimal coupling works in two ways.  first, since the initial value of inflaton field for reheating becomessmaller with the increase of $|\xi|$, the evolution of the inflaton quanta isdelayed for fixed $\lambda$. second, the oscillation of the inflaton field ismodified and the nonadiabatic change around $\phi=0$ occurs significantly. thatmakes the resonant band of the fluctuation field wider. especially for strongcoupling regimes $|\xi| \gg 1$, the growth of the inflaton flutuation isdominated by the resonance due to the nonminimal coupling, which leads to thesignificant enhancement of low momentum modes. although the final variance ofthe inflaton fluctuation does notchange significantly compared with theminimally coupled case, we have found that the energy transfer from thehomogeneous inflaton to created particles efficiently occurs for $\xi&lt;-60$.

nucl-ex;0405031	study of the sigma-nucleus potential by the (pi^-,k^+) reaction on  medium-to-heavy nuclear targets	in order to study the sigma-nucleus optical potential, we measured inclusive(pi^-,k^+) spectra on medium-to-heavy nuclear targets: ch_2, si, ni, in and bi.the ch_2 target was used to calibrate the excitation energy scale by using theelementary process p + pi^- -&gt; k^+ + sigma^-, where the c spectrum was alsoextracted. the calibration was done with +-0.1 mev precision. the angulardistribution of the elementary cross section was measured, and agreed well withthe previous bubble chamber data, but with better statistics, and themagnitudes of the cross sections of the measured inclusive (pi^-,k^+) spectrawere also well calibrated. all of the inclusive spectra were found to besimilar in shape at a region near to the sigma^- binding energy threshold,showing a weak mass-number dependence on the magnitude of the cross section.the measured spectra were compared with a theoretical calculation performedwithin the framework of the distorted wave impulse approximation (dwia). it hasbeen demonstrated that a strongly repulsive \sig-nucleus potential with anon-zero size of the imaginary part is required to reproduce the shape of themeasured spectra.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0906.2811	a massive star origin for an unusual helium-rich supernova in an  elliptical galaxy	the unusual helium-rich (type ib) supernova sn 2005e is distinguished fromany supernova hitherto observed by its faint and rapidly fading light curve,prominent calcium lines in late-phase spectra and lack of any mark of recentstar formation near the supernova location. these properties are claimed to beexplained by a helium detonation in a thin surface layer of an accreting whitedwarf (perets et al. 2010). here we report on observations of sn 2005czappeared in an elliptical galaxy, whose observed properties resemble those ofsn 2005e in that it is helium-rich and unusually faint, fades rapidly, showsmuch weaker oxygen emission lines than those of calcium in the well-evolvedspectrum. we argue that these properties are best explained by a core-collapsesupernova at the low-mass end ($8-12 m_{\odot}$) of the range of massive starsthat explode (smartt 2009). such a low mass progenitor had lost itshydrogen-rich envelope through binary interaction, having very thin oxygen-richand silicon-rich layers above the collapsing core, thus ejecting a very smallamount of radioactive $^{56}$ni and oxygen. although the host galaxy ngc 4589is an elliptical, some studies have revealed evidence of recent star-formationactivity (zhang et al. 2008), consistent with the core-collapse scenario.

0707.2187	nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae and grb--metal-poor star  connection	we review the nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse supernovae (sne) forvarious stellar masses, explosion energies, and metallicities. comparison withthe abundance patterns of metal-poor stars provides excellent opportunities totest the explosion models and their nucleosynthesis. we show that the abundancepatterns of extremely metal-poor (emp) stars, e.g., the excess of c, co, znrelative to fe, are in better agreement with the yields of hyper-energeticexplosions (hypernovae, hne) rather than normal supernovae.  we note that the variation of the abundance patterns of emp stars are relatedto the diversity of the supernova-grb connection. we summarize the diverseproperties of (1) grb-sne, (2) non-grb hne/sne, (3) xrf-sn, and (4) non-sn grb.in particular, the non-sn grbs (dark hypernovae) have been predicted in orderto explain the origin of c-rich emp stars. we show that these variations andthe connection can be modeled in a unified manner with the explosions inducedby relativistic jets. finally, we examine whether the most luminous supernova2006gy can be consistently explained with the pair-instability supernova model.

1002.2153	nucleosynthesis in two-dimensional delayed detonation models of type ia  supernova explosions	the nucleosynthetic characteristics of various explosion mechanisms of typeia supernovae (sne ia) is explored based on three two-dimensional explosionsimulations representing extreme cases: a pure turbulent deflagration, adelayed detonation following an approximately spherical ignition of the initialdeflagration, and a delayed detonation arising from a highly asymmetricdeflagration ignition. apart from this initial condition, the deflagrationstage is treated in a parameter-free approach. the detonation is initiated whenthe turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. this occurs atdensities around $10^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ -- relatively low as compared to existingnucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models. theburning in these multidimensional models is different from that inone-dimensional simulations as the detonation wave propagates both intounburned material in the high density region near the center of a white dwarfand into the low density region near the surface. thus, the resulting yield isa mixture of different explosive burning products, from carbon-burning productsat low densities to complete silicon-burning products at the highest densities,as well as electron-capture products synthesized at the deflagration stage. incontrast to the deflagration model, the delayed detonations produce acharacteristic layered structure and the yields largely satisfy constraintsfrom galactic chemical evolution. in the asymmetric delayed detonation model,the region filled with electron capture species (e.g., $^{58}$ni, $^{54}$fe) iswithin a shell, showing a large off-set, above the bulk of $^{56}$nidistribution, while species produced by the detonation are distributed morespherically (abridged).

1006.2213	observations of the optical transient in ngc 300 with akari/irc:  possibilities of asymmetric dust formation	we present the results of near-infrared (nir) multi-epoch observations of theoptical transient in the nearby galaxy ngc300 (ngc300-ot) at 398 and 582 daysafter the discovery with the infrared camera (irc) onboard akari. nir spectra(2--5 um) of ngc300-ot were obtained for the first time. they show no prominentemission nor absorption features, but are dominated by continuum thermalemission from the dust around ngc300-ot. nir images were taken in the 2.4, 3.2,and 4.1 um bands. the spectral energy distributions (sed) of ngc300-ot indicatethe dust temperature of 810 (+-14) k at 398 days and 670 (+-12) k at 582 days.we attribute the observed nir emission to the thermal emission from dust grainsformed in the ejecta of ngc300-ot. the multi-epoch observations enable us toestimate the dust optical depth as larger than about 12 at 398 days and largerthan about 6 at 582 days at 2.4 um, by assuming an isothermal dust cloud. theobserved nir emission must be optically thick, unless the amount of dust grainsincreases with time. little extinction at visible wavelengths reported inearlier observations suggests that the dust cloud around ngc300-ot should bedistributed inhomogeneously so as to not screen the radiation from the ejectagas and the central star. the present results suggest the dust grains are notformed in spherically symmetric geometry, but rather in a torus, a bipolaroutflow, or clumpy cloudlets.

1006.5888	an asymmetric explosion as the origin of spectral evolution diversity in  type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae (sne ia) form an observationally uniform class of stellarexplosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates. thisone-parameter behavior allows sne ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standardcandles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating universe. recentinvestigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of sne ia is morecomplicated. theoretically, it has been suggested that the initialthermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of thewhite-dwarf (wd) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before theexplosion. observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of sneia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. here wereport that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions fromwhich an asymmetric explosion is viewed. our findings suggest that the spectralevolution diversity is no longer a concern in using sne ia as cosmologicalstandard candles. furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset fromthe centre of is a generic feature of sne ia.

1101.3935	effects of explosion asymmetry and viewing angle on the type ia  supernova color and luminosity calibration	phenomenological relations exist between the peak luminosity and otherobservables of type ia supernovae (sne~ia), that allow one to standardize theirpeak luminosities. however, several issues are yet to be clarified: sne~ia showcolor variations after the standardization. also, individual sne~ia can showresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\sim0.15$ mag. in this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual arerelated to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\gsim150$ days after maximum light. a sample of 11 sne ia which likely suffer fromlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\sigma$) between the peak$b-v$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. furthermore, a nearlyidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three sne with$b-v \gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. following the interpretation that thelate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from whichan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is adominant factor controlling the sn color and that a large part of the colorvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction. we alsoinvestigate a relation between the peak luminosity residuals and the wavelengthshift in nebular emission lines in a sample of 20 sne. we thereby found a hintof a correlation (at $\sim 1.6 \sigma$ level). the confirmation of this willrequire a future sample of sne with more accurate distance estimates. radiationtransfer simulations for a toy explosion model where different viewing anglescause the late-time emission-line shift are presented, predicting a strongcorrelation between the color and shift, and a weaker one for the luminosityresidual.

1201.3629	discovery of an unidentified fermi object as a black widow-like  millisecond pulsar	the fermi gamma-ray space telescope has revolutionized our knowledge of thegamma-ray pulsar population, leading to the discovery of almost 100 gamma-raypulsars and dozens of gamma-ray millisecond pulsars (msps). although theouter-gap model predicts different sites of emission for the radio andgamma-ray pulsars, until now all of the known gamma-ray msps have been visiblein the radio. here we report the discovery of a "radio-quiet" gamma-rayemitting msp candidate by using fermi, chandra, swift, and opticalobservations. the x-ray and gamma-ray properties of the source are consistentwith known gamma-ray pulsars. we also found a 4.63-hr orbital period in opticaland x-ray data. we suggest that the source is a black widow-like msp with a~0.1 solar-mass late-type companion star. based on the profile of the opticaland x-ray light-curves, the companion star is believed to be heated by thepulsar while the x-ray emissions originate from pulsar magnetosphere and/orfrom intra-binary shock. no radio detection of the source has been reported yetand although no gamma-ray/radio pulsation has been found, we estimated that thespin period of the msp is ~3-5 ms based on the inferred gamma-ray luminosity.

1303.1565	sn 2009js at the crossroads between normal and subluminous type iip  supernovae: optical and mid-infrared evolution	we present a study of sn 2009js in ngc 918. multi-band kanata opticalphotometry covering the first ~120 days show the source to be a type iip sn.reddening is dominated by that due to our galaxy. one-year-post-explosionphotometry with the ntt, and a subaru optical spectrum 16 days post-discovery,both imply a good match with the well-studied subluminous sn 2005cs. theplateau phase luminosity of sn 2009js and its plateau duration are more similarto the intermediate luminosity iip sn 2008in. thus, sn 2009js sharescharacteristics with both subluminous and intermediate luminosity sne. itsradioactive tail luminosity lies between sn 2005cs and sn 2008in, whereas itsquasi-bolometric luminosity decline from peak to plateau (quantified by anewly-defined parameter delta[logl] measuring adiabatic cooling following shockbreakout) is much smaller than both the others. we estimate the ejected mass of56ni to be low (~0.007 msun). the sn explosion energy appears to have beensmall, similar to sn 2005cs. sn 2009js is the first subluminous sn iip to bestudied in the mid-infrared. it was serendipitously caught by spitzer at veryearly times. in addition, it was detected by wise 105 days later with asignificant 4.6 micron flux excess above the photosphere. the infrared excessluminosity relative to the photosphere is clearly smaller than that of sn2004dj extensively studied in the mid-infrared. the excess may be tentativelyassigned to heated dust with mass ~3e-5 msun, or to co fundamental emission asa precursor to dust formation.

1304.2777	gamma-ray diagnostics of type ia supernovae: predictions of observables  from three-dimensional modeling	besides the fact that the gamma-ray emission due to radioactive decays isresponsible for powering the light curves of type ia supernovae (sne ia), gammarays themselves are of particular interest as a diagnostic tool because theyprovide a direct way to obtain deeper insights into the nucleosynthesis and thekinematics of these explosion events. focusing on two of the most broadlydiscussed sn ia progenitor scenarios - a delayed detonation in achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (wd) and a violent merger of two wds - we usethree-dimensional explosion models and perform radiative transfer simulationsto obtain synthetic gamma-ray spectra. both chosen models produce the same massof 56ni and have similar optical properties that are in reasonable agreementwith the recently observed supernova sn 2011fe. in contrast to the opticalregime, the gamma-ray emission of our two chosen models proves to be ratherdifferent. the almost direct connection of the emission of gamma rays tofundamental physical processes occuring in sne ia permits additionalconstraints concerning several explosion model properties that are not easilyaccessible within other wavelength ranges. proposed future mev missions such asgrips will resolve all spectral details only for nearby sne ia, but hardnessratio and light curve measurements still allow for a distinction of the twodifferent models at 10 and 16 mpc for an exposure time of 10^6 s, respectively.the possibility to detect the strongest line features up to the virgo distancewill offer the opportunity to build up a first sample of sn ia detections inthe gamma-ray energy range and underlines the importance of future spaceobservatories for mev gamma rays.

1306.1549	supernova spectra below strong circum-stellar interaction	we construct spectra of supernovae interacting strongly with a circumstellarmedium (csm) by adding sn templates, a black-body continuum and anemission-line spectrum. in a monte carlo simulation we generate more than 800spectra, distribute them to 10 different classifiers and study how thedifferent simulation parameters affect the appearance of the spectra. sne iinshowing some structure over the continuum were characterized as sne iins. wedemonstrate that the flux ratio of the underlying sn to the continuum fv is themost important parameter determining the spectral classification. thermonuclearsne get progressively classified as ia-csm, iins and iin as fv decreases. thetransition between ia-csm and iins occurs at fv~0.2-0.3. it shown that sneia-csm are found at the magnitude range -19.5&gt; m &gt;-21.6, in good agreement withobservations, and that the faintest sn iin that can hide a sn ia has m = -20.1.the sample of sne ia-csm shows an association with 91t-like sne ia. ourexperiment does not support that this association is due to a luminosity bias(91t-like being brighter than normal ia). we therefore conclude that thisassociation has real physical origins and we propose that 91t-like explosionsresult from single degenerate progenitors. despite the similarities between sneibc and sne ia, the number of misclassifications between these types was smalland mostly at low s/n. combined with the luminosity function needed toreproduce the observed sn ia-csm luminosities, it is unlikely that sne ibcconstitute an important contaminant within this sample. we show how type iispectra transition to iin and how the ha profiles vary with fv. sne iin fainterthan m = -17.2 are unable to mask sne iip brighter than m = -15. a simulationincluding radiative transfer shows that our simplified model is a good firstorder approximation. the spectra obtained are in good agreement with real data.

0801.2015	early formation of dust in the ejecta of type ib sn 2006jc and  temperature and mass of the dust	sn 2006jc is a peculiar supernova (sn), in which the formation of dust hasbeen confirmed at an early epoch of ~50 days after the explosion. weinvestigate the possibility of such an earlier formation of dust grains in theexpanding ejecta of sn 2006jc, applying the type ib sn model that is developedto reproduce the observed light curve. we find that the rapid decrease of thegas temperature in sn 2006jc enables the condensation of c grains in the c-richlayer at 40-60 days after the explosion, which is followed by the condensationof silicate and oxide grains until ~200 days. the average radius of each grainspecies is confined to be less than 0.01 micron due to the low gas density atthe condensation time. the calculated total dust mass reaches ~1.5 msun, ofwhich c dust shares 0.7 msun. on the other hand, based on the calculated dusttemperature, we show that the dust species and mass evaluated to reproduce thespectral energy distribution observed by akari and magnum at day 200 aredifferent from those obtained by the dust formation calculations; the dustspecies contributing to the observed flux are hot c and fes grains with massesof $5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ msun and $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ msun, respectively,though we cannot defy the presence of a large amount of cold dust such assilicate and oxide grains up to 0.5 msun. one of the physical processesresponsible for the difference between calculated and evaluated masses of c andfes grains could be considered to be the destruction of small-sized clusters byenergetic photons and electrons prevailing within the ejecta at the earlierepoch.

1307.5581	multiband diagnostics of unidentified 1fgl sources with suzaku and swift  x-ray observations	we have analyzed all the archival x-ray data of 134 unidentified (unid)gammaray sources listed in the first fermi/lat (1fgl) catalog and subsequentlyfollowed up by swift/xrt. we constructed the spectral energy distributions(seds) from radio to gamma-rays for each x-ray source detected, and tried topick up unique objects that display anomalous spectral signatures. in theseanalysis, we target all the 1fgl unid sources, using updated data from thesecond fermi/lat (2fgl) catalog on their lat position and spectra. we foundseveral potentially interesting objects, particularly three sources, 1fglj0022.2-1850, 1fgl j0038.0+1236 and 1fgl j0157.0-5259, which were then moredeeply observed with suzaku as a part of an ao7 program in 2012. wesuccessfully detected an x-ray counterpart for each source whose x-ray spectrawere well fitted by a single power-law function. the positional coincidencewith a bright radio counterpart (currently identified as agn) in the 2fgl errorcircles suggests these are definitely the x-ray emission from the same agn, buttheir seds show a wide variety of behavior. in particular, the sed of 1fglj0038.0+1236 is difficult to be explained by conventional emission models ofblazars. the source 1fgl j0022.2-1850 may be in a transition state between alow-frequency peaked bl lac and a high-frequency peaked bl lac object, and 1fglj0157.0-5259 could be a rare kind of extreme blazar. we discuss the possiblenature of these three sources observed with suzaku, together with the x-rayidentification results and seds of all 134 sources observed with swift/xrt.

1308.0406	properties of newly formed dust grains in the luminous type iin  supernova 2010jl	supernovae (sne) have been proposed to be the main production sites of dustgrains in the universe. our knowledge on their importance to dust productionis, however, limited by observationally poor constraints on the nature andamount of dust particles produced by individual sne. in this paper, we presenta spectrum covering optical through near-infrared (nir) light of the luminoustype iin supernova (sn iin) 2010jl around one and half years after theexplosion. this unique data set reveals multiple signatures of newly formeddust particles. the nir portion of the spectrum provides a rare example wherethermal emission from newly formed hot dust grains is clearly detected. wedetermine the main population of the dust species to be carbon grains at atemperature of ~1,350 - 1,450k at this epoch. the mass of the dust grains isderived to be ~(7.5 - 8.5) x 10^{-4} msun. hydrogen emission lines showwavelength-dependent absorption, which provides a good estimate on the typicalsize of the newly formed dust grains (~0.1 micron, and most likely &lt;~0.01micron). we attribute the dust grains to have been formed in a dense coolingshell as a result of a strong sn-circumstellar media (csm) interaction. thedust grains occupy ~10% of the emitting volume, suggesting an inhomogeneous,clumpy structure. the average csm density is required to be &gt;~3 x 10^{7}cm^{-3}, corresponding to a mass loss rate of &gt;~0.02 msun yr^{-1} (for a massloss wind velocity of ~100 km s^{-1}). this strongly supports a scenario thatsn 2010jl and probably other luminous sne iin are powered by stronginteractions within very dense csm, perhaps created by luminous blue variable(lbv)-like eruptions within the last century before the explosion.

1401.2991	interaction between the broad-lined type ic supernova 2012ap and  carriers of diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are absorption features observed inoptical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated withcarbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. however, because thecentral wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronictransitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remaineduncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. here we report onunusually strong dibs in optical spectra of the broad-lined type ic supernovasn 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)timescales. the 4428 and 6283 angstrom dib features get weaker with time,whereas the 5780 angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. these nonuniformchanges suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of thedibs and that the dib carriers possess high ionization potentials, such assmall cations or charged fullerenes. we conclude that moderate-resolutionspectra of supernovae with dib absorptions obtained within weeks of outburstcould reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of theirprogenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of dibcarriers.

1504.06668	type iib supernova 2013df entering into an interaction phase: a link  between the progenitor and the mass loss	we report the late-time evolution of type iib supernova (sn iib) 2013df. sn2013df showed a dramatic change in its spectral features at ~1 year after theexplosion. early on it showed typical characteristics shared by sne iib/ib/icdominated by metal emission lines, while later on it was dominated by broad andflat-topped halpha and he i emissions. the late-time spectra are strikinglysimilar to sn iib 1993j, which is the only previous example clearly showing thesame transition. this late-time evolution is fully explained by a change in theenergy input from the $^{56}$co decay to the interaction between the sn ejectaand dense circumstellar matter (csm). the mass loss rate is derived to be ~(5.4+- 3.2) x 10^{-5} msun/yr (for the wind velocity of ~20 km/s), similar to sn1993j but larger than sn iib 2011dh by an order of magnitude. the strikingsimilarity between sne 2013df and 1993j in the (candidate) progenitors and thecsm environments, and the contrast in these natures to sn 2011dh, infer thatthere is a link between the natures of the progenitor and the mass loss: sneiib with a more extended progenitor have experienced a much stronger mass lossin the final centuries toward the explosion. it might indicate that sne iibfrom a more extended progenitor are the explosions during a strong binaryinteraction phase, while those from a less extended progenitor have a delaybetween the strong binary interaction and the explosion.

astro-ph;0105127	hypernova nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution	we study nucleosynthesis in 'hypernovae', i.e., supernovae with very largeexplosion energies ($ \gsim 10^{52} $ ergs) for both spherical and asphericalexplosions. the hypernova yields compared to those of ordinary core-collapsesupernovae show the following characteristics: 1) complete si-burning takesplace in more extended region, so that the mass ratio between the complete andincomplete si burning regions is generally larger in hypernovae than normalsupernovae. as a result, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(zn,co)/fe], small [(mn, cr)/fe], and larger [fe/o], which could explain the trendobserved in very metal-poor stars. 2) si-burning takes place in lower densityregions, so that the effects of $\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced. thus$^{44}$ca, $^{48}$ti, and $^{64}$zn are produced more abundantly than in normalsupernovae. the large [(ti, zn)/fe] ratios observed in very metal poor starsstrongly suggest a significant contribution of hypernovae. 3) oxygen burningalso takes place in more extended regions for the larger explosion energy. thena larger amount of si, s, ar, and ca ("si") are synthesized, which makes the"si"/o ratio larger. the abundance pattern of the starburst galaxy m82 may beattributed to hypernova explosions. asphericity in the explosions strengthensthe nucleosynthesis properties of hypernovae except for "si"/o. we thus suggestthat hypernovae make important contribution to the early galactic (and cosmic)chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0109244	formation of the black hole in nova scorpii	israelian et al. (1999) showed that the stellar companion of the black-holebinary nova sco is polluted with material ejected in the supernova thataccompanied the formation of the black-hole primary. here we systematicallyinvestigate the implications of these observations for the black-hole formationprocess. using a variety of supernova models, including both standard as wellas hypernova models (for different helium-star masses, explosion energies, andexplosion geometries) and a simple model for the evolution of the binary andthe pollution of the secondary, we show that most of the observed abundanceanomalies can be explained for a large range of model parameters (apart fromthe abundance of ti). the best models are obtained for he star masses of 10 to16 msun, where spherical hypernova models are generally favoured over standardsupernova ones. aspherical hypernova models also produce acceptable fits,provided there is extensive lateral mixing. all models require substantialfallback and that the fallback material either reached the orbit of thesecondary or was mixed efficiently with material that escaped. the black holetherefore formed in a two-step process, where the initial mass of the collapsedremnant was increased substantially by matter that fell back after the initialcollapse. this may help to explain the high observed space velocity of nova scoeither because of a neutrino-induced kick (if a neutron star was formed first)or by asymmetric mass ejection in an asymmetric supernova explosion.

astro-ph;0208470	early-phase spectra of "hypernova" sn 2002ap	the spectral evolution of the peculiar sn ic 2002ap during the first 40 daysis presented. the spectra display very broad absorption features, which aretypical of "hypernovae". the maximum expansion velocity measured on theearliest spectra exceeds 3 times 10^4 km s^{-1}. the spectrum of sn 2002ap atthe epoch of maximum brightness resembles that of sn 1997ef more than that ofsn 1998bw. the spectral evolution of sn 2002ap proceeds at about 1.5 times therate of sn 1997ef. the parameterized supernova spectrum synthesis code synowwas used to perform line identification and deduce velocity information fromthe early-phase spectra, which are heavily affected by line blending. thephotospheric velocity, as deduced from the fitting results and from theblueshift of the \ion{si}{2} lambda 6355 absorption minimum, is lower than inpreviously studied hypernovae. at advanced epochs, the \ion{si}{2} lambda 6355absorption minimum becomes difficult to distinguish. this may be caused by thegrowth of [\ion{o}{1}] lambda lambda 6300, 6364 emission. together with therapid spectral evolution, this suggests that sn 2002ap should enter the nebularphase sooner than previously studied hypernovae.

astro-ph;0304172	bipolar supernova explosions: nucleosynthesis &amp; implication on  abundances in extremely metal-poor stars	hydrodynamics and explosive nucleosynthesis in bipolar supernova explosionsare examined to account for some peculiar properties of hypernovae as well aspeculiar abundance patterns of metal-poor stars. the explosion is supposed tobe driven by bipolar jets which are powered by accretion onto a centralremnant. we explore the features of the explosions with varying progenitors'masses and jet properties. the outcomes are different from conventionalspherical models. (1) in the bipolar models, fe-rich materials are ejected athigh velocities along the jet axis, while o-rich materials occupy the centralregion whose density becomes very high as a consequence of continuous accretionfrom the side. this configuration can explain some peculiar features in thelight curves and the nebular spectra of hypernovae. (2) production of $^{56}$nitends to be smaller than in spherical thermal bomb models. to account for alarge amount of $^{56}$ni observed in hypernovae, the jets should be initiatedwhen the compact remnant mass is still smaller than $2-3\msun$, or the jetsshould be very massive and slow. (3) ejected isotopes are distributed asfollows in order of decreasing velocities: $^{64}$zn, $^{59}$co, $^{56}$fe,$^{44}$ti, and $^{4}$he at the highest velocities, $^{55}$mn, $^{52}$cr,$^{32}$s, and $^{28}$si at the intermediate velocities, and $^{24}$mg, $^{16}$oat the lowest velocities. (4) the abundance ratios (zn, co)/fe are enhancedwhile the ratios (mn, cr)/fe are suppressed. this can account for the abundancepattern of extremely metal-poor stars. these agreements between the models andobservations suggest that hypernovae are driven by bipolar jets and havesignificantly contributed to the early galactic chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0305182	a two-component model for the light curves of hypernovae	the light curves of 'hypernovae', i.e. very energetic supernovae with $e_{51}\equiv e/10^{51}$ergs $\gsim 5-10$ are characterized at epochs of a few monthsby a phase of linear decline. classical, one-dimensional explosion models failto simultaneously reproduce the light curve near peak and at the linear declinephase. the evolution of these light curves may however be explained by a simplemodel consisting of two concentric components. the outer component isresponsible for the early part of the light curve and for the broad absorptionfeatures observed in the early spectra of hypernovae, similar to theone-dimensional models. in addition, a very dense inner component is added,which reproduces the linear decline phase in the observed magnitude-versus-timerelation for sne 1998bw, 1997ef, and 2002ap. this simple approach does containone of the main features of jet-driven, asymmetric explosion models, namely thepresence of a dense core. although the total masses and energies derived withthe two-component model are similar to those obtained in previous studies whichalso adopted spherical symmetry, this study suggests that the ejecta areaspherical, and thus the real energies and masses may deviate from thosederived assuming spherical symmetry. the supernovae which were modeled aredivided into two groups, according to the prominence of the inner component:the inner component of sn 1997ef is denser and more $^{56}$ni-rich, relative tothe outer component, than the corresponding inner components of sne 1998bw and2002ap. these latter objects have a similar inner-to-outer component ratio,although they have very different global values of mass and energy.

astro-ph;0411566	high velocity features in the spectra of the type ia sn 1999ee: a  property of the explosion or evidence of circumstellar interaction?	the near-maximum spectra of the type ia sn 1999ee are reviewed. two narrowabsorption features corresponding to the strongest component of the caii irtriplet appear in the spectra from 7 days before to 2 days after b-bandmaximum, at a high velocity (~22,000 km/s). before these features emerge, thecaii ir triplet has an anomalously high velocity, indicating that the narrowfeatures were still blended with the main, photospheric component.high-velocity caii absorption has been observed in other sne ia, but usuallydetached from the photospheric component. furthermore, the siii 6355a line isobserved at a comparably high velocity (~20,000 km/s) 9 and 7 days before bmaximum, but then it suddenly shifts to much lower velocities. syntheticspectra are used to reproduce the data under various scenarios. an abundanceenhancement requires an outer region dominated by si and ca, the origin ofwhich is not easy to explain in terms of nuclear burning. a density enhancementleads to a good reproduction of the spectral evolution if a mass of ~0.10 msunis added at velocities between 16,000 and 28,000 km/s, and it may result from aperturbation, possibly angular, of the explosion. an improved match to the caiiir triplet at the earliest epoch can be obtained if the outermost part of thismodified density profile is assumed to be dominated by h (~0.004 msun above24,000 km/s). line broadening is then the result of increased electronscattering. this h may be the result of interaction between the ejecta andcircumstellar material.

astro-ph;0511389	optical emission from aspherical supernovae and the hypernova sn 1998bw	a fully 3d monte carlo scheme is applied to compute optical bolometric lightcurves for aspherical (jet-like) supernova explosion models. density andabundance distributions are taken from hydrodynamic explosion models, with theenergy varied as a parameter to explore the dependence. our models showinitially a very large degree ($\sim 4$ depending on model parameters) ofboosting luminosity toward the polar ($z$) direction relative to the equatorial($r$) plane, which decreases as the time of peak is approached. after the peak,the factor of the luminosity boost remains almost constant ($\sim 1.2$) untilthe supernova enters the nebular phase. this behavior is due mostly to theaspherical $^{56}$ni distribution in the earlier phase and to the disk-likeinner low-velocity structure in the later phase. also the aspherical modelsyield an earlier peak date than the spherical models, especially if viewed fromnear the z-axis. aspherical models with ejecta mass $\sim 10\msun$ areexamined, and one with the kinetic energy of the expansion $\sim 2 \pm 0.5\times 10^{52}$ ergs and a mass of $^{56}$ni $\sim 0.4\msun$ yields a lightcurve in agreement with the observed light curve of sn 1998bw (the prototypicalhyper-energetic supernova). the aspherical model is also at least qualitativelyconsistent with evolution of photospheric velocities, showing large velocitiesnear the z-axis, and with a late-phase nebular spectrum. the viewing angle isclose to the z-axis, strengthening the case for the association of sn 1998bwwith the gamma ray burst grb980425.

astro-ph;0511480	three dimensional simulation of gamma ray emission from asymmetric  supernovae and hypernovae	hard x- and $\gamma$-ray spectra and light curves resulting from radioactivedecays are computed for aspherical (jet-like) and energetic supernova models(representing a prototypical hypernova sn 1998bw), using a 3d energy- andtime-dependent monte carlo scheme. the emission is characterized by (1) earlyemergence of high energy emission, (2) large line-to-continuum ratio, and (3)large cut-off energy by photoelectric absorptions in hard x-ray energies. thesethree properties are not sensitively dependent on the observer's direction. onthe other hand, fluxes and line profiles depend sensitively on the observer'sdirection, showing larger luminosity and larger degree of blueshift for anobserver closer to the polar ($z$) direction. strategies to derive the degreeof asphericity and the observer's direction from (future) observations aresuggested on the basis of these features, and an estimate on detectability ofthe high energy emission by the {\it integral} and future observatories ispresented. also presented is examination on applicability of a gray effective$\gamma$-ray opacity for computing the energy deposition rate in the asphericalsn ejecta. the 3d detailed computations show that the effective $\gamma$-rayopacity $\kappa_{\gamma} \sim 0.025 - 0.027$ cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$ reproduces thedetailed energy-dependent transport for both spherical and aspherical(jet-like) geometry.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

astro-ph;0702472	diversity of the supernova - gamma-ray burst connection	the connection between the long gamma ray bursts (grbs) and type icsupernovae (sne) has revealed interesting diversity. we review the followingtypes of the grb-sn connection. (1) grb-sne: the three sne all explode withenergies much larger than those of typical sne, thus being called hypernovae(hne). they are massive enough for forming black holes. (2) non-grb hne/sne:some hne are not associated with grbs. (3) xrf-sn: sn 2006aj associated withx-ray flash 060218 is dimmer than grb-sne and has very weak oxygen lines. itsprogenitor mass is estimated to be small enough to form a neutron star ratherthan a black hole. (4) non-sn grb: two nearby long grbs were not associatedsne. such ``dark hne'' have been predicted in this talk (i.e., just before thediscoveries) in order to explain the origin of c-rich (hyper) metal-poor stars.this would be an important confirmation of the hypernova-first star connection.we will show our attempt to explain the diversity in a unified manner with thejet-induced explosion model.

0812.1448	origin and nature of dust in the early universe	we present recent advances in theoretical studies of the formation andevolution of dust in primordial supernovae (sne) that are considered to be themain sources of dust in the early universe. being combined with the results ofcalculations of dust formation in the ejecta of population iii sne, theinvestigations of the evolution of newly formed dust within supernova remnants(snrs) show that smaller grains are predominantly destroyed by sputtering inthe shocked gas, while larger grains are injected into the ambient medium. themass of dust grains surviving the destruction in snrs reaches up to 0.1--15$m_\odot$, which is high enough to account for the content of dust observed forthe host galaxies of quasars at $z &gt; 5$. in addition, the transport of dustformed in the ejecta causes the formation of low-mass stars in the dense shellof primordial snrs and affects the elemental composition of those stars. wealso show that the flat extinction curve is expected in the high-redshiftuniverse where sne are the possible sources of dust.
