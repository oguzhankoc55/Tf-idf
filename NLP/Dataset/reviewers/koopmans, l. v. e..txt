0902.3186	strong gravitational lensing as a probe of gravity, dark-matter and  super-massive black holes	whereas considerable effort has been afforded in understanding the propertiesof galaxies, a full physical picture, connecting their baryonic and dark-mattercontent, super-massive black holes, and (metric) theories of gravity, is stillill-defined. strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probegravity in the central regions of galaxies. it can (1) provide a uniquedetection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detectionexperiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe centralsuper-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxyformation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of thenature and state of dark matter. to seriously address the above questions, aconsiderable increase in the number of strong gravitational-lens systems isrequired. in the timeframe 2010-2020, a staged approach with radio (e.g. evla,e-merlin, lofar, ska phase-i) and optical (e.g. lsst and jdem) instruments canprovide 10^(2-4) new lenses, and up to 10^(4-6) new lens systems fromska/lsst/jdem all-sky surveys around ~2020. follow-up imaging of (radio) lensesis necessary with moderate ground/space-based optical-ir telescopes and with30-50m telescopes for spectroscopy (e.g. tmt, gmt, elt). to answer thesefundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investmentin large radio and optical-ir facilities is therefore critical in the comingdecade. in particular, only large-scale radio lens surveys (e.g. with ska)provide the large numbers of high-resolution and high-fidelity images of lensesneeded for smbh and flux-ratio anomaly studies.

0903.4752	statistics of mass substructure from strong gravitational lensing:  quantifying the mass fraction and mass function	a bayesian statistical formalism is developed to quantify the level at whichthe mass function slope (alpha) and the projected cumulative mass fraction (f)of (cdm) substructure in strong gravitational-lens galaxies, with arcs oreinstein rings, can be recovered as function of the lens-survey parameters andthe detection threshold of the substructure mass. the method is applied todifferent sets of mock data to explore a range of observational limits: (i) thenumber of lens galaxies in the survey, (ii) the mass threshold, mlow, for thedetection of substructures and (iii) the uncertainty of the measuredsubstructure masses. we explore two different priors on the mass functionslope: a uniform prior and a gaussian prior with alpha = 1.90+-0.1. with asubstructure detection threshold mlow=3x10^8 msun, the number of lensesavailable now (n_l=30), a true dark-matter mass fraction in (cdm) substructure&lt;=1.0% and a prior of alpha = 1.90+-0.1, we find that the upper limit of f canbe constrained down to a level &lt;=1.0% (95% cl). in the case of a gaussian prioron alpha, it is always possible to set stringent constraints on bothparameters. we also find that lowering the detection threshold has the largestimpact on the ability to recover alpha, because of the (expected) steepmass-function slope. in the future, thanks to new surveys with telescopes, suchas ska, lsst and jdem and follow-up telescopes with high-fidelity data, asignificant increase in the number of known lenses will allow us to recover thesatellite population in its completeness. for example, a sample of 200 lenses,equivalent in data-quality to the sloan lens acs survey and a detectionthreshold of 10^8 msun, allows one to determine f=0.5+-0.1% (68% cl) andalpha=1.90+-0.2 (68% cl).

0904.0404	foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line: i. first  westerbork measurements of galactic emission at 150 mhz in a low latitude  field	we present the first results from a series of observations conducted with thewesterbork telescope in the 140--160 mhz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimedat characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionizationexperiments. for the first time we have detected fluctuations in the galacticdiffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 mhz, in the lowgalactic latitude area known as fan region. those fluctuations have an $rms$ of14 k. the total intensity power spectrum shows a power--law behaviour down to$\ell \sim 900$ with slope $\beta^i_\ell = -2.2 \pm 0.3$. the detection ofdiffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual pointsources. we measured an $rms$ confusion noise of $\sim$3 mjy beam$^{-1}$.diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at thisfrequency. the polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially andalong the line of sight. the polarization power spectrum shows a power--lawbehaviour down to $\ell \sim 2700$ with slope $\beta^p_\ell = -1.65 \pm 0.15$.the $rms$ of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 k on 4 arcmin scales. byextrapolating the measured spectrum of total intensity emission, we find acontamination on the cosmological signal of $\delta t= \sqrt{\ell (\ell+1)c^i_\ell / 2\pi} \sim 5.7$ k on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding $rms$ valueof $\sim$18.3 k at the same angular scale. the level of the polarization powerspectrum is $\delta t \sim 3.3$ k on 5 arcmin scales. given its exceptionallybright polarized signal, the fan region is likely to represent an upper limiton the sky brightness at moderate and high galactic latitude.

0906.1349	the structure &amp; dynamics of massive early-type galaxies: on homology,  isothermality and isotropy inside one effective radius	based on 58 slacs strong-lens early-type galaxies with direct total-mass andstellar-velocity dispersion measurements, we find that inside one effectiveradius massive elliptical galaxies with m_eff &gt;= 3x10^10 m_sun arewell-approximated by a power-law ellipsoid with an average logaritmic densityslope of &lt;gamma'_ld&gt; = -dlog(rho_tot)/dlog(r)=2.085^{+0.025}_{-0.018} (randomerror on mean) for isotropic orbits with beta_r=0, +-0.1 (syst.) andsigma_gamma' &lt;= 0.20^{+0.04}_{-0.02} intrinsic scatter (all errors indicate the68 percent cl). we find no correlation of gamma'_ld with galaxy mass (m_eff),rescaled radius (i.e. r_einst/r_eff) or redshift, despite intrinsic differencesin density-slope between galaxies. based on scaling relations, the averagelogarithmic density slope can be derived in an alternative manner, fullyindependent from dynamics, yielding &lt;gamma'_sr&gt;=1.959 +- 0.077. agreementbetween the two values is reached for &lt;beta_r&gt; =0.45 +- 0.25, consistent withmild radial anisotropy. this agreement supports the robustness of our results,despite the increase in mass-to-light ratio with total galaxy mass: m_eff ~l_{v,eff}^(1.363+-0.056). we conclude that massive early-type galaxies arestructurally close-to homologous with close-to isothermal total densityprofiles (&lt;=10 percent intrinsic scatter) and have at most some mild radialanisotropy. our results provide new observational limits on galaxy formationand evolution scenarios, covering four gyr look-back time.

0909.4301	galaxy number counts and implications for strong lensing	we compare galaxy number counts in hst/acs fields containingmoderate-redshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0) strong gravitational lenses with those in twocontrol samples: (1) the first square degree of the cosmos survey, comprising259 acs fields and (2) 20 "pure parallel" fields randomly located on the sky.through a bayesian analysis we determine the expectation values (mu_0) andconfidence levels of the underlying number counts for a range of apertures andmagnitude bins. our analysis has produced the following results: (i) we inferthat our control samples are not consistent, with the number counts in thecosmos sample being significantly higher than in the pure parallel sample for21 &lt;= f814w &lt;= 23. this result matches those found in previous analyses ofcosmos data using different techniques. (ii) we find that small-size apertures,centered on strong lenses, are overdense compared with randomly placedapertures in the control samples, even compared to the cosmos sample.correcting for the local clustering of elliptical galaxies, based on theaverage two-point correlation function reduces this overdensity to the 1-2sigma level. thus, the overdensity of galaxies seen along a typical line ofsight to a lens can be explained mostly by the natural clustering of galaxies,rather than being due to lenses lying along otherwise biased lines of sight.however, a larger sample of lenses is needed to see if the remaining biaspersists when the lens-field uncertainties are smaller. (iii) there isconsiderable scatter in the lines of sight to _individual_ lens systems, butquantities that are linearly dependent on the external convergence (e.g., h_0)should become unbiased if the extra galaxies that cause the bias can beaccounted for in the lens models either through direct modeling or via aninformed prior on the external convergence. the number counts can used to setsuch an informed prior.

0910.0760	detection of a dark substructure through gravitational imaging	we report the detection of a dark substructure through direct gravitationalimaging - undetected in the hst-acs f814w image - in the gravitational lensgalaxy of slacs sdssj0946+1006 (the "double einstein ring"). the detection isbased on a bayesian grid reconstruction of the two-dimensional surface densityof the galaxy inside an annulus around its einstein radius (few kpc). [...] weconfirm this detection by modeling the system including a parametric mass modelwith a tidally truncated pseudo-jaffe density profile; in that case thesubstructure mass is m_sub=(3.51+-0.15)x10^9 msun, located at(-0.651+-0.038,1.040+-0.034)'', precisely where also the surface density mapshows a strong convergence peak. [...] we set a lower limit of (m/l)_v}&gt;=120(msun/l}_v,sun (3-sigma) inside a sphere of 0.3 kpc centred on the substructure(r_tidal=1.1kpc). the result is robust under substantial changes in the modeland the data-set (e.g. psf, pixel number and scale, source and potentialregularization, rotations and galaxy subtraction). despite being at the limitsof detectability, it can therefore not be attributed to obvious systematiceffects. our detection implies a dark matter mass fraction at the radius of theinner einstein ring of f_cdm=2.15^{+2.05}_{-1.25} percent (68 percent c.l) inthe mass range 4x10^6 msun to 4x10^9 msun assuming alpha=1.9+-0.1 (with dn/dm ~m^-alpha). assuming a flat prior on alpha, between 1.0 and 3.0, increases thisto f_cdm=2.56^{+3.26}_{-1.50} percent (68 percent c.l). the likelihood ratio is0.51 between our best value (f_cdm=0.0215) and that from simulations(f_sim=0.003). hence the inferred mass fraction, admittedly based on a singlelens system, is large but still consistent with predictions.

0910.1133	the mass distribution of a moderate redshift galaxy group and brightest  group galaxy from gravitational lensing and kinematics	the gravitational lens system class b2108+213 has two radio-loud lensedimages separated by 4.56 arcsec. the relatively large image separation impliesthat the lensing is caused by a group of galaxies. in this paper, new opticalimaging and spectroscopic data for the lensing galaxies of b2108+213 and thesurrounding field galaxies are presented. these data are used to investigatethe mass and composition of the lensing structure. the redshift and stellarvelocity dispersion of the main lensing galaxy (g1) are found to be z = 0.3648+/- 0.0002 and sigma_v = 325 +/- 25 km/s, respectively. the optical spectrum ofthe lensed quasar shows no obvious emission or absorption features and isconsistent with a bl lac type radio source. however, the tentative detection ofthe g-band and mg-b absorption lines, and a break in the spectrum of the hostgalaxy of the lensed quasar gives a likely source redshift of z = 0.67.spectroscopy of the field around b2108+213 finds 51 galaxies at a similarredshift to g1, thus confirming that there is a much larger structure at z ~0.365 associated with this system. the width of the group velocity distributionis 694 +/- 93 km/s, but is non-gaussian, implying that the structure is not yetviralized. the main lensing galaxy is also the brightest group member and has asurface brightness profile consistent with a typical cd galaxy. a lensing anddynamics analysis of the mass distribution, which also includes the newly foundgroup members, finds that the logarithmic slope of the mass density profile ison average isothermal inside the einstein radius, but steeper at the locationof the einstein radius. this apparent change in slope can be accounted for ifan external convergence gradient, representing the underlying parent halo ofthe galaxy group, is included in the mass model.

0910.1213	radio counterpart of the lensed sub-mm emission in the cluster  ms0451.6-0305: new evidence for the merger scenario	smm j04542-0301 is an extended (~1 arcmin) sub-mm source located near thecore of the cluster ms0451.6-0305. it has been suggested that part of itsemission arises from the interaction between a lbg and two eros at z~2.9 thatare multiply-imaged. however, the dramatic resolution difference between thesub-mm map and the optical/nir images make it difficult to confirm thishypothesis. in this paper, we present a deep (~ 10 microjy/beam), highresolution (~2 arcsec) 1.4 ghz radio map of the cluster core, in which we haveidentified 6 sources located within smm j04542-0301. the strong lensing effectin the radio data has been quantified by constructing a new lens model of thecluster. the brightest and most extended of these sources (rj) is located inthe middle of the sub-mm emission, and has no obvious counterpart in theoptical/nir. three other detections (e1, e2 and e3) seem to be associated withthe images of one of the eros. the last two detections (cr1 and cr2), for whichno optical/nir counterpart have been found, seem to constitute two relativelycompact emitting regions embedded in a ~5 arcsec extended radio source locatedat the position of the sub-mm peak. the presence of this extended component canonly be explained if it is being produced by a lensed region of dust obscuredstar formation in the center of the merger. a comparison between the radio andsub-mm data at the same resolution suggests that e1, e2, e3, cr1 and cr2 areassociated with the sub-mm emission. the radio observations provide strongobservational evidence in favor of the merger hypothesis. however, the questionif rj is also contributing to the observed sub-mm emission remains open. theseresults illustrate the promising prospects for radio interferometry and stronggravitational lensing to study the internal structure of smgs.

0910.2773	dissecting the gravitational lens b1608+656. ii. precision measurements  of the hubble constant, spatial curvature, and the dark energy equation of  state	strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between themultiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to thelens, and thus the hubble constant. we present a bayesian analysis of thestrong gravitational lens system b1608+656, incorporating (i) new, deep hubblespace telescope (hst) observations, (ii) a new velocity dispersion measurementof 260+/-15 km/s for the primary lens galaxy, and (iii) an updated study of thelens' environment. when modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lensgalaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitlyinclude the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma' and theexternal convergence kappa_ext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigningwell-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors intostatistical ones. the hst images provide one such prior, constraining the lensmass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma'=2.08+/-0.03; a combinationof numerical simulations and photometric observations of the b1608+656 fieldprovides an estimate of the prior for kappa_ext: 0.10 +0.08/-0.05. this latterdistribution dominates the final uncertainty on h_0. compared with previouswork on this system, the new data provide an increase in precision of more thana factor of two. in combination with the wmap 5-year data set, we find that theb1608+656 data set constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 &lt; omega_k &lt;0.009 (95% cl), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the currenttype ia sne sample. asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, incombination with wmap, h_0 = 69.7 +4.9/-5.0 km/s/mpc and w=-0.94 +0.17/-0.19(68% cl), suggesting that the observations of b1608+656 constrain w as tightlyas do the current baryon acoustic oscillation data.

0911.3392	the initial mass function of early-type galaxies	we determine an absolute calibration of the initial mass function (imf) ofearly-type galaxies, by studying a sample of 56 gravitational lenses identifiedby the slacs survey. under the assumption of standard navarro, frenk &amp; whitedark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar populationsynthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark mattercontribution for each lens. we define an "imf mismatch" parameter\alpha=m*(l+d)/m*(sps) as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensingand dynamical models (m*(l+d)) to the current stellar mass inferred fromstellar populations synthesis models (m*(sps)). we find that a salpeter imfprovides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing anddynamical models (&lt;\log \alpha&gt;=0.00+-0.03+-0.02), while a chabrier imfunderestimates them (&lt;\log \alpha&gt;=0.25+-0.03+-0.02). a tentative trend isfound, in the sense that \alpha appears to increase with galaxy velocitydispersion. taken at face value, this result would imply a non universal imf,perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellarpopulations. alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal darkmatter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion.while the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken withoutadditional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannothave both a universal imf and universal dark matter halos.

1005.1898	ionospheric power-spectrum tomography in radio interferometry	a tomographic method is described to quantify the three-dimensionalpower-spectrum of the ionospheric electron-density fluctuations based onradio-interferometric observations by a two-dimensional planar array. themethod is valid to first-order born approximation and might be applicable tocorrect observed visibilities for phase variations due to the imprint of thefull three-dimensional ionosphere. it is shown that not the ionosphericelectron density distribution is the primary structure to model ininterferometry, but its autocorrelation function or equivalent itspower-spectrum. an exact mathematical expression is derived that provides thethree dimensional power-spectrum of the ionospheric electron-densityfluctuations directly from a rescaled scattered intensity field and an incidentintensity field convolved with a complex unit phasor that depends on the w-termand is defined on the full sky pupil plane. in the limit of a small field ofview, the method reduces to the single phase screen approximation. tomographicself-calibration can become important in high-dynamic range observations at lowradio frequencies with wide-field antenna interferometers, because athree-dimensional ionosphere causes a spatially varying convolution of the sky,whereas a single phase screen results in a spatially invariant convolution. athick ionosphere can therefore not be approximated by a single phase screenwithout introducing errors in the calibration process. by applying a radonprojection and the fourier projection-slice theorem, it is shown that thephase-screen approach in three dimensions is identical to the tomographicmethod. finally we suggest that residual speckle can cause a diffuse intensityhalo around sources, due to uncorrectable ionospheric phase fluctuations in theshort integrations, which could pose a fundamental limit on the dynamic rangein long-integration images.

1007.2409	dark matter contraction and the stellar content of massive early-type  galaxies: disfavoring "light" initial mass functions	we use stellar dynamics, strong lensing, stellar population synthesis models,and weak lensing shear measurements to constrain the dark matter (dm) profileand stellar mass in a sample of 53 massive early-type galaxies. we explorethree dm halo models (unperturbed navarro frenk &amp; white [nfw] halos and theadiabatic contraction models of blumenthal and gnedin) and impose a model forthe relationship between the stellar and virial mass (i.e., a relationship forthe star-formation efficiency as a function of halo mass). we show that, givenour model assumptions, the data clearly prefer a salpeter-like initial massfunction (imf) over a lighter imf (e.g., chabrier or kroupa), irrespective ofthe choice of dm halo. in addition, we find that the data prefer at most amoderate amount of adiabatic contraction (blumenthal adiabatic contraction isstrongly disfavored) and are only consistent with no adiabatic contraction(i.e., a nfw halo) if a mass-dependent imf is assumed, in the sense of a moremassive normalization of the imf for more massive halos.

1011.6604	a method for efficient measurement of gravitational lens time delays	the hubble constant value is currently known to 10% accuracy unlessassumptions are made for the cosmology (sandage et al. 2006). gravitationallens systems provide another probe of the hubble constant using time delaymeasurements. however, current investigations of ~20 time delay lenses, albeitof varying levels of sophistication, have resulted in different values of thehubble constant ranging from 50-80 km/s/mpc. in order to reduce uncertainties,more time delay measurements are essential together with better determined massmodels (oguri 2007, saha et al. 2006). we propose a more efficient techniquefor measuring time delays which does not require regular monitoring with ahigh-resolution interferometer array. the method uses double image andlong-axis quadruple lens systems in which the brighter component varies firstand dominates the total flux density. monitoring the total flux density withlow-resolution but high sensitivity radio telescopes provides the variation ofthe brighter image and is used to trigger high-resolution observations whichcan then be used to see the variation in the fainter image. we presentsimulations of this method together with a pilot project using the wsrt(westerbork radio synthesis telescope) to trigger vla (very large array)observations. this new method is promising for measuring time delays because ituses relatively small amounts of time on high-resolution telescopes. this willbe important because many ska pathfinder telescopes, such as meerkat (karooarray telescope) and askap (australian square kilometre array pathfinder), havehigh sensitivity but limited resolution.

1012.1722	radio interferometric calibration using the sage algorithm	the aim of the new generation of radio synthesis arrays such as lofar and skais to achieve much higher sensitivity, resolution and frequency coverage thanwhat is available now, especially at low frequencies. to accomplish this goal,the accuracy of the calibration techniques used is of considerable importance.moreover, since these telescopes produce huge amounts of data, speed ofconvergence of calibration is a major bottleneck. the errors in calibration aredue to system noise (sky and instrumental) as well as the estimation errorsintroduced by the calibration technique itself, which we call solver noise. wedefine solver noise as the distance between the optimal solution (the truevalue of the unknowns, uncorrupted by the system noise) and the solutionobtained by calibration. we present the space alternating generalizedexpectation maximization (sage) calibration technique, which is a modificationof the expectation maximization algorithm, and compare its performance with thetraditional least squares calibration based on the level of solver noiseintroduced by each technique. for this purpose, we develop statistical methodsthat use the calibrated solutions to estimate the level of solver noise. thesage calibration algorithm yields very promising results both in terms ofaccuracy and speed of convergence. the comparison approaches we adopt introducea new framework for assessing the performance of different calibration schemes.

1104.1577	observing pulsars and fast transients with lofar	low frequency radio waves, while challenging to observe, are a rich source ofinformation about pulsars. the low frequency array (lofar) is a new radiointerferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric "radiowindow": 10-240mhz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radiofrequencies. through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexibledigital hardware, it is expected that lofar will revolutionize radio astronomyat the lowest frequencies visible from earth. lofar is a next-generation radiotelescope and a pathfinder to the square kilometre array (ska), in that itincorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individualelements. we discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations ingeneral and the potential of lofar in addressing these science goals. wepresent lofar as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations ofpulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observingmodes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implementedto facilitate these observations. a number of results obtained fromcommissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potentialof the telescope. this paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsarobservations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcomingpulsar/fast transient science papers with lofar.

1104.5663	the swells survey. i. a large spectroscopically selected sample of  edge-on late-type lens galaxies	the relative contribution of baryons and dark matter to the inner regions ofspiral galaxies provides critical clues to their formation and evolution, butit is generally difficult to determine. for spiral galaxies that are stronggravitational lenses, however, the combination of lensing and kinematicobservations can be used to break the disk-halo degeneracy. in turn, such dataconstrain fundamental parameters such as i) the mass density profile slope andaxis ratio of the dark matter halo, and by comparison with dark matter-onlynumerical simulations the modifications imposed by baryons; ii) the mass instars and therefore the overall star formation efficiency, and the amount offeedback; iii) by comparison with stellar population synthesis models, thenormalization of the stellar initial mass function. in this first paper of aseries, we present a sample of 16 secure, 1 probable, and 6 possible stronglensing spiral galaxies, for which multi-band high-resolution images androtation curves were obtained using the hubble space telescope and keck-iitelescope as part of the sloan wfc edge-on late-type lens survey (swells). thesample includes 8 newly discovered secure systems. [abridged] we find that theswells sample of secure lenses spans a broad range of morphologies (fromlenticular to late-type spiral), spectral types (quantified by halphaemission), and bulge to total stellar mass ratio (0.22-0.85), while beinglimited to m_*&gt;10^{10.5} m_sun. the swells sample is thus well-suited forexploring the relationship between dark and luminous matter in a broad range ofgalaxies. we find that the deflector galaxies obey the same size-mass relationas that of a comparison sample of elongated non-lens galaxies selected from thesdss survey. we conclude that the swells sample is consistent with beingrepresentative of the overall population of high-mass high-inclination diskygalaxies.

1201.3643	gravitational detection of a low-mass dark satellite at cosmological  distance	the mass-function of dwarf satellite galaxies that are observed around localgroup galaxies substantially differs from simulations based on cold darkmatter: the simulations predict many more dwarf galaxies than are seen. thelocal group, however, may be anomalous in this regard. a massive dark satellitein an early-type lens galaxy at z = 0.222 was recently found using a new methodbased on gravitational lensing, suggesting that the mass fraction contained insubstructure could be higher than is predicted from simulations. the lack ofvery low mass detections, however, prohibited any constraint on their massfunction. here we report the presence of a 1.9 +/- 0.1 x 10^8 m_sun darksatellite in the einstein-ring system jvas b1938+666 at z = 0.881, where m_sundenotes solar mass. this satellite galaxy has a mass similar to the sagittariusgalaxy, which is a satellite of the milky way. we determine the logarithmicslope of the mass function for substructure beyond the local universe to bealpha = 1.1^+0.6_-0.4, with an average mass-fraction of f = 3.3^+3.6_-1.8 %, bycombining data on both of these recently discovered galaxies. our results areconsistent with the predictions from cold dark matter simulations at the 95 percent confidence level, and therefore agree with the view that galaxies formedhierarchically in a universe composed of cold dark matter.

1205.3449	imaging neutral hydrogen on large-scales during the epoch of  reionization with lofar	the first generation of redshifted 21 cm detection experiments, carried outwith arrays like lofar, mwa and gmrt, will have a very low signal-to-noiseratio per resolution element (\sim 0.2). in addition, whereas the variance ofthe cosmological signal decreases on scales larger than the typical size ofionization bubbles, the variance of the formidable galactic foregroundsincreases, making it hard to disentangle the two on such large scales. the poorsensitivity on small scales on the one hand, and the foregrounds effect onlarge scales on the other hand, make direct imaging of the epoch ofreionization of the universe very difficult, and detection of the signaltherefore is expected to be statistical.despite these hurdles, in this paper weargue that for many reionization scenarios low resolution images could beobtained from the expected data. this is because at the later stages of theprocess one still finds very large pockets of neutral regions in the igm,reflecting the clustering of the large-scale structure, which stays strong upto scales of \sim 120 comoving mpc/h (\sim 1 degree). the coherence of theemission on those scales allows us to reach sufficient s/n (\sim 3) so as toobtain reionization 21 cm images. such images will be extremely valuable foranswering many cosmological questions but above all they will be a verypowerful tool to test our control of the systematics in the data. the existenceof this typical scale (\sim 120 comoving mpc/h) also argues for designingfuture eor experiments, e.g., with ska, with a field of view of at least 4degree.

1206.4310	the swells survey - v. a salpeter stellar initial mass function in the  bulges of massive spiral galaxies	recent work has suggested that the stellar initial mass function (imf) is notuniversal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocitydispersion, or morphological type. in this paper, we investigate variations ofthe imf within individual galaxies. for this purpose, we use strong lensing andgas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the imf of thebulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies withsubstantial bulge components taken from the swells survey. we find that thestellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematicdata. a comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis modelsfitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a salpeter-likenormalisation of the imf. conversely, the disk masses are less well constraineddue to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with milkyway type imfs in agreement with previous studies. the disks are submaximal at2.2 disk scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxiesare baryon dominated at 2.2 disk scale lengths. globally, our inferred imfnormalisation is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies ofcomparable stellar mass (&gt; 10^11 m_sun). our results suggest a non-universalimf within the different components of spiral galaxies, adding to thewell-known differences in stellar populations between disks and bulges.

1208.6010	two accurate time-delay distances from strong lensing: implications for  cosmology	strong gravitational lenses with measured time delays between the multipleimages and models of the lens mass distribution allow a one-step determinationof the time-delay distance, and thus a measure of cosmological parameters. wepresent a blind analysis of the gravitational lens rxj1131-1231 incorporating(1) the newly measured time delays from cosmograil, (2) archival hst imaging ofthe lens system, (3) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of the lens galaxyof 323+/-20km/s based on keck spectroscopy, and (4) a characterization of theline-of-sight structures via observations of the lens' environment and raytracing through the millennium simulation. our blind analysis is designed toprevent experimenter bias. the joint analysis of the data sets allows atime-delay distance measurement to 6% precision that takes into account allknown systematic uncertainties. in combination with the wmap7 data set in flatwcdm cosmology, our unblinded cosmological constraints for rxj1131-1231 are:h_0=80.0+5.8/-5.7km/s/mpc, omegade=0.79+/-0.03 and w=-1.25+0.17/-0.21. we findthe results to be statistically consistent with those from the analysis of thegravitational lens b1608+656. the joint constraints from the two lenses andwmap7 are h_0=75.2+4.4/-4.2km/s/mpc, omegade=0.76+0.02/-0.03 andw=-1.14+0.17/-0.20 in flat wcdm, and h_0=73.1+2.4/-3.6km/s/mpc,omegal=0.75+0.01/-0.02 and omegak=0.003+0.005/-0.006 in open lcdm. time-delaylenses constrain especially tightly the hubble constant (5.7% and 4.0%respectively in wcdm and open lcdm) and curvature of the universe. theycomplement well other cosmological probes, and provide an independent check ofunknown systematics. our measurement of the hubble constant is completelyindependent of those based on the local distance ladder method, providing animportant consistency check of the standard cosmological model and of generalrelativity.

1209.2615	prospects for detecting the 21cm forest from the diffuse intergalactic  medium with lofar	we discuss the feasibility of the detection of the 21cm forest in the diffuseigm with the radio telescope lofar. the optical depth to the 21cm line has beenderived using simulations of reionization which include detailed radiativetransfer of ionizing photons. we find that the spectra from reionization modelswith similar total comoving hydrogen ionizing emissivity but differentfrequency distribution look remarkably similar. thus, unless the reionizationhistories are very different from each other (e.g. a predominance of uv vs.x-ray heating) we do not expect to distinguish them by means of observations ofthe 21cm forest. because the presence of a strong x-ray background would makethe detection of 21cm line absorption impossible, the lack of absorption couldbe used as a probe of the presence/intensity of the x-ray background and thethermal history of the universe. along a random line of sight lofar coulddetect a global suppression of the spectrum from z&gt;12, when the igm is stillmostly neutral and cold, in contrast with the more well-defined, albeit broad,absorption features visible at lower redshift. sharp, strong absorptionfeatures associated with rare, high density pockets of gas could be detectedalso at z~7 along preferential lines of sight.

1209.4769	the scale of the problem : recovering images of reionization with gmca	the accurate and precise removal of 21-cm foregrounds from epoch ofreionization redshifted 21-cm emission data is essential if we are to gaininsight into an unexplored cosmological era. we apply a non-parametrictechnique, generalized morphological component analysis or gmca, to simulatedlofar-eor data and show that it has the ability to clean the foregrounds withhigh accuracy. we recover the 21-cm 1d, 2d and 3d power spectra with highaccuracy across an impressive range of frequencies and scales. we show thatgmca preserves the 21-cm phase information, especially when the smallestspatial scale data is discarded. while it has been shown that lofar-eor imagerecovery is theoretically possible using image smoothing, we add that waveletdecomposition is an efficient way of recovering 21-cm signal maps to the sameor greater order of accuracy with more flexibility. by comparing the gmcaoutput residual maps (equal to the noise, 21-cm signal and any foregroundfitting errors) with the 21-cm maps at one frequency and discarding the smallerwavelet scale information, we find a correlation coefficient of 0.689, comparedto 0.588 for the equivalently smoothed image. considering only the central 50%of the maps, these coefficients improve to 0.905 and 0.605 respectively and weconclude that wavelet decomposition is a significantly more powerful method todenoise reconstructed 21-cm maps than smoothing.

1209.5727	lofar insights into the epoch of reionization from the cross power  spectrum of 21cm emission and galaxies	using a combination of n-body simulations, semi-analytic models and radiativetransfer calculations, we have estimated the theoretical cross power spectrumbetween galaxies and the 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epochof reionization. in accordance with previous studies, we find that the 21cmemission is initially correlated with halos on large scales (&gt; 30 mpc),anti-correlated on intermediate (~ 5 mpc), and uncorrelated on small (&lt; 3 mpc)scales. this picture quickly changes as reionization proceeds and the twofields become anti-correlated on large scales. the normalization of the crosspower spectrum can be used to set constraints on the average neutral fractionin the intergalactic medium and its shape can be a tool to study the topologyof reionization. when we apply a drop-out technique to select galaxies and addto the 21cm signal the noise expected from the lofar telescope, we find thatwhile the normalization of the cross power spectrum remains a useful tool forprobing reionization, its shape becomes too noisy to be informative. on theother hand, for a lyalpha emitter (lae) survey both the normalization and theshape of the cross power spectrum are suitable probes of reionization. a closerlook at a specific planned lae observing program using subaru hyper-suprime camreveals concerns about the strength of the 21cm signal at the plannedredshifts. if the ionized fraction at z ~ 7 is lower that the one estimatedhere, then using the cross power spectrum may be a useful exercise given thatat higher redshifts and neutral fractions it is able to distinguish between twotoy models with different topologies.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

0712.1145	probing a massive radio galaxy with gravitational lensing	the gravitational lens system class b2108+213 has two lensed images separatedby 4.56 arcsec. such a wide image separation suggests that the lens is either amassive galaxy, or is composed of a group of galaxies. to investigate thestructure of the lensing potential we have carried out new high resolutionimaging of the two lensed images at 1.7 ghz with the vlba and at 5 ghz withglobal vlbi. compact and extended emission is detected from the two lensedimages, which provides additional constraints to the lensing mass model. wefind that the data are consistent with either a single lensing galaxy, or a twogalaxy lens model that takes account of a nearby companion to the main lensinggalaxy within the einstein radius of the system. however, for an ensemble ofglobal power-law mass models, those with density profiles steeper thanisothermal are a better fit. the best-fitting profile for a single sphericalmass model has a slope of $\gamma=$~2.45$_{-0.18}^{+0.19}$. the system also hasa third radio component which is coincident with the main lensing galaxy. thiscomponent is detected at milli-arcsecond scales for the first time by the 1.7ghz vlba and 5 ghz global vlbi imaging. however, the third radio component isfound not to be consistent with a core lensed image because the radio spectrumdiffers from the two lensed images, and its flux-density is too high whencompared to what is expected from simple mass models with a variable power-lawdensity profile and/or a reasonable core radius. furthermore, 1.4 ghz imagingof the system with the merlin finds extended lobe emission on either side ofthe main lensing galaxy. therefore, the radio emission from the third radiocomponent is almost certainly from an agn within the main lensing galaxy, whichis classified as an fr i type radio source.

1303.5627	probing reionization with lofar using 21-cm redshift space distortions	one of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (eor) isthrough radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutralhydrogen. these observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping ofredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities ofthe gas. such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properlyunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale $n$-body and radiative transfersimulations. we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrumby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionizationprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. we go on to study theeffects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations, taking instrumentnoise and foreground subtraction into account. we find that lofar should beable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift spacedistortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$1000 hours of integration time. at larger scales, sample errors become alimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds makethe extraction of the signal problematic. finally, we show how theastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations, and how it canbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

1306.1272	dark energy with gravitational lens time delays	strong lensing gravitational time delays are a powerful and cost effectiveprobe of dark energy. recent studies have shown that a single lens can providea distance measurement with 6-7 % accuracy (including random and systematicuncertainties), provided sufficient data are available to determine the timedelay and reconstruct the gravitational potential of the deflector.gravitational-time delays are a low redshift (z~0-2) probe and thus allow oneto break degeneracies in the interpretation of data from higher-redshift probeslike the cosmic microwave background in terms of the dark energy equation ofstate. current studies are limited by the size of the sample of known lensedquasars, but this situation is about to change. even in this decade, wide fieldimaging surveys are likely to discover thousands of lensed quasars, enablingthe targeted study of ~100 of these systems and resulting in substantial gainsin the dark energy figure of merit. in the next decade, a further order ofmagnitude improvement will be possible with the 10000 systems expected to bedetected and measured with lsst and euclid. to fully exploit these gains, weidentify three priorities. first, support for the development of softwarerequired for the analysis of the data. second, in this decade, small robotictelescopes (1-4m in diameter) dedicated to monitoring of lensed quasars willtransform the field by delivering accurate time delays for ~100 systems. third,in the 2020's, lsst will deliver 1000's of time delays; the bottleneck willinstead be the aquisition and analysis of high resolution imaging follow-up.thus, the top priority for the next decade is to support fast high resolutionimaging capabilities, such as those enabled by the james webb space telescopeand next generation adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes.

1306.2172	chromatic effects in the 21 cm global signal from the cosmic dawn	the redshifted 21 cm brightness distribution from neutral hydrogen is apromising probe into the cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn, and re-ionization.lofar's low band antennas (lba) may be used in the frequency range 45 mhz to 85mhz (30&gt;z&gt;16) to measure the sky averaged redshifted 21 cm brightnesstemperature as a function of frequency, or equivalently, cosmic redshift. theselow frequencies are affected by strong galactic foreground emission that isobserved through frequency dependent ionospheric and antenna beam distortionswhich lead to chromatic mixing of spatial structure into spectral structure.using simple models, we show that (i) the additional antenna temperature due toionospheric refraction and absorption are at a \sim 1% level--- 2 to 3 ordersof magnitude higher than the expected 21 cm signal, and have an approximate\nu^{-2} dependence, (ii) ionospheric refraction leads to a knee-likemodulation on the sky spectrum at \nu\approx 4\times plasma frequency. usingmore realistic simulations, we show that in the measured sky spectrum, morethan 50% of the 21 cm signal variance can be lost to confusion from foregroundsand chromatic effects. we conclude that foregrounds and chromatic mixing maynot be subtracted as generic functions of frequency as previously thought, butmust rather be carefully modeled using additional priors and interferometricmeasurements.

1306.4732	cosmology from gravitational lens time delays and planck data	under the assumption of a flat lambda-cdm cosmology, recent data from theplanck satellite point toward a hubble constant that is in tension with thatmeasured by gravitational lens time delays and by the local distance ladder.prosaically, this difference could arise from unknown systematic uncertaintiesin some of the measurements. more interestingly -- if systematics were ruledout -- resolving the tension would require a departure from the flat lambda-cdmcosmology, introducing for example a modest amount of spatial curvature, or anon-trivial dark energy equation of state. to begin to address these issues, wepresent here an analysis of the gravitational lens rxj1131-1231 that isimproved in one particular regard: we examine the issue of systematic errorintroduced by an assumed lens model density profile. we use more flexiblegravitational lens models with baryonic and dark matter components, and findthat the exquisite hubble space telescope image with thousands of intensitypixels in the einstein ring and the stellar velocity dispersion of the lenscontain sufficient information to constrain these more flexible models. thetotal uncertainty on the time-delay distance is 6.6% for a single system. weproceed to combine our improved time-delay distance measurements with the wmap9and planck posteriors. in an open lambda-cdm model, the data for rxj1131-1231in combination with planck favor a flat universe with omega_k = 0.00+0.01/-0.02(68% ci). in a flat wcdm model, the combination of rxj1131-1231 and planckyields w = -1.52+0.19/-0.20 (68% ci).

1307.5580	the brightness and spatial distributions of terrestrial radio sources	faint undetected sources of radio-frequency interference (rfi) might becomevisible in long radio observations when they are consistently present overtime. thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomicalsignals of interest. this issue is especially important for epoch ofreionisation (eor) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted hi signalsfrom the time of the earliest structures in the universe. we explore the rfisituation at 30-163 mhz by studying brightness histograms of visibility dataobserved with lofar, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used incosmology. an empirical rfi distribution model is derived that allows thesimulation of rfi in radio observations. the brightness histograms show an rfidistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponentaround -1.5. with several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniformdistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existingpropagation models. extrapolation of the power law implies that the currentlofar eor observations should be severely rfi limited if the strength of rfisources remains strong after time integration. this is in contrast with actualobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to belimited by rfi. therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there areundetected rfi sources that will become visible in long observations.consequently, there is no indication that rfi will prevent an eor detectionwith lofar.

1308.2804	studying galactic interstellar turbulence through fluctuations in  synchrotron emission: first lofar galactic foreground detection	the characteristic outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of the random toordered components of the magnetic field are key parameters to characterisemagnetic turbulence in the interstellar gas, which affects the propagation ofcosmic rays within the galaxy. we provide new constraints to those twoparameters. we use the low frequency array (lofar) to image the diffusecontinuum emission in the fan region at (l,b) (137.0,+7.0) at 80"x70"resolution in the range [146,174] mhz. we detect multi-scale fluctuations inthe galactic synchrotron emission and compute their power spectrum. applyingtheoretical estimates and derivations from the literature for the first time,we derive the outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of random to orderedmagnetic field from the characteristics of these fluctuations . we obtain thedeepest image of the fan region to date and find diffuse continuum emissionwithin the primary beam. the power spectrum of the foreground synchrotronfluctuations displays a power law behaviour for scales between 100 and 8 arcminwith a slope of (-1.84+/-0.19). we find an upper limit of about 20 pc for theouter scale of the magnetic interstellar turbulence toward the fan region. wealso find a variation of the ratio of random to ordered field as a function ofgalactic coordinates, supporting different turbulent regimes. we use powerspectra fluctuations from lofar as well as earlier gmrt and wsrt observationsto constrain the outer scale of turbulence of the galactic synchrotronforeground, finding a range of plausible values of 10-20 pc. then, we use thisinformation to deduce lower limits of the ratio of ordered to random magneticfield strength. these are found to be 0.3, 0.3, and 0.5 for the lofar, wsrt andgmrt fields considered respectively. both these constraints are in agreementwith previous estimates.

1403.4986	measuring gravitational lens time delays using low-resolution radio  monitoring observations	obtaining lensing time delay measurements requires long-term monitoringcampaigns with a high enough resolution (&lt; 1 arcsec) to separate the multipleimages. in the radio, a limited number of high-resolution interferometer arraysmake these observations difficult to schedule. to overcome this problem, wepropose a technique for measuring gravitational time delays which relies onmonitoring the total flux density with low-resolution but high-sensitivityradio telescopes to follow the variation of the brighter image. this is thenused to trigger high-resolution observations in optimal numbers which thenreveal the variation in the fainter image. we present simulations to assess theefficiency of this method together with a pilot project observing radio lenssystems with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) to trigger verylarge array (vla) observations. this new method is promising for measuring timedelays because it uses relatively small amounts of time on high-resolutiontelescopes. this will be important because instruments that have highsensitivity but limited resolution, together with an optimum usage of followuphigh-resolution observations from appropriate radio telescopes may in thefuture be useful for gravitational lensing time delay measurements by means ofthis new method.

1405.3666	inference of the cold dark matter substructure mass function at z=0.2  using strong gravitational lenses	we present the results of a search for galaxy substructures in a sample of 11gravitational lens galaxies from the sloan lens acs survey. we find nosignificant detection of mass clumps, except for a luminous satellite in thesystem sdss j0956+5110. we use these non-detections, in combination with aprevious detection in the system sdss j0946+1006, to derive constraints on thesubstructure mass function in massive early-type host galaxies with an averageredshift z ~ 0.2 and an average velocity dispersion of 270 km/s. we perform abayesian inference on the substructure mass function, within a median region ofabout 32 kpc squared around the einstein radius (~4.2 kpc). we infer a meanprojected substructure mass fraction $f = 0.0076^{+0.0208}_{-0.0052}$ at the 68percent confidence level and a substructure mass function slope $\alpha$ &lt; 2.93at the 95 percent confidence level for a uniform prior probability density onalpha. for a gaussian prior based on cold dark matter (cdm) simulations, weinfer $f = 0 .0064^{+0.0080}_{-0.0042}$ and a slope of $\alpha$ =1.90$^{+0.098}_{-0.098}$ at the 68 percent confidence level. since only onesubstructure was detected in the full sample, we have little information on themass function slope, which is therefore poorly constrained (i.e. the bayesfactor shows no positive preference for any of the two models).the inferredfraction is consistent with the expectations from cdm simulations and withinference from flux ratio anomalies at the 68 percent confidence level.

1407.2093	initial lofar observations of epoch of reionization windows: ii. diffuse  polarized emission in the elais-n1 field	this study aims to characterise the polarized foreground emission in theelais-n1 field and to address its possible implications for the extraction ofthe cosmological 21-cm signal from the low-frequency array - epoch ofreionization (lofar-eor) data. we use the high band antennas of lofar to imagethis region and rm-synthesis to unravel structures of polarized emission athigh galactic latitudes. the brightness temperature of the detected galacticemission is on average 4 k in polarized intensity and covers the range from -10to +13rad m^-2 in faraday depth. the total polarized intensity and polarizationangle show a wide range of morphological features. we have also used thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) at 350 mhz to image the sameregion. the lofar and wsrt images show a similar complex morphology, atcomparable brightness levels, but their spatial correlation is very low. thefractional polarization at 150 mhz, expressed as a percentage of the totalintensity, amounts to 1.5%. there is no indication of diffuse emission in totalintensity in the interferometric data, in line with results at higherfrequencies. the wide frequency range, good angular resolution and goodsensitivity make lofar an exquisite instrument for studying galactic polarizedemission at a resolution of 1-2 rad m^-2 in faraday depth. the differentpolarised patterns observed at 150 mhz and 350 mhz are consistent withdifferent source distributions along the line of sight wring in a variety offaraday thin regions of emission. the presence of polarised foregrounds is aserious complication for epoch of reionization experiments. to avoid theleakage of polarized emission into total intensity, which can depend onfrequency, we need to calibrate the instrumental polarization across the fieldof view to a small fraction of 1%.

1407.4244	lunar occultation of the diffuse radio sky: lofar measurements between  35 and 80 mhz	we present radio observations of the moon between $35$ and $80$ mhz todemonstrate a novel technique of interferometrically measuring large-scalediffuse emission extending far beyond the primary beam (global signal) for thefirst time. in particular, we show that (i) the moon appears as a negative-fluxsource at frequencies $35&lt;\nu&lt;80$ mhz since it is `colder' than the diffusegalactic background it occults, (ii) using the (negative) flux of the lunardisc, we can reconstruct the spectrum of the diffuse galactic emission with thelunar thermal emission as a reference, and (iii) that reflected rfi(radio-frequency interference) is concentrated at the center of the lunar discdue to specular nature of reflection, and can be independently measured. ourrfi measurements show that (i) moon-based cosmic dawn experiments must designfor an earth-isolation of better than $80$ db to achieve an rfi temperature$&lt;1$ mk, (ii) moon-reflected rfi contributes to a dipole temperature less than$20$ mk for earth-based cosmic dawn experiments, (iii) man-madesatellite-reflected rfi temperature exceeds $20$ mk if the aggregate crosssection of visible satellites exceeds $80$ m$^2$ at $800$ km height, or $5$m$^2$ at $400$ km height. currently, our diffuse background spectrum is limitedby sidelobe confusion on short baselines (10-15% level). further refinement ofour technique may yield constraints on the redshifted global $21$-cm signalfrom cosmic dawn ($40&gt;z&gt;12$) and the epoch of reionization ($12&gt;z&gt;5$).

0804.2827	dissecting the gravitational lens b1608+656. i. lens potential  reconstruction	strong gravitational lensing is a powerful technique for probing galaxy massdistributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. we present a pixelatedapproach to modeling simultaneously the lens potential and source intensity ofstrong gravitational lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions.for systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensedimages are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in thereconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. we applythis potential reconstruction technique to deep hst observations of b1608+656,a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lensgalaxies. we present a comprehensive bayesian analysis of the system that takesinto account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, andthe interacting lens galaxies. our approach allows us to compare various modelsof the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function(psf), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lenspotential. using optimal combinations of the psf, dust, and lens galaxy lightmodels, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extendedsource-intensity distribution of b1608+656. the resulting reconstruction can beused as the basis of a measurement of the hubble constant. we use ourreconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relativedistribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. we find that themass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0+/-0.2)h m_{\sun}l_{b,\sun}^{-1} within the einstein radius 3.9 h^{-1} kpc, in agreement withwhat is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales.

1503.01644	polarization leakage in epoch of reionization windows: i. lofar  observations of the 3c196 field	detection of the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization (eor) ischallenging especially because, even after removing the foregrounds, theresidual stokes $i$ maps contain leakage from polarized emission that can mimicthe signal. here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of lofar and presentrealistic simulations of the leakages between stokes parameters. from the lofarobservations of polarized emission in the 3c196 field, we have quantified thelevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of lofar, andcompared it with the eor signal using power spectrum analysis. we found that at134--166 mhz, within the central 4$^\circ$ of the field the $(q,u)\rightarrowi$ leakage power is lower than the eor signal at $k&lt;0.3$ mpc$^{-1}$. theleakage was found to be localized around a faraday depth of 0, and the rms ofthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown tovary between 0.2-0.3\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal ofleakage. moreover, we could define an `eor window' in terms of the polarizationleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the psf-induced wedge and below$k_\parallel\sim 0.5$ mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to$k_\parallel\sim 1$ mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\perp$ when 70\% of the leakage hadbeen removed. these lofar results show that even a modest polarimetriccalibration over a field of view of $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in the future arrayslike ska will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below theexpected eor signal at the scales of 0.02-1 mpc$^{-1}$.

1505.07568	the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization with the square kilometre  array	concerted effort is currently ongoing to open up the epoch of reionization(eor) ($z\sim$15-6) for studies with ir and radio telescopes. whereas irdetections have been made of sources (lyman-$\alpha$ emitters, quasars anddrop-outs) in this redshift regime in relatively small fields of view, nodirect detection of neutral hydrogen, via the redshifted 21-cm line, has yetbeen established. such a direct detection is expected in the coming years, withongoing surveys, and could open up the entire universe from $z\sim$6-200 forastrophysical and cosmological studies, opening not only the eor, but also itspreceding cosmic dawn ($z\sim$30-15) and possibly even the later phases of thedark ages ($z\sim$200-30). all currently ongoing experiments attemptstatistical detections of the 21-cm signal during the eor, with limitedsignal-to-noise. direct imaging, except maybe on the largest (degree) scales atlower redshifts, as well as higher redshifts will remain out of reach. thesquare kilometre array(ska) will revolutionize the field, allowing directimaging of neutral hydrogen from scales of arc-minutes to degrees over most ofthe redshift range $z\sim$6-28 with ska1-low, and possibly even higherredshifts with the ska2-low. in this ska will be unique, and in parallelprovide enormous potential of synergy with other upcoming facilities (e.g.jwst). in this chapter we summarize the physics of 21-cm emission, thedifferent phases the universe is thought to go through, and the observablesthat the ska can probe, referring where needed to detailed chapters in thisvolume (abridged).

astro-ph;0001108	micro &amp; strong lensing with the square kilometer array: the  mass--function of compact objects in high--redshift galaxies	we present the results from recent vla 8.5-ghz and wsrt 1.4 and 4.9-ghzmonitoring campaigns of the class gravitational lens b1600+434 and show how theobserved variations argue strongly in favor of microlensing by machos in thehalo of a dark-matter dominated edge-on disk galaxy at z=0.4. the population offlat-spectrum radio sources with micro-jy flux-densities detected with thesquare-kilometer-array is expected to have dimensions of micro-arcsec. theywill therefore vary rapidly as a result of galactic scintillation (diffractiveand refractive). however, when positioned behind distant galaxies they willalso show variations due to microlensing, even more strongly than in the caseof b1600+434. relativistic or superluminal motion in these background sourcestypically leads to temporal variations on time scales of days to weeks.scintillation and microlensing can be distinguished, and separated, by theirdifferent characteristic time scales and the frequency dependence of theirmodulations. monitoring studies with square-kilometer-array at ghz frequencieswill thus probe both microscopic and macroscopic properties of dark matter andits mass-function as a function of redshift, information very hard to obtain byany other method.

astro-ph;0004112	microlensing of multiply-imaged compact radio sources: evidence for  compact halo objects in the disk galaxy of b1600+434	we present the first unambiguous case of external variability of a radiogravitational lens, class b1600+434. the vla 8.5-ghz difference light curve ofthe lensed images, taking the proper time-delay into account, shows thepresence of external variability with 14.6-sigma confidence. we investigate twoplausible causes of this external variability: scattering by the ionizedcomponent of the galactic interstellar medium and microlensing by massivecompact objects in the bulge/disk and halo of the lens galaxy. based on thetight relation between the modulation-index and variability time scale and thequantitative difference between the light curves of both lensed images, weconclude that the observed short-term variability characteristics of the lensedimages are incompatible with scintillation in our galaxy. this conclusion isstrongly supported by multi-frequency wsrt observations at 1.4 and 5 ghz, whichare in strong disagreement with predictions based on the scintillationhypothesis. ... on the other hand, a single superluminal jet-component, havingan apparent velocity 9&lt;=(v_app/c)&lt;=26, a radius of 2-5 micro-arcsec andcontaining 5-11% of the observed 8.5-ghz source flux density, can reproduce theobserved modulation-indices and variability time scale at 8.5 ghz, when it ismicrolensed by compact objects in the lens galaxy. it also reproduces thefrequency-dependence of the modulation-indices, determined from the independentwsrt 1.4 and 5-ghz observations. ... the only conclusion fully consistent withthe data gathered thus far is that we have indeed detected radio microlensing.the far reaching consequence of this statement is that a significant fractionof the mass in the dark-matter halo at ~6 kpc (h=0.65) above the lens-galaxydisk in b1600+434 consists of massive compact objects.

astro-ph;0007011	the influence of central black holes on gravitational lenses	recent observations indicate that many if not all galaxies host massivecentral black holes. in this paper we explore the influence of black holes onthe lensing properties. we model the lens as an isothermal ellipsoid with afinite core radius plus a central black hole. we show that the presence of theblack hole substantially changes the critical curves and caustics. if the blackhole mass is above a critical value, then it will completely suppress thecentral images for all source positions. realistic central black holes likelyhave masses below this critical value. even in such sub-critical cases, theblack hole can suppress the central image when the source is inside a zone ofinfluence, which depends on the core radius and black hole mass. in thesub-critical cases, an additional image may be created by the black hole insome regions, which for some radio lenses may be detectable withhigh-resolution and large dynamic-range vlbi maps. the presence of centralblack holes should also be taken into account when one constrains the coreradius from the lack of central images in gravitational lenses.

astro-ph;0007286	class b0827+525: `dark lens' or binary radio-loud quasar?	we present radio, optical, near-infrared and spectroscopic observations ofthe source b0827+525. we consider this source as the best candidate from thecosmic lens all-sky survey (class) for a `dark lens' system or binaryradio-loud quasar. the system consists of two radio components with somewhatdifferent spectral indices, separated by 2.815 arcsec. vlba observations showthat each component has substructure on a scale of a few mas. a deep k-bandexposure with the w.m.keck-ii telescope reveals emission near both radiocomponents. the k-band emission of the weaker radio component appears extended,whereas the emission from the brighter radio component is consistent with apoint source. hubble space telescope f160w-band observations with the nicmosinstrument confirms this. a redshift of 2.064 is found for the brightercomponent, using the lris instrument on the w.m.keck-ii telescope. theprobability that b0827+525 consists of two unrelated compact flat-spectrumradio sources is ~3%, although the presence of similar substructure in bothcomponent might reduce this.  we discuss two scenarios to explain this system: (i) class b0827+525 is a`dark lens' system or (ii) b0827+525 is a binary radio-loud quasar. b0827+525has met all criteria that thus far have in 100% of the cases confirmed a sourceas an indisputable gravitational lens system. despite this, no lens galaxy hasbeen detected with m_f160w&lt;=23 mag. hence, we might have found the first binaryradio-loud quasar. at this moment, however, we feel that the `dark lens'hypothesis cannot yet be fully excluded.

astro-ph;0104399	the new two-image gravitational lens system class b2319+051	we report the discovery of a new two-image gravitational lens system from thecosmic lens all-sky survey, class b2319+051. radio imaging with the very largearray (vla) and multi-element radio-linked interferometer network (merlin)shows two compact components with a flux density ratio of 5:1, separated by1.36 arcsec. observations with the very long baseline array (vlba) resolve eachof the radio components into a pair of parity-reversed subcomponents. hubblespace telescope (hst) observations with the near-infrared camera andmulti-object spectrometer (nicmos) show a bright elliptical galaxy (g1)coincident with the radio position, and a second irregular galaxy (g2) 3.4arcsec to the northwest. previous spectroscopic studies have indicated thatthese galaxies are at different redshifts: z(g1) = 0.624, z(g2) = 0.588.infrared counterparts to the lensed radio components are not detected in thenicmos image, and the source redshift has not yet been determined. preliminarymass modeling based on the vlba subcomponent data indicates that the lensingpotential includes a strong external shear contribution. a vla monitoringprogram is currently being undertaken to measure the differential time delay.

astro-ph;0106575	2016+112: a gravitationally lensed type-ii quasar	a single-screen model of the gravitational lens system 2016+112 is proposed,that explains recent hubble space telescope} (hst) infrared (nicmos-f160w)observations and new high-resolution european vlbi network (evn) 5-ghz radioobservations, presented in this paper. in particular, we find that a massive`dark' structure at the lens position, previously suggested by x-ray, opticaland spectroscopic observations of the field around 2016+112, is not necessarilyrequired to accommodate the strong lensing constraints. a massive structure tothe north-west of the lens system, suggested from a weak-lensing analysis ofthe field, is included in the model. the lensed source is an x-ray brightactive galaxy at z=3.273 with a central bright optical continuum core andstrong narrow emission lines, suggestive of a type-ii quasar. the evn 5-ghzradio maps show a radio-jet structure with at least two compact subcomponents.we propose that the diamond caustic crosses the counter-jet of the radiosource, so that part of the counter-jet, host galaxy and narrow-line emissionregions are quadruply imaged. the remainder of the radio source, including thecore, is doubly imaged. our lens model predicts a very high magnification(mu~300) at the bightness peaks of the inner two radio components of complex c.if the jet exhibits relativistic velocities on micro-arsecond scales, it mightresult in apparent hyperluminal motion. however, the lack of strong radiovariability and the peaked radio spectrum imply that these motions need not bepresent in the source. our model furthermore implies that the optical spectrumof c' can only show features of the agn and its host galaxy.

astro-ph;0311052	the dark matter halos of spheroidal galaxies and clusters of galaxies	we describe the first results from two observational projects aimed atmeasuring the amount and spatial distribution of dark matter in distantearly-type galaxies (e/s0s) and clusters of galaxies. at the galaxy scale, thelenses structure and dynamics (lsd) survey is gathering kinematic data fordistant (up to $z\sim1$) e/s0s that are gravitational lenses. a joint lensingand dynamical analysis constrains the fraction of dark matter within theeinstein radius, the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar component, and thetotal slope of the mass density profile. these properties and their evolutionwith redshift are briefly discussed in terms of the formation and evolution ofe/s0 galaxies and measurement of the hubble constant from gravitational timedelay systems. at the cluster scale -- after careful removal of the stellarcomponent with a joint lensing and dynamical analysis -- systems with giantradial arcs can be used to measure precisely the inner slope of the dark matterhalo. an hst search for radial arcs and the analysis of a first sample arebriefly discussed in terms of the universal dark matter halos predicted by cdmsimulations.

astro-ph;0311567	hi kinematics in a massive spiral galaxy at z=0.89	we present a kinematic model of the neutral-hydrogen in the spiral galaxy ofthe lens system pks1830-211, based on a multi element radio-linkedinterferometer (merlin) 1.4-ghz radio map and the integrated and redshifted21-cm hydrogen absorption-line profile as measured with the westerborksynthesis radio telescope (wsrt). degeneracies in the models do not allow aunique determination of the kinematic center and forthcoming deeper hubblespace telescope observations with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) arerequired to break this degeneracy. even so, we measure the inclination of thehydrogen disk: i=(17-32) deg., indicating a close-to face-on spiral galaxy. theoptical depth increases with radius over the extent of the einstein ring,suggesting hi depletion towards the lens center. the latter could be due tostar formation or conversion of hi in to molecular hydrogen because of a highermetalicity/dust content in the galaxy center. the neutral hydrogen opticaldepth gives n_hi= 2x10^21 cm^-2 at r=5.0 h_{70}^-1 kpc in the disk (t_s=100k),comparable to local spiral galaxies. our study shows that planned new radiotelescopes (i.e. alma, lofar and ska) -- which will discover large numbers ofsimilar lens systems -- are powerful new tools to probe the internal structure,kinematics and evolution of spiral galaxies in detail to z&gt;=1, as well as theirneutral-hydrogen (and molecular) content, thereby complementing studies of hiemission from spirals at z&lt;=1 and damped ly-alpha systems to z&gt;&gt;1.

astro-ph;0409095	strong gravitational lensing with ska	the advent of new observational facilities in the last two decades hasallowed the rapid discovery and high-resolution optical imaging of many stronglens systems from galaxy to cluster scales, as well as their spectroscopicfollow-up. radio telescopes have played the dominant role in the systematicdetection of dozens of new arcsec-scale lens systems. for the future, we expectnothing less! the next major ground- and space-based facilities, especially thesquare kilometer array can discover tens of thousands of new lens systems inlarge sky surveys. for optical imaging and spectroscopic follow-up a strongsynergy with planned optical facilities is needed. here, we discuss the fieldwhere strong gravitational lensing is expected to play the dominant role andwhere ska can have a major impact: the study of the internal mass structure andevolution of galaxies and clusters to z~1. in addition, studies of more exoticphenomena are contemplated. for example, milli- and microlensing can provide away to measure the mass-functions of stars and cdm substructure at cosmologicaldistances. all-sky radio monitoring will also rapidly develop the field oftime-domain lensing.

astro-ph;0412596	gravitational lensing &amp; stellar dynamics: dark-matter and baryons in  early-type galaxies to z=1	gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics provide two complementary, nearlyorthogonal, constraints on the mass distribution of early-type lens galaxies.this allows the luminous and dark-matter distribution in higher-redshift(z&gt;0.1) galaxies to be studied beyond the limitations of each individualmethod. two surveys have been initiated to compile a large sample of early-typegalaxies suitable to lensing and dynamical studies: (1) the lenses structure &amp;dynamics (lsd) survey and (2) the sloan lens acs (slacs) survey. usingspherically symmetric mass models, i illustrated how lensing and dynamicalconstraints can be used to measure the ``effective'' density slope (gamma') ofgalaxies inside their einstein radii and estimate the typical error on thisdetermination. the main results from the lsd survey thus far are: (i) massive(typically &gt;l_*) early-type galaxies at z=0.5-1 contain a significant fractionf_cdm=0.4-0.7 of dark matter inside their einstein radii. [the null-hypothesis,f_cdm=0, is excluded at the &gt;99% in all analyzed systems.] (ii) the inner cdmdensity slope is gamma_cdm=1.3^{+0.2}_{-0.3} (68% cl). (iii) the total densityslope gamma' = 1.9 +- 0.1 (with 0.3 rms scatter in the sample). the intrinsicscatter of 15% in gamma' is consistent with local dynamical studies and canlead to a 30% rms scatter in inferred values of h_0 from lens time-delays, whenpurely isothermal mass models are assumed. hence, the common practice to assumethat lens galaxies are perfectly isothermal should be abandoned, especially incases where this assumption is critical.

astro-ph;0505093	class b0631+519: last of the class lenses	we report the discovery of a new gravitational lens system from the classsurvey, class b0631+519. vla, merlin and vlba observations show a doubly-imagedradio core, a doubly-imaged lobe and a second lobe that is probablyquadruply-imaged. the maximum image separation is 1.16 arcseconds. the vlbaresolves the most magnified image of the flat-spectrum radio core into a numberof sub-components spread across approximately 20 milli-arcseconds. optical andnear-infrared imaging with the acs and nicmos cameras on the hst show thatthere are two galaxies along the line of sight to the lensed source, as waspreviously discovered by optical spectroscopy. the nearer galaxy at z=0.0896 isa small blue irregular, while the more distant galaxy at z=0.6196 is anelliptical type and appears to contribute most of the lensing effect. the hostgalaxy of the lensed source is visible in nicmos imaging as a set of arcs thatform an almost complete einstein ring. mass modelling using non-parametrictechniques can reproduce the ring and indicates that the irregular galaxy has a(localised) effect on the flux density distribution in the einstein ring at the5-10% level.

(iii) the average projecteddark-matter mass fraction is inferred to be 0.25+-0.06 inside r_e, using thestellar mass-to-light ratios derived from the fundamental plane as priors. (iv)combined with results from the lsd survey, we find no significant evolution ofthe total density slope inside one effective radius: a linear fit givesd\gamma'/dz = 0.23+-0.16 (1-sigma) for the range z=0.08-1.01. the small scatterand absence of significant evolution in the inner density slopes suggest acollisional scenario where gas and dark matter strongly couple during galaxyformation, leading to a total mass distribution that rapidly converge todynamical isothermality.

astro-ph;0603445	three gravitational lenses for the price of one: enhanced strong lensing  through galaxy clustering	we report the serendipitous discovery of two strong gravitational lenscandidates (acs j160919+6532 and acs j160910+6532) in deep images obtained withthe advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope, each less than40 arcsec from the previously known gravitational lens system class b1608+656.the redshifts of both lens galaxies have been measured with keck and gemini:one is a member of a small galaxy group at z~0.63, which also includes thelensing galaxy in the b1608+656 system, and the second is a member of aforeground group at z~0.43. by measuring the effective radii and surfacebrightnesses of the two lens galaxies, we infer their velocity dispersionsbased on the passively evolving fundamental plane (fp) relation. ellipticalisothermal lens mass models are able to explain their image configurationswithin the lens hypothesis, with a velocity dispersion compatible with thatestimated from the fp for a reasonable source-redshift range. based on thelarge number of massive early-type galaxies in the field and the number-densityof faint blue galaxies, the presence of two additional lens systems aroundclass b1608+656 is not unlikely in hindsight. gravitational lens galaxies arepredominantly early-type galaxies, which are clustered, and the lensed quasarhost galaxies are also clustered. therefore, obtaining deep high-resolutionimages of the fields around known strong lens systems is an excellent method ofenhancing the probability of finding additional strong gravitational lenssystems.

astro-ph;0603466	highly-magnified, multiply-imaged radio counterparts of the sub-mm  starburst emission in the cluster-lens ms0451.6-0305	previous authors have reported the detection of intrinsically faint sub-mmemission lensed by the cluster ms0451.6-0305. they suggest that this emissionarises from a merging system composed of a ly-break galaxy and a pair ofextremely red objects which are multiply-imaged in the optical/nirobservations. since the submm emission presents an unusually large angularextent (~1 arcmin), the possible radio emission asociatted with that system canhelp to identify optical/nir counterparts due to the higher spatial resolutionand astrometric accuracy of the radio observations. archive vla data (bnaconfiguration at 1.4 ghz) was reduced and analysed. a simple lens model wasconstructed to aid the interpretation of the radio and pre-existing sub-mm andoptical/nir data. we present a 1.4 ghz map of the central region ofms0451.6-0305 and report the detection of gravitationally lensed radioemission, coincident with the previously discovered sub-mm lensed emission. theoverall morphology and scale of the radio and sub-mm emission are strikinglysimilar, extending ~1 arcmin across the sky. this observation strongly suggeststhat the radio and sub-mm emission arise from the same sources. preliminaryestimates of the total s_850 microns/s_1.4 ghz flux density ratio appear to beconsistent with that expected from distant star forming galaxies. the radioemission is resolved into 7 distinct components, and the overall structure canbe explained, using a simple lens model, with three multiply-imaged radiosources at z~2.9. one of these sources is predicted to lie in the middle of thepreviously mentioned system in the source plane, suggesting that it is relatedto the intense star formation generated during the merging process.

astro-ph;0611215	high resolution imaging of the anomalous flux-ratio gravitational lens  system class b2045+265: dark or luminous satellites?	the existence of flux-ratio anomalies between fold and cusp images ingalaxy-scale strong-lens systems has led to an interpretation based on thepresence of a high mass-fraction of cold-dark-matter (cdm) substructures aroundgalaxies, as predicted by numerical n-body simulations. the flux-ratio anomalyis particularly evident in the radio-loud quadruple gravitational lens systemclass b2045+265. in this paper, new high-resolution radio, optical, andinfrared imaging of b2045+265 is presented which sheds more light on thisanomaly and its possible causes. first, deep very long baseline arrayobservations show very compact images, possibly with a hint of a jet, but withno evidence for differential scattering or scatter broadening. second, opticaland infrared observations with the hubble space telescope and throughadaptive-optics imaging with the w. m. keck telescope, show a previouslyundiscovered object -- interpreted as a (tidally disrupted) dwarf satellitebased on its colours and slight extension -- between the main lens galaxy andthe three anomalous flux-ratio images. third, colour variations in theearly-type lens galaxy indicate recent star-formation, possibly the result ofsecondary infall of gas-rich satellites. a population of such galaxies aroundthe lens system could explain the previously discovered strong [o ii] emission.however, spiral structure and/or normal star formation in the lens galaxycannot be excluded. in light of these new data, we propose a lens model for thesystem, including the observed dwarf satellite, which reproduces all positionaland flux-ratio constraints, without the need for additional cdm substructure.[abridged]

astro-ph;9801186	the edge-on spiral gravitational lens b1600+434	we present new observations of the gravitational lens (gl) system b1600+434,strongly suggesting that the lens is an edge-on spiral galaxy. theseobservations are used to constrain the mass model of the system, in particularthe oblateness and velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo around thelensing galaxy. from an analytical model we find a lower limit on the halooblateness $q_\rmn{halo}=(c/a)_{\rho}\ga0.4$; more detailed numerical modelsgive a lower limit $q_\rmn{h}\ga0.5$. we determine an average halo velocitydispersion of $\sigma_{halo}=190\pm 15$ km/s over all non-singular isothermalelliptical (nie) halo models. constraining the models to larger and moremassive disks, decreases this average by only 10 km/s. a lower limit of$\sigma_{halo}\ga 150$ km/s is found, even for disk masses larger then the massinside the einstein radius. this lower limit indicates the need for a massivedark matter halo, contributing at least half of the mass inside the einsteinradius. time delay calculations give $(54\pm3)/h_{50}$ days for the nie halomodel and $(70\pm4)/h_{50}$ days for the modified hubble profile (mhp) halomodel. although the time delay for both nie and mhp halo models is wellconstrained on our parameter grid, it strongly depends on the halo surfacedensity profile. we furthermore find that the presence of a flat luminous massdistribution can severely alter the statistical properties of the lens.

astro-ph;9804136	lensing galaxies: light or dark?	in a recent paper, hawkins (1997) argues on the basis of statistical studiesof double-image gravitational lenses and lens candidates that a largepopulation of dark lenses exists and that these outnumber galaxies with morenormal mass-to-light ratios by a factor of 3:1. if correct, this is a veryimportant result for many areas of astronomy including galaxy formation andcosmology. in this paper we discuss our new radio-selected gravitational lenssample, jvas/class, in order to test and constrain this proposition. we haveobtained ground-based and hst images of all multiple-image lens systems in oursample and in 12 cases out of 12 we find the lensing galaxies in the opticaland/or near infrared. our success in finding lensing galaxies creates problemsfor the dark lens hypothesis. if it is to survive, ad hoc modifications seem tobe necessary: only very massive galaxies (more than about one trillion solarmasses) can be dark, and the cutoff in mass must be sharp. our finding of lensgalaxies in all the jvas/class systems is complementary evidence which supportsthe conclusion of kochanek et al. (1997) that many of the wide-separationoptically-selected pairs are physically distinct quasars rather thangravitational lens systems.

astro-ph;9811167	b2045+265: a new four-image gravitational lens from class	we have discovered a new gravitational lens in the cosmic lens all-sky survey(class). b2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9arcsec. a fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and itspositional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy stronglysuggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. this implies that theb2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed byanother flat-spectrum radio source. infrared images detect the lensed images ofthe background source and the lensing galaxy. the lensed images have relativepositions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radiowavelengths. spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and asource redshift of z_s=1.28. the image splitting and system redshifts implythat the projected mass inside the einstein radius of the lensing galaxy ism_e=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun. an estimate of the light emitted inside theeinstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame b band of(m/l_b)_e = 20 h (m/l_b)_sun. both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higherthan what is seen in nearby sa galaxies. in fact, the implied rotation velocityfor the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearbyspirals. the large projected mass inside the einstein ring radius may be theresult of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from acompact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentificationof the source redshift. a simple model of the gravitational potential of thelens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required tosatisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. with furtherobservations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of h_0.

0812.0748	stars and dark matter in the spiral gravitational lens 2237+0305	we construct a mass model for the spiral lens galaxy 2237+0305, at redshiftz_l=0.04, based on gravitational-lensing constraints, hi rotation, and newstellar-kinematic information, based on data taken with the esi spectrograph onthe 10m keck-ii telescope. high resolution rotation curves and velocitydispersion profiles along two perpendicular directions, close to the major andminor axes of the lens galaxy, were obtained by fitting the mgb-fe absorptionline region. the stellar rotation curve rises slowly and flattens at r~1.5"(~1.1 kpc). the velocity dispersion profile is approximately flat. acombination of photometric, kinematic and lensing information is used toconstruct a mass model for the four major mass components of the system -- thedark matter halo, disc, bulge, and bar. the best-fitting solution has a darkmatter halo with a logarithmic inner density slope of gamma=0.9+/-0.3 forrho_dm propto r^-gamma, a bulge with m/l_b=6.6+/-0.3 upsilon_odot, and a discwith m/l_b =1.2+/-0.3 upsilon_odot, in agreement with measurements of late-typespirals. the bulge dominates support in the inner regions where the multipleimages are located and is therefore tightly constrained by the observations.the disc is sub-maximal and contributes 45+/-11 per cent of the rotationalsupport of the galaxy at 2.2r_d. the halo mass is (2.0+/-0.6) x 10^12 m_odot,and the stellar to virial mass ratio is 7.0+/-2.3 per cent, consistent withtypical galaxies of the same mass.
