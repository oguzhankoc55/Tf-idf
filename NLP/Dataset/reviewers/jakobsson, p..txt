0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0704.1244	sn 2003du: 480 days in the life of a normal type ia supernova	an extensive set of optical and nir photometry and low-resolution spectra thetype ia supernova (sn ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. theobservations started 13 days before b-band maximum light and continued for 480days with exceptionally good time sampling. the optical photometry wascalibrated through the s-correction technique.  the ubvrijhk light curves and the color indices of sn 2003du closely resemblethose of normal sne ia. sn 2003du reached a b-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)mag on jd2452766.38 (+/-0.5). we derive a b-band stretch parameter of 0.988(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dm15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a sn ia ofstandard luminosity. the reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by threemethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. we estimate a distancemodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, ugc 9391. the peak uvoirbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and arnett's rule impliesthat m(ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)m_sun of ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.modeling of the uvoir bolometric light curve also indicates m(ni56) in therange 0.6-0.8 m_sun. the spectral evolution of sn 2003du at both optical andnir wavelengths also closely resembles normal sne ia. in particular, the si iiratio at maximum r(si ii)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of theblueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. the pre-maximumspectra of sn 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the ca ii h&amp;kdoublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in si ii 6355, lines. we compare thetime evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed sne iaand we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of si ii 6355 line inmany sne ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1004.2919	discovery of the nearby long, soft grb 100316d with an associated  supernova	we report the swift discovery of nearby long, soft gamma-ray burst grb100316d, and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy andassociated supernova. we derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb-sn. we study the extremelyunusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to x-ray spectroscopy, andfind that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition toa synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. the x-ray light curvehas a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. the host is a bright,blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south, vlt andhst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. wecompare and contrast the x-ray emission and host galaxy of grb 100316d to asubsample of grb-sne. grb 100316d is unlike the majority of grb-sne in itsx-ray evolution, but resembles rather grb 060218, and we find that these twoevents have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.comparison of the host galaxies of grb-sne demonstrates, however, that there isa great diversity in the environments in which grb-sne can be found. grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample ofspectroscopically confirmed grb-sne, from which a better understanding of longgrb progenitors and the grb--sn connection can be gleaned.

1006.4469	searching for differences in swift's intermediate grbs	gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emissioninto short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect twodifferent types of progenitors. however, it has been shown on statisticalgrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classificationscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so farnot been done. the large amount of follow-up studies generated during the swiftera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this thirdpopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and theirafterglows. our study is focused on a sample of grbs observed by swift duringits first four years of operation. the sample contains those bursts withmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than longgrbs, especially when considering the x-ray light curves, which are on averageone order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. there is a less significanttrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer thanlong bursts. except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties tolong bursts. in particular, they follow the epeak vs. eiso correlation andhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that oflong bursts. like long grbs, they normally have an associated supernova,although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. this studyshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite ofsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences betweenthem as well. we suggest that the physical difference between intermediate andlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while forthe latter they are thick shells.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1010.4057	the circumburst density profile around grb progenitors: a statistical  study	according to our present understanding, long grbs originate from the collapseof massive stars while short bursts are due to the coalescence of compactstellar objects. since the afterglow evolution is determined by the circumburstdensity profile, n(r), traversed by the fireball, it can be used to distinguishbetween a so-called ism profile, n(r) = const., and a free stellar wind, $n(r)\propto r^{-2}$. our goal is to derive the most probable circumburst densityprofile for a large number of swift-detected bursts using well-sampledafterglow light curves in the optical and x-ray bands. we combined all publiclyavailable optical and swift/x-ray afterglow data from june 2005 to september2009 to find the best-sampled late-time afterglow light curves. after applyingseveral selection criteria, our final sample consists of 27 bursts, includingone short burst. the afterglow evolution was then studied within the frameworkof the fireball model. we find that the majority (18) of the 27 afterglow lightcurves are compatible with a constant density medium (ism case). only 6 of the27 afterglows show evidence for a wind profile at late times. in particular, weset upper limits on the wind termination-shock radius, $r_t$, for grb fireballswhich are propagating into an ism profile and lower limits on $r_t$ for thosewhich were found to propagate through a wind medium. observational evidence forism profiles dominates in grb afterglow studies, implying that most grbprogenitors might have relatively small wind termination-shock radii. a smallergroup of progenitors, however, seems to be characterised by notably moreextended wind regions.

1011.0734	a high signal-to-noise ratio composite spectrum of gamma-ray burst  afterglows	we present a composite spectrum of 60 long duration gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows with redshifts in the range 0.35&lt;z&lt;6.7 observed with low resolutionoptical spectra. the composite spectrum covers the wavelength range 700-6600 ain the rest frame and has a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 150 per 1 a pixel andreaches a maximum of ~300 in the range 2500-3500 a. equivalent widths aremeasured from metal absorption lines from the lya line to ~5200 a, andassociated metal and hydrogen lines are identified between the lyman break andlya line. the average transmission within the lyman forest is consistent withthat found along quasar lines of sight. we find a temporal variation in finestructure lines when dividing the sample into bursts observed within 2 hoursfrom their trigger and those observed later. other lines in the predominantlyneutral gas show variations too, but this is most likely a random effect causedby weighting of individual strong absorption lines and which mimics a temporalvariation. bursts characterized with high or low prompt grb energy releaseproduce afterglows with similar absorption line strengths, and likewise forbursts with bright or faint optical afterglows. bursts defined as dark fromtheir optical to x-ray spectral index have stronger absorption lines relativeto the optically bright bursts. the composite spectrum has strong caii and mgiiabsorption lines as commonly found in dusty galaxies, however, we find noevidence for dust or a significant molecular content based on the non-detectionof diffuse interstellar bands. compared to starburst galaxy spectra, the grbcomposite has much stronger fine structure lines, while metal absorption linesare weaker.

1011.4239	probing grb environments with time variability: ultraspec fast imaging  of grb 080210	we present high time resolution (1.09 s) photometry of grb 080210 obtainedwith ultraspec mounted on the eso/3.6-m telescope, starting 68.22 min after theburst and lasting for 26.45 min. the light curve is smooth on both short (downto 2.18 s) and long time scales, confirmed by a featureless power spectrum. ontop of the fireball power-law decay, bumps and wiggles at different time scalescan, in principle, be produced by density fluctuations in the circumburstmedium, substructures in the jet or by refreshed shocks. comparing ourconstraints with variability limits derived from kinematic arguments, weexclude under-density fluctuations producing flux dips larger than 1 per centwith time scales \deltat &gt; 9.2 min (2 per cent on \deltat &gt; 2.3 min for manyfluctuating regions). in addition, we study the afterglow vlt/fors2 spectrum,the optical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) and the time decay. thesed is best fit with a broken power law with slopes {\beta}opt = 0.71 \pm 0.01and {\beta}x = 1.59 \pm 0.07, in disagreement with the fireball model,suggesting a non-standard afterglow for grb 080210. we find av = 0.18 \pm 0.03mag optical extinction due to smc-like dust and an excess x-ray absorption oflog (nh/cm-2) = 21.58 +0.18 -0.26 assuming solar abundances. the spectralanalysis reveals a damped ly{\alpha} absorber (log (nh i /cm-2) = 21.90 \pm0.10) with a low metallicity ([x/h] = -1.21 \pm 0.16), likely associated withthe interstellar medium of the grb host galaxy (z = 2.641).

0704.2525	a case of mistaken identity? grb 060912a and the nature of the long --  short grb divide	we investigate the origin of the grb 060912a, which has observationalproperties that make its classification as either a long or short burstambiguous. short duration grbs (sgrbs) are thought to have typically lowerenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populationsof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the longduration bursts. however, it has become clear that duration alone isinsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,leading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. grb060912a had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, lowredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been thehost, which would favour it being a short-burst. however, our deep opticalimaging and spectroscopy of the location of grb 060912a using the vlt showsthat grb 060912a more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy atz=0.937, and is most likely a long burst. this demonstrates the risk inidentifying bright, nearby galaxies as the hosts of given grbs without furthersupporting evidence. further, it implies that, in the absence of secureidentifications, "host" type, or more broadly discriminators which rely ongalaxy redshifts, may not be good indicators of the true nature of any givengrb.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1109.3167	the dark grb080207 in an extremely red host and the implications for  grbs in highly obscured environments	[abridged] we present comprehensive x-ray, optical, near- and mid-infrared,and sub-mm observations of grb 080207 and its host galaxy. the afterglow wasundetected in the optical and near-ir, implying an optical to x-ray index &lt;0.3,identifying grb 080207 as a dark burst. swift x-ray observations show extremeabsorption in the host, which is confirmed by the unusually large opticalextinction found by modelling the x-ray to nir afterglow spectral energydistribution. our chandra observations obtained 8 days post-burst allow us toplace the afterglow on the sky to sub-arcsec accuracy, enabling us to pinpointan extremely red galaxy (ero). follow-up host observations with hst, spitzer,gemini, keck and the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) provide a photometricredshift solution of z ~1.74 (+0.05,-0.06) (1 sigma), 1.56 &lt; z &lt; 2.08 at 2sigma) for the ero host, and suggest that it is a massive and morphologicallydisturbed ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) system, with l_fir ~ 2.4 x10^12 l_solar. these results add to the growing evidence that grbs originatingin very red hosts always show some evidence of dust extinction in theirafterglows (though the converse is not true -- some extinguished afterglows arefound in blue hosts). this indicates that a poorly constrained fraction of grbsoccur in very dusty environments. by comparing the inferred stellar masses, andestimates of the gas phase metallicity in both grb hosts and sub-mm galaxies wesuggest that many grb hosts, even at z&gt;2 are at lower metallicity than thesub-mm galaxy population, offering a likely explanation for the dearth ofsub-mm detected grb hosts. however, we also show that the dark grb hosts aresystematically more massive than those hosting optically bright events, perhapsimplying that previous host samples are severely biased by the exclusion ofdark events.

1201.6074	star formation in the early universe: beyond the tip of the iceberg	we present late-time hubble space telescope imaging of the fields of sixswift grbs lying at 5.0&lt;z&lt;9.5. our data includes very deep observations of thefield of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, grb 090423, atz=8.2. using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can placestringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. in one case, thatof grb 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the grbposition which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude j(ab)=28.5. none ofthe others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie belowl\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates sfr&lt;4mo/yr inall cases. indeed, stacking the five fields with wfc3-ir data we conclude amean sfr&lt;0.17mo/yr per galaxy. these results support the proposition that thebulk of star formation, and hence integrated uv luminosity, at high redshiftsarises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.making the reasonable assumption that grb rate is proportional to uv luminosityat early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based ongalaxy luminosity functions derived from the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) andother deep fields. we infer that a luminosity function which is evolvingrapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristicluminosity (l\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with ourobservations, whereas a non-evolving lf shape is ruled out at &gt;90% confidence.although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required forgrb production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the natureof star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supplyof ionizing photons in the early universe.

1202.0347	the shallow-decay phase in both optical and x-ray afterglows of swift  grb 090529a: energy injection into a wind-type medium?	the energy injection model is usually proposed to interpret the shallow-decayphase in swift grb x-ray afterglows. however, very few grbs have simultaneoussignatures of energy injection in their optical and x-ray afterglows. here, wereport optical observations of grb 090529a from 2000 sec to $\sim10^6$ secafter the burst, in which an achromatic decay is seen at both wavelengths. theoptical light curve shows a decay from 0.37 to 0.99 with a break at $\sim10^5$sec. in the same time interval, the decay indices of the x-ray light curvechanged from 0.04 to 1.2. comparing these values with the closure relations,the segment after 3$\times10^{4}$ sec is consistent with the prediction of theforward shock in an ism medium without any energy injection. the shallow-decayphase between 2000 to 3$\times10^{4}$ sec could be due to the external shock ina wind-type-like medium with an energy injection under the condition of $\nu_o&lt; \nu_c &lt; \nu_x$. however, the constraint of the spectral region is not wellconsistent with the multi-band observations. for this shallow-decay phase,other models are also possible, such as energy injection with evolvingmicrophysical parameters, or a jet viewed off-axis,etc.

1205.3490	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. iii. redshift  distribution	we present 10 new gamma-ray burst (grb) redshifts and another five redshiftlimits based on host galaxy spectroscopy obtained as part of a large programconducted at the very large telescope (vlt). the redshifts span the range 0.345&lt; z &lt; 2.54. three of our measurements revise incorrect values from theliterature. the homogeneous host sample researched here consists of 69 hoststhat originally had a redshift completeness of 55% (with 38 out of 69 hostshaving redshifts considered secure). our project, including vlt/x-shooterobservations reported elsewhere, increases this fraction to 77% (53/69), makingthe survey the most comprehensive in terms of redshift completeness of anysample to the full swift depth, analyzed to date. we present the cumulativeredshift distribution and derive a conservative, yet small, associateduncertainty. we constrain the fraction of swift grbs at high redshift to amaximum of 14% (5%) for z &gt; 6 (z &gt; 7). the mean redshift of the host sample isassessed to be &lt;z&gt; &gt; 2.2, with the 10 new redshifts reducing it significantly.using this more complete sample, we confirm previous findings that the grb rateat high redshift (z &gt; 3) appears to be in excess of predictions based onassumptions that it should follow conventional determinations of the starformation history of the universe, combined with an estimate of its likelymetallicity dependence. this suggests that either star formation at highredshifts has been significantly underestimated, for example due to a dominantcontribution from faint, undetected galaxies, or that grb production isenhanced in the conditions of early star formation, beyond that usuallyascribed to lower metallicity.

1205.4239	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. vi. radio observations  at z&lt;1 and consistency with typical star-forming galaxies	the objective of this paper is to determine the level of obscured starformation activity and dust attenuation in a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb)hosts; and to test the hypothesis that grb hosts have properties consistentwith those of the general star-forming galaxy populations. we present a radiocontinuum survey of all z&lt;1 grb hosts in the optically unbiased grb host(tough) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-swift) grb-snhosts discovered before october 2006. we present new radio data for 22 objectsand have obtained a detection for three of them (grb 980425, 021211, 031203;none in the tough sample), increasing the number of radio-detected grb hostsfrom two to five. the star formation rate (sfr) for the grb 021211 host of ~825mo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a grb host, places it in the categoryof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. we found that at least 63% of grb hostshave sfr &lt; 100 mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have sfr &gt; 500 mo yr^-1. for theundetected hosts the mean radio flux (&lt;35 ujy 3sigma) corresponds to an averagesfr &lt; 15 mo yr^-1. moreover, ~88% of the z&lt;1 grb hosts have ultraviolet dustattenuation a_uv &lt; 6.7 mag (visual attenuation a_v &lt; 3 mag). hence we did notfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of grb hosts. finally,we found that the distributions of sfrs and a_uv of grb hosts are consistentwith those of lyman break galaxies, halpha emitters at similar redshifts and ofgalaxies from cosmological simulations. the similarity of the grb populationwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that grbs, aleast at z&lt;1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are thereforeless biased indicators than once thought.

1207.6088	galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z sub-dlas/dlas and mgii  absorbers towards gamma-ray bursts	we present the first search for galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z(2&lt;z&lt; 3.6) sub-dlas and dlas towards grbs. our final sample comprises of fiveintervening sub-dlas and dlas in four grb fields. to identify candidate galaxycounterparts of the absorbers we use deep optical and near-infrared imaging,and low-, mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy acquired with 6 to 10-m classtelescopes, the hubble and the spitzer space telescopes. furthermore, we usethe spectroscopic information and spectral-energy-distribution fittingtechniques to study them in detail. our main result is the detection andspectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy counterpart of the intervening dla atz=3.096 in the field of grb 070721b (z_grb=3.6298) as proposed by otherauthors. we also identify good candidates for the galaxy counterparts of thetwo strong mgii absorbers at z=0.6915 and 1.4288 towards grb 050820a(z_grb=2.615). the properties of the detected dla galaxy are typical forlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at similar redshifts; a young, highly starforminggalaxy that shows evidence for a galactic outflow. this supports the hypothesisthat a dla can be the gaseous halo of an lbg. in addition, we report a redshiftcoincidence of different objects associated with metal lines in the same field,separated by 130-161 kpc. the high detection rate of three correlatedstructures on a length scale as small as ~150 kpc in two pairs of lines ofsight is intriguing. the absorbers in each of these are most likely not part ofthe same gravitationally bound structure. they more likely represent groups ofgalaxies.

1207.6102	rapid-response mode vlt/uves spectroscopy of super iron-rich gas exposed  to grb 080310. evidence of ionization in action and episodic star formation  in the host	we analyse high-resolution near-uv and optical spectra of the afterglow ofgrb 080310, obtained with the very large telescope ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (vlt/uves), to investigate the circumburst environment andthe interstellar medium of the gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxy. the vltrapid-response mode (rrm) enabled the observations to start only 13 minutesafter the swift trigger and a series of four exposures to be collected beforedawn. a low neutral-hydrogen column-density (log n (hi) = 18.7) is measured atthe host-galaxy redshift of z = 2.42743. at this redshift, we also detect alarge number of resonance ground-state absorption lines (e.g., cii, mgii, alii,siii, crii, civ, siiv), as well as time-varying absorption from thefine-structure levels of feii. time-varying absorption from a highly excitedfeiii energy level (7s3), giving rise to the so-called uv34 line triplet, isalso detected, for the first time in a grb afterglow. the crii ground-state andall observed feii energy levels are found to depopulate with time, whilst thefeiii 7s3 level is increasingly populated. this absorption-line variability isclear evidence of ionization by the grb, which is for the first timeconclusively observed in a grb afterglow spectrum. we derive ionic columndensities at each epoch of observations by fitting absorption lines with afour-component voigt-profile model. we perform cloudy photo-ionizationmodelling of the expected pre-burst ionic column densities, to estimate that,before the onset of the burst, [c/h] = -1.3 \pm 0.2, [o/h] &lt; -0.8, [si/h] =-1.2 \pm 0.2, [cr/h] = +0.7 \pm 0.2, and [fe/h] = +0.2 \pm 0.2 for theintegrated line profile, indicating strong overabundances of iron and chromium.for one of the components, we observe even more extreme ratios of [si/fe] \leq-1.47 and [c/fe] \leq -1.74.

1209.0891	the distribution of equivalent widths in long grb afterglow spectra	the extreme brightness of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows and their simplespectral shape make them ideal beacons to study the interstellar medium oftheir host galaxies through absorption line spectroscopy. using 69low-resolution grb afterglow spectra, we conduct a study of the rest-frameequivalent width (ew) distribution of features with an average rest-frame ewlarger than 0.5 a. to compare an individual grb with the sample, we develop ewdiagrams as a graphical tool, and we give a catalogue with diagrams for the 69spectra. we introduce a line strength parameter (lsp) that allows us toquantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by asingle number. using the distributions of ews of single-species features, wederive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth (cog) fit. wefind correlations between the lsp and the extinction of the grb, the uvbrightness of the host galaxies and the neutral hydrogen column density.however, we see no significant evolution of the lsp with the redshift. there isa weak correlation between the ionisation of the absorbers and the energy ofthe grb, indicating that, either the grb event is responsible for part of theionisation, or that galaxies with high-ionisation media produce more energeticgrbs. spectral features in grb spectra are, on average, 2.5 times stronger thanthose seen in qso intervening damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems and slightlymore ionised. in particular we find larger excess in the ew of civ1549 relativeto qso dlas, which could be related to an excess of wolf-rayet stars in theenvironments of grbs. from the cog fitting we obtain an average number ofcomponents in the absorption features of grbs of 6.00(-1.25,+1.00). the mostextreme ionisation ratios in our sample are found for grbs with low neutralhydrogen column density, which could be related to ionisation by the grbemission.

1209.1506	time-dependent excitation and ionization modelling of absorption-line  variability due to grb 080310	we model the time-variable absorption of feii, feiii, siii, cii and criidetected in uves spectra of grb 080310, with the afterglow radiation excitingand ionizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at a redshift ofz=2.42743. to estimate the rest-frame afterglow brightness as a function oftime, we use a combination of the optical vri photometry obtained by theraptor-t telescope array -- which are presented in this paper -- and swift'sx-ray telescope observations. excitation alone, which has been successfullyapplied for a handful of other grbs, fails to describe the observedcolumn-density evolution in the case of grb 080310. inclusion of ionization isrequired to explain the column-density decrease of all observed feii levels(including the ground state 6d9/2) and increase of the feiii 7s3 level. thelarge population of ions in this latter level (up to 10% of all feiii) can onlybe explained through ionization of feii, whereby a large fraction of theionized feii ions -- we calculate 31% using the flexible atomic (fac) and cowancodes -- initially populate the 7s3 level of feiii rather than the groundstate. this channel for producing a significant feiii 7s3 level population maybe relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level -- theuv34 triplet -- are observed, such as bal quasars and eta carinae. thisprovides conclusive evidence for time-variable ionization in the circumburstmedium, which to date has not been convincingly detected. however, the best-fitdistance of the neutral absorbing cloud to the grb is 200--400 pc, i.e. similarto grb-absorber distance estimates for grbs without any evidence forionization. we find that the presence of time-varying ionization in grb 080310is likely due to a combination of the super-solar iron abundance ([fe/h]=+0.2)and the low hi column density (log n(hi)=18.7).

0712.2186	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts. i. comparing pre-swift and  swift era long/soft (type ii) grb optical afterglows	we have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a largesample of swift-era gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows including grbs up toseptember 2009, for a total of 76 grbs, and present an additional threepre-swift grbs not included in an earlier sample. furthermore, we publish 840additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 grb afterglows,including large data sets for grbs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820a, 050922c,060418, 080413a and 080810. we analyzed the light curves of all grbs in thesample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the bestdata quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. wetransformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 systemand compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-swift afterglows. theresults of a former study, which showed that grb afterglows clustered andexhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the largersample. we found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples(swift-era and pre-swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which wewere not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the mainsample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight hostextinction. we derived bolometric isotropic energies for all grbs in oursample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energyrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the grb in thez=1 system. a comparative study of the optical luminosities of grb afterglowswith echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)and those without reveals no indication that the former are statisticallysignificantly more luminous.

1301.5903	a population of massive, luminous galaxies hosting heavily dust-obscured  gamma-ray bursts: implications for the use of grbs as tracers of cosmic star  formation	we present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavilydust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swift satellite duringthe years 2005-2009, representing all grbs with an unambiguous host-frameextinction of a_v&gt;1 mag from this period. deep observations with keck, gemini,vlt, hst, and spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establishspectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us toprovide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellarmasses, and mean extinctions. compared to the hosts of unobscured grbs atsimilar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured grbs are (onaverage) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidlystar-forming and dust-obscured. while this demonstrates that grbs populate alltypes of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems atz~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall grb population continues to show ahighly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference forlow-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely sfr-selectedgalaxy sample. this supports the notion that the grb rate is strongly dependenton metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the universeunderwent a transition in their chemical properties ~9 gyr ago. we alsoconclude that, based on the absence of unobscured grbs in massive galaxies andthe absence of obscured grbs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions ofthe lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, whileintermediate-mass galaxies (~10^9 m_sun) have diverse internal properties.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1305.6832	discovery of the broad-lined type ic sn 2013cq associated with the very  energetic grb 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) at z &lt; 1 are in most cases found to beaccompanied by bright, broad-lined type ic supernovae (sne ic-bl). thehighest-energy grbs are mostly located at higher redshifts, where theassociated sne are hard to detect observationally. here we present early andlate observations of the optical counterpart of the very energetic grb 130427a.despite its moderate redshift z = 0.3399+/-0.0002, grb 130427a is at the highend of the grb energy distribution, with an isotropic-equivalent energy releaseof eiso ~ 9.6x10^53 erg, more than an order of magnitude more energetic thanother grbs with spectroscopically confirmed sne. in our dense photometricmonitoring, we detect excess flux in the host-subtracted r-band light curve,consistent with what expected from an emerging sn, ~0.2 mag fainter than theprototypical sn 1998bw. a spectrum obtained around the time of the sn peak(16.7 days after the grb) reveals broad undulations typical of sne ic-bl,confirming the presence of a sn, designated sn 2013cq. the spectral shape andearly peak time are similar to those of the high expansion velocity sn 2010bhassociated with grb 100316d. our findings demonstrate that high-energylong-duration grbs, commonly detected at high redshift, can also be associatedwith sne ic-bl, pointing to a common progenitor mechanism.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1404.0881	the host of the sn-less grb 060505 in high resolution	the spiral host galaxy of grb 060505 at z=0.089 was the site of a puzzlinglong duration burst without an accompanying supernova. studies of the burstenvironment by th\"one et al. (2008) suggested that this grb came from thecollapse of a massive star and that the grb site was a region with propertiesdifferent from the rest of the galaxy. we reobserved the galaxy in high spatialresolution using the vimos integral-field unit (ifu) at the vlt with a spaxelsize of 0.67 arcsec. furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data fromhires/keck at two different slit positions covering the grb site, the center ofthe galaxy and an hii region next to the grb region. we compare the propertiesof different hii regions in the galaxy with the grb site and study the globaland local kinematic properties of this galaxy. the resolved data show that thegrb site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 z_solar, butits specific sfr (ssfr) of 7.4 m_solar/yr/l/l* and age (determined by thehalpha ew) are similar to other hii regions in the host. the galaxy shows agradient in metallicity and ssfr from the bulge to the outskirts as it iscommon for spiral galaxies. this gives further support to the theory that grbsprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in s-typegalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.kinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for largeperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. this studyconfirms the collapsar origin of grb060505 but reveals that the properties ofthe hii region surrounding the grb were not unique to that galaxy. spatiallyresolved observations are key to know the implications and interpretations ofunresolved grb hosts observations at higher redshifts.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

astro-ph;0401225	a very low luminosity x-ray flash: xmm-newton observations of grb 031203	grb031203 was observed by xmm-newton twice, first with an observationbeginning 6 hours after the burst, and again after 3 days. the afterglow hadaverage 0.2-10.0kev fluxes for the first and second observations of4.2+/-0.1x10^-13 and 1.8+/-0.1x10^-13 erg/cm^2/s respectively, decaying veryslowly according to a power-law with an index of -0.55+/-0.05. the prompt softx-ray flux, inferred from a detection of the dust echo of the prompt emission,strongly implies that this burst is very soft and should be classified as anx-ray flash (xrf) and further, implies a steep temporal slope (&lt;~-1.7) betweenthe prompt and afterglow phases or in the early afterglow, very different fromthe later afterglow decay slope. a power-law (gamma=1.90+/-0.05) withabsorption at a level consistent with the galactic foreground absorption fitsthe afterglow spectrum well. a bright, low-redshift (z=0.105) galaxy lieswithin 0.5 arcsec of the x-ray position and is likely to be the grb host. atthis redshift, grb031203 is the closest grb or xrf known after grb980425. ithas a very low equivalent isotropic gamma-ray energy in the burst (~3x10^49erg) and x-ray luminosity in the afterglow (9x10^42 erg/s at 10 hours), 3-4orders of magnitude less than typical bursts, though higher than either thefaint xrf020903 or grb980425. the rapid initial decline and subsequent veryslow fading of the x-ray afterglow is also similar to that observed ingrb980425, indicating that grb031203 may be representative of low luminositybursts.

astro-ph;0402240	on the afterglow of the x-ray flash of july 23 2003: photometric  evidence for an off-axis gamma-ray burst with an associated supernova?	we present optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of the x-rayflash (xrf) of july 23 2003. our observations in the r-band cover the temporalrange from 4.2 h to 64 days after the high energy event. we also present theresults of multicolor imaging extending to the k-band on three epochs. thelightcurve of the r-band afterglow the first week after the burst is similar tothe lightcurve for long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a brokenpower-law with a late time slope of alpha=-2.0 (f_nu propto t^alpha).furthermore, the spectral energy distribution (sed) has a power-law (f_nupropto nu^beta) shape with slope beta=-1.0. however, the decay slope at t&lt;1 dayis shallow, consistent with zero. this is in qualitative agreement with theprediction that xrfs are off-axis classical grbs. after the first week there isa strong bump in the lightcurve, which peaks at around 16 days. the sed afterthe peak becomes significantly redder. we discuss the possible interpretationsof this bump, and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likelyexplanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of thesed. finally, we present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglowand in the bump phase. a firm upper limit of z=2.3 is placed on the redshift ofxrf030723 from the lack of ly-alpha forest lines in the spectrum of theafterglow. the lack of significant absorption and emission lines in either ofthe two spectra excludes a spectroscopic redshift determination.

astro-ph;0505542	ly-alpha and uv emission from high-redshift grb hosts: to what extent do  grbs trace star formation?	we report the result of a search for ly-alpha emission from the host galaxiesof the gamma-ray bursts (grbs) 030226 (z = 1.986), 021004 (z = 2.335) and020124 (z = 3.198). we find that the host galaxy of grb 021004 is an extended(around 8 kpc) strong ly-alpha emitter with a restframe equivalent width (ew)of 68^{+12}_{-11} aa, and a star-formation rate of 10.6 +/- 2.0 m_sun/yr. we donot detect the hosts of grb 030226 and grb 020124, but the upper limits ontheir ly-alpha fluxes do not rule out large restframe ews. in the fields of grb021004 and grb 030226 we find seven and five other galaxies, respectively, withexcess emission in the narrow-band filter. these galaxies are candidately-alpha emitting galaxies in the environment of the host galaxies. we havealso compiled a list of all z &gt; 2 grb hosts, and demonstrate that a scenariowhere they trace star formation in an unbiased way is compatible with currentobservational constraints. fitting the z=3 luminosity function (lf) under thisassumption, results in a characteristic luminosity of r* = 24.6 and a faint endslope of alpha = -1.55, consistent with the lf measured for lyman-breakgalaxies.

astro-ph;0506101	on the afterglow and host galaxy of grb021004: a comprehensive study  with the hubble space telescope	(abridged) we report on hst observations of the late-time afterglow and hostgalaxy of grb021004 (z=2.33). although this grb is one of the best observed sofar, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations ofdata sets on this burst in the literature. we have observed the field ofgrb021004 with the hst at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 monthsafter the burst. with stis spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700aain the restframe. from the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of thelyman-limit we constrain the hi column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 basedon acs and nicmos imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromaticallywithin the errors. the color changes observed by other authors during the firstfour days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on anafterglow component with a constant spectral shape. this achromaticity impliesthat the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of thespectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. the optical-to-x-ray slope isconsistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. thisindicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according tofireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.the late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and isinconsistent with a single power-law. this could be due to a late-timeflattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due toexcess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. the host is astarburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong ly-alpha emission.the afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the hostsuggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.

astro-ph;0604153	are short gamma-ray bursts collimated? grb050709, a flare but no break	from the small sample of afterglow lightcurves of short duration gamma-raybursts (grbs), the decays are rapid, roughly following a power-law in time. ithas been assumed that the afterglow emission in short grbs is collimated injets in the same way as in long grbs. an achromatic break in a short grbafterglow lightcurve would therefore be strong evidence in favour ofcollimation in short grbs. we examine the optical lightcurve of the afterglowof the short grb 050709, the only short grb where a jet break has been claimedfrom optical data. we show that (1) the decay follows a single power-law from1.4 to 19 days after the burst and has a decay index alpha =1.73_{-0.04}^{+0.11}, (2) that an optical flare at ~10 days is required by thedata, roughly contemporaneous with a flare in the x-ray data, and (3) thatthere is no evidence for a break in the lightcurve. this means that so farthere is no direct evidence for collimation in the outflows of short grbs. theavailable limits on the collimation angles in short grbs now strongly suggestmuch wider opening angles than found in long grbs.

astro-ph;0609450	hi column densities of z &gt; 2 swift gamma-ray bursts	context: before the launch of the swift satellite, the majority of thegamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows for which ly-alpha was redshifted into theobservable spectrum showed evidence for a damped ly-alpha absorber. this smallsample indicated that grbs explode either in galaxies, or regions within them,having high neutral hydrogen column densities.  aims: to increase the spectroscopic sample of grbs with z &gt; 2 and henceestablish the n(hi) distribution along grb lines-of-sight.  methods: we have obtained six z &gt; 2 grb afterglow spectra and fitted thely-alpha absorption line in each case to determine n(hi). this has beencomplemented with 12 other swift n(hi) values from the literature.  results: we show that the peak of the grb n(hi) distribution is qualitativelyconsistent with a model where grbs originate in galactic-like molecular clouds.however, a systematic difference, in particular an excess of low column-densitysystems compared to the predictions, indicates that selection effects andconditions within the cloud (e.g. strong ionization) influence the observedn(hi) range. we also report the discovery of ly-alpha emission from the grb060714 host, corresponding to a star-formation rate of approximately 0.8m_sun/year. finally, we present accurate redshifts of the six bursts: z = 3.240+/- 0.001 (grb 050319), z = 2.198 +/- 0.002 (grb 050922c), z = 3.221 +/- 0.001(grb 060526), z = 3.425 +/- 0.002 (grb 060707), z = 2.711 +/- 0.001 (grb060714) and z = 3.686 +/- 0.002 (grb 060906).

astro-ph;0701736	the nature of the x-ray flash of august 24 2005	we present comprehensive photometric r-band observations of the fadingoptical afterglow of the x-ray flash xrf050824, from 11 minutes to 104 daysafter the burst. the r-band lightcurve of the afterglow resembles thelightcurves of long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a power-law albeitwith a rather shallow slope of alpha=0.6. our late r-band images reveal thehost galaxy with a rest-frame b-band luminosity corresponding to roughly 0.5lstar. the star-formation rate as determined from the [o ii] emission lineluminosity is about 1.8 msun per year. when accounting for the hostcontribution, the slope is alpha=0.65+-0.01 and a break in the lightcurve isalso suggested. a potential lightcurve bump at 2 weeks can be interpreted as asupernova only if this is a supernova with a fast rise and a fast decay.however, the overall fit still show excess scatter in the lightcurve due towiggles and bumps. the flat lightcurves in the optical and x-rays could beexplained by a continuous energy injection scenario with an on-axis viewingangle and a wide jet opening angle (theta_j&gt;10 deg). if the energy injectionsare episodic, this could potentially help explain the bumps and wiggles.spectroscopy of the afterglow give a redshift of z=0.828+-0.005 from bothabsorption and emission lines. the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theafterglow has a power-law shape with slope beta=0.56+-0.04. this can becompared to the x-ray spectral index which is betax=1.0+-0.1. the curvature ofthe sed constrain the dust reddening towards the burst to av&lt;0.5 mag.(abridged)

astro-ph;0702537	very different x-ray to optical column density ratios in gamma-ray burst  afterglows: ionisation in grb environments	we compare the hi column densities from ly-alpha absorption to the metalcolumn densities from x-ray absorption in gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows.eight bursts of seventeen entering the sample, have significant extragalacticx-ray absorptions. of these we find a range in metallicities from sub-solar toa few hundred times the solar value. there is a complete lack of correlationbetween the x-ray and optical column densities. this, and the large range andextreme values of these 'metallicities', suggest that the column densitiesderived by one or both methods are not a reliable indication of the true totalcolumn densities towards grbs. ionisation of the grb's gas cloud to largedistances along the line of sight seems the most likely cause. from the lowerlimit on the total column density and the uv luminosity of the grbs, we derivea maximum distance to the majority of the gas surrounding grbs of ~3 pc,suggesting that the gas probed by optical afterglow spectra is not the cloud inwhich the burst occurs. this is an encouraging result for the use of grboptical afterglows as probes of the interstellar medium (ism) in their hostgalaxies, as the ism observed is less likely to be strongly affected by the grbor its progenitor.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.
