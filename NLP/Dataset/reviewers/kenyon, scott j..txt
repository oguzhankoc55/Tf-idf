0901.2603	stellar mass dependent disk dispersal	we use published optical spectral and ir excess data from nine young clustersand associations to study the stellar mass dependent dispersal of circumstellardisks. all clusters older than ~3 myr show a decrease in disk fraction withincreasing stellar mass for solar to higher mass stars. this result issignificant at about the 1 $\sigma$ level in each cluster. for the complete setof clusters we reject the null hypothesis--that solar and intermediate-massstars lose their disks at the same rate--with 95-99.9% confidence. to interpretthis behaviour, we investigate the impact of grain growth, binary companions,and photoevaporation on the evolution of disk signatures. changes in graingrowth timescales at fixed disk temperature may explain why early-type starswith ir excesses appear to evolve faster than their later-type counterparts.little evidence that binary companions affect disk evolution suggests thatphotoevaporation is the more likely mechanism for disk dispersal. a simplephotoevaporation model provides a good fit to the observed disk fractions forsolar and intermediate-mass stars. although the current mass-dependent diskdispersal signal is not strong, larger and more complete samples of clusterswith ages of 3-5 myr can improve the significance and provide better tests oftheoretical models. in addition, the orbits of extra-solar planets canconstrain models of disk dispersal and migration. we suggest that the signatureof stellar mass dependent disk dispersal due to photoevaporation may be presentin the orbits of observed extra solar planets. planets orbiting hosts moremassive than ~1.6 msun may have larger orbits because the disks in which theyformed were dispersed before they could migrate.

0903.2666	the last gasp of gas giant planet formation: a spitzer study of the 5  myr-old cluster ngc 2362	(abridged) we describe spitzer irac and mips observations of the populous, 5myr-old open cluster ngc 2362. early/intermediate-type confirmed/candidatecluster members either have photospheric mid-ir emission or weak,optically-thin infrared excess emission at &lt; 24 microns consistent with debrisdisks. few late-type, solar/subsolar-mass stars have primordial disks. the diskpopulation around late-type stars is dominated by disks with inner holes(canonical 'transition disks') and 'homologously depleted' disks. both types ofdisks represent an intermediate stage between primordial disks and debrisdisks. thus, we find that multiple paths for the primordial-to-debris disktransition exist. our results undermine standard arguments in favor of a ~ 0.01myr year timescale for the transition based on data from taurus-auriga and ruleout standard uv photoevaporation scenarios as the primary mechanism to explainthe transition. combining our data with other spitzer surveys, we investigatethe evolution of debris disks around high/intermediate-mass stars andinvestigate timescales for giant planet formation. if the gas and dust in disksevolve on similar timescales, the formation timescale for gas giant planetssurrounding early-type, high/intermediate-mass stars is likely 1--5 myr. mostsolar/subsolar-mass stars detected by spitzer have seds that indicate theirdisks may be actively leaving the primordial disk phase. thus, gas giant planetformation may also occur by 5 myr around solar/subsolar-mass stars as well.

0907.5567	runaway stars, hypervelocity stars, and radial velocity surveys	runaway stars ejected from the galactic disk populate the halo of the milkyway. to predict the spatial and kinematic properties of runaways, we injectstars into a galactic potential, compute their trajectories through the galaxy,and derive simulated catalogs for comparison with observations. runaways have aflattened spatial distribution, with higher velocity stars at galacticlatitudes less than 30 degrees. due to their shorter stellar lifetimes, massiverunaway stars are more concentrated towards the disk than low mass runaways.bound (unbound) runaways that reach the halo probably originate from distancesof 6--12 kpc (10--15 kpc) from the galactic center, close to the estimatedorigin of the unbound runaway star hd 271791. because runaways are brighter andhave smaller velocities than hypervelocity stars (hvss), radial velocitysurveys are unlikely to confuse runaway stars with hvss. we estimate that atmost 1 runaway star contaminates the current sample. we place an upper limit of2% on the fraction of a-type main sequence stars ejected as runaways.

0910.2242	velocity dispersion profile of the milky way halo	we present a spectroscopic sample of 910 distant halo stars from thehypervelocity star survey from which we derive the velocity dispersion profileof the milky way halo. the sample is a mix of 74% evolved horizontal branchstars and 26% blue stragglers. we estimate distances to the stars usingobserved colors, metallicities, and stellar evolution tracks. our samplecontains twice as many objects with r&gt;50 kpc as previous surveys. we computethe velocity dispersion profile in two ways: with a parametric method based ona milky way potential model, and with a non-parametric method based on thecaustic technique originally developed to measure galaxy cluster mass profiles.the resulting velocity dispersion profiles are remarkably consistent with thosefound by two independent surveys based on other stellar populations: the milkyway halo exhibits a mean decline in radial velocity dispersion of -0.38+-0.12km/s/kpc over 15&lt;r&lt;75 kpc. this measurement is a useful basis for calculatingthe total mass and mass distribution of the milky way halo.

0911.4129	variations on debris disks ii. icy planet formation as a function of the  bulk properties and initial sizes of planetesimals	we describe comprehensive calculations of the formation of icy planets anddebris disks at 30-150 au around 1-3 solar mass stars. disks composed of large,strong planetesimals produce more massive planets than disks composed of small,weak planetesimals. the maximum radius of icy planets ranges from roughly 1500km to 11,500 km. the formation rate of 1000 km objects - `plutos' - is a usefulproxy for the efficiency of icy planet formation. plutos form more efficientlyin massive disks, in disks with small planetesimals, and in disks with a rangeof planetesimal sizes. although plutos form throughout massive disks, plutoproduction is usually concentrated in the inner disk. despite the large numberof plutos produced in many calculations, icy planet formation is inefficient.at the end of the main sequence lifetime of the central star, plutos containless than 10% of the initial mass in solid material. this conclusion isindependent of the initial mass in the disk or the properties of planetesimals.debris disk formation coincides with the formation of planetary systemscontaining plutos. as plutos form, they stir leftover planetesimals to largevelocities. a cascade of collisions then grinds the leftovers to dust, formingan observable debris disk. in disks with small (&lt; 1-10 km) planetesimals,collisional cascades produce luminous debris disks with maximum luminosityroughly 0.01 times the stellar luminosity. disks with larger planetesimalsproduce much less luminous debris disks. observations of debris disks arounda-type and g-type stars strongly favor models with small planetesimals. inthese models, our predictions for the time evolution and detection frequency ofdebris disks agree with published observations. we suggest several criticalobservations that can test key features of our calculations.

1005.1660	vortices as nurseries for planetesimal formation in protoplanetary discs	turbulent, two-dimensional, hydrodynamic flows are characterized by theemergence of coherent, long-lived vortices without a need to invoke specialinitial conditions. vortices have the ability to sequester particles, withtypical radii from about 1 mm to 10 cm, that are slightly decoupled from thegas. a generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperatureprofiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is thatfour vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. in particular, two of thezones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which smallparticles reside. particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scalenear and at the boundaries of this annulus. as the disc ages and the particlesgrow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks. older discs prefer tocapture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time,a phenomenon we term "vortex aging". more viscous, more dust-opaque and/or lessmassive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range ofparticle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc. thus, how efficiently adisc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales betweencoagulation and vortex aging. if vortices form in protoplanetary discs, theyare important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely tocondense out of the protostellar nebula. particle capture also occurs atdistances relevant to planet formation. future infrared, submillimetre andcentimetre observations of grain opacity as a function of radial distance willtest the hypothesis that vortices serve as nurseries for particle growth inprotoplanetary discs.

1005.2619	the mass profile of the galaxy to 80 kpc	the hypervelocity star survey presents the currently largest sample of radialvelocity measurements of halo stars out to 80 kpc. we apply spherical jeansmodeling to these data in order to derive the mass profile of the galaxy. werestrict the analysis to distances larger than 25 kpc from the galactic center,where the density profile of halo stars is well approximated by a single powerlaw with logarithmic slope between -3.5 and -4.5. with this restriction, wealso avoid the complication of modeling a flattened galactic disk. in the range25 &lt; r &lt; 80 kpc, the radial velocity dispersion declines remarkably little; arobust measure of its logarithmic slope is between -0.05 and -0.1. the circularvelocity profile also declines remarkably little with radius. the allowed rangeof v_c(80 kpc) lies between 175 and 231 km/s, with the most likely value 193km/s. compared with the value at the solar location, the galactic circularvelocity declines by less than 20% over an order of magnitude in radius. such aflat profile requires a massive and extended dark matter halo. the massenclosed within 80 kpc is 6.9(+3.0-1.2) 10^11 msun. our sample of radialvelocities is large enough that the biggest uncertainty in the mass is notstatistical but systematic, dominated by the density slope and anisotropy ofthe tracer population. further progress requires modeling observed datasetswithin realistic simulations of galaxy formation.

0704.0259	formation and collisional evolution of kuiper belt objects	this chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for theformation and collisional evolution of kbos at 20--150 au. we describe the mainpredictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamicalperturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify theevolution. although robust comparisons between observations and theory requirebetter kbo statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadlyconsistent with kbo formation in a massive disk followed by substantialcollisional grinding and dynamical ejection. however, there are importantproblems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of kbos and asteroidssuggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identificationof more dynamical families of kbos (like the 2003 el61 family), would provideadditional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding anddynamical ejection in the kuiper belt. the uncertainties also motivatecalculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'calculation that should give us a better picture of kbo formation andevolution.

0709.1471	hypervelocity stars iii. the space density and ejection history of main  sequence stars from the galactic center	we report the discovery of 3 new unbound hypervelocity stars (hvss), starstraveling with such extreme velocities that dynamical ejection from a massiveblack hole (mbh) is their only suggested origin. we also detect a population ofpossibly bound hvss. the significant asymmetry we observe in the velocitydistribution -- we find 26 stars with v_rf &gt; 275 km/s and 1 star with v_rf &lt;-275 km/s -- shows that the hvss must be short-lived, probably 3 - 4 msun mainsequence stars. any population of hypervelocity post-main sequence stars shouldcontain stars falling back onto the galaxy, contrary to the observations. thespatial distribution of hvss also supports the main sequence interpretation:longer-lived 3 msun hvss fill our survey volume; shorter-lived 4 msun hvss aremissing at faint magnitudes. we infer that there are 96 +- 10 hvss of mass 3 -4 msun within r &lt; 100 kpc, possibly enough hvss to constrain ejectionmechanisms and potential models. depending on the mass function of hvss, wepredict that segue may find up to 5 - 15 new hvss. the travel times of our hvssfavor a continuous ejection process, although a ~120 myr-old burst of hvss isalso allowed.

0710.1065	planet formation around stars of various masses: the snow line and the  frequency of giant planets	we use a semi-analytic circumstellar disk model that considers movement ofthe snow line through evolution of accretion and the central star toinvestigate how gas giant frequency changes with stellar mass. the snow linedistance changes weakly with stellar mass; thus giant planets form over a widerange of spectral types. the probability that a given star has at least one gasgiant increases linearly with stellar mass from 0.4 m_sun to 3 m_sun. starsmore massive than 3 m_sun evolve quickly to the main-sequence, which pushes thesnow line to 10-15 au before protoplanets form and limits the range of diskmasses that form giant planet cores. if the frequency of gas giants aroundsolar-mass stars is 6%, we predict occurrence rates of 1% for 0.4 m_sun starsand 10% for 1.5 m_sun stars. this result is largely insensitive to our assumedmodel parameters. finally, the movement of the snow line as stars &gt;2.5 m_sunmove to the main-sequence may allow the ocean planets suggested by leger et.al. to form without migration.

1112.1919	identifying star streams in the milky way halo	we develop statistical methods for identifying star streams in the halo ofthe milky way galaxy that exploit observed spatial and radial velocitydistributions. within a great circle, departures of the observed spatialdistribution from random provide a measure of the likelihood of a potentialstar stream. comparisons between the radial velocity distribution within agreat circle and the radial velocity distribution of the entire sample alsomeasure the statistical significance of potential streams. the radialvelocities enable construction of a more powerful joint statistical test foridentifying star streams in the milky way halo. applying our method to halostars in the hypervelocity star (hvs) survey, we detect the sagittarius streamat high significance. great circle counts and comparisons with theoreticalmodels suggest that the sagittarius stream comprises 10% to 17% of the halostars in the hvs sample. the population of blue stragglers and blue horizontalbranch stars varies along the stream and is a potential probe of thedistribution of stellar populations in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy prior todisruption.

1203.2918	wind-accretion disks in wide binaries, second generation protoplanetary  disks and accretion onto white dwarfs	mass transfer from an evolved donor star to its binary companion is astandard feature of stellar evolution in binaries. in wide binaries, thecompanion star captures some of the mass ejected in a wind by the primary star.the captured material forms an accretion disk. here, we study the evolution ofwind-accretion disks, using a numerical approach which allows us to follow thelong term evolution. for a broad range of initial conditions, we derive theradial density and temperature profiles of the disk. in most cases,wind-accretion leads to long-lived stable disks over the lifetime of the agbdonor star. the disks have masses of a few times 10^{-5}-10^{-3} m_sun, withsurface density and temperature profiles that follow broken power-laws. thetotal mass in the disk scales approximately linearly with the viscosityparameter used. roughly 50% to 80% of the mass falling into the disk accretesonto the central star; the rest flows out through the outer edge of the diskinto the stellar wind of the primary. for systems with large accretion rates,the secondary accretes as much as 0.1 m_sun. when the secondary is a whitedwarf, accretion naturally leads to nova and supernova eruptions. for all typesof secondary star, the surface density and temperature profiles of massivedisks resemble structures observed in protoplanetary disks, suggesting thatcoordinated observational programs might improve our understanding of uncertaindisk physics.

1203.3543	mmt hypervelocity star survey. ii. five new unbound stars	we present the discovery of five new unbound hypervelocity stars (hvss) inthe outer milky way halo. using a conservative estimate of galactic escapevelocity, our targeted spectroscopic survey has now identified 16 unbound hvssas well as a comparable number of hvss ejected on bound trajectories. agalactic center origin for the hvss is supported by their unbound velocities,the observed number of unbound stars, their stellar nature, their ejection timedistribution, and their galactic latitude and longitude distribution. otherproposed origins for the unbound hvss, such as runaway ejections from the diskor dwarf galaxy tidal debris, cannot be reconciled with the observations. anintriguing result is the spatial anisotropy of hvss on the sky, which possiblyreflects an anisotropic potential in the central 10-100 pc region of thegalaxy. further progress requires measurement of the spatial distribution ofhvss over the southern sky. our survey also identifies seven b supergiantsassociated with known star-forming galaxies; the absence of b supergiantselsewhere in the survey implies there are no new star-forming galaxies in oursurvey footprint to a depth of 1-2 mpc.

1206.4057	the nature of hypervelocity stars and the time between their formation  and ejection	we obtain keck hires spectroscopy of hvs5, one of the fastest unbound starsin the milky way halo. we show that hvs5 is a 3.62 +- 0.11 msun main sequence bstar at a distance of 50 +- 5 kpc. the difference between its age and itsflight time from the galactic center is 105 +-18(stat)+-30(sys) myr; flighttimes from locations elsewhere in the galactic disk are similar. this 10^8 yr`arrival time' between formation and ejection is difficult to reconcile withany ejection scenario involving massive stars that live for only 10^7 yr. forcomparison, we derive arrival times of 10^7 yr for two unbound runaway b stars,consistent with their disk origin where ejection results from a supernova in abinary system or dynamical interactions between massive stars in a dense starcluster. for hvs5, ejection during the first 10^7 yr of its lifetime is ruledout at the 3-sigma level. together with the 10^8 yr arrival times inferred forthree other well-studied hypervelocity stars (hvss), these results areconsistent with a galactic center origin for the hvss. if the hvss were indeedejected by the central black hole, then the galactic center was forming stars~200 myr ago, and the progenitors of the hvss took ~100 myr to enter the blackhole's loss cone.

1301.3211	migration of small moons in saturn's rings	the motions of small moons through saturn's rings provide excellent tests ofradial migration models. in theory, torque exchange between these moons andring particles leads to radial drift. we predict that moons with hill radii r_h~ 2-24 km should migrate through the a ring in 1000 yr. in this size range,moons orbiting in an empty gap or in a full ring eventually migrate at the samerate. smaller moons or moonlets -- such as the propellers (e.g., tiscareno etal. 2006) -- are trapped by diffusion of disk material into corotating orbits,creating inertial drag. larger moons -- such as pan or atlas -- do not migratebecause of their own inertia. fast migration of 2-24 km moons should eliminateintermediate-size bodies from the a ring and may be responsible for theobserved large-radius cutoff of r_h ~ 1-2 km in the size distribution of the aring's propeller moonlets. although the presence of daphnis (r_h ~ 5 km) insidethe keeler gap challenges this scenario, numerical simulations demonstrate thatorbital resonances and stirring by distant, larger moons (e.g., mimas) may beimportant factors. for daphnis, stirring by distant moons seems the mostpromising mechanism to halt fast migration. alternatively, daphnis may be arecent addition to the ring that is settling into a low inclination orbit in~10^3 yr prior to a phase of rapid migration. we provide predictions ofobservational constraints required to discriminate among possible scenarios fordaphnis.

1303.0280	the formation of pluto's low mass satellites	motivated by the new horizons mission, we consider how pluto's smallsatellites -- currently styx, nix, kerberos, and hydra -- grow in debris fromthe giant impact that forms the pluto-charon binary. after the impact, plutoand charon accrete some of the debris and eject the rest from the binary orbit.during the ejection, high velocity collisions among debris particles produce acollisional cascade, leading to the ejection of some debris from the system andenabling the remaining debris particles to find stable orbits around thebinary. our numerical simulations of coagulation and migration show thatcollisional evolution within a ring or a disk of debris leads to a few smallsatellites orbiting pluto-charon. these simulations are the first todemonstrate migration-induced mergers within a particle disk. the finalsatellite masses correlate with the initial disk mass. more massive disks tendto produce fewer satellites. for the current properties of the satellites, ourresults strongly favor initial debris masses of 3-10 x 10^{19} g and currentsatellite albedos of roughly 0.4-1. we also predict an ensemble of smallersatellites with radii less than roughly 1-3 km, and very small particles, withradii of roughly 1-100 cm and optical depth smaller than 10^-10. these objectsshould have semimajor axes outside the current orbit of hydra.

1410.2816	the fate of scattered planets	as gas giant planets evolve, they may scatter other planets far from theiroriginal orbits to produce hot jupiters or rogue planets that are notgravitationally bound to any star. here, we consider planets cast out to largeorbital distances on eccentric, bound orbits through a gaseous disk. withsimple numerical models, we show that super-earths can interact with the gasthrough dynamical friction to settle in the remote outer regions of a planetarysystem. outcomes depend on planet mass, the initial scattered orbit, and theevolution of the time-dependent disk. efficient orbital damping by dynamicalfriction requires planets at least as massive as the earth. more massive,longer-lived disks damp eccentricities more efficiently than less massive,short-lived ones. transition disks with an expanding inner cavity cancircularize orbits at larger distances than disks that experience a global(homologous) decay in surface density. thus, orbits of remote planets mayreveal the evolutionary history of their primordial gas disks. a remote planetwith an orbital distance ~100 au from the sun is plausible and might explaincorrelations in the orbital parameters of several distant trans-neptunianobjects.

0804.2296	planet formation around stars of various masses: hot super-earths	we consider trends resulting from two formation mechanisms for short-periodsuper-earths: planet-planet scattering and migration. we model scenarios wherethese planets originate near the snow line in ``cold finger'' circumstellardisks. low-mass planet-planet scattering excites planets to low periastronorbits only for lower mass stars. with long circularisation times, theseplanets reside on long-period eccentric orbits. closer formation regions meanplanets that reach short-period orbits by migration are most common aroundlow-mass stars. above ~1 solar mass, planets massive enough to migrate toclose-in orbits before the gas disk dissipates are above the critical mass forgas giant formation. thus, there is an upper stellar mass limit forshort-period super-earths that form by migration. if disk masses aredistributed as a power law, planet frequency increases with metallicity becausemost disks have low masses. for disk masses distributed around a relativelyhigh mass, planet frequency decreases with increasing metallicity. as icyplanets migrate, they shepherd interior objects toward the star, which grow to~1 earth mass. in contrast to icy migrators, surviving shepherded planets arerocky. upon reaching short-period orbits, planets are subject to evaporationprocesses. the closest planets may be reduced to rocky or icy cores. low-massstars have lower euv luminosities, so the level of evaporation decreases withdecreasing stellar mass.

astro-ph;0011022	the tully-fisher relation as a measure of luminosity evolution: a low  redshift baseline for evolving galaxies	we use optical rotation curves to investigate the r-band tully-fisherproperties of a sample of 90 spiral galaxies in close pairs. the galaxiesfollow the tully-fisher relation remarkably well, with the exception of eightdistinct 3-sigma outliers. although most of the outliers show signs of recentstar formation, gasdynamical effects are probably the dominant cause of theiranomalous tully-fisher properties. four outliers with small emission linewidths have very centrally concentrated line emission and truncated rotationcurves; the central emission indicates recent gas infall after a closegalaxy-galaxy pass. these four galaxies may be local counterparts to compact,blue galaxies at intermediate redshift. the remaining galaxies have anegligible offset from the reference tully-fisher relation, but a shallowerslope (2.6-sigma significance) and a 25% larger scatter. we characterize thenon-outlier sample with measures of distortion and star formation to search forthird parameter dependence in the residuals of the tf relation. severekinematic distortion is the only significant predictor of tf residuals; thisdistortion is not, however, responsible for the slope difference from thereference distribution.  because the outliers are easily removed by sigma clipping, we conclude thateven in the presence of some tidal distortion, detection of moderate luminosityevolution should be possible with high-redshift samples the size of this90-galaxy study.

astro-ph;0111283	infrared signatures of protoplanetary disk evolution	we investigate the observational signatures of a straightforward evolutionaryscenario for protoplanetary disks in which the disk mass of small (50 micron)particles decreases homologously with time, but the disk structure and stellarparameters do not change. our goal is to identify optimal infrared spectralindicators of the existence of disks, their structure, and mass evolution thatmay be tested with the upcoming sirtf mission. we present simulated spectralenergy distributions and colors over a wide range of masses. the sed is mostsensitive to disk mass in the far-ir and longer wavelengths, which is alreadyknown from millimeter and radio observations. as the disk mass decreases, theexcess emission of the disk over the stellar photosphere diminishes morerapidly at the longest rather than at short wavelengths. at near-infraredwavelengths, the disk remains optically thick to stellar radiation over a widerange of disk mass, resulting in a slower decline in the sed in this spectralregime. therefore, near-ir excesses (k-l) provide a robust means of detectingdisks in star clusters down to 1e-7 solar masses, while the far-ir excessprobes the disk mass. reducing the disk mass results in a clear progression incolor-color diagrams with low mass disks displaying the bluest colors. weinterpret color-color diagrams for taurus-auriga sources in the context ofdecreasing disk mass.

astro-ph;0111384	collisional cascades in planetesimal disks i. stellar flybys	we use a new multiannulus planetesimal accretion code to investigate theevolution of a planetesimal disk following a moderately close encounter with apassing star. the calculations include fragmentation, gas andpoynting-robertson drag, and velocity evolution from dynamical friction andviscous stirring. we assume that the stellar encounter increases planetesimalvelocities to the shattering velocity, initiating a collisional cascade in thedisk. during the early stages of our calculations, erosive collisions dampparticle velocities and produce substantial amounts of dust. for a wide rangeof initial conditions and input parameters, the time evolution of the dustluminosity follows a simple relation, l_d/l_{\star} = l_0 / [alpha +(t/t_d)^{beta}]. the maximum dust luminosity l_0 and the damping time t_ddepend on the disk mass, with l_0 proportional to m_d and t_d proportional tom_d^{-1}. for disks with dust masses of 1% to 100% of the `minimum mass solarnebula' (1--100 earth masses at 30--150 au), our calculations yield t_d approx1--10 myr, alpha approx 1--2, beta = 1, and dust luminosities similar to therange observed in known `debris disk' systems, l_0 approx 10^{-3} to 10^{-5}.less massive disks produce smaller dust luminosities and damp on longertimescales. because encounters with field stars are rare, these results implythat moderately close stellar flybys cannot explain collisional cascades indebris disk systems with stellar ages of 100 myr or longer.

astro-ph;0112120	planet formation in the outer solar system	this paper reviews coagulation models for planet formation in the kuiperbelt, emphasizing links to recent observations of our and other solar systems.at heliocentric distances of 35-50 au, single annulus and multiannulusplanetesimal accretion calculations produce several 1000 km or larger planetsand many 50-500 km objects on timescales of 10-30 myr in a minimum mass solarnebula. planets form more rapidly in more massive nebulae. all models yield twopower law cumulative size distributions, n_c propto r^{-q} with q = 3.0-3.5 forradii larger than 10 km and n_c propto r^{-2.5} for radii less than 1 km. thesesize distributions are consistent with observations of kuiper belt objectsacquired during the past decade. once large objects form at 35-50 au,gravitational stirring leads to a collisional cascade where 0.1-10 km objectsare ground to dust. the collisional cascade removes 80% to 90% of the initialmass in the nebula in roughly 1 gyr. this dust production rate is comparable torates inferred for alpha lyr, beta pic, and other extrasolar debris disksystems.

astro-ph;0605326	x-ray emitting blast wave from the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi	stellar explosions such as novae and supernovae produce most of the heavyelements in the universe. although the onset of novae from runawaythermonuclear fusion reactions on the surface of a white dwarf in a binary starsystem is understood[1], the structure, dynamics, and mass of the ejecta arenot well known. in rare cases, the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebulaof a red-giant companion; the explosion products plow through the nebula andproduce x-ray emission. early this year, an eruption of the recurrent nova rsophiuchi[2,3] provided the first opportunity to perform comprehensive x-rayobservations of such an event and diagnose conditions within the ejecta. herewe show that the hard x-ray emission from rs ophiuchi early in the eruptionemanates from behind a blast wave, or outward-moving shock wave, that expandedfreely for less than 2 days and then decelerated due to interaction with thenebula. the x-rays faded rapidly, suggesting that the blast wave deviates fromthe standard spherical shell structure[4-6]. the early onset of decelerationindicates that the ejected shell had a low mass, the white dwarf has a highmass[7], and that rs ophiuchi is a progenitor of the type of supernova integralto studies of the expansion of the universe.
