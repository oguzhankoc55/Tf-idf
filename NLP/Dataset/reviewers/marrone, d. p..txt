0907.3786	simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of sgr a* during 2007 april  1-11	we report the detection of variable emission from sgr a* in almost allwavelength bands (i.e. centimeter, millimeter, submillimeter, near-ir andx-rays) during a multi-wavelength observing campaign. three new moderate flaresare detected simultaneously in both near-ir and x-ray bands. the ratio of x-rayto near-ir flux in the flares is consistent with inverse compton scattering ofnear-ir photons by submillimeter emitting relativistic particles which followscaling relations obtained from size measurements of sgr a*. we also find thatthe flare statistics in near-ir wavelengths is consistent with the probabilityof flare emission being inversely proportional to the flux. at millimeterwavelengths, the presence of flare emission at 43 ghz (7mm) using vlba withmilli-arcsecond spatial resolution indicates the first direct evidence thathourly time scale flares are localized within the inner 30$\times$70schwarzschild radii of sgr a*. we also show several cross correlation plotsbetween near-ir, millimeter and submillimeter light curves that collectivelydemonstrate the presence of time delays between the peaks of emission up tothree hours. the evidence for time delays at millimeter and submillimeterwavelengths are consistent with the source of emission being optically thickinitially followed by a transition to an optically thin regime. in particular,there is an intriguing correlation between the optically thin near-ir and x-rayflare and optically thick radio flare at 43 ghz that occurred on 2007 april 4.this would be the first evidence of a radio flare emission at 43 ghz delayedwith respect to the near-ir and x-ray flare emission.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

0912.2341	a method for individual source brightness estimation in single- and  multi-band data	we present a method of reliably extracting the flux of individual sourcesfrom sky maps in the presence of noise and a source population in which numbercounts are a steeply falling function of flux. the method is an extension of astandard bayesian procedure in the millimeter/submillimeter literature. as inthe standard method, the prior applied to source flux measurements is derivedfrom an estimate of the source counts as a function of flux, dn/ds. the keyfeature of the new method is that it enables reliable extraction of propertiesof individual sources, which previous methods in the literature do not. wefirst present the method for extracting individual source fluxes from data in asingle observing band, then we extend the method to multiple bands, includingprior information about the spectral behavior of the source population(s). themulti-band estimation technique is particularly relevant for classifyingindividual sources into populations according to their spectral behavior. wefind that proper treatment of the correlated prior information betweenobserving bands is key to avoiding significant biases in estimations ofmulti-band fluxes and spectral behavior, biases which lead to significantnumbers of misclassified sources. we test the single- and multi-band versionsof the method using simulated observations with observing parameters similar tothat of the south pole telescope data used in vieira, et al.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1210.4970	sptpol: an instrument for cmb polarization measurements with the south  pole telescope	sptpol is a dual-frequency polarization-sensitive camera that was deployed onthe 10-meter south pole telescope in january 2012. sptpol will measure thepolarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) on angularscales spanning an arcminute to several degrees. the polarization sensitivityof sptpol will enable a detection of the cmb "b-mode" polarization from thedetection of the gravitational lensing of the cmb by large scale structure, anda detection or improved upper limit on a primordial signal due to inflationarygravity waves. the two measurements can be used to constrain the sum of theneutrino masses and the energy scale of inflation. these science goals can beachieved through the polarization sensitivity of the sptpol camera and carefulcontrol of systematics. the sptpol camera consists of 768 pixels, eachcontaining two transition-edge sensor (tes) bolometers coupled to orthogonalpolarizations, and a total of 1536 bolometers. the pixels are sensitive tolight in one of two frequency bands centered at 90 and 150 ghz, with 180 pixelsat 90 ghz and 588 pixels at 150 ghz. the sptpol design has several featuresdesigned to control polarization systematics, including: single-moded feedhornswith low cross-polarization, bolometer pairs well-matched to differenceatmospheric signals, an improved ground shield design based on far-sidelobemeasurements of the spt, and a small beam to reduce temperature to polarizationleakage. we present an overview of the sptpol instrument design, projectstatus, and science projections.

1211.0085	the ionized circumstellar envelopes of orion source i and the becklin  neugebauer object	the 229 ghz (lambda 1.3mm) radio emission from orion-kl was mapped with up to0.14" angular resolution with carma, allowing measurements of the fluxdensities of source i ('srci') and the becklin-neugebauer object (bn), the 2most massive stars in this region. we find integrated flux densities of 310 +/-45 mjy for srci and 240 +/- 35 mjy for bn. srci is optically thick even at 229ghz. no trace of the h30alpha recombination line is seen in its spectrum,although the v_2=1, 5(5,0)-6(4,3) transition of h2o, 3450 k above the groundstate, is prominent. srci is elongated at position angle 140 degrees, as in 43ghz images. these results are most easily reconciled with models in which theradio emission from srci arises via the h- free-free opacity in a t &lt; 4500 kdisk, as considered by reid et al. (2007). by contrast, the radio spectrum ofbn is consistent with p+/e- free-free emission from a dense (n_e ~ 5x10^7cm^{-3}), but otherwise conventional, hypercompact hii region. the source isbecoming optically thin at 229 ghz, and the h30alpha recombination line, atvlsr = 23.2 +/- 0.5 km/sec, is prominent in its spectrum. a lyman continuumflux of 5x10^{45} photons/sec, consistent with that expected from a b star, isrequired to maintain the ionization. supplementary 90 ghz observations weremade to measure the h41alpha and h42alpha recombination lines toward bn.published 43 and 86 ghz data suggest that srci brightened with respect to bnover the 15 year period from 1994 to 2009.

1303.2723	dusty starburst galaxies in the early universe as revealed by  gravitational lensing	in the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has beenrevolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty, starburst galaxies were1,000 times more abundant in the early universe than at present. it has,however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift 2 distribution ofthese objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z &gt; 4). here we report aredshift survey at a wavelength of three millimeters, targeting carbon monoxideline emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction ofextraordinarily bright millimetrewave-selected sources. high-resolution imagingdemonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed byforeground galaxies. we detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources andmultiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust,unambiguous redshifts. at least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z &gt; 4,indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts isgreater than previously thought. models of lens geometries in the sampleindicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies,powered by extreme bursts of star formation.

1412.3304	optical &amp; sunyaev-zel'dovich observations of a new sample of distant  rich galaxy clusters in the rosat all sky survey	finding a sample of the most massive clusters with redshifts $z&gt;0.6$ canprovide an interesting consistency check of the $\lambda$ cold dark matter($\lambda$cdm) model. here we present results from our search for clusters with$0.6\lesssim z\lesssim1.0$ where the initial candidates were selected bycross-correlating the rass faint and bright source catalogues with red galaxiesfrom the sloan digital sky survey dr8. our survey thus covers$\approx10,000\,\rm{deg^2}$, much larger than previous studies of this kind.deeper follow-up observations in three bands using the william herscheltelescope and the large binocular telescope were performed to confirm thecandidates, resulting in a sample of 44 clusters for which we presentrichnesses and red sequence redshifts, as well as spectroscopic redshifts for asubset. at least two of the clusters in our sample are comparable in richnessto rcs2-$j$232727.7$-$020437, one of the richest systems discovered to date. wealso obtained new observations with the combined array for research inmillimeter astronomy for a subsample of 21 clusters. for 11 of those we detectthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signature. the sunyaev-zel'dovich signal allowsus to estimate $m_{200}$ and check for tension with the cosmological standardmodel. we find no tension between our cluster masses and the $\lambda$cdmmodel.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1503.02315	measurements of sub-degree b-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave  background from 100 square degrees of sptpol data	we present a measurement of the $b$-mode polarization power spectrum (the$bb$ spectrum) from 100 $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of sky observed with sptpol, apolarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the south poletelescope. the observations used in this work were taken during 2012 and early2013 and include data in spectral bands centered at 95 and 150 ghz. we reportthe $bb$ spectrum in five bins in multipole space, spanning the range $300 \le\ell \le 2300$, and for three spectral combinations: 95 ghz $\times$ 95 ghz, 95ghz $\times$ 150 ghz, and 150 ghz $\times$ 150 ghz. we subtract small ($&lt; 0.5\sigma$ in units of statistical uncertainty) biases from these spectra andaccount for the uncertainty in those biases. the resulting power spectra areinconsistent with zero power but consistent with predictions for the $bb$spectrum arising from the gravitational lensing of $e$-mode polarization. if weassume no other source of $bb$ power besides lensed $b$ modes, we determine apreference for lensed $b$ modes of $4.9 \sigma$. after marginalizing overtensor power and foregrounds, namely polarized emission from galactic dust andextragalactic sources, this significance is $4.3 \sigma$. fitting for a singleparameter, $a_\mathrm{lens}$, that multiplies the predicted lensed $b$-modespectrum, and marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, we find$a_\mathrm{lens} = 1.08 \pm 0.26$, indicating that our measured spectra areconsistent with the signal expected from gravitational lensing. the datapresented here provide the best measurement to date of the $b$-mode powerspectrum on these angular scales.

1508.06283	star-forming brightest cluster galaxies at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25: a  transitioning fuel supply	we present a multi-wavelength study of 90 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs)in a sample of galaxy clusters selected via the sunyaev zel'dovich effect bythe south pole telescope, utilizing data from various ground- and space-basedfacilities. we infer the star formation rate (sfr) for the bcg in each cluster,based on the uv and ir continuum luminosity, as well as the [o ii] emissionline luminosity in cases where spectroscopy is available, finding 7 systemswith sfr &gt; 100 msun/yr. we find that the bcg sfr exceeds 10 msun/yr in 31 of 90(34%) cases at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25, compared to ~1-5% at z ~ 0 from the literature.at z &gt; 1, this fraction increases to 92(+6)(-31)%, implying a steady decreasein the bcg sfr over the past ~9 gyr. at low-z, we find that the specific starformation rate in bcgs is declining more slowly with time than for field orcluster galaxies, most likely due to the replenishing fuel from the cooling icmin relaxed, cool core clusters. at z &gt; 0.6, the correlation between clustercentral entropy and bcg star formation - which is well established at z ~ 0 -is not present. instead, we find that the most star-forming bcgs at high-z arefound in the cores of dynamically unrelaxed clusters. we investigate therest-frame near-uv morphology of a subsample of the most star-forming bcgsusing data from the hubble space telescope, finding complex, highly asymmetricuv morphologies on scales as large as ~50-60 kpc. the high fraction ofstar-forming bcgs hosted in unrelaxed, non-cool core clusters at early timessuggests that the dominant mode of fueling star formation in bcgs may haverecently transitioned from galaxy-galaxy interactions to icm cooling.

1508.07369	sub-kiloparsec imaging of cool molecular gas in two strongly lensed  dusty, star-forming galaxies	we present spatially-resolved imaging obtained with the australia telescopecompact array (atca) of three co lines in two high-redshift gravitationallylensed dusty star-forming galaxies, discovered by the south pole telescope.strong lensing allows us to probe the structure and dynamics of the moleculargas in these two objects, at z=2.78 and z=5.66, with effective source-planeresolution of less than 1kpc. we model the lensed emission from multiple cotransitions and the dust continuum in a consistent manner, finding that thecold molecular gas as traced by low-j co always has a larger half-light radiusthan the 870um dust continuum emission. this size difference leads to up to 50%differences in the magnification factor for the cold gas compared to dust. inthe z=2.78 galaxy, these co observations confirm that the background source isundergoing a major merger, while the velocity field of the other source is morecomplex. we use the atca co observations and comparable resolution atacamalarge millimeter/submillimeter array dust continuum imaging of the same objectsto constrain the co-h_2 conversion factor with three different procedures,finding good agreement between the methods and values consistent with thosefound for rapidly star-forming systems. we discuss these galaxies in thecontext of the star formation - gas mass surface density relation, noting thatthe change in emitting area with observed co transition must be accounted forwhen comparing high-redshift galaxies to their lower redshift counterparts.

1509.02835	stellar masses and star formation rates of lensed dusty star-forming  galaxies from the spt survey	to understand cosmic mass assembly in the universe at early epochs, weprimarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate ofdistant galaxies. in this paper, we present stellar masses and star formationrates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. thesesources were first discovered by the south pole telescope (spt) at millimeterwavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derivedfrom alma observations. we have conducted follow-up observations, obtainingmulti-wavelength imaging data, using {\it hst}, {\it spitzer}, {\it herschel}and the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex). we use the high-resolution {\ithst}/wfc3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lensin {\it spitzer}/irac data. the detections and upper limits provide importantconstraints on the spectral energy distributions (seds) for these dsfgs,yielding stellar masses, ir luminosities, and star formation rates (sfrs). thesed fits of six spt sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a rangemore than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times10^{10}m_{\sun}$. the intrinsic ir luminosities range from 4$\times10^{12}l_{\sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}l_{\sun}$. they all have prodigiousintrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $m_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.compared to the star-forming main sequence (ms), these six dsfgs have specificsfrs that all lie above the ms, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10higher than the ms. our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoingstrong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

1510.01359	probing star formation in the dense environments of z~1 lensing halos  aligned with dusty star-forming galaxies detected with the south pole  telescope	we probe star formation in the environments of massive$\sim10^{13}\,m_{\odot}$ dark matter halos at redshifts of $z$$\sim$$1$. thisstar formation is linked to a sub-millimetre clustering signal which we detectin maps of the planck high frequency instrument that are stacked at thepositions of a sample of high-redshift ($z$$&gt;$$2$) strongly-lensed dustystar-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected from the south pole telescope (spt) 2500deg$^2$ survey. the clustering signal has sub-millimetre colours which areconsistent with the mean redshift of the foreground lensing halos($z$$\sim$$1$). we report a mean excess of star formation rate (sfr) comparedto the field, of $(2700\pm700)\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$ from all galaxiescontributing to this clustering signal within a radius of 3.5' from the sptdsfgs. the magnitude of the planck excess is in broad agreement withpredictions of a current model of the cosmic infrared background. the modelpredicts that 80$\%$ of the excess emission measured by planck originates fromgalaxies lying in the neighbouring halos of the lensing halo. using herschelmaps of the same fields, we find a clear excess, relative to the field, ofindividual sources which contribute to the planck excess. the mean excess sfrcompared to the field is measured to be ($370\pm40)$$\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$per resolved, clustered source. our findings suggest that the environmentsaround these massive $z$$\sim$$1$ lensing halos host intense star formation outto about $2\,$mpc. the flux enhancement due to clustering should also beconsidered when measuring flux densities of galaxies in planck data.

astro-ph;0210305	the cosmic microwave background anisotropy power spectrum measured by  archeops	we present a determination by the archeops experiment of the angular powerspectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy in 16 bins over themultipole range l=15-350. archeops was conceived as a precursor of the planckhfi instrument by using the same optical design and the same technology for thedetectors and their cooling. archeops is a balloon-borne instrument consistingof a 1.5 m aperture diameter telescope and an array of 21 photometersmaintained at ~100 mk that are operating in 4 frequency bands centered at 143,217, 353 and 545 ghz. the data were taken during the arctic night of february7, 2002 after the instrument was launched by cnes from esrange base (sweden).the entire data cover ~ 30% of the sky.this first analysis was obtained with asmall subset of the dataset using the most sensitive photometer in each cmbband (143 and 217 ghz) and 12.6% of the sky at galactic latitudes above 30degrees where the foreground contamination is measured to be negligible. thelarge sky coverage and medium resolution (better than 15 arcminutes) providefor the first time a high signal-to-noise ratio determination of the powerspectrum over angular scales that include both the first acoustic peak andscales probed by cobe/dmr. with a binning of delta(l)=7 to 25 the error barsare dominated by sample variance for l below 200. a companion paper details thecosmological implications.

astro-ph;0210306	cosmological constraints from archeops	we analyze the cosmological constraints that archeops places on adiabaticcold dark matter models with passive power-law initial fluctuations. becauseits angular power spectrum has small bins in l and large l coverage down tocobe scales, archeops provides a precise determination of the first acousticpeak in terms of position at multipole l_peak=220 +- 6, height and width. ananalysis of archeops data in combination with other cmb datasets constrains thebaryon content of the universe, omega(b)h^2 = 0.022 (+0.003,-0.004), compatiblewith big-bang nucleosynthesis and with a similar accuracy. using cosmologicalpriors obtainedfrom recent non-cmb data leads to yet tighter constraints on thetotal density, e.g. omega(tot)=1.00 (+0.03,-0.02) using the hst determinationof the hubble constant. an excellent absolute calibration consistency is foundbetween archeops and other cmb experiments, as well as with the previouslyquoted best fit model.the spectral index n is measured to be 1.04 (+0.10,-0.12)when the optical depth to reionization, tau, is allowed to vary as a freeparameter, and 0.96 (+0.03,-0.04) when tau is fixed to zero, both in goodagreement with inflation.

0809.5077	application of a self-similar pressure profile to sunyaev-zel'dovich  effect data from galaxy clusters	we investigate the utility of a new, self-similar pressure profile forfitting sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect observations of galaxy clusters. currentsz imaging instruments - such as the sunyaev-zel'dovich array (sza) - arecapable of probing clusters over a large range in physical scale. a model istherefore required that can accurately describe a cluster's pressure profileover a broad range of radii, from the core of the cluster out to a significantfraction of the virial radius. in the analysis presented here, we fit a radialpressure profile derived from simulations and detailed x-ray analysis ofrelaxed clusters to sza observations of three clusters with exceptionally highquality x-ray data: a1835, a1914, and cl j1226.9+3332. from the joint analysisof the sz and x-ray data, we derive physical properties such as gas mass, totalmass, gas fraction and the intrinsic, integrated compton y-parameter. we findthat parameters derived from the joint fit to the sz and x-ray data agree wellwith a detailed, independent x-ray-only analysis of the same clusters. inparticular, we find that, when combined with x-ray imaging data, this newpressure profile yields an independent electron radial temperature profile thatis in good agreement with spectroscopic x-ray measurements.
