0901.1313	the chemical history of molecules in circumstellar disks. i. ices	(abridged) aims &amp; methods. a two-dimensional, semi-analytical model ispresented that follows, for the first time, the chemical evolution from acollapsing molecular cloud (a pre-stellar core) to a protostar andcircumstellar disk. the model computes infall trajectories from any point inthe cloud and tracks the radial and vertical motion of material in theviscously evolving disk. it includes a full time-dependent radiative transfertreatment of the dust temperature, which controls much of the chemistry. asmall parameter grid is explored to understand the effects of the sound speedand the mass and rotation of the cloud. the freeze-out and evaporation ofcarbon monoxide (co) and water (h2o), as well as the potential for formingcomplex organic molecules in ices, are considered as important first steps toillustrate the full chemistry.  results. both species freeze out towards the centre before the collapsebegins. pure co ice evaporates during the infall phase and re-adsorbs in thoseparts of the disk that cool below the co desorption temperature of ~18 k. h2oremains solid almost everywhere during the infall and disk formation phases andevaporates within ~10 au of the star. mixed co-h2o ices are important inkeeping some solid co above 18 k and in explaining the presence of co incomets. material that ends up in the planet- and comet-forming zones of thedisk is predicted to spend enough time in a warm zone during the collapse toform first-generation complex organic species on the grains. the dynamicaltimescales in the hot inner envelope (hot core or hot corino) are too short forabundant formation of second-generation molecules by high-temperature gas-phasechemistry.

0902.3092	radiative transfer in very optically thick circumstellar disks	in this paper we present two efficient implementations of the diffusionapproximation to be employed in monte carlo computations of radiative transferin dusty media of massive circumstellar disks. the aim is to improve theaccuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computationtime. the accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in variouscorners of parameter space are investigated. the effects of using these methodson the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained fromhydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. two methods arepresented. first, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve theaccuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,where photon counts are low. second, a modified random walk approximation isemployed to decrease the computation time. this modified random walk ensuresthat the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape tothe lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in thedisk is still computed accurately. a new radiative transfer code, mcmax, ispresented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. thesecan be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decreasestatistical noise. we conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fastand accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structureand observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.

0903.1231	benchmark problems for continuum radiative transfer. high optical  depths, anisotropic scattering, and polarisation	solving the continuum radiative transfer equation in high opacity mediarequires sophisticated numerical tools. in order to test the reliability ofsuch tools, we present a benchmark of radiative transfer codes in a 2d discconfiguration. we test the accuracy of seven independently developed radiativetransfer codes by comparing the temperature structures, spectral energydistributions, scattered light images, and linear polarisation maps that eachmodel predicts for a variety of disc opacities and viewing angles. the testcases have been chosen to be numerically challenging, with midplane opticaldepths up 10^6, a sharp density transition at the inner edge and complexscattering matrices. we also review recent progress in the implementation ofthe monte carlo method that allow an efficient solution to these kinds ofproblems and discuss the advantages and limitations of monte carlo codescompared to those of discrete ordinate codes. for each of the test cases, thepredicted results from the radiative transfer codes are within good agreement.the results indicate that these codes can be confidently used to interpretpresent and future observations of protoplanetary discs.

0706.2614	dust crystallinity in protoplanetary disks: the effect of  diffusion/viscosity ratio	the process of turbulent radial mixing in protoplanetary disks has strongrelevance to the analysis of the spatial distribution of crystalline dustspecies in disks around young stars and to studies of the composition ofmeteorites and comets in our own solar system.  a debate has gone on in the recent literature on the ratio of the effectiveviscosity coefficient $\nu$ (responsible for accretion) to the turbulentdiffusion coefficient $d$ (responsible for mixing). numericalmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations have yielded values between $\nu/d\simeq 10$(carballido, stone &amp; pringle, 2005) and $\nu/d\simeq 0.85$ (johansen &amp; klahr,2005}). here we present two analytic arguments for the ratio $\nu/d=1/3$ whichare based on elegant, though strongly simplified assumptions. we argue thatwhichever of these numbers comes closest to reality may be determined {\emobservationally} by using spatially resolved mid-infrared measurements ofprotoplanetary disks around herbig stars. if meridional flows are present inthe disk, then we expect less abundance of crystalline dust in the surfacelayers, a prediction which can likewise be observationally tested withmid-infrared interferometers.

0906.0730	protoplanetary disk structures in ophiuchus	we present a high angular resolution (0.3" = 40 au) sma survey of the 870micron thermal continuum emission from 9 of the brightest, and therefore mostmassive, circumstellar disks in the ~1 myr-old ophiuchus star-forming region.using 2-d radiative transfer calculations, we simultaneously fit the observedcontinuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each diskwith a parametric structure model. compared to previous millimeter studies,this survey includes significant upgrades in modeling, data quality, andangular resolution that provide improved constraints on key structureparameters, particularly those that characterize the spatial distribution ofmass in the disks. in the context of a surface density profile motivated bysimilarity solutions for viscous accretion disks, the best-fit models for thesample disks have characteristic radii r_c = 20-200 au, high disk masses m_d =0.005-0.14 m_sun, and a narrow range of radial surface density gradients arounda median $\gamma$ = 0.9. these density structures are used in conjunction withaccretion rate estimates from the literature to help characterize the viscousevolution of the disk material. using the standard prescription for diskviscosities, those combined constraints indicate that $\alpha$ = 0.0005-0.08.three of the sample disks show large (r = 20-40 au) central cavities in theircontinuum emission morphologies, marking extensive zones where dust has beenphysically removed and/or has significantly diminished opacities. based on thecurrent requirements of planet formation models, these emission cavities andthe structure constraints for the sample as a whole suggest that these youngdisks may eventually produce planetary systems, and have perhaps alreadystarted.

0907.0985	dust retention in protoplanetary disks	context: protoplanetary disks are observed to remain dust-rich for up toseveral million years. theoretical modeling, on the other hand, raises severalquestions. firstly, dust coagulation occurs so rapidly, that if the small dustgrains are not replenished by collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates,most disks should be observed to be dust poor, which is not the case. secondly,if dust aggregates grow to sizes of the order of centimeters to meters, theydrift so fast inwards, that they are quickly lost.  aims: we attempt to verify if collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates iseffective enough to keep disks 'dusty' by replenishing the population of smallgrains and by preventing excessive radial drift.  methods: with a new and sophisticated implicitly integrated coagulation andfragmentation modeling code, we solve the combined problem of coagulation,fragmentation, turbulent mixing and radial drift and at the same time solve forthe 1-d viscous gas disk evolution.  results: we find that for a critical collision velocity of 1 m/s, assuggested by laboratory experiments, the fragmentation is so effective, that atall times the dust is in the form of relatively small particles. this meansthat radial drift is small and that large amounts of small dust particlesremain present for a few million years, as observed. for a critical velocity of10 m/s, we find that particles grow about two orders of magnitude larger, whichleads again to significant dust loss since larger particles are more stronglyaffected by radial drift.

0707.0304	cold disks: spitzer spectroscopy of disks around young stars with large  gaps	we have identified four circumstellar disks with a deficit of dust emissionfrom their inner 15-50 au. all four stars have f-g spectral type, and wereuncovered as part of the spitzer space telescope ``cores to disks'' legacyprogram infrared spectrograph (irs) first look survey of ~100 pre-main sequencestars. modeling of the spectral energy distributions indicates a reduction indust density by factors of 100-1000 from disk radii between ~0.4 and 15-50 au,but with massive gas-rich disks at larger radii. this large contrast betweenthe inner and outer disk has led us to use the term `cold disks' to distinguishthese unusual systems. however, hot dust [0.02-0.2 mmoon] is still presentclose to the central star (r ~0.8 au). we introduce the 30/13 micron, fluxdensity ratio as a new diagnostic for identifying cold disks. the mechanismsfor dust clearing over such large gaps are discussed. though rare, cold disksare likely in transition from an optically thick to an optically thin state,and so offer excellent laboratories for the study of planet formation.

0908.4153	c2d spitzer-irs spectra of disks around t tauri stars. iv. crystalline  silicates	dust grains in the planet forming regions around young stars are expected tobe heavily processed due to coagulation, fragmentation and crystallization.this paper focuses on the crystalline silicate dust grains in protoplanetarydisks. as part of the cores to disks legacy program, we obtained more than ahundred spitzer/irs spectra of ttauri stars. more than 3/4 of our objects showat least one crystalline silicate emission feature that can be essentiallyattributed to mg-rich silicates. observational properties of the crystallinefeatures seen at lambda &gt; 20 mu correlate with each other, while they arelargely uncorrelated with the properties of the amorphous silicate 10 mufeature. this supports the idea that the irs spectra essentially probe twoindependent disk regions: a warm zone (&lt; 1 au) emitting at lambda ~ 10 mu and amuch colder region emitting at lambda &gt; 20 mu (&lt; 10 au). we identify acrystallinity paradox, as the long-wavelength crystalline silicate features are3.5 times more frequently detected (~55 % vs. ~15%) than the crystallinefeatures arising from much warmer disk regions. this suggests that the disk hasan inhomogeneous dust composition within ~10 au. the abundant crystallinesilicates found far from their presumed formation regions suggests efficientoutward radial transport mechanisms in the disks. the analysis of the shape andstrength of both the amorphous 10 mu feature and the crystalline feature around23 mu provides evidence for the prevalence of micron-sized grains in upperlayers of disks. their presence in disk atmospheres suggests efficient verticaldiffusion, likely accompanied by grain-grain fragmentation to balance theefficient growth expected. finally, the depletion of submicron-sized grainspoints toward removal mechanisms such as stellar winds or radiation pressure.

0909.0975	radiative transfer models of mid-infrared h2o lines in the  planet-forming region of circumstellar disks	the study of warm molecular gas in the inner regions of protoplanetary disksis of key importance for the study of planet formation and especially for thetransport of h2o and organic molecules to the surfaces of rockyplanets/satellites. recent spitzer observations have shown that themid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks are covered in emission lines dueto water and other molecules. here, we present a non-lte 2d radiative transfermodel of water lines in the 10-36 mum range that can be used to constrain theabundance structure of water vapor, given an observed spectrum, and show thatan assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) does not accuratelyestimate the physical conditions of the water vapor emission zones. by applyingthe model to published spitzer spectra we find that: 1) most water lines aresubthermally excited, 2) the gas-to-dust ratio must be one to two orders ofmagnitude higher than the canonical interstellar medium ratio of 100-200, and3) the gas temperature must be higher than the dust temperature, and 4) thewater vapor abundance in the disk surface must be truncated beyond ~ 1 au. alow efficiency of water formation below ~ 300 k may naturally result in a lowerwater abundance beyond a certain radius. however, we find that chemistry, maynot be sufficient to produce an abundance drop of many orders of magnitude andspeculate that the depletion may also be caused by vertical turbulent diffusionof water vapor from the superheated surface to regions below the snow line,where the water can freeze out and be transported to the midplane as part ofthe general dust settling. such a vertical cold finger effect is likely to beefficient due to the lack of a replenishment mechanism of large, water-icecoated dust grains to the disk surface.

0909.5595	evidence for dust clearing through resolved submillimeter imaging	mid-infrared spectrophotometric observations have revealed a small sub-classof circumstellar disks with spectral energy distributions (seds) suggestive oflarge inner gaps with low dust content. however, such data provide only anindirect and model-dependent method of finding central holes. imaging ofprotoplanetry disks provides an independent check of sed modeling. we presenthere the direct characterization of three 33-47 au radii inner gaps, in thedisks around lkha 330, sr 21n and hd 135344b, via 340 ghz (880 micron) dustcontinuum aperture synthesis observations obtained with the submillimeter array(sma). the large gaps are fully resolved at ~0\farcs3 by the sma observationsand mostly empty of dust, with less than 1 - 7.5 x 10^-6 msolar of fine grainedsolids inside the holes. gas (as traced by atomic accretion markers and co 4.7micron rovibrational emission) is still present in the inner regions of allthree disks. for each, the inner hole exhibits a relatively steep rise in dustemission to the outer disk, a feature more likely to originate from thegravitational influence of a companion body than from a process expected toshow a more shallow gradient like grain growth. importantly, the good agreementof the spatially resolved data and spectrophotometry-based models lendsconfidence to current interpretations of seds, wherein the significant dustemission deficits arise from disks with inner gaps or holes. further sed-basedsearches can therefore be expected to yield numerous additional candidates thatcan be examined at high spatial resolution.

1001.0488	the outcome of protoplanetary dust growth: pebbles, boulders, or  planetesimals? ii. introducing the bouncing barrier	the sticking of micron sized dust particles due to surface forces incircumstellar disks is the first stage in the production of asteroids andplanets. the key ingredients that drive this process are the relative velocitybetween the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dustaggregate collisions. here we present the results of a collision model, whichis based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. we investigate themaximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation inprotoplanetary disks. we model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 au at themidplane at three different gas densities. we find that the evolution of thedust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles.catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. furthermorewe see long lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of theaggregates due to bouncing. we explore how the mass and the porosity changeupon varying the turbulence parameter and by varying the critical mass ratio ofdust particles. particles reach stokes numbers of roughly 10^-4 during thesimulations. the particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather thanfragmentation in these models. the final stokes number of the aggregates israther insensitive to the variations of the gas density and the strength ofturbulence. the maximum mass of the particles is limited to approximately 1gram (chondrule-sized particles). planetesimal formation can proceed via theturbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted chondrule-sizedparticles.

1002.0335	gas- and dust evolution in protoplanetary disks	context. current models of the size- and radial evolution of dust inprotoplanetary disks generally oversimplify either the radial evolution of thedisk (by focussing at one single radius or by using steady state disk models)or they assume particle growth to proceed monodispersely or withoutfragmentation. further studies of protoplanetary disks - such as observations,disk chemistry and structure calculations or planet population synthesis models- depend on the distribution of dust as a function of grain size and radialposition in the disk.  aims. we attempt to improve upon current models to be able to investigate howthe initial conditions, the build-up phase, and the evolution of theprotoplanetary disk influence growth and transport of dust.  methods. we introduce a new version of the model of brauer et al. (2008) inwhich we now include the time-dependent viscous evolution of the gas disk, andin which more advanced input physics and numerical integration methods areimplemented.  results. we show that grain properties, the gas pressure gradient, and theamount of turbulence are much more influencing the evolution of dust than theinitial conditions or the build-up phase of the protoplanetary disk. wequantify which conditions or environments are favorable for growth beyond themeter size barrier. high gas surface densities or zonal flows may help toovercome the problem of radial drift, however already a small amount ofturbulence poses a much stronger obstacle for grain growth.

1003.4695	a new condition for the transition from runaway to oligarchic growth	accretion among macroscopic bodies of ~km size or larger is enhancedsignificantly due to gravitational focusing. two regimes can be distinguished.initially, the system experiences runaway growth, in which the gravitationalfocusing factors increase, and bodies at the high-mass tail of the distributiongrow fastest. however, at some point the runaway body dynamically heats itsenvironment, gravitational focusing factors decrease, and runaway growth passesinto oligarchic growth. based on the results of recent simulations, wereconsider the runaway growth-oligarchy transition. in contrast to oligarchy,we find that runaway growth cannot be approximated with a two component model(of small and large bodies) and that the criterion of ida &amp; makino (1993),which is frequently adopted as the start of oligarchy, is not a sufficientcondition to signify the transition. instead, we propose a new criterion basedon timescale arguments. we then find a larger value for the runawaygrowth-oligarchy transition: from several hundreds of km in the inner diskregions up to ~10^3 km for the outer disk. these findings are consistent withthe view that runaway growth has been responsible for the size distribution ofthe present day kuiper belt objects. our finding furthermore outlines theproper initial conditions at the start of the oligarchy stage.

1005.1261	sub-keplerian accretion onto circumstellar disks	models of the formation, evolution and photoevaporation of circumstellardisks are an essential ingredient in many theories of the formation ofplanetary systems. the ratio of disk mass over stellar mass in thecircumstellar phase of a disk is largely determined by the angular momentum ofthe original cloud core from which the system was formed. while full 3d or 2daxisymmetric hydrodynamical models of accretion onto the disk automaticallytreat all aspects of angular momentum, this is not so trivial for 1d andsemi-2d viscous disk models. since 1d and semi-2d disk models are still veryuseful for long-term evolutionary modelling of disks with relatively littlenumerical effort, we investigate how the 2d nature of accretion affects theformation and evolution of the disk in such models. a proper treatment of thisproblem requires a correction for the sub-keplerian velocity at which accretiontakes place. we develop an update of our semi-2d time-dependent disk evolutionmodel to properly treat the effects of sub-keplerian accretion. the new modelalso accounts for the effects of the vertical extent of the disk on theaccretion streamlines from the envelope. the disks produced with the new methodare smaller than those obtained previously, but their mass is mostly unchanged.the new disks are a few degrees warmer in the outer parts, so they contain lesssolid co. otherwise, the results for ices are unaffected. the 2d treatment ofthe accretion results in material accreting at larger radii, so a smallerfraction comes close enough to the star for amorphous silicates to be thermallyannealed into crystalline form. the lower crystalline abundances thus predictedcorrespond more closely to observed abundances than did earlier modelpredictions. we argue that thermal annealing followed by radial mixing must beresponsible for at least part of the observed crystalline material.

1006.0940	testing the theory of grain growth and fragmentation by millimeter  observations of protoplanetary disks	context. observations at sub-millimeter and mm wavelengths will in the nearfuture be able to resolve the radial dependence of the mm spectral slope incircumstellar disks with a resolution of around a few au at the distance of theclosest star-forming regions.  aims. we aim to constrain physical models of grain growth and fragmentationby a large sample of (sub-)mm observations of disks around pre-main sequencestars in the taurus-auriga and ophiuchus star-forming regions.  methods. state-of-the-art coagulation/fragmentation and disk-structure codesare coupled to produce steady-state grain size distributions and to predict thespectral slopes at (sub-)mm wavelengths.  results. this work presents the first calculations predicting the mm spectralslope based on a physical model of grain growth. our models can quite naturallyreproduce the observed mm-slopes, but a simultaneous match to the observedrange of flux levels can only be reached by a reduction of the dust mass by afactor of a few up to about 30 while keeping the gas mass of the disk the same.this dust reduction can either be due to radial drift at a reduced rate orduring an earlier evolutionary time (otherwise the predicted fluxes wouldbecome too low) or due to efficient conversion of dust into larger, unseenbodies.

1006.3186	accretion among preplanetary bodies: the many faces of runaway growth	(abridged) when preplanetary bodies reach proportions of ~1 km or larger insize, their accretion rate is enhanced due to gravitational focusing (gf). wehave developed a new numerical model to calculate the collisional evolution ofthe gravitationally-enhanced growth stage. we validate our approach againstexisting n-body and statistical codes. using the numerical model, we explorethe characteristics of the runaway growth and the oligarchic growth accretionphases starting from an initial population of single planetesimal radius r_0.in models where the initial random velocity dispersion (as derived from theireccentricity) starts out below the escape speed of the planetesimal bodies, thesystem experiences runaway growth. we find that during the runaway growth phasethe size distribution remains continuous but evolves into a power-law at thehigh mass end, consistent with previous studies. furthermore, we find that thelargest body accretes from all mass bins; a simple two component approximationis inapplicable during this stage. however, with growth the runaway body stirsup the random motions of the planetesimal population from which it isaccreting. ultimately, this feedback stops the fast growth and the systempasses into oligarchy, where competitor bodies from neighboring zones catch upin terms of mass. compared to previous estimates, we find that the systemleaves the runaway growth phase at a somewhat larger radius. furthermore, weassess the relevance of small, single-size fragments on the growth process. inclassical models, where the initial velocity dispersion of bodies is small,these do not play a critical role during the runaway growth; however, in modelsthat are characterized by large initial relative velocities due to externalstirring of their random motions, a situation can emerge where fragmentsdominate the accretion.

1006.3485	the inner regions of protoplanetary disks	to understand how planetary systems form in the dusty disks aroundpre-main-sequence stars a detailed knowledge of the structure and evolution ofthese disks is required. while this is reasonably well understood for theregions of the disk beyond about 1 au, the structure of these disks inward of 1au remains a puzzle. this is partly because it is very difficult to spatiallyresolve these regions with current telescopes. but it is also because thephysics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts toevaporate, is poorly understood. with infrared interferometry it has becomepossible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner au ofprotoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. these observations havepartly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questionsand puzzles. moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of theseregions is extremely challenging. in this review we give a rough overview ofthe history and recent developments in this exciting field of astrophysics.

1007.2169	detectability of giant planets in protoplanetary disks by co emission  lines	in this paper we intend to provide an indirect method to detect jovianplanets by studying near infrared emission spectra originating in theprotoplanetary disks around t tauri stars. our idea is to investigate whether amassive planet could induce any observable effect on the spectral linesemerging in the disks atmosphere. as a tracer molecule we propose co, which isexcited in the ro-vibrational fundamental band in the disk atmosphere to adistance of ~2-3 au (depending on the stellar mass) where terrestrial planetsare thought to form. the synthetic molecular spectral line profiles werecalculated by an own developed semi-analytical double layer disk model. 2d gasdynamics were incorporated in the calculation of synthetic spectral lines. wedemonstrate that a massive planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk stronglyinfluences the originally circular keplerian gas dynamics. the perturbed motionof the gas can be detected by comparing the co line profiles in emission, whichis emerge from planet-bearing to those of planet-free disk models. the planetsignal has two major characteristics: a permanent line profile asymmetry, andshort timescale variability correlated with the orbital phase of the giantplanet. we have found that the strength of the asymmetry depends on thephysical parameters of the star-planet-disk system, such as the diskinclination angle, the planetary and stellar masses, the orbital distance, andthe size of the disk inner cavity. the permanent line profile asymmetry iscaused by a disk in an eccentric state in the gap opened by the giant planet.however, the variable component is a consequence of the local dynamicalperturbation by the orbiting giant planet. we show that a forming giant planet,still embedded in the protoplanetary disk, can be detected using contemporaryor future high-resolution near-ir spectrographs like vlt/crires and elt/metis.

1007.5070	protoplanetary disk structures in ophiuchus ii: extension to fainter  sources	we present new results from a significant extension of our previous highangular resolution (0.3" = 40 au) submillimeter array survey of the 880 umcontinuum emission from dusty circumstellar disks in the ~1 myr-old ophiuchusstar-forming region. an expanded sample is constructed to probe disk structuresthat emit significantly lower millimeter luminosities (hence dust masses), downto the median value for t tauri stars. using a monte carlo radiative transfercode, the millimeter visibilities and broadband spectral energy distributionfor each disk are simultaneously reproduced with a two-dimensional parametricmodel for a viscous accretion disk. we find wide ranges of characteristic radii(14-198 au) and disk masses (0.004-0.143 m_sun), but a narrow distribution ofsurface density gradients (0.4-1.1) that is consistent with a uniform value$\gamma$ = 0.9 +/- 0.2 and independent of mass (or millimeter luminosity). inthis sample, we find a correlation between the disk luminosity/mass andcharacteristic radius, such that fainter disks are both smaller and lessmassive. we suggest that this relationship is an imprint of the initialconditions inherited by the disks at their formation epoch, compare theirangular momenta with those of molecular cloud cores, and speculate on howfuture observations can help constrain the distribution of viscous evolutiontimescales. no other correlations between disk and star properties are found.the inferred disk structures are briefly compared with theoretical models forgiant planet formation, although resolution limitations do not permit us todirectly comment on material inside r = 20 au. however, there is somecompelling evidence for dust evolution in the planet formation region: 4/17disks in the sample show resolved regions of significantly reduced opticaldepths within ~20-40 au of their central stars.

1011.2411	high-resolution spectroscopic view of planet formation sites	theories of planet formation predict the birth of giant planets in the inner,dense, and gas-rich regions of the circumstellar disks around young stars.these are the regions from which strong co emission is expected. observationshave so far been unable to confirm the presence of planets caught in formation.we have developed a novel method to detect a giant planet still embedded in acircumstellar disk by the distortions of the co molecular line profilesemerging from the protoplanetary disk's surface. the method is based on thefact that a giant planet significantly perturbs the gas velocity flow inaddition to distorting the disk surface density. we have calculated theemerging molecular line profiles by combining hydrodynamical models withsemianalytic radiative transfer calculations. our results have shown that agiant jupiter-like planet can be detected using contemporary or futurehigh-resolution near-ir spectrographs such as vlt/crires or elt/metis. we havealso studied the effects of binarity on disk perturbations. the mostinteresting results have been found for eccentric circumprimary disks inmid-separation binaries, for which the disk eccentricity - detectable from theasymmetric line profiles - arises from the gravitational effects of thecompanion star. our detailed simulations shed new light on how to constrain thedisk kinematical state as well as its eccentricity profile. recent findings byindependent groups have shown that core-accretion is severely affected by diskeccentricity, hence detection of an eccentric protoplanetary disk in a youngbinary system would further constrain planet formation theories.

1011.4420	impact of grain evolution on the chemical structure of protoplanetary  disks	we study the impact of dust evolution in a protoplanetary disk around a ttauri star on the disk chemical composition. for the first time we utilize acomprehensive model of dust evolution which includes growth, fragmentation andsedimentation. specific attention is paid to the influence of grain evolutionon the penetration of the uv field in the disk. a chemical model that includesa comprehensive set of gas phase and grain surface chemical reactions is usedto simulate the chemical structure of the disk. the main effect of the grainevolution on the disk chemical composition comes from sedimentation, and, to alesser degree, from the reduction of the total grain surface area. the neteffect of grain growth is suppressed by the fragmentation process whichmaintains a population of small grains, dominating the total grain surfacearea. we consider three models of dust properties. in model gs both growth andsedimentation are taken into account. in models a5 and a4 all grains areassumed to have the same size (10(-5) cm and 10(-4) cm, respectively) withconstant gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100. like in previous studies, the"three-layer" pattern (midplane, molecular layer, hot atmosphere) in the diskchemical structure is preserved in all models, but shifted closer to themidplane in models with increased grain size (gs and a4). unlike other similarstudies, we find that in models gs and a4 column densities of most gas-phasespecies are enhanced by 1-3 orders of magnitude relative to those in a modelwith pristine dust (a5), while column densities of their surface counterpartsare decreased. we show that column densities of certain species, like c2h,hc(2n+1)n (n=0-3), h2o and some other molecules, as well as the c2h2/hcnabundance ratio which are accessible with herschel and alma can be used asobservational tracers of early stages of the grain evolution process inprotoplanetary disks.

0704.2332	survival of the mm-cm size grain population observed in protoplanetary  disks	millimeter interferometry provides evidence for the presence of mm to cm size"pebbles" in the outer parts of disks around pre-main-sequence stars. theobservations suggest that large grains are produced relatively early in diskevolution (&lt; 1 myr) and remain at large radii for longer periods of time (5 to10 myr). simple theoretical estimates of the radial drift time of solidparticles, however, imply that they would drift inward over a time scale ofless than 0.1 myr. in this paper, we address this conflict between theory andobservation, using more detailed theoretical models, including the effects ofsedimentation, collective drag forces and turbulent viscosity. we find that,although these effects slow down the radial drift of the dust particles, thisreduction is not sufficient to explain the observationally determined longsurvival time of mm/cm-sized grains in protoplanetary disks. however, if forsome reason the gas to dust ratio in the disk is reduced by at least a factorof 20 from the canonical value of 100 (for instance through photoevaporation ofthe gas), then the radial drift time scales become sufficiently large to be inagreement with observations.

1101.1820	spectral signatures of disk eccentricity in young binary systems: i.  circumprimary case	star formation occurs via fragmentation of molecular clouds, which means thatthe majority of stars born are a members of binaries. there is growing evidencethat planets might form in circumprimary disks of medium-separation binaries.the tidal forces caused by the secondary generally act to distort theoriginally circular disk to an eccentric one. to infer the disk eccentricityfrom high-res nir spectroscopy, we calculate the fundamental band emissionlines of the co molecule emerging from the atmosphere of the disk. we modelcircumprimary disk evolution under the gravitational perturbation of theorbiting secondary using a 2d grid-based hydrodynamical code, assumingalpha-type viscosity. the hydrodynamical results are combined with our spectralcode based on the double-layer disk model to calculate the co molecular lineprofiles. we find that the orbital velocity distribution of the gas parcelsdiffers significantly from the circular keplerian fashion, thus the lineprofiles are asymmetric in shape. the magnitude of asymmetry is insensitive tothe binary mass ratio, the magnitude of viscosity, and the disk mass. incontrast, the disk eccentricity, thus the level of the line profile asymmetry,is influenced significantly by the binary eccentricity and the disk geometricalthickness. we demonstrate that the disk eccentricity profile in theplanet-forming region can be determined by fitting the high-resolution co lineprofile asymmetry using a simple 2d spectral model that accounts for thevelocity distortions caused by the disk eccentricity. thus, with our novelapproach the disk eccentricity can be inferred with high-resolution near-irspectroscopy prior to the era of high angular resolution optical or radiodirect-imaging. by determining the disk eccentricity in medium-separation youngbinaries, we might be able to constrain the planet formation theories.

1103.0284	resolved images of large cavities in protoplanetary transition disks	circumstellar disks are thought to experience a rapid "transition" phase intheir evolution that can have a considerable impact on the formation and earlydevelopment of planetary systems. we present new and archival high angularresolution (0.3" = 40-75 au) submillimeter array (sma) observations of the 880micron dust continuum emission from 12 such transition disks in nearbystar-forming regions. in each case, we directly resolve a dust-depleted diskcavity around the central star. using radiative transfer calculations, weinterpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous, parametric modelframework by reproducing their sma visibilities and seds. the cavities in thesedisks are large (r_cav = 15-73 au) and substantially depleted of small(~um-sized) dust grains, although their mass contents are still uncertain. thestructures of the remnant material at larger radii are comparable to normaldisks. we demonstrate that these large cavities are common among themillimeter-bright disk population, comprising at least 20% of the disks in thebright half of the millimeter luminosity (disk mass) distribution. utilizingthese results, we assess some of the physical mechanisms proposed to accountfor transition disk structures. as has been shown before, photoevaporationmodels do not produce the large cavity sizes, accretion rates, and disk massesrepresentative of this sample. it would be difficult to achieve a sufficientdecrease of the dust optical depths in these cavities by particle growth alone:substantial growth (to meter sizes or beyond) must occur in large (tens of au)regions of low turbulence without also producing an abundance of smallparticles. given those challenges, we suggest instead that the observations aremost commensurate with dynamical clearing due to tidal interactions withlow-mass companions --young brown dwarfs or giant planets on long-periodorbits.

1105.1287	near-infrared spectroscopy of ex lupi in outburst	ex lup is the prototype of the exor class of young eruptive stars: objectsshowing repetitive brightenings due to increased accretion from thecircumstellar disk to the star. in this paper, we report on medium-resolutionnear-infrared spectroscopy of ex\,lup taken during its extreme outburst in2008, as well as numerical modeling with the aim of determining the physicalconditions around the star. we detect emission lines from atomic hydrogen,helium, and metals, as well as first overtone bandhead emission from carbonmonoxide. our results indicate that the emission lines are originating from gaslocated in a dust-free region within ~ 0.2 au of the star. the profile of theco bandhead indicates that the co gas has a temperature of 2500 k, and islocated in the inner edge of the disk or in the outer parts of funnel flows.the atomic metals are probably co-located with the co. some metallic lines arefluorescently excited, suggesting direct exposure to ultraviolet photons. thebrackett series indicates emission from hot (10000 k) and optically thin gas.the hydrogen lines display a strong spectro-astrometric signal, suggesting thatthe hydrogen emission is probably not coming from an equatorial boundary layer;a funnel flow or disk wind origin is more likely. this picture is broadlyconsistent with the standard magnetospheric accretion model usually assumed fornormally accreting t tauri stars. our results also set constraints on theeruption mechanism, supporting a model where material piles up around thecorotation radius and episodically falls onto the star.

1107.5198	the outcome of protoplanetary dust growth: pebbles, boulders, or  planetesimals? iii. sedimentation driven coagulation inside the snow-line	we investigate dust growth due to settling in a 1d vertical column of aprotoplanetary disk. it is known from the observed 10 micron feature in diskseds, that small micron-sized grains are present at the disk atmospherethroughout the lifetime of the disk. we hope to explain such questions as whatprocess can keep the disk atmospheres dusty for the lifetime of the disk andhow does the particle properties change as a function of height above themidplane. we use a monte carlo code to follow the mass and porosity evolutionof the particles in time. the used collision model is based on laboratoryexperiments performed on dust aggregates. as the experiments cannot cover allpossible collision scenarios, the largest uncertainty of our model is thenecessary extrapolations we had to perform. we simultaneously solve for theparticle growth and motion. particles can move vertically due to settling andturbulent mixing. we assume that the vertical profile of the gas density isfixed in time and only the solid component evolves. we find that the usedcollision model strongly influences the masses and sizes of the particles. thelaboratory experiment based collision model greatly reduces the particle sizescompared to models that assume sticking at all collision velocities. we findthat a turbulence parameter of alpha = 10^-2 is needed to keep the dustatmospheres dusty, but such strong turbulence can produce only small particlesat the midplane which is not favorable for planetesimal formation models. wealso see that the particles are larger at the midplane and smaller at the upperlayers of the disk. at 3-4 pressure scale heights micron-sized particles areproduced. these particle sizes are needed to explain the 10 micron feature ofdisk seds. turbulence may therefore help to keep small dust particles in thedisk atmosphere.

1109.6177	possible planet-forming regions on submillimetre images	submillimetre images of transition discs are expected to reflect thedistribution of the optically thin dust. former observation of three transitiondiscs lkha330, sr21n, and hd1353444b at submillimetre wavelengths revealedimages which cannot be modelled by a simple axisymmetric disc. we show that alarge-scale anticyclonic vortex that develops where the viscosity has a largegradient (e.g., at the edge of the disc dead zone), might be accountable forthese large-scale asymmetries. we modelled the long-term evolution of vorticesbeing triggered by the rossby wave instability. we found that ahorseshoe-shaped (azimuthal wavenumber m=1) large-scale vortex forms bycoalescing of smaller vortices within 5x10^4 yr, and can survive on the disclife-time (~5x10^6 yr), depending on the magnitude of global viscosity and thethickness of the viscosity gradient. the two-dimensional grid-based global discsimulations with local isothermal approximation and compressible-gas model havebeen done by the gpu version of hydrodynamic code fargo (gfargo). to calculatethe dust continuum image at submillimetre wavelengths, we combined ourhydrodynamical results with a 3d radiative transfer code. by the strikingsimilarities of the calculated and observed submillimetre images, we suggestthat the three transition discs can be modelled by a disc possessing alarge-scale vortex formed near the disc dead zone edge. since the larger dustgrains (larger than mm in size) are collected in these vortices, thenon-axisymmetric submillimetre images of the above transition discs might beinterpreted as active planet and planetesimal forming regions situated far (&gt;50 au) from the central stars.

1201.0014	warm gas at 50 au in the disk around herbig be star hd 100546	the disk atmosphere is one of the fundamental elements of theoretical modelsof a protoplanetary disk. however, the direct observation of the warm gas (&gt;&gt;100 k) at large radius of a disk (&gt;&gt; 10 au) is challenging, because the lineemission from warm gas in a disk is usually dominated by the emission from aninner disk. our goal is to detect the warm gas in the disk atmosphere wellbeyond 10 au from a central star in a nearby disk system of the herbig be starhd 100546. we measured the excitation temperature of the vibrational transitionof co at incremental radii of the disk from the central star up to 50 au, usingan adaptive optics system combined with the high-resolution infraredspectrograph crires at the vlt. the observation successfully resolved the lineemission with 0".1 angular resolution, which is 10 au at the distance of hd100546. population diagrams were constructed at each location of the disk, andcompared with the models calculated taking into account the optical deptheffect in lte condition. the excitation temperature of co is 400-500 k orhigher at 50 au away from the star, where the blackbody temperature inequilibrium with the stellar radiation drops as low as 90 k. this isunambiguous evidence of a warm disk atmosphere far away from the central star.

1204.3473	mid-infrared spectral variability atlas of young stellar objects	optical and near-infrared variability is a well-known property of youngstellar objects. however, a growing number of recent studies claim that aconsiderable fraction of them also exhibit mid-infrared flux changes. with theaim of studying and interpreting variability on a decadal timescale, here wepresent a mid-infrared spectral atlas containing observations of 68 low- andintermediate mass young stellar objects. the atlas consists of 2.5-11.6 umlow-resolution spectra obtained with the isophot-s instrument on-board theinfrared space observatory (iso) between 1996 and 1998, as well as 5.2-14.5 umlow-resolution spectra obtained with the irs instrument on-board the spitzerspace telescope between 2004 and 2007. the observations were retrieved from theiso and spitzer archives and were post-processed interactively by our ownroutines. for those 47 objects where multi-epoch spectra were available, weanalyze mid-infrared spectral variability on annual and/or decadal timescales.we identify 37 variable candidate sources. many stars showwavelength-independent flux changes, possibly due to variable accretion rate.in several systems, all exhibiting 10 um silicate emission, the variability ofthe 6-8 um continuum and the silicate feature exhibit different amplitudes. apossible explanation is variable shadowing of the silicate emitting region byan inner disk structure of changing height or extra silicate emission from dustclouds in the disk atmosphere. our results suggest that mid-infraredvariability, in particular the wavelength-dependent changes, are moreubiquitous than was known before. interpreting this variability is a newpossibility to explore the structure of the disk and its dynamical processes.

1301.1976	lopsided dust rings in transition disks	context. particle trapping in local or global pressure maxima inprotoplanetary disks is one of the new paradigms in the theory of the firststages of planet formation. however, finding observational evidence for thiseffect is not easy. recent work suggests that the large ring-shaped outer disksobserved in transition disk sources may in fact be lopsided and constitutelarge banana-shaped vortices.  aims. we wish to investigate how effective dust can accumulate along theazimuthal direction. we also want to find out if the size- sorting resultingfrom this can produce a detectable signatures at millimeter wavelengths.  methods. to keep the numerical cost under control we develop a 1+1d method inwhich the azimuthal variations are treated sepa- rately from the radial ones.the azimuthal structure is calculated analytically for a steady-state betweenmixing and azimuthal drift. we derive equilibration time scales and compare theanalytical solutions to time-dependent numerical simulations.  results. we find that weak, but long-lived azimuthal density gradients in thegas can induce very strong azimuthal accumulations of dust. the strength of theaccumulations depends on the p\'eclet number, which is the relative importanceof advection and diffusion. we apply our model to transition disks and oursimulated observations show that this effect would be easily observable withalma and in principle allows to put constraints on the strength of turbulenceand the local gas density.

1304.1736	asymmetric transition disks: vorticity or eccentricity?	context. transition disks typically appear in resolved millimeterobservations as giant dust rings surrounding their young host stars. moreaccurate observations with alma have shown several of these rings to be in factasymmetric: they have lopsided shapes. it has been speculated that these ringsact as dust traps, which would make them important laboratories for studyingplanet formation. it has been shown that an elongated giant vortex produced ina disk with a strong viscosity jump strikingly resembles the observedasymmetric rings.  aims. we aim to study a similar behavior for a disk in which a giant planetis embedded. however, a giant planet can induce two kinds of asymmetries: (1) agiant vortex, and (2) an eccentric disk. we studied under which conditions eachof these can appear, and how one can observationally distinguish between them.this is important because only a vortex can trap particles both radially andazimuthally, while the eccentric ring can only trap particles in radialdirection.  methods. we used the fargo code to conduct the hydro-simulations. we set up adisk with an embedded giant planet and took a radial grid spanning from 0.1 to7 times the planet semi-major axis. we ran the simulations with variousviscosity values and planet masses for 1000 planet orbits to allow a fullydeveloped vortex or disk eccentricity. afterwards, we compared the dustdistribution in a vortex-holding disk with an eccentric disk using dustsimulations.  results. we find that vorticity and eccentricity are distinguishable bylooking at the azimuthal contrast of the dust density. while vortices, asparticle traps, produce very pronounced azimuthal asymmetries, eccentricfeatures are not able to accumulate millimeter dust particles in azimuthaldirection, and therefore the asymmetries are expected to be modest.

1304.6638	explaining millimeter-sized particles in brown dwarf disks	planets have been detected around a variety of stars, including low-massobjects, such as brown dwarfs. however, such extreme cases are challenging forplanet formation models. recent sub-millimeter observations of disks aroundbrown dwarf measured low spectral indices of the continuum emission thatsuggest that dust grains grow to mm-sizes even in these very low massenvironments. to understand the first steps of planet formation in scaled-downversions of t-tauri disks, we investigate the physical conditions that cantheoretically explain the growth from interstellar dust to millimeter-sizedgrains in disks around brown dwarf. we modeled the evolution of dust particlesunder conditions of low-mass disks around brown dwarfs. we used coagulation,fragmentation and disk-structure models to simulate the evolution of dust, withzero and non-zero radial drift. for the non-zero radial drift, we consideredstrong inhomogeneities in the gas surface density profile that mimic long-livedpressure bumps in the disk. we studied different scenarios that could lead toan agreement between theoretical models and the spectral slope found bymillimeter observations. we find that fragmentation is less likely and rapidinward drift is more significant for particles in brown dwarf disks than int-tauri disks. we present different scenarios that can nevertheless explainmillimeter-sized grains. as an example, a model that combines the followingparameters can fit the millimeter fluxes measured for brown dwarf disks: strongpressure inhomogeneities of $\sim$ 40% of amplitude, a small radial extent$\sim$ 15 au, a moderate turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}}= 10^{-3}$,and average fragmentation velocities for ices $v_f = 10 m s^{-1}$.

1306.3412	planetesimal formation via sweep-up growth at the inner edge of dead  zones	the early stages of planet formation are still not well understood.coagulation models have revealed numerous obstacles to the dust growth, such asthe bouncing, fragmentation and radial drift barriers. we study the interplaybetween dust coagulation and drift in order to determine the conditions inprotoplanetary disk that support the formation of planetesimals. we focus onplanetesimal formation via sweep-up and investigate whether it can take placein a realistic protoplanetary disk. we have developed a new numerical modelthat resolves spatial distribution of dust in the radial and verticaldimension. the model uses representative particles approach to follow the dustevolution in protoplanetary disk. the coagulation and fragmentation of solidsis taken into account using monte carlo method. a collision model adopting themass transfer effect, that can occur for different-sized dust aggregatecollisions, is implemented. we focus on a protoplanetary disk including apressure bump caused by a steep decline of turbulent viscosity around the snowline. our results show that sufficient resolution of the vertical diskstructure in dust coagulation codes is necessary to obtain adequately shortgrowth timescales, especially in the case of a low turbulence region. we findthat a sharp radial variation of the turbulence strength at the inner edge ofdead zone promotes planetesimal formation in several ways. it provides apressure bump that efficiently prevents the dust from drifting inwards. it alsocauses a radial variation in the size of aggregates at which growth barriersoccur, favoring the growth of large aggregates via sweeping up of smallparticles. in our model, by employing an ad hoc alpha viscosity change near thesnow line, it is possible to grow planetesimals by incremental growth ontimescales of approximately 10^5 years.

0801.4139	characterizing the nature of embedded young stellar objects through  silicate, ice and millimeter observations	(abridged) classification schemes for ysos are based on evaluating the degreeof dissipation of the surrounding envelope, whose main effects are theextinction of the optical radiation from the central yso and re-emission in thefar-infrared. since extinction is a property of column density along the lineof sight, the presence of a protoplanetary disk may lead to a misclassificationwhen the system is viewed edge-on.  we performed radiative transfer calculations, using the axysimmetric 3dradiative transfer codes radmc and radical, to show the effects of differentgeometries on the main indicators of yso evolutionary stage, like the slope ofthe flux between 2 and 24mum, the bolometric temperature and the optical depthof silicates and ices.  we show that for systems viewed at intermediate angles the 'classical'indicators of evolution accurately trace the envelope column density, and theyall agree with each other. on the other hand, edge-on system are misclassifiedfor inclinations larger than ~65deg. in particular, silicate emission, typicalof pre-main sequence stars with disks, turns into absorption when the diskcolumn density reaches 1e22cm-2, corresponding e.g. to a 5e-3 msun flaring diskviewed at 64deg. a similar effect is noticed in all the other classificationindicators studied alpha, tbol, and the h2o and co2 ices absorption strengths.this misclassification has a big impact on the nature of the flat-spectrumsources (alpha ~0), whose number can be explained by simple geometricalarguments without invoking evolution. a reliable classification scheme using aminimal number of observations is constituted by observations of the mm-fluxwith both a single dish and an interferometer.

1311.3498	a quantification of hydrodynamical effects on protoplanetary dust growth	context. the growth process of dust particles in protoplanetary disks can bemodeled via numerical dust coagulation codes. in this approach, physicaleffects that dominate the dust growth process often must be implemented in aparameterized form. due to a lack of these parameterizations, existing studiesof dust coagulation have ignored the effects a hydrodynamical gas flow can haveon grain growth, even though it is often argued that the flow couldsignificantly contribute either positively or negatively to the growth process.  aims. we intend to provide a quantification of hydrodynamical effects on thegrowth of dust particles, such that these effects can be parameterized andimplemented in a dust coagulation code.  methods. we numerically integrate the trajectories of small dust particles inthe flow of disk gas around a proto-planetesimal, sampling a large parameterspace in proto-planetesimal radii, headwind velocities, and dust stoppingtimes.  results. the gas flow deflects most particles away from theproto-planetesimal, such that its effective collisional cross section, andtherefore the mass accretion rate, is reduced. the gas flow however alsoreduces the impact velocity of small dust particles onto a proto-planetesimal.this can be beneficial for its growth, since large impact velocities are knownto lead to erosion. we also demonstrate why such a gas flow does not returncollisional debris to the surface of a proto-planetesimal.  conclusions. we predict that a laminar hydrodynamical flow around aproto-planetesimal will have a significant effect on its growth. however, wecannot easily predict which result, the reduction of the impact velocity or thesweep-up cross section, will be more important. therefore, we provideparameterizations ready for implementation into a dust coagulation code.

0802.0998	lkh$\alpha$ 330: evidence for dust clearing through resolved  submillimeter imaging	mid-infrared spectrophotometric observations have revealed a small sub-classof circumstellar disks with spectral energy distributions (seds) suggestive oflarge inner gaps with low dust content. however, such data provide only anindirect and model dependent method of finding central holes. we present herethe direct characterization of a 40 au radius inner gap in the disk around lkha330 through 340 ghz (880 micron) dust continuum imaging with the submillimeterarray (sma). this large gap is fully resolved by the sma observations andmostly empty of dust with less than 1.3 x 10^-6 m_solar of solid particlesinside of 40 au. gas (as traced by accretion markers and co m-band emission) isstill present in the inner disk and the outer edge of the gap rises steeply --features in better agreement with the underlying cause being gravitationalperturbation than a more gradual process such as grain growth. importantly, thegood agreement of the spatially resolved data and spectrophometry-based modellends confidence to current interpretations of seds with significant dustemission deficits as arising from disks with inner gaps or holes. furthersed-based searches can therefore be expected to yield numerous additionalcandidates that can be examined at high spatial resolution.

1402.5778	millimetre spectral indices of transition disks and their relation to  the cavity radius	transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner depleted dust cavitiesand excellent candidates to investigate the dust evolution under the existenceof a pressure bump. a pressure bump at the outer edge of the cavity allows dustgrains from the outer regions to stop their rapid inward migration towards thestar and efficiently grow to millimetre sizes. dynamical interactions withplanet(s) have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearingof the inner disk. we look for evidence of the presence of millimetre dustparticles in transition disks by measuring their spectral index with new andavailable photometric data. we investigate the influence of the size of thedust depleted cavity on the disk integrated millimetre spectral index. wepresent the 3mm photometric observations carried out with pdbi of fourtransition disks: lkha330, uxtaua, lrll31, and lrll67. we use available valuesof their fluxes at 345ghz to calculate their spectral index, as well as thespectral index for a sample of twenty transition disks. we compare theobservations with two kind of models. in the first set of models, we considercoagulation and fragmentation of dust in a disk in which a cavity is formed bya massive planet located at different positions. the second set of modelsassumes disks with truncated inner parts at different radius and with power-lawdust size distributions, where the maximum size of grains is calculatedconsidering turbulence as the source of destructive collisions. we show thatthe integrated spectral index is higher for transition disks than for regularprotoplanetary disks. for transition disks, the probability that the measuredspectral index is positively correlated with the cavity radius is 95%. highangular resolution imaging of transition disks is needed to distinguish betweenthe dust trapping scenario and the truncated disk case.

1403.3248	interferometer predictions with triangulated images: solving the  multi-scale problem	interferometers play an increasingly important role for spatially resolvedobservations. if employed at full potential, interferometry can probe anenormous dynamic range in spatial scale. interpretation of the observedvisibilities requires the numerical compu- tation of fourier integrals over thesynthetic model images. to get the correct values of these integrals, the modelimages must have the right size and resolution. insufficient care in thesechoices can lead to wrong results. we present a new general-purpose scheme forthe computation of visibilities of radiative transfer images. our methodrequires a model image that is a list of intensities at arbitrarily placedpositions on the image-plane. it creates a triangulated grid from thesevertices, and assumes that the intensity inside each triangle of the grid is alinear function. the fourier integral over each triangle is then evaluated withan analytic expression and the complex visibility of the entire image is thenthe sum of all triangles. the result is a robust fourier trans- form that doesnot suffer from aliasing effects due to grid regularities. the methodautomatically ensures that all structure contained in the model gets reflectedin the fourier transform.

1408.3377	mean gas opacity for circumstellar environments and equilibrium  temperature degeneracy	in a molecular cloud dust opacity typically dominates over gas opacity, yetin the vicinities of forming stars dust is depleted, and gas is the soleprovider of opacity. in the optically thin circumstellar environments theradiation temperature cannot be assumed to be equal to the gas temperature,hence the two-temperature planck means are necessary to calculate the radiativeequilibrium.  by using the two-temperature mean opacity one does obtain the properequilibrium gas temperature in a circumstellar environment, which is in achemical equilibrium. a careful consideration of a radiative transfer problemreveals that the equilibrium temperature solution can be degenerate in anoptically thin gaseous environment.  we compute mean gas opacities based on the publicly available code dfsyntheby kurucz and castelli. we performed the calculations assuming localthermodynamic equilibrium and an ideal gas equation of state. the values werederived by direct integration of the high-resolution opacity spectrum.  we produced two sets of gas opacity tables: rosseland means andtwo-temperature planck means (the tables available viahttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ as well as viahttp://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/malygin). for three metallicities [me/h] =0.0,+/-0.3 we covered the parameter range 3.48 &lt;= log t_rad[k] &lt;= 4.48 inradiation temperature, 2.8 &lt;= log t_gas[k]} &lt;= 6.0 in gas temperature, and -10&lt;= log p[dyn cm^-2] &lt;= 6 in gas pressure. we show that in the optically thincircumstellar environment for a given stellar radiation field and local gasdensity there are several equilibrium gas temperatures possible.  we conclude that, in general, equilibrium gas temperature cannot bedetermined without treating the temperature evolution.

0804.4761	molecular hydrogen in the circumstellar environments of herbig ae/be  stars probed by fuse	we observed molecular hydrogen around a sample of pre-main sequence stars inorder to better characterize their gaseous cs environments. we analyzed thefuse (far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer) spectra of a sample of herbigae/be stars (haebes) covering a broad spectral range, including themain-sequence a5 star beta-pictoris. to better diagnose the origin of thedetected h2 and its excitation conditions, we used a model of aphotodissociation region. our analysis demonstrates that the excitation of h2is clearly different around most of the haebes compared to the interstellarmedium. moreover, the characteristics of h2 around herbig ae and be stars giveevidence for different excitation mechanisms. for the most massive stars of oursample (b8 to b2 type), the excitation diagrams are reproduced well by a modelof photodissociation regions (pdr). our results favor an interpretation interms of large cs envelopes, remnants of the molecular clouds in which thestars were formed. on the other hand, the group of ae stars (later than b9type) known to possess disks is more inhomogeneous. in most cases, when cs h2is detected, the lines of sight do not pass through the disks. the excitationconditions of h2 around ae stars cannot be reproduced by pdr models andcorrespond to warm and/or hot excited media very close to the stars. inaddition, no clear correlation has been found between the ages of the stars andthe amount of circumstellar h2. our results suggest structural differencesbetween herbig ae and be star environments. herbig be stars do evolve fasterthan ae stars, and consequently, most herbig be stars are younger than ae onesat the time we observe them. it is thus more likely to find remnants of theirparent cloud around them.

0805.4376	size-sorting dust grains in the surface layers of protoplanetary disks	aims: we wish to investigate what the effect of dust sedimentation is on theobserved 10 mum feature of protoplanetary disks and how this may affect theinterpretation of the observations.  methods: using a combination of modeling tools, we simulated thesedimentation of a dust grain size distribution in an axisymmetric 2-d model ofa turbulent protoplanetary disk, and we used a radiative transfer program tocompute the resulting spectra.  results: we find that the sedimentation can turn a flat feature into a pointyone, but only to a limited degree and for a very limited set of particle sizedistributions. only if we have a bimodal size distribution, i.e. a very smallgrain population and a bigger grain population, do we find that thetransformation from a flat to a pointy feature upon dust sedimentation isstrong. however, our model shows that, if sedimentation is the sole reason forthe variety of silicate feature strengths observed in protoplanetary disks,then we would expect to find a correlation such that disks with weak mid- tofar-infrared excess have a stronger 10 mum silicate feature than disks with astrong mid- to far-infrared excess. if this is contrary to what is observed,then this would indicate that sedimentation cannot be the main reason for thevariety of 10 mum silicate features observed in protoplanetary disks.

0806.1646	planetesimal formation around the snow line in mri-driven turbulent  protoplanetary disks	the formation of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks due to collisionalsticking of smaller dust aggregates has to face at least two severe obstacles,namely the rapid loss of material due to radial inward drift and particlefragmentation due to destructive collisions. we present a scenario tocircumvent these two hurdles. our dust evolution model involves two mainmechanisms. first, we consider a disk with a dead zone. in an almost laminarregion close to the midplane, the relative velocities of the turbulentparticles are comparatively small, which decreases the probability ofdestructive particle collisions. second, turbulence is not the only source ofviolent relative particle velocities, because high radial drift speeds can alsolead to boulder fragmentation. for this reason, we focus additionally on thesnow line. evaporation fronts can be associated with gas pressure maxima inwhich radial drift basically vanishes. this implies that particle fragmentationbecomes even less likely. our simulation results suggest that particles canovercome the fragmentation barrier. we find that boulders of several 100 m canform within only a few thousand years.

1512.05679	a multi-wavelength analysis for interferometric (sub-)mm observations of  protoplanetary disks: radial constraints on the dust properties and the disk  structure	theoretical models of grain growth predict dust properties to change as afunction of protoplanetary disk radius, mass, age and other physicalconditions. we lay down the methodology for a multi-wavelength analysis of(sub-)mm and cm continuum interferometric observations to constrainself-consistently the disk structure and the radial variation of the dustproperties. the computational architecture is massively parallel and highlymodular. the analysis is based on the simultaneous fit in the uv-plane ofobservations at several wavelengths with a model for the disk thermal emissionand for the dust opacity. the observed flux density at the differentwavelengths is fitted by posing constraints on the disk structure and on theradial variation of the grain size distribution. we apply the analysis toobservations of three protoplanetary disks (as 209, ft tau, dr tau) for which acombination of spatially resolved observations in the range ~0.88mm to ~10mm isavailable (from sma, carma, and vla), finding evidence of a decreasing maximumdust grain size (a_max) with radius. we derive large a_max values up to 1 cm inthe inner disk between 15 and 30 au and smaller grains with a_max~1 mm in theouter disk (r &gt; 80au). in this paper we develop a multi-wavelength analysisthat will allow this missing quantity to be constrained for statisticallyrelevant samples of disks and to investigate possible correlations with disk orstellar parameters.

astro-ph;0007399	are passive protostellar disks stable to self-shadowing?	the uniqueness and stability of irradiated flaring passive protostellar disksis investigated in the context of a simplified set of equations for thevertical height h as a function of radius r. it is found that the well-knownflaring disk solution with h ~ r^{9/7} is not unique. diverging solutions andasymptotically conical (h ~ r) solutions are also found. moreover, usingtime-dependent linear perturbation analysis, it is found that the flaring disksolution may become unstable to self-shadowing. a local enhancement in thevertical height alters the functional form of irradiation grazing angle, andcauses the 'sunny side' of the enhancement to grow and the 'shadow side' tocollapse in a run-away fashion. this instability operates in regions of thedisk in which the cooling time is much shorter than the vertical sound crossingtime, which may occur in the outer regions of the passive irradiated disk ifdust and gas are sufficiently strongly thermally coupled. processes that maystabilize the disk, which include active accretion, irradiation from above(e.g. a scattering corona) and low disk optical depth, are likely to operateonly at small or at large radius. the simple analysis of this letter thereforesuggests that the instability may alter the flaring disk structure atintermediate radii (between the actively accreting and fast rotating innerregions and the optically thin outer regions).

astro-ph;0106470	passive irradiated circumstellar disks with an inner hole	a model for irradiated dust disks around herbig ae stars is proposed. themodel is based on the flaring disk model of chiang &amp; goldreich (1997), but withthe central regions of the disk removed. the inner rim of the disk is puffed upand is much hotter than the rest of the disk, because it is directly exposed tothe stellar flux. if located at the dust evaporation radius, its reemitted fluxproduces a conspicuous bump in the sed which peaks at 2-3 micron. we proposethat this emission is the explanation for the near-infrared bump observed inthe seds of herbig ae stars. we study for which stellar parameters this bumpwould be observable, and find that it is the case for herbig ae stellarparameters but not for t-tauri stars, confirming what is found from theobservations. we also study the effects of the shadow cast by the inner rimover the rest of the flaring disk. the shadowed region can be quite large, andunder some circumstances the entire disk may lie in the shadow. this shadowedregion will be much cooler than an unshadowed flaring disk, since its onlyheating sources are radial radiative diffusion and possible indirect sources ofirradiation. under certain special circumstances the shadowing effect cansuppress, or even completely eliminate, the 10 micron emission feature from thespectrum, which might explain the anomalous seds of some isolated herbig aestars in the sample of meeus et al. (2001). at much larger radii the diskemerges from the shadow, and continues as a flaring disk towards the outeredge. the complete model, including structure of the inner edge, shadowedregion and the flared outer part, is described in detail in this paper, and weshow examples of the general behavior of the model for varying parameters.

astro-ph;0108438	x-ray spectra from protons illuminating a neutron star	we consider the interaction of a slowly rotating unmagnetized neutron starwith a hot (ion supported, adaf) accretion flow. the virialized protons of theadaf penetrate into the neutron star atmosphere, heating a surface layer.detailed calculations are presented of the equilibrium between heating by theprotons, electron thermal conduction, bremsstrahlung and multiple comptonscattering in this layer. its temperature is of the order 40-70 kev. itsoptical depth increases with the incident proton energy flux, and is of theorder unity for accretion at $10^{-2}$--$10^{-1}$ of the eddington rate. atthese rates, the x-ray spectrum produced by the layer has a hard tail extendingto 100 kev, and is similar to the observed spectra of accreting neutron starsin their hard states. the steep gradient at the base of the heated layer givesrise to an excess of photons at the soft end of the spectrum (compared to ablackbody) through an `inverse photosphere effect'. the differences withrespect to previous studies of similar problems are discussed, they are duemostly to a more accurate treatment of the proton penetration process and thevertical structure of the heated layer.

astro-ph;0204281	vertical structure models of t tauri and herbig ae/be disks	in this paper we present detailed models of the vertical structure(temperature and density) of passive irradiated circumstellar disks around ttauri and herbig ae/be stars. in contrast to earlier work, we use fullfrequency- and angle-dependent radiative transfer instead of the usual momentequations. we find that this improvement of the radiative transfer has stronginfluence on the resulting vertical structure of the disk, with differences intemperature as large as 70 %. however, the spectral energy distribution (sed)is only mildly affected by this change. in fact, the sed compares reasonablywell with that of improved versions of the chiang &amp; goldreich (cg) model. thisshows that the latter is a reasonable model for the sed, in spite of itssimplicity. it also shows that from the sed alone, little can be learned aboutthe vertical structure of a passive circumstellar disk. the molecular lineemission from these disks is more sensitive to the vertical temperature anddensity structure, and we show as an example how the intensity and profiles ofvarious co lines depend on the adopted disk model. the models presented in thispaper can also serve as the basis of theoretical studies of e.g. dustcoagulation and settling in disks.

astro-ph;0209323	the 2-d structure of dusty disks around herbig ae/be stars, i. models  with grey opacities	in this paper the two-dimensional structure of protoplanetary disks aroundherbig ae/be stars is studied. this is done by constructing a self-consistentmodel based on 2-d radiative transfer coupled to the equation of verticalhydrostatics. as a simplifying assumption a grey opacity is used. it is foundthat the disk can adopt four different structures, dependent on the surfacedensity distribution sigma(r) as a function of radius, i.e. on radial- andvertical optical depth of the disk. for the case of high to intermediatevertical optical depth, the temperature and density structures are in agreementwith the simple ``disk with inner hole'' model of dullemond, dominik &amp; natta(2001, henceforth ddn01). at large radii the disk adopts a flaring shape asexpected, and near the dust destruction radius (located at about 0.5 au formost herbig ae stars) the disk is superheated and puffs up. the region directlybehind this ``puffed-up inner dust wall'' is shadowed, as predicted by ddn01.for the case of intermediate to low vertical optical depth, but still highradial optical depth, the 2-d models show that the shadow can cover the entiredisk. the disk is then no longer flaring. when the disk is optically thin evenin radial direction, it becomes unshadowed again because the inner rim can nolonger block the stellar light. finally, for disks that flare at intermediateradii, but become too optically thin at large radii, the outer parts once againbecome shadowed. but this time the shadowing is caused by the flaring part ofthe disk instead of the inner rim. observational consequences of these fourgeometries are discussed.

astro-ph;0304437	an analysis of two-layer models for circumstellar disks	the two-layer disk models of chiang &amp; goldreich (1997, henceforth cg) and itsderivatives are popular among astronomers because of their simplicity and theclear predictions they make for the seds of t tauri stars and herbig ae/bestars. moreover, they can be computed quickly, which is a great advantage whenfitting observations using automated procedures. in this paper we wish toassess the accuracy and reliability of 2-layer models, by comparing them todetailed vertical structure models with accurate 1+1d radiative transfer. wefocus on the shape of the sed, and the predicted height and "flaring index" ofthe disk. we first consider models where scattering is set to zero. we findthat 2-layer models overestimate significantly the near-infrared flux, and wesuggest a simple way of correcting this effect, at least in part. at longerwavelengths, the sed of two-layer models often show a two-bump structure, whichis absent in 1+1d models. nevertheless, overall agreement is reasonably good,and the differences are in most cases within 30%. at (sub)-mm wavelengths thedifferences may even be less. the shape of the disk, as measured by itspressure and surface scale height and by the flaring angle are also wellreproduced by two-layer models. when scattering is included in the 1+1d models,the differences become larger, especially in the near-infrared. we suggestsimple ways to include scattering in two-layer models and discuss theirreliability. we do not compare the two-layer models to full 2-d/3-d models, sothe conclusions remain valid only within the annulus-by-annulus approximation.

astro-ph;0305451	the effect of scattering on the structure and sed of protoplanetary  disks	in this paper we investigate how the inclusion of scattering of the stellarradiation into a passive flaring disk model affects its structure and spectralenergy distribution, and whether neglecting it could significantly decrease themodel reliability. in order to address these questions we construct a detailed1+1d vertical structure model in which the scattering properties of the dustcan be varied. models are presented with and without dust scattering, and fordifferent albedos and phase functions. it is found that scattering has theeffect of reducing the disk temperature at all heights, so that the disk"shrinks", i.e., the the density at all intermediate heights decreases.however, this effect in most cases is more than compensated by the increase ofthe total extinction (absorption + scattering) cross section, so that thesurface scale height increases, and images in scattered light will see aslightly thicker disk. the integrated infrared emission decreases as the albedoincreases, because an increasing part of the flux captured by the disk isreflected away instead of absorbed and reprocessed. the reduction of theinfrared thermal emission of the disk is stronger at short wavelengths (nearinfrared) and practically negligible at millimeter wavelengths. for relativelylow albedo (alb &lt;~ 0.5), or for strongly forward-peaked scattering (g roughly&gt;0.8), the infrared flux reduction is relatively small.

astro-ph;0306113	explaining uxor variability with self-shadowed disks	in this letter we propose a new view on ux orionis type variability. the ideais based on the earlier proposal by various authors that uxors arenearly-edge-on disks in which hydrodynamic fluctuations could cause clumps ofdust and gas to cross the line of sight. however, because the standard diskmodels have a flaring geometry, it is mostly the outer regions of the disk thatobscure the star. the time scales for such obscuration events would be too longto match the observed time scales of weeks to months. recent 2-dself-consistent models of herbig ae/be protoplanetary disks (dullemond et al.2002,2003 henceforth d02/dd03), however, have indicated that for herbig ae/bestar disks there exists, in addition to the usual flared disks, also a newclass of disks: those that are fully self-shadowed. only their puffed-up innerrim (at the dust evaporation radius) is directly irradiated by the star, whilethe disk at larger radius resides in the shadow of the rim. for these disksthere exist inclinations at which the line of sight towards the star skims theupper parts of the puffed-up inner rim, while passing high over the surface ofouter disk regions. small hydrodynamic fluctuations in the puffed-up inner rimcould then be held responsible for the extinction events seen in uxors. if thisidea is correct, it makes a prediction for the shape of the seds of thesestars. it was shown by d02/dd03 that flared disks have a strong far-ir excessand can be classified as `group i' (in the classification of meeus et al.2001), while self-shadowed disks have a relatively weak far-ir excess and areclassified as `group ii'. our model therefore predicts that uxors belong to the`group ii' sources. we show that this correlation is indeed found within asample of 86 herbig ae/be stars.

astro-ph;0401495	flaring vs. self-shadowed disks: the seds of herbig ae/be stars	isolated herbig ae stars can be divided into two groups (meeus et al. 2001):those with an almost flat spectral energy distribution in the mid-infrared(`group i'), and those with a strong decline towards the far-infrared (`groupii'). in this paper we show that the group i vs. ii distinction can beunderstood as arising from flaring vs. self-shadowed disks. we show that thesetwo types of disks are natural solutions of the 2-d radiation-hydrostaticstructure equations. disks with high optical depth turn out to be flaring andhave a strong far-ir emission, while disks with an optical depth below acertain threshold drop into the shadow of their own puffed-up inner rim and areweak in the far-ir. in spite of not having a directly irradiated surface layer,self-shadowed disks still display dust features in emission, in agreement withobservations of group ii sources. we propose an evolutionary scenario in whicha disk starts out with a flaring shape (group i source), and then goes throughthe process of grain growth, causing the optical depth of the disk to drop andthe disk to become self-shadowed (group ii source). we show that this scenariopredicts that the (sub-)millimeter slope of the disk changes from steep (smallgrains) to rayleigh-jeans-like (large grains) in the early stages of evolution,so that all group ii sources are expected to have rayleigh-jeans-like slopes,while some group i sources may still have steep (sub-)millimeter slopes.

astro-ph;0405226	the effect of dust settling on the appearance of protoplanetary disks	we analyze how the process of dust settling affects the spectral energydistribution and optical appearance of protoplanetary disks. using simpleanalytic estimates on the one hand, and detailed 1+1-d models on the otherhand, we show that, while the time scale for settling down to the equator mayexceed the life time of the disk, it takes much less time for even small grainsof 0.1 micron to settle down to a few pressure scale heights. this is oftenwell below the original location of the disk's photosphere, and the disktherefore becomes effectively 'flatter'. if turbulent stirring is included, asteady state solution can be found, which is typically reached after a fewtimes 1e5 years. dependent on the strength of the turbulence, the shape of thedisk in such a steady state can be either fully flaring, or flaring only up toa certain radius and self-shadowed beyond that radius. we show that thesepartly self-shadowed disks have a much weaker mid- to far-infrared flux thanthe fully flaring ones. we also show that these self-shadowed regions of thedisk are very weak in resolved images of scattered light, in contrast to thefully flaring disks. from the calculations with compact grains it follows that,after about 1e6 years, most disks should be self-shadowed. the fact that someolder disks are still observed with the characteristics of flaring diskstherefore seems somewhat inconsistent with the time scales predicted by thesettling model based on compact grains. this suggests that perhaps even thesmall grains (lesssim 0.1 micron) have a porous or fractal structure, or thatthe different geometries of observed disks is merely a reflection of theturbulent state of these disks.

astro-ph;0408501	the gas temperature in the surface layers of protoplanetary disks	models for the structure of protoplanetary disks have so far been based onthe assumption that the gas and the dust temperature are equal. the gastemperature, an essential ingredient in the equations of hydrostaticequilibrium of the disk, is then determined from a continuum radiative transfercalculation, in which the continuum opacity is provided by the dust. it hasbeen long debated whether this assumption still holds in the surface layers ofthe disk, where the dust infrared emission features are produced. in this paperwe compute the temperature of the gas in the surface layers of the disk in aself-consistent manner. the gas temperature is determined from aheating-cooling balance equation in which processes such as photoelectricheating, dissociative heating, dust-gas thermal heat exchange and line coolingare included. the abundances of the dominant cooling species such as co, c, c+and o are determined from a chemical network based on the atomic species h, he,c, o, s, mg, si, fe (kamp &amp; bertoldi 2000). the underlying disk models to ourcalculations are the models of dullemond, van zadelhoff &amp; natta (2002). we findthat in general the dust and gas temperature are equal to withing 10% for a_v&gt;~ 0.1, which is above the location of the `super-heated surface layer' inwhich the dust emission features are produced (e.g. chiang &amp; goldreich 1997).high above the disk surface the gas temperature exceeds the dust temperatureand can can become -- in the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- ashigh as 600 k at a radius of 100 au. this is a region where co has fullydissociated, but a significant fraction of hydrogen is still in molecular form.the densities are still high enough for non-negligible h_2 emission to beproduced.....(see paper for full abstract)

astro-ph;0409315	grain growth and dust settling in a brown dwarf disk: gemini/t-recs  observations of cfht-bd-tau 4	we present accurate mid-infrared observations of the disk around the young,bona-fide brown dwarf cfht-bd-tau 4. we report gemini/t-recs measurements inthe 7.9, 10.4 and 12.3 micron filters, from which we infer the presence of aprominent, broad silicate emission feature. the shape of the silicate featureis dominated by emission from 2 micron amorphous olivine grains. such grains,being an order of magnitude larger than those in the interstellar medium, are afirst proof of dust processing and grain growth in disks around brown dwarfs.the object's spectral energy distribution is below the prediction of theclassical flared disk model but higher than that of the two-layer flat disk. agood match can be achieved by using an intermediate disk model with stronglyreduced but non-zero flaring. grain growth and dust settling processes providea natural explanation for this disk geometry and we argue that suchintermediate flaring might explain the observations of several other browndwarf disks as well.

astro-ph;0412117	dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks: a rapid depletion of small  grains	we model the process of dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks andcalculate how it affects their observational appearance. our model involves thedetailed solution of the coagulation equation at every location in the disk. atregular time intervals we feed the resulting 3-d dust distribution functionsinto a continuum radiative transfer code to obtain spectral energydistributions. we find that, even if only the very basic -- and well understood-- coagulation mechanisms are included, the process of grain growth is much tooquick to be consistent with infrared observations of t tauri disks. smallgrains are removed so efficiently that, long before the disk reaches an age of1e6 years typical of t tauri stars, the sed shows only very weak infraredexcess. this is inconsistent with observed seds of most classical t tauristars. small grains somehow need to be replenished, for instance by aggregatefragmentation through high-speed collisions. a very simplified calculationshows that when aggregate fragmentation is included, a quasi-stationary grainsize distribution is obtained in which growth and fragmentation are inequilibrium. this quasi-stationary state may last 1e6 years or even longer,dependent on the circumstances in the disk, and may bring the time scales intothe right regime. we conclude that a simple evolutionary scenario in whichgrains slowly grow from pristine 0.1 micron grains to larger grains over aperiod of a few myr is most likely incorrect.

astro-ph;0501463	evaporation of ion-irradiated disks	we calculate the evaporation of a cool accretion disk around a black hole dueto the ion-bombardment by an ion supported accretion flow (here isaf, oroptically thin adaf). as first suggested by spruit &amp; deufel (2002), thisevaporation takes place in two stages: ion bombardment of the cool disk(shakura-sunyaev disk: ssd) produces an intermediate-temperature layer on topof the disk (`warm layer') which constitutes an independent accretion flow onboth sides of the ssd. as this warm material accretes inward of the innerradius of the ssd, it becomes thermally unstable by lack of cooling of photons,and evaporates into the isaf, thereby feeding the latter. angular momentumconservation forces a certain fraction of the isaf material to move outward,where it can bombard the ssd with its hot ions. the flow geometry is derived bycomputing stationary solutions of the continuity- and angular momentumequations for the three components (isaf, warm flow and ssd). the overallradiative output is dominated by hard x-rays. they are produced mostly from thewarm component, rather than the isaf. the expected time dependence andstability of the flow, not computed here, is discussed briefly.

astro-ph;0501570	clumpy tori around active galactic nuclei	we discuss the question whether the matter in dusty tori around activegalactic nuclei has a smooth or a clumpy structure. nenkova, ivezic &amp; elitzur(2002) have argued that the lack of emission feature in the seds of type 1 agngalaxies combined with a clear absorption feature in type 2 agn can beexplained if the circumnuclear dust is distributed in discrete clumps. our aimis to verify this. we use multi-dimensional radiative transfer models of smoothand clumpy tori, and compare the seds of equivalent smooth and clumpy models.we find that the 10 micron emission feature of the clumpy models, when seenalmost face-on, is not appreciably reduced compared to the equivalent smoothmodels. some of the clumpy models have a weak or even absent 10 micron feature,but so do some of the smooth models. on the whole the seds of clumpy and smoothtori are similar, but some details are different. the absorption feature seenat edge-on inclinations appears to be less deep in the clumpy models than inthe smooth models, and the average flux in the near-infrared regime is strongerin the clumpy models. moreover, at these inclinations the clumpy models have aslightly wider sed. whether these differences are unique enough to be used as adiagnostic for clumpiness of agn tori is not yet clear.

astro-ph;0502103	projection of circumstellar disks on their environments	we use a 3d monte carlo radiative transfer code to study the projection oflarge shadows by circumstellar disks around young stellar objects onsurrounding reflection nebulosity. it is shown that for a wide range ofparameters a small (10-100 au) circumstellar disk can project a large (1 000-10000 au) dark band in the near-infrared that often resembles a massive edge-ondisk. the disk shadows are divided into two basic types, depending on thedistribution of the reflecting material and the resulting morphology of theshadows in the near-infrared. two ysos associated with bipolar nebulosity, ck3/ec 82 illuminating the serpens reflection nebula (srn) and ced 110 irs 4 inthe chamaeleon i molecular cloud, are modelled in detail as disk shadows.spectral energy distributions of the two sources are collected using botharchival iso data and new spitzer-irs data. an axisymmetric model consisting ofa small disk and a spherically symmetric envelope can reproduce thenear-infrared images and full spectral energy distributions of the two diskshadow candidates. it is shown that the model fits can be used to constrain thegeometry of the central disks due to the magnifying effect of the projection.we find that a disk unresolved in near-infrared images, but casting a largedisk shadow, can be modelled at a level of sophistication approaching that ofan edge-on disk with resolved near-infrared images. it is found that the mostobvious observable difference between a disk shadow and a large optically thickdisk is that the disk shadows have a compact near-infrared source near thecenter of the dark band. high resolution imaging and/or polarimetry shouldreveal the compact source in the center of a disk shadow as an edge-on disk.[abstract abridged]

astro-ph;0508210	protostellar holes: spitzer space telescope observations of the  protostellar binary iras16293-2422	mid-infrared (23-35 micron) emission from the deeply embedded "class 0"protostar iras16293-2422 is detected with the spitzer space telescope infraredspectrograph. a detailed radiative transfer model reproducing the full spectralenergy distribution (sed) from 23 micron to 1.3 mm requires a large innercavity of radius 600 au in the envelope to avoid quenching the emission fromthe central sources. this is consistent with a previous suggestion based onhigh angular resolution millimeter interferometric data. an alternativeinterpretation using a 2d model of the envelope with an outflow cavity canreproduce the sed but not the interferometer visibilities. the cavity size iscomparable to the centrifugal radius of the envelope and therefore appears tobe a natural consequence of the rotation of the protostellar core, which hasalso caused the fragmentation leading to the central protostellar binary. witha large cavity such as required by the data, the average temperature at a givenradius does not increase above 60-80 k and although hot spots with highertemperatures may be present close to each protostar, these constitute a smallfraction of the material in the inner envelope. the proposed cavity will alsohave consequences for the interpretation of molecular line data, especially ofcomplex species probing high temperatures in the inner regions of the envelope.

astro-ph;0511092	c2d spitzer-irs spectra of disks around t tauri stars: i. silicate  emission and grain growth	infrared ~5--35 um spectra for 40 solar-mass t tauri stars and 7intermediate-mass herbig ae stars with circumstellar disks were obtained usingthe spitzer space telescope as part of the c2d irs survey. this workcomplements prior spectroscopic studies of silicate infrared emission fromdisks, which were focused on intermediate-mass stars, with observations ofsolar-mass stars limited primarily to the 10 um region. the observed 10 and 20um silicate feature strengths/shapes are consistent with source-to-sourcevariations in grain size. a large fraction of the features are weak and flat,consistent with um-sized grains indicating fast grain growth (from 0.1--1.0 umin radius). in addition, approximately half of the t tauri star spectra showcrystalline silicate features near 28 and 33 um indicating significantprocessing when compared to interstellar grains. a few sources show large10-to-20 um ratios and require even larger grains emitting at 20 um than at 10um. this size difference may arise from the difference in the depth into thedisk probed by the two silicate emission bands in disks where dust settling hasoccurred. the 10 um feature strength vs. shape trend is not correlated with ageor halpha equivalent width, suggesting that some amount of turbulent mixing andregeneration of small grains is occurring. the strength vs. shape trend isrelated to spectral type, however, with m stars showing significantly flatter10 um features (larger grain sizes) than a/b stars. the connection betweenspectral type and grain size is interpreted in terms of the variation in thesilicate emission radius as a function of stellar luminosity, but could also beindicative of other spectral-type dependent factors (e.g, x-rays, uv radiation,stellar/disk winds, etc.).

astro-ph;0602154	crystalline silicates as a probe of disk formation history	we present a new perspective on the crystallinity of dust in protoplanetarydisks. the dominant crystallization by thermal annealing happens in the veryearly phases of disk formation and evolution. both the disk properties and thelevel of crystallinity are thereby directly linked to the properties of themolecular cloud core from which the star+disk system was formed. we show that,under the assumption of single star formation, rapidly rotating clouds producedisks which, after the main infall phase (i.e. in the optically revealed classii phase), are rather massive and have a high accretion rate but lowcrystallinity. slowly rotating clouds, on the other hand, produce less massivedisks with lower accretion rate, but high levels of crystallinity. cloudfragmentation and the formation of multiple stars complicates the problem andnecessitates further study. the underlying physics of the model isinsufficiently understood to provide the precise relationship betweencrystallinity, disk mass and accretion rate. but the fact that with `standard'input physics the model produces disks which, in comparison to observations,appear to have either too high levels of crystallinity or too high disk masses,demonstrates that the comparison of these models to observations can placestrong contraints on the disk physics. the question to ask is not why somesources are so crystalline, but why some other sources have such a low level ofcrystallinity.

astro-ph;0602619	models of the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks	we review advances in the modeling of protoplanetary disks. this review willfocus on the regions of the disk beyond the dust sublimation radius, i.e.beyond 0.1 - 1 au, depending on the stellar luminosity. we will be mostlyconcerned with models that aim to fit spectra of the dust continuum or gaslines, and derive physical parameters from these fits. for optically thickdisks, these parameters include the accretion rate through the disk onto thestar, the geometry of the disk, the dust properties, the surface chemistry andthe thermal balance of the gas. for the latter we are mostly concerned with theupper layers of the disk, where the gas and dust temperature decouple and aphotoevaporative flow may originate. we also briefly discuss optically thindisks, focusing mainly on the gas, not the dust. the evolution of these disksis dominated by accretion, viscous spreading, photoevaporation, and dustsettling and coagulation. the density and temperature structure arising fromthe surface layer models provide input to models of photoevaporation, whichoccurs largely in the outer disk. we discuss the consequences ofphotoevaporation on disk evolution and planet formation.

astro-ph;0612450	probing protoplanetary disks with silicate emission: where is the  silicate emission zone?	recent results indicate that the grain size and crystallinity inferred fromobservations of silicate features may be correlated with spectral type of thecentral star and/or disk geometry. in this paper, we show that grain size, asprobed by the 10 um silicate feature peak-to-continuum and 11.3-to-9.8 um fluxratios, is inversely proportional to log l_star. these trends can be understoodusing a simple two-layer disk model for passive irradiated flaring disks,cgplus. we find that the radius, r_10, of the 10 um silicate emission zone inthe disk goes as (l_star/l_sun)^0.56, with slight variations depending on diskgeometry (flaring angle, inner disk radius). the observed correlations,combined with simulated emission spectra of olivine and pyroxene mixtures,imply a grain size dependence on luminosity. combined with the fact that r_10is smaller for less luminous stars, this implies that the apparent grain sizeof the emitting dust is larger for low-luminositysources. in contrast, ourmodels suggest that the crystallinity is only marginally affected, because forincreasing luminosity, the zone for thermal annealing (assumed to be at t&gt;800k) is enlarged by roughly the same factor as the silicate emission zone. theobserved crystallinity is affected by disk geometry, however, with increasedcrystallinity in flat disks. the apparent crystallinity may also increase withgrain growth due to a corresponding increase in contrast between crystallineand amorphous silicate emission bands.

astro-ph;0701606	pah chemistry and ir emission from circumstellar disks	aims. the chemistry of, and infrared (ir) emission from, polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs) in disks around herbig ae/be and t tauri stars areinvestigated. the equilibrium distribution of the pahs over all accessiblecharge/hydrogenation states depends on the size and shape of the pahs and onthe physical properties of the star and surrounding disk.  methods. a chemistry model is created to calculate this equilibriumdistribution. destruction of pahs by ultraviolet (uv) photons, possibly inmulti-photon absorption events, is taken into account. the chemistry model iscoupled to a radiative transfer code to provide the physical parameters and tocombine the pah emission with the spectral energy distribution (sed) from thestar+disk system.  results. normally hydrogenated pahs in herbig ae/be disks account for most ofthe observed pah emission, with neutral and positively ionized speciescontributing in roughly equal amounts. close to the midplane, the pahs are morestrongly hydrogenated and negatively ionized, but these species do notcontribute to the overall emission because of the low uv/optical flux deepinside the disk. pahs of 50 carbon atoms are destroyed out to 100 au in thedisk's surface layer, and the resulting spatial extent of the emission does notagree well with observations. rather, pahs of about 100 carbon atoms or moreare predicted to cause most of the observed emission. the emission is extendedon a scale similar to that of the size of the disk. furthermore, the emissionfrom t tauri disks is much weaker and concentrated more towards the centralstar than that from herbig ae/be disks. positively ionized pahs are predictedto be largely absent in t tauri disks because of the weaker radiation field.

astro-ph;0701651	abundant crystalline silicates in the disk of a very low mass star	we announce the discovery of sst-lup3-1, a very low mass star close to thebrown dwarf boundary in lupus iii with a circum(sub)stellar disk, discovered bythe `cores to disks' spitzer legacy program from mid-, near-infrared andoptical data, with very conspicuous crystalline silicate features in itsspectrum. it is the first of such objects with a full 5 to 35 micron spectrumtaken with the irs and it shows strong 10 and 20 micron silicate features withhigh feature to continuum ratios and clear crystalline features out to 33micron. the dust in the disk upper layer has a crystalline silicate grainfraction between 15% and 33%, depending on the assumed dust continuum. theavailability of the full spitzer infrared spectrum allows an analysis of thedust composition as a function of temperature and position in the disk. the hot(~ 300 k) dust responsible for the 10 micron feature consists of a roughlyequal mix of small (~ 0.1 micron) and large (~ 1.5 micron) grains, whereas thecold (~ 70 k) dust responsible for the longer wavelength silicate featurescontains primarily large grains (&gt; 1 micron). since the cold dust emissionarises from deeper layers in the inner (&lt; 3 au) disk as well as from thesurface layers of the outer (3-5 au) disk, this provides direct evidence forcombined grain growth and settling in the disk. the inferred crystalline massfractions in the two components are comparable. since only the inner 0.02 au ofthe disk is warm enough to anneal the amorphous silicate grains, even thelowest fraction of 15% of crystalline material requires either very efficientmixing or other formation mechanisms.

0809.3916	coagulation of small grains in disks: the influence of residual infall  and initial small-grain content	turbulent coagulation in protoplanetary disks is known to operate ontimescale far shorter than the lifetime of the disk. in the absence ofmechanisms that replenish the small dust grain population, protoplanetary diskswould rapidly lose their continuum opacity-bearing dust. this is inconsistentwith infrared observations of disks around t tauri stars and herbig ae/bestars, which are usually optically thick at visual wavelengths and showsignatures of small (a&lt;~ 3um) grains. a plausible replenishing mechanism ofsmall grains is collisional fragmentation or erosion of large dust aggregates,which model calculations predict to play an important role in protoplanetarydisks. if optically thick disks are to be seen as proof for ongoingfragmentation or erosion, then alternative explanations for the existence ofoptically thick disks must be studied carefully. in this study we explore twoscenarios. first, we study the effect of residual, low-level infall of matteronto the disk surface. we find that infall rates as low as 10^{-11} msun/yrcan, in principle, replenish the small grain population to a level that keepsthe disk marginally optically thick. however, it remains to be seen if theassumption of such inflow is realistic for star+disk systems at the age ofseveral myrs, at which winds and jets are expected to have removed any residualenvelope. in summary, fragmentation or erosion still appear to be the mostpromising processes to explain the abundant presence of small grains in olddisks.

0811.0915	a parameter study of self-consistent disk models around herbig aebe  stars	we present a parameter study of self-consistent models of protoplanetarydisks around herbig aebe stars. we use the code developed by dullemond anddominik, which solves the 2d radiative transfer problem including an iterationfor the vertical hydrostatic structure of the disk. this grid of models will beused for several studies on disk emission and mineralogy in followup papers. inthis paper we take a first look on the new models, compare them with previousmodeling attempts and focus on the effects of various parameters on the overallstructure of the sed that leads to the classification of herbig aebe stars intotwo groups, with a flaring (group i) or self-shadowed (group ii) sed. we findthat the parameter of overriding importance to the sed is the total mass ingrains smaller than 25um, confirming the earlier results by dullemond anddominik. all other parameters studied have only minor influences, and willalter the sed type only in borderline cases. we find that there is no naturaldichotomy between group i and ii. from a modeling point of view, the transitionis a continuous function of the small dust mass. we also show that moderategrain growth produces spectra with weak or no 1um feature, both for flaring(group i) and non-flaring (group ii) sources. the fact that sources with weakfeatures have been found mostly in group i sources is therefore surprising andmust be due to observational biases or evolutionary effects.

0812.3664	lack of pah emission toward low-mass embedded young stellar objects	pahs have been detected toward molecular clouds and some young stars withdisks, but have not yet been associated with embedded young stars. we present asensitive mid-ir spectroscopic survey of pah features toward a sample oflow-mass embedded ysos. the aim is to put constraints on the pah abundance inthe embedded phase of star formation using radiative transfer modeling.  vlt-isaac l-band spectra for 39 sources and spitzer irs spectra for 53sources are presented. line intensities are compared to recent surveys ofherbig ae/be and t tauri stars. the radiative transfer codes radmc and radicalare used to model the pah emission from embedded ysos consisting of a pms starwith a circumstellar disk embedded in an envelope. the dependence of the pahfeature on pah abundance, stellar radiation field, inclination and theextinction by the surrounding envelope is studied.  the 3.3 micron pah feature is undetected for the majority of the sample(97%), with typical upper limits of 5e-16 w/m^2. compact 11.2 micron pahemission is seen directly towards 1 out of the 53 spitzer short-high spectra,for a source that is borderline embedded. for all 12 sources with both vlt andspitzer spectra, no pah features are detected in either. in total, pah featuresare detected toward at most 1 out of 63 (candidate) embedded protostars (&lt;~2%), even lower than observed for class ii t tauri stars with disks (11-14%).assuming typical class i stellar and envelope parameters, the absence of pahsemission is most likely explained by the absence of emitting carriers through apah abundance at least an order of magnitude lower than in molecular clouds butsimilar to that found in disks. thus, most pahs likely enter the protoplanetarydisks frozen out in icy layers on dust grains and/or in coagulated form.
