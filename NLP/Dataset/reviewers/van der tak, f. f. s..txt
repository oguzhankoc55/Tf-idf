0906.5154	probing x-ray irradiation in the nucleus of ngc 1068 with observations  of high-j lines of dense gas tracers	with the incorporation of high-j molecular lines, we aim to constrain thephysical conditions of the dense gas in the central region of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and to determine signatures of the agn or the starburstcontribution.  we used the james clerk maxwell telescope to observe the j=4-3 transition ofhcn, hnc, and hco+, as well as the cn n_j=2_{5/2}-1_{3/2} andn_j=3_{5/2}-2_{5/2}, in ngc 1068.  we estimate the excitation conditions of hcn, hnc, and cn, based on the lineintensity ratios and radiative transfer models.  we find that the bulk emission of hcn, hnc, cn, and the high-j hco+ emergefrom dense gas n(h_2)&gt;=10^5 cm^-3). however, the low-j hco+ lines (dominatingthe hco+ column density) trace less dense (n(h_2)&lt;10^5 cm^-3) and colder(t_k&lt;=20 k) gas, whereas the high-j hco+ emerges from warmer (&gt;30 k) gas thanthe other molecules.  the hco+ j=4-3 line intensity, compared with the lower transition lines andwith the hcn j=4-3 line, support the influence of a local xdr environment. theestimated n(cn)/n(hcn)~1-4 column density ratios are indicative of an xdr/agnenvironment with a possible contribution of grain-surface chemistry induced byx-rays or shocks.

0912.1626	the iso long wavelength spectrometer line spectrum of vy canis majoris  and other oxygen-rich evolved stars	the far-infrared spectra of circumstellar envelopes around variousoxygen-rich stars were observed using the iso long wavelength spectrometer(lws). we have examined high signal-to-noise iso lws observations of theluminous supergiant star, vy cma, with the aim of identifying all of thespectral lines. by paying particular attention to water lines, we aim toseparate the lines due to other species, in particular, to prepare forforthcoming observations that will cover the same spectral range using herschelpacs and at higher spectral resolution using herschel hifi and sofia. we havedeveloped a fitting method to account for blended water lines using a simpleweighting scheme to distribute the flux. we have applied this approach toseveral other stars which we compare with vy cma. we present line fluxes forthe unblended h2o and co lines, and present detections of several possiblenu_2=1 vibrationally excited water lines. we also identify blended lines of oh,one unblended and several blended lines of nh3, and one possible detection ofh3o+.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.2903	water abundance variations around high-mass protostars: herschel-hifi  observations of the dr21 region	water is a key molecule in the star formation process, but its spatialdistribution in star-forming regions is not well known. we study thedistribution of dust continuum and h2o and 13co line emission in dr21, aluminous star-forming region with a powerful outflow and a compact hii region.herschel-hifi spectra near 1100 ghz show narrow 13co 10-9 emission and h2o1(11)-0(00) absorption from the dense core and broad emission from the outflowin both lines. the h2o line also shows absorption by a foreground cloud knownfrom ground-based observations of low-j co lines. the dust continuum emissionis extended over 36" fwhm, while the 13co and h2o lines are confined to ~24" orless. the foreground absorption appears to peak further north than the othercomponents. radiative transfer models indicate very low abundances of ~2e-10for h2o and ~8e-7 for 13co in the dense core, and higher h2o abundances of~4e-9 in the foreground cloud and ~7e-7 in the outflow. the high h2o abundancein the warm outflow is probably due to the evaporation of water-rich icy grainmantles, while the h2o abundance is kept down by freeze-out in the dense coreand by photodissociation in the foreground cloud.

1006.3236	tracing early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation with  molecular lines	despite its major role in the evolution of the interstellar medium, theformation of high-mass stars (m &gt; 10 msol) is still poorly understood. twotypes of massive star cluster precursors, the so-called massive dense cores(mdcs), have been observed, which differ in their mid-infrared brightness. theorigin of this difference is not established and could be the result ofevolution, density, geometry differences, or a combination of these. we compareseveral molecular tracers of physical conditions (hot cores, shocks) observedin a sample of mid-ir weak emitting mdcs with previous results obtained in asample of exclusively mid-ir bright mdcs. the aim is to understand thedifferences between these two types of object. we present single-dishobservations of hdo, h2o-18, so2 and ch3oh lines at lambda = 1.3 - 3.5 mm. westudy line profiles and estimate abundances of these molecules, and use apartial correlation method to search for trends in the results. the detectionrates of thermal emission lines are found to be very similar between mid-irquiet and bright objects. the abundances of h2o, hdo (1e-13 to 1e-9 in the coldouter envelopes), so2 and ch3oh differ from source to source but independentlyof their mid-ir flux. in contrast, the methanol class i maser emission, atracer of outflow shocks, is found to be strongly anti-correlated with the 12micron source brightnesses. the enhancement of the methanol maser emission inmid-ir quiet mdcs may indicate a more embedded nature. since total masses aresimilar between the two samples, we suggest that the matter distribution isspherical around mid-ir quiet sources but flattened around mid-ir bright ones.in contrast, water emission is associated with objects containing a hotmolecular core, irrespective of their mid-ir brightness. these results indicatethat the mid-ir brightness of mdcs is an indicator of their evolutionary stage.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1007.1539	herschel/hifi observations of spectrally resolved methylidyne signatures  toward the high-mass star-forming core ngc6334i	in contrast to extensively studied dense star-forming cores, little is knownabout diffuse gas surrounding star-forming regions. we study molecular gas inthe high-mass star-forming region ngc6334i, which contains diffuse, quiescentcomponents that are inconspicuous in widely used molecular tracers such as co.we present herschel/hifi observations of ch toward ngc6334i observed as part ofthe chess key program. hifi resolves the hyperfine components of its j=3/2-1/2transition, observed in both emission and absorption. the ch emission appearsclose to the systemic velocity of ngc6334i, while its measured linewidth of 3km/s is smaller than previously observed in dense gas tracers such as nh3 andsio. the ch abundance in the hot core is 7 10^-11, two to three orders ofmagnitude lower than in diffuse clouds. while other studies find distinctoutflows in, e.g., co and h2o toward ngc6334i, we do not detect outflowsignatures in ch. to explain the absorption signatures, at least two absorbingcomponents are needed at -3.0 and +6.5 km/s with n(ch)=7 10^13 and 3 10^13cm^-2. two additional absorbing clouds are found at +8.0 and 0.0 km/s, bothwith n(ch)=2 10^13 cm^-2. turbulent linewidths for the four absorptioncomponents vary between 1.5 and 5.0 km/s in fwhm. we constrain physicalproperties of our ch clouds by matching our ch absorbers with other absorptionsignatures. in the hot core, molecules such as h2o and co trace gas that isheated and dynamically influenced by outflow activity, whereas ch traces morequiescent material. the four ch absorbers have column densities and turbulentproperties consistent with diffuse clouds: two are located near ngc6334, andtwo are unrelated foreground clouds. local density and dynamical effectsinfluence the chemical composition of physical components of ngc6334, causingsome components to be seen in ch but not in other tracers, and vice versa.

1007.4119	water abundances in high-mass protostellar envelopes: herschel  observations with hifi	we derive the dense core structure and the water abundance in four massivestar-forming regions which may help understand the earliest stages of massivestar formation. we present herschel-hifi observations of the para-h2o 1_11-0_00and 2_02-1_11 and the para-h2-18o 1_11-0_00 transitions. the envelopecontribution to the line profiles is separated from contributions by outflowsand foreground clouds. the envelope contribution is modelled using monte-carloradiative transfer codes for dust and molecular lines (mc3d and ratran), withthe water abundance and the turbulent velocity width as free parameters. whilethe outflows are mostly seen in emission in high-j lines, envelopes are seen inabsorption in ground-state lines, which are almost saturated. the derived waterabundances range from 5e-10 to 4e-8 in the outer envelopes. we detect coldclouds surrounding the protostar envelope, thanks to the very high quality ofthe herschel-hifi data and the unique ability of water to probe them. severalforeground clouds are also detected along the line of sight. the low h2oabundances in massive dense cores are in accordance with the expectation thathigh densities and low temperatures lead to freeze-out of water on dust grains.the spread in abundance values is not clearly linked to physical properties ofthe sources.

1007.4691	first detection of nd in the solar-mass protostar iras16293-2422	in the past decade, much progress has been made in characterising theprocesses leading to the enhanced deuterium fractionation observed in the ismand in particular in the cold, dense parts of star forming regions such asprotostellar envelopes. very high molecular d/h ratios have been found forsaturated molecules and ions. however, little is known about the deuteriumfractionation in radicals, even though simple radicals often represent anintermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. theimidogen radical nh is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesisin the gas phase. herschel/hifi represents a unique opportunity to study thedeuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observablefrom the ground. we searched here for the deuterated radical nd in order todetermine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuterationmechanism of this species. we observed the solar-mass class 0 protostariras16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument hifi as part of the herschel keyprogramme chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions). thedeuterated form of the imidogen radical nd was detected and securely identifiedwith 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorptionagainst the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. the 3groups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart nh were alsodetected in absorption. we derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an[nd]/[nh] ratio of between 30 and 100%. the deuterium fractionation of imidogenis of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggeststhat an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. we discuss twopossible formation pathways for nd, by means of either the reaction of n+ withhd, or deuteron/proton exchange with nh.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1101.5529	the jcmt spectral legacy survey: physical structure of the molecular  envelope of the high-mass protostar afgl2591	the understanding of the formation process of massive stars (&gt;8 msun) islimited, due to theoretical complications and observational challenges.  we investigate the physical structure of the large-scale (~10^4-10^5 au)molecular envelope of the high-mass protostar afgl2591 using spectral imagingin the 330-373 ghz regime from the jcmt spectral legacy survey. out of ~160spectral features, this paper uses the 35 that are spatially resolved.  the observed spatial distributions of a selection of six species are comparedwith radiative transfer models based on a static spherically symmetricstructure, a dynamic spherical structure, and a static flattened structure. themaps of co and its isotopic variations exhibit elongated geometries on scalesof ~100", and smaller scale substructure is found in maps of n2h+, o-h2co, cs,so2, cch, and methanol lines. a velocity gradient is apparent in maps of allmolecular lines presented here, except so, so2, and h2co. we find two emissionpeaks in warm (eup~200k) methanol separated by 12", indicative of a secondaryheating source in the envelope.  the spherical models are able to explain the distribution of emission for theoptically thin h13co+ and c34s, but not for the optically thick hcn, hco+, andcs, nor for the optically thin c17o. the introduction of velocity structuremitigates the optical depth effects, but does not fully explain theobservations, especially in the spectral dimension. a static flattened envelopeviewed at a small inclination angle does slightly better.  we conclude that a geometry of the envelope other than an isotropic staticsphere is needed to circumvent line optical depth effects. we propose that thiscould be achieved in envelope models with an outflow cavity and/orinhomogeneous structure at scales smaller than ~10^4 au. the picture ofinhomogeneity is supported by observed substructure in at least six species.

0710.1503	modeling the water line emission from the high-mass star-forming region  afgl2591	context: observations of water lines are a sensitive probe of the geometry,dynamics and chemical structure of dense molecular gas. the launch of herschelwith on board hifi and pacs allow to probe the behaviour of multiple waterlines with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. aims: we investigate thediagnostic value of specific water transitions in high-mass star-formingregions. as a test case, we apply our models to the afgl2591 region. results:in general, for models with a constant water abundance, the ground state lines,i.e., 1_(10)-1_(01), 1_(11)-0_(00), and 2_(12)-1_(01), are predicted inabsorption, all the others in emission. this behaviour changes for models witha water abundance jump profile in that the line profiles for jumps by a factorof ~10-100 are similar to the line shapes in the constant abundance models,whereas larger jumps lead to emission profiles. asymmetric line profiles arefound for models with a cavity outflow and depend on the inclination angle.models with an outflow cavity are favoured to reproduce the swas observationsof the 1_(10)-1_(01) ground-state transition. pacs spectra will tell us aboutthe geometry of these regions, both through the continuum and through thelines. conclusions: it is found that the low-lying transitions of water aresensitive to outflow features, and represent the excitation conditions in theouter regions. high-lying transitions are more sensitive to the adopted densityand temperature distribution which probe the inner excitation conditions. theherschel mission will thus be very helpful to constrain the physical andchemical structure of high-mass star-forming regions such as afgl2591.

1112.3860	detection of hf emission from the orion bar	the clumpy density structure of photon-dominated regions is well established,but the physical properties of the clumps and of the surrounding interclumpmedium are only approximately known. the aim of this paper is to constrain thephysical and chemical conditions in the orion bar, a prototypical nearbyphoton-dominated region. we present observations of the hf j=1-0 line, whichappears in emission toward the orion bar, and compare the brightness of theline to non-lte radiative transfer calculations. the large width of the hf linesuggests an origin of the emission in the interclump gas, but collisionalexcitation by h2 in the interclump gas underpredicts the observed lineintensity by factors of 3-5. in contrast, an origin of the line in the denseclumps requires a density of ~10^9 cm^-3, 10-100 times higher than previousestimates, which is unlikely. however, electron impact excitation reproducesour observations for t = 100 k and n(e) = 10 cm^-3, as expected for theinterclump gas. we conclude that hf emission is a signpost of molecular gaswith a high electron density. similar conditions may apply to active galacticnuclei where hf also appears in emission.

1202.5637	multi-line detection of o2 toward rho oph a	models of pure gas-phase chemistry in well-shielded regions of molecularclouds predict relatively high levels of molecular oxygen, o2, and water, h2o.contrary to expectation, the space missions swas and odin found only very smallamounts of water vapour and essentially no o2 in the dense star-forminginterstellar medium. only toward rho oph a did odin detect a weak line of o2 at119 ghz in a beam size of 10 arcmin. a larger telescope aperture such as thatof the herschel space observatory is required to resolve the o2 emission and topinpoint its origin. we use the heterodyne instrument for the far infraredaboard herschel to obtain high resolution o2 spectra toward selected positionsin rho oph a. these data are analysed using standard techniques for o2excitation and compared to recent pdr-like chemical cloud models. the 487.2ghzline was clearly detected toward all three observed positions in rho oph a. inaddition, an oversampled map of the 773.8ghz transition revealed the detectionof the line in only half of the observed area. based on their ratios, thetemperature of the o2 emitting gas appears to vary quite substantially, withwarm gas (&gt; 50 k) adjacent to a much colder region, where temperatures arebelow 30 k. the exploited models predict o2 column densities to be sensitive tothe prevailing dust temperatures, but rather insensitive to the temperatures ofthe gas. in agreement with these model, the observationally determined o2column densities seem not to depend strongly on the derived gas temperatures,but fall into the range n(o2) = (3 to &gt;6)e15/cm^2. beam averaged o2 abundancesare about 5e-8 relative to h2. combining the hifi data with earlier odinobservations yields a source size at 119 ghz of about 4 - 5 arcmin,encompassing the entire rho oph a core.

1204.0390	extended warm and dense gas towards w49a: starburst conditions in our  galaxy?	the star formation rates in starburst galaxies are orders of magnitude higherthan in local star-forming regions, and the origin of this difference is notwell understood. we use sub-mm spectral line maps to characterize the physicalconditions of the molecular gas in the luminous galactic star-forming regionw49a and compare them with the conditions in starburst galaxies. we probe thetemperature and density structure of w49a using h_2co and hcn line ratios overa 2'x2' (6.6x6.6 pc) field with an angular resolution of 15" (~0.8 pc) providedby the jcmt spectral legacy survey. we analyze the rotation diagrams of lineswith multiple transitions with corrections for optical depth and beam dilution,and estimate excitation temperatures and column densities. comparing theobserved line intensity ratios with non-lte radiative transfer models, ourresults reveal an extended region (about 1'x1', equivalent to ~3x3 pc at thedistance of w49a) of warm (&gt; 100 k) and dense (&gt;10^5 cm^-3) molecular gas, witha mass of 2x10^4 - 2x10^5 m_sun (by applying abundances derived for otherregions of massive star-formation). these temperatures and densities in w49aare comparable to those found in clouds near the center of the milky way and instarburst galaxies. the highly excited gas is likely to be heated via shocksfrom the stellar winds of embedded, o-type stars or alternatively due to uvirradiation, or possibly a combination of these two processes. cosmic rays,x-ray irradiation and gas-grain collisional heating are less likely to be thesource of the heating in the case of w49a.

1204.4367	kinematics of the inner thousand au region around the young massive star  afgl 2591-vla3: a massive disk candidate?	[context] recent detections of disks around young high-mass stars support theidea of massive star formation through accretion rather than coalescence, butthe detailed kinematics in the equatorial region of the disk candidates is notwell known, which limits our understanding of the accretion process. [aims]this paper explores the kinematics of the gas around a young massive star withmillimeter-wave interferometry to improve our understanding of the formation ofmassive stars though accretion. [methods] we use plateau de bureinterferometric images to probe the environment of the nearby (~1 kpc) andluminous (~20000 lsun) high-mass (10-16 msun) young star afgl 2591-vla3 incontinuum and in lines of hdo, h218o and so2 in the 115 and 230 ghz bands.radiative transfer calculations are employed to investigate the kinematics ofthe source. [results] at ~0.5" (500 au) resolution, the line images clearlyresolve the velocity field of the central compact source (diameter of ~ 800 au)and show linear velocity gradients in the northeast-southwest direction.judging from the disk-outflow geometry, the observed velocity gradient resultsfrom rotation and radial expansion in the equatorial region of vla3. radiativetransfer calculations suggest that the velocity field is consistent withsub-keplerian rotation plus hubble-law like expansion. the line profiles of theobserved molecules suggest a layered structure, with hdo emission arising fromthe disk mid-plane, h218o from the warm mid-layer, and so2 from the upper disk.[conclusions] we propose afgl 2591-vla3 as a new massive disk candidate, withpeculiar kinematics. the rotation of this disk is sub-keplerian, probably dueto magnetic braking, while the stellar wind may be responsible for theexpansion of the disk. the expansion motion [...]

1211.3359	herschel/hifi observations of [cii] and [13cii] in pdrs	recently, we introduced detailed isotopic chemistry into the kosma-tau modelfor photon-dominated regions (pdrs) to give theoretical predictions for theabundance of the carbon isotopologues as a function of pdr parameters. combinedwith radiative transfer computations for specific geometries, we estimated thepossible intensity ratio of the [cii]/[13cii] lines. here, we compare thesepredictions with new observations.  we performed herschel/hifi observations of the [cii] 158micron line in anumber of pdrs. in all sources we observed at least two hyperfine components ofthe [13cii] transition allowing to determine the [cii]/[13cii] intensity ratio,after some revision of the intrinsic hyperfine ratios. comparing the intensityratios with the results from the updated kosma-tau model, we identify casesdominated by chemical fractionation and cases dominated by the optical depth ofthe main isotopic line.  an observable enhancement of the [cii]/[13cii] intensity ratio due tochemical fractionation depends mostly on geometry and velocity structure, andless on the gas density and radiation field. in our observations the[cii]/[13cii] ratio for the integrated line intensity was always dominated bythe optical depth of the main isotopic line. however, an enhanced intensityratio is found for particular velocity components in a few sources: thered-shifted material in the ultracompact hii region mon r2, the wings of theturbulent profile in the orion bar, and possibly a blue wing in ngc7023. themapping of the [13cii] lines in the orion bar allows to derive a c+ columndensity map confirming the temperature stratification of the c+ layer, inagreement with the chemical stratification of the bar. the c+ column densitiesfor all sources show that at the position of the [cii] peak emission, adominant fraction of the gas-phase carbon is in the form of c+.

1301.4658	herschel-hifi observations of high-j co and isotopologues in  star-forming regions: from low- to high-mass	context; our understanding of the star formation process has traditionallybeen confined to certain mass or luminosity boundaries because most studiesfocus only on low-, intermediate- or high-mass star-forming regions. as part ofthe "water in star-forming regions with herschel" (wish) key program, water andother important molecules, such as co and oh, have been observed in 51 embeddedyoung stellar objects (ysos). the studied sample covers a range of luminositiesfrom &lt;1 to &gt;10^5 l_sol. aims; we analyse the co line emission towards a largesample of protostars in terms of both line intensities and profiles. methods;herschel-hifi spectra of the 12co 10-9, 13co 10-9 and c18o 5-4, 9-8 and 10-9lines are analysed for a sample of 51 ysos. in addition, jcmt spectra of 12co3-2 and c18o 3-2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. results; allobserved co and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation betweenthe logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders ofmagnitude on both axes. this suggests that the high-j co lines primarily tracethe amount of dense gas associated with ysos. this relation can be extended tolarger (extragalactic) scales. the majority of the detected 12co line profilescan be decomposed into a broad and a narrow gaussian component, while the c18ospectra are mainly fitted with a single gaussian. a broadening of the lineprofile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, whichis due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). the widths of thebroad 12co 3-2 and 10-9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrowc18o 9-8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelopemotions are related independent of the mass of the protostar. these resultsindicate that physical processes in protostellar envelopes have similarcharacteristics across the studied luminosity range.

[conclusions] the proto-trapeziumcluster w3 irs5 is an ideal test case to discriminate between models of massivestar formation. either the massive stars accrete locally from their localcores; in this case the small core masses imply that w3 irs5 is at the very endstages (1000 yr) of infall and accretion, or the stars are accreting from theglobal collapse of a massive, cluster forming core. we find that the observedmasses, densities and line widths observed toward w3 irs 5 and the surroundingcluster forming core are consistent with the competitive accretion of gas atrates of macc~10^-4 msun yr^-1 by the massive young forming stars. ......

1409.5704	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish) v. the physical  conditions in low-mass protostellar outflows revealed by multi-transition  water observations	context: outflows are an important part of the star formation process as boththe result of ongoing active accretion and one of the main sources ofmechanical feedback on small scales. water is the ideal tracer of these effectsbecause it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.method: we present \textit{herschel} hifi spectra of multiple water-transitionstowards 29 nearby class 0/i protostars as part of the wish survey. these aredecomposed into different gaussian components, with each related to one ofthree parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock andspot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. we then constrain theexcitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. results:water emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios thatdo not vary with velocity, in contrast to co. the physical conditions of thecavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock h$_{2}$ densities of order10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\,cm$^{-3}$ and h$_{2}$o column densities of order10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\,cm$^{-2}$. h$_{2}$o emission originates in compactemitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources withradii of order 10-200\,au, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thinlayer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\,au.conclusions: water emission at the source position traces two distinctkinematic components in the outflow; j shocks at the base of the outflow or inthe jet, and c shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. class i sources havesimilar excitation conditions to class 0 sources, but generally smallerline-widths and emitting region sizes. we suggest that it is the velocity ofthe wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density ormass, that is the cause of the decrease in h$_{2}$o intensity between class 0and i.

1412.1106	herschel survey of galactic oh+, h2o+, and h3o+: probing the molecular  hydrogen fraction and cosmic-ray ionization rate	in diffuse interstellar clouds the chemistry that leads to the formation ofthe oxygen bearing ions oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ begins with the ionization ofatomic hydrogen by cosmic rays, and continues through subsequent hydrogenabstraction reactions involving h2. given these reaction pathways, the observedabundances of these molecules are useful in constraining both the totalcosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen (zeta_h) and molecular hydrogenfraction, f(h2). we present observations targeting transitions of oh+, h2o+,and h3o+ made with the herschel space observatory along 20 galactic sight linestoward bright submillimeter continuum sources. both oh+ and h2o+ are detectedin absorption in multiple velocity components along every sight line, but h3o+is only detected along 7 sight lines. from the molecular abundances we computef(h2) in multiple distinct components along each line of sight, and find agaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation 0.042+-0.018. thisconfirms previous findings that oh+ and h2o+ primarily reside in gas with lowh2 fractions. we also infer zeta_h throughout our sample, and find a log-normaldistribution with mean log(zeta_h)=-15.75, (zeta_h=1.78x10^-16 s^-1), andstandard deviation 0.29 for gas within the galactic disk, but outside of thegalactic center. this is in good agreement with the mean and distribution ofcosmic-ray ionization rates previously inferred from h3+ observations.ionization rates in the galactic center tend to be 10--100 times larger thanfound in the galactic disk, also in accord with prior studies.

1412.4818	observations of water with herschel/hifi toward the high-mass protostar  afgl 2591	water is a sensitive tracer of physical conditions in star-forming regionsbecause of its large abundance variations between hot and cold regions. we usespectrally resolved observations of rotational lines of h$_2$o and itsisotopologs with herschel/hifi to constrain the physical conditions of thewater emitting region toward the high-mass protostar afgl2591. we useanalytical estimates and rotation diagrams to estimate t$_{ex}$ and columndensities of h$_2$o of the envelope, the outflow, and a foreground cloud.furthermore, we use the non-lte radiative transfer code to estimate thetemperature and volume density of the h$_2$o emitting gas. assuming lte, weestimate an t$_{ex}$ of 42 k and a column density of 2$\times$10$^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ for the envelope and 45 k and 4$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ for theoutflow, in beams of 4" and 30", respectively. non-lte models indicate akinetic temperature of 60-230 k and a volume density of 7$\times$10$^6$-10$^8$cm$^{-3}$ for the envelope, and a kinetic temperature of 70-90 k and a gasdensity of 10$^7$-10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ for the outflow. the o/p ratio of theforeground absorption is 1.9$\pm$0.4, suggesting a low temperature. incontrast, the o/p ratio seen in absorption by the outflow is 3.5$\pm$1.0, asexpected for warm gas. the water abundance in the envelope is 10$^{-9}$,similar to the low values found for other high- and low-mass protostars,suggesting that this abundance is constant during the embedded phase ofhigh-mass star formation. the water abundance in the outflow is 10$^{-10}$,which is 10$\times$ lower than in the envelope and in the outflows of high- andlow-mass protostars. since beam size effects can only increase this estimate bya factor of 2, we suggest that the water in the outflow is affected bydissociating uv radiation due to the low extinction in the outflow lobe.

1502.03187	physical and chemical differentiation of the luminous star-forming  region w49a - results from the jcmt spectral legacy survey	the massive and luminous star-forming region w49a is a well known galacticcandidate to probe the physical conditions and chemistry similar to thoseexpected in external starburst galaxies. we aim to probe the physical andchemical structure of w49a on a spatial scale of ~0.8 pc based on the jcmtspectral legacy survey, which covers the frequency range between 330 and 373ghz. the wide 2x2 arcminutes field and the high spectral resolution of the harpinstrument on jcmt provides information on the spatial structure and kinematicsof the cloud. for species where multiple transitions are available, we estimateexcitation temperatures and column densities. we detected 255 transitionscorresponding to 60 species in the 330-373 ghz range at the center position ofw49a. excitation conditions can be probed for 16 molecules. the chemicalcomposition suggests the importance of shock-, pdr-, and hot core chemistry.many molecular lines show a significant spatial extent across the mapsincluding high density tracers (e.g. hcn, hnc, cs, hco+) and tracers ofuv-irradiation (e.g. cn and c2h). large variations are seen between thesub-regions with mostly blue-shifted emission toward the eastern tail, mostlyred-shifted emission toward the northern clump, and emission peaking around theexpected source velocity toward the south-west clump. a comparison of columndensity ratios of characteristic species observed toward w49a to galactic pdrssuggests that while the chemistry toward the w49a center is driven by acombination of uv-irradiation and shocks, uv-irradiation dominates for thenorthern clump, eastern tail, and south-west clump regions. a comparison to astarburst galaxy and an agn suggests similar c2h, cn, and h2co abundances (withrespect to the dense gas tracer 34cs) between the ~0.8 pc scale probed for w49aand the &gt;1 kpc regions in external galaxies with global star-formation.

1507.05808	infrared dark clouds on the far side of the galaxy	context: infrared dark clouds are the coldest and densest portions of giantmolecular clouds. the most massive ones represent some of the most likelybirthplaces for the next generation of massive stars in the milky way. becausea strong mid-ir background is needed to make them appear in absorption, theyare usually assumed to be nearby.  aims: we use thz absorption spectroscopy to solve the distance ambiguityassociated with kinematic distances for the ir-dark clouds in the top100atlasgal sample, a flux-limited selection of massive clumps in differentevolutionary phases of star formation.  methods: the para-h2o ground state transition at 1113.343 ghz, observed withherschel/hifi, was used to investigate the occurrence of foreground absorptionalong the line of sight directly towards infrared-dark clouds. additionalconsistency checks were performed using malt90 and higal archival data andtargeted mopra and apex spectroscopic observations.  results: we report the first discovery of five irdcs in the top100 lyingconclusively at the far kinematic distance, showing that the mere presence oflow-contrast mid-ir absorption is not sufficient to unequivocally resolve thenear/far ambiguity in favour of the former. all irdcs are massive and activelyforming high-mass stars; four of them also show infall signatures.  conclusions: we give a first estimate of the fraction of dark sources at thefar distance (~11% in the top100) and describe their appearance and properties.the assumption that all dark clouds lie at the near distance may lead, in somecases, to underestimating masses, sizes, and luminosities, possibly causingclouds to be missed that will form very massive stars and clusters.

0806.1195	evolution of massive protostars: the iras 18151-1208 region	the study of physical and chemical properties of massive protostars iscritical to better understand the evolutionary sequence which leads to theformation of high-mass stars. iras 18151-1208 is a nearby massive region (d =3kpc, l ~ 20000 lsun) which splits into three cores: mm1, mm2 and mm3(separated by 1'-2'). we aim at (1) studying the physical and chemicalproperties of the individual mm1, mm2 and mm3 cores; (2) deriving theirevolutionary stages; (3) using these results to improve our view of theevolutionary sequence of massive cores. the region was observed in the cs,c34s, h2co, hco+, h13co+, and n2h+ lines at mm wavelengths with the iram 30mand mopra telescopes. we use 1d and 2d modeling of the dust continuum to derivethe density and temperature distributions, which are then used in the ratrancode to model the lines and constrain the abundances of the observed species.all the lines were detected in mm1 and mm2. mm3 shows weaker emission, or evenis undetected in hco+ and all isotopic species. mm2 is driving a newlydiscovered co outflow and hosts a mid-ir-quiet massive protostar. the abundanceof cs is significantly larger in mm1 than in mm2, but smaller than in areference massive protostar such as afgl2591. in contrast the n2h+ abundancedecreases from mm2 to mm1, and is larger than in afgl2591. both mm1 and mm2host an early phase massive protostar, but mm2 (and mid-ir-quiet sources ingeneral) is younger and more dominated by the host protostar than mm1(mid-ir-bright). the mm3 core is probably in a pre-stellar phase. we find thatthe n2h+/c34s ratio varies systematically with age in the massive protostarsfor which the data are available. it can be used to identify young massiveprotostars.

1511.00357	linking low- to high-mass ysos with herschel-hifi observations of water	water probes the dynamics in young stellar objects (ysos) effectively,especially shocks in molecular outflows. it is a key molecule for exploringwhether the physical properties of low-mass protostars can be extrapolated tomassive ysos. as part of the wish key programme, we investigate the dynamicsand the excitation conditions of shocks along the outflow cavity wall asfunction of source luminosity. velocity-resolved herschel-hifi spectra of theh2o 988, 752, 1097 ghz and 12co j=10-9, 16-15 lines were analysed for 52 ysoswith bolometric luminosities (l_bol) ranging from &lt;1 to &gt;10^5 l_sun. theprofiles of the h2o lines are similar, indicating that they probe the same gas.we see two main gaussian emission components in all ysos: a broad componentassociated with non-dissociative shocks in the outflow cavity wall (cavityshocks) and a narrow component associated with quiescent envelope material.more than 60% of the total integrated intensity of the h2o lines (l_h2o) comesfrom the cavity shock component. the h2o line widths are similar for all ysos,whereas those of 12co 10-9 increase slightly with l_bol. the excitationanalysis of the cavity shock component, performed with the non-lte radiativetransfer code radex, shows stronger 752 ghz emission for high-mass ysos, likelydue to pumping by an infrared radiation field. as previously found for co, astrong correlation with slope unity is measured between log(l_h2o) andlog(l_bol), which can be extrapolated to extragalactic sources. we concludethat the broad component of h2o and high-j co lines originate in shocks in theoutflow cavity walls for all ysos, whereas lower-j co transitions mostly traceentrained outflow gas. the higher uv field and turbulent motions in high-massobjects compared to their low-mass counterparts may explain the slightlydifferent kinematical properties of 12co 10-9 and h2o lines from low- tohigh-mass ysos.

astro-ph;0105219	highly abundant hcn in the inner hot envelope of gl 2591: probing the  birth of a hot core?	we present observations of the v2=0 and vibrationally excited v2=1 j=9-8rotational lines of hcn at 797 ghz toward the deeply embedded massive youngstellar object gl 2591, which provide the missing link between the extendedenvelope traced by lower-j line emission and the small region of hot (t_ex &gt;=300 k), abundant hcn seen in 14 micron absorption with the infrared spaceobservatory (iso). the line ratio yields t_ex=720^+135_-100 k and the lineprofiles reveal that the hot gas seen with iso is at the velocity of theprotostar, arguing against a location in the outflow or in shocks. radiativetransfer calculations using a depth-dependent density and temperature structureshow that the data rule out a constant abundance throughout the envelope, butthat a model with a jump of the abundance in the inner part by two orders ofmagnitude matches the observations. such a jump is consistent with the sharpincrease in hcn abundance at temperatures &gt;~230 k predicted by recent chemicalmodels in which atomic oxygen is driven into water at these temperatures.together with the evidence for ice evaporation in this source, this resultsuggests that we may be witnessing the birth of a hot core. thus, gl 2591 mayrepresent a rare class of objects at an evolutionary stage just preceding the`hot core' stage of massive star formation.

astro-ph;0204448	triply deuterated ammonia in ngc 1333	the caltech submillimeter observatory has detected triply deuterated ammonia,nd3, through its 10a-00s transition near 310 ghz. emission is found in the ngc1333 region, both towards iras 4a and a position to the south-east where dco+peaks. in both cases, the hyperfine ratio indicates that the emission isoptically thin. column densities of nd3 are 3--6 x 10^11 cm^-2 for t_ex=10 kand twice as high for t_ex=5 k. using a monte carlo radiative transfer code anda model of the structure of the iras source with temperature and densitygradients, the estimated nd3 abundance is 3.2 x 10^-12 if nd3/h2 is constantthroughout the envelope. in the more likely case that nd3/h2d+ is constant,nd3/h2 peaks in the cold outer parts of the source at a value of 1.0 x 10^-11.to reproduce the observed nh3/nd3 abundance ratio of ~1000, grain surfacechemistry requires an atomic d/h ratio of ~0.15 in the gas phase, &gt;10 timeshigher than in recent chemical models. more likely, the deuteration of nh3occurs by ion-molecule reactions in the gas phase, in which case the dataindicate that deuteron transfer reactions are much faster than protontransfers.

astro-ph;0205292	chemistry as a probe of the structures and evolution of massive star  forming regions	we present detailed thermal and gas-phase chemical models for the envelope ofthe massive star-forming region afgl 2591. time- and space-dependent chemistryare used to study the physical structure proposed by van der tak et al. (1999;2000), and the chemical evolution of this region. the model is compared withobservations for 29 species covering a wide range of conditions within thesource. taking appropriate care when comparing models with both emission andabsorption measurements, we find that the majority of the chemical structurecan be well-explained. in particular, we find that the nitrogen and hydrocarbonchemistry can be significantly affected by temperature, with the possibility ofhigh-temperature pathways to hcn. while we cannot determine the sulphurreservoir, the observations can be explained by models with the majority of thesulphur in cs in the cold gas, so$_{2}$ in the warm gas, and atomic sulphur inthe warmest gas. the observed abundances of ions such as hco$^+$ and n$_2$h$^+$and the cold gas-phase production of hcn constrain the cosmic-ray ionizationrate to $\sim 5.6 \times 10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, to within a factor of three.finally, we find that the model and observations can simultaneously agree at areasonable level and often to within a factor of three for $7 \times 10^{3}\leq t(\mathrm{yrs}) \leq 5 \times 10^{4}$, with a strong preference for $t\sim 3 \times 10^{4}$ yrs since the collapse and formation of the centralluminosity source.

astro-ph;0212325	sulphur chemistry in the envelopes of massive young stars	we present submillimeter observations of so, so2, h2s, h2cs, ocs,  ns and hcs+ toward nine massive young stars. the outflow contributes ~50% tothe so and so2 emission in 15-20'' beams, more than for cs, where it is 10%.the so2 abundance increases from dark cloud levels in the outer envelope (t&lt;100k) to levels seen in hot cores and shocks in the inner envelope (t&gt;100 k).molecular abundances are consistent with a model of ice evaporation in anenvelope with gradients in temperature and density for a chemical age of ~30000yr. the high observed abundance of ocs, the fact that t_ex (ocs) &gt;&gt; t_ex (h2s),and the data on solid ocs and h2s all suggest that the major sulphur carrier ingrain mantles is ocs rather than h2s. for most other sulphur-bearing molecules,the source-to-source abundance variations by factors of up to 10 do notcorrelate with previously established evolutionary trends in temperaturetracers. these species probe the chemically inactive outer envelope. our dataset does not constrain the abundances of h2s and so in the inner envelope,which, together with so2, are required to use sulphur as a clock.

astro-ph;0309138	sulphur chemistry in the envelopes of massive young stars	the sulphur chemistry in nine regions in the earliest stages of high-massstar formation is studied through single-dish submillimeter spectroscopy. theline profiles indicate that 10-50% of the so and so2 emission arises inhigh-velocity gas, either infalling or outflowing. for the low-velocity gas,excitation temperatures are 25 k for h2s, 50 k for so, h2cs, ns and hcs+, and100 k for ocs and so2, indicating that most observed emission traces the outerparts (t&lt;100 k) of the molecular envelopes, except high-excitation ocs and so2lines. abundances in the outer envelopes, calculated with a monte carloprogram, using the physical structures of the sources derived from previoussubmillimeter continuum and cs line data, are ~10^-8 for ocs, ~10^-9 for h2s,h2cs, so and so2, and ~10^-10 for hcs+ and ns. in the inner envelopes (t&gt;100 k)of six sources, the so2 abundance is enhanced by factors of ~100-1000. thisregion of hot, abundant so2 has been seen before in infrared absorption, andmust be small, &lt;~ 0.2 arcsec (180 au radius). the derived abundance profilesare consistent with models of envelope chemistry which invoke ice evaporationat t~100$ k. shock chemistry is unlikely to contribute. a major sulphur carrierin the ices is probably ocs, not h2s as most models assume. thesource-to-source abundance variations of most molecules by factors of ~10 donot correlate with previous systematic tracers of envelope heating. withoutobservations of h2s and so lines probing warm (&gt;~ 100 k) gas, sulphur-bearingmolecules cannot be used as evolutionary tracers during star formation.

0809.0292	millimeter interferometry of w3 irs5: a trapezium in the making	although most young massive stars appear to be part of multiple systems, itis poorly understood how this multiplicity influences the formation of massivestars. the high-mass star-forming region w3 irs5 is a prime example of a youngmassive cluster where the cluster center is resolved into multiple subsourcesat cm and infrared wavelengths, a potential proto-trapezium system. the regionw3 irs5 was mapped with the pdbi at 1.4mm and 3.4mm in the ab configurations,observing shock-tracing sio and so_2 emission. in the continuum we detect fivesources, one of them for the first time, while counterparts were detected inthe nir, mir or at radio wavelengths for the remaining four sources. three ofthe detected sources are within the inner 2100au, where the protostellar numberdensity exceeds 10^6 protostars pc^-3 assuming spherical symmetry. lower limitsfor the circumstellar masses of the detected sources were calculated, althoughthey were strongly affected by the spatial filtering of the interferometer.however, the projected separations of the sources ranging between ~750 and~4700au indicate a multiple, trapezium-like system. we detected five molecularoutflows in sio, two of them nearly in the line of sight direction, whichallowed us to see the collapsing protostars in the nir through the cavitiescarved by the outflows. the so_2 velocity structure indicates a rotating, boundsystem, and we find tentative signatures of converging flows as predicted bythe gravoturbulent star formation and converging flow theories. the obtaineddata strongly indicate that the clustered environment has a major influence onthe formation of high-mass stars; however, our data do not clearly allow us todistinguish whether the ongoing star-forming process follows a monolithiccollapse or a competitive accretion mechanism.

astro-ph;0605454	the evolutionary state of the southern dense core cha-mms1	aims: our goal is to set constraints on the evolutionary state of the densecore cha-mms1 in the chamaeleon i molecular cloud. methods: we analyzemolecular line observations carried out with the new submillimeter telescopeapex. we look for outflow signatures around the dense core and probe itschemical structure, which we compare to predictions of models of gas-phasechemistry. we also use the public database of the spitzer space telescope (sst)to compare cha-mms1 with the two class 0 protostars iram 04191 and l1521f,which are at the same distance. results: we measure a large deuteriumfractionation for n2h+ (11 +/- 3 %), intermediate between the prestellar corel1544 and the very young class 0 protostar l1521f. it is larger than for hco+(2.5 +/- 0.9 %), which is probably the result of depletion removing hco+ fromthe high-density inner region. our co(3-2) map reveals the presence of abipolar outflow driven by the class i protostar ced 110 irs 4 but we do notfind evidence for an outflow powered by cha-mms1. we also report the detectionof cha-mms1 at 24, 70 and 160 microns by the instrument mips of the sst, at alevel nearly an order of magnitude lower than iram 04191 and l1521f.conclusions: cha-mms1 appears to have already formed a compact object, eitherthe first hydrostatic core at the very end of the prestellar phase, or anextremely young protostar that has not yet powered any outflow, at the verybeginning of the class 0 accretion phase.

astro-ph;0605582	apex mapping of h3o+ in the sgr b2 region	the cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta) of dense molecular clouds is a keyparameter for their dynamics and chemistry. variations of zeta are wellestablished, but it is unclear if these are related to source column density orto galactic location. using the apex telescope, we have mapped the 364 ghz lineof h3o+ in the sgr b2 region and observed the 307 ghz line at selectedpositions. with the iram 30-m telescope we have observed the 203 ghz line ofh2o-18 at the same positions. strong h3o+ emission is detected over a ~3x2 pcregion, indicating h3o+ column densities of 10^15 - 10^16 cm^-2 in an 18" beam.the h3o+ abundance of ~3 x 10^-9 and h3o+/h2o ratio of ~1/50 in the sgr b2envelope are consistent with models with zeta ~4 x 10^-16 s^-1, 3x lower thanderived from h3+ observations toward sgr a, but 10x that of local dense clouds.the ionization rates of interstellar clouds thus seem to be to first orderdetermined by the ambient cosmic-ray flux, while propagation effects cause afactor of ~3 decrease from diffuse to dense clouds.

astro-ph;0608393	tracing high energy radiation with molecular lines near deeply embedded  protostars	submillimeter lines of cn, no, co+ and so+, and upper limits on sh+ and n2oare observed with the james clerk maxwell telescope in two high-mass and up tonine low-mass young stellar objects and compared with chemical models. constantfractional abundances derived from radiative transfer modeling of the linestrengths are x(cn) ~ a few x 10^{-11}-10^{-8}, x(no) ~ 10^{-9}-10^{-8} andx(co+) ~ 10^{-12}-10^{-10}. so+ has abundances of a few x 10^{-11} in thehigh-mass objects and upper limits of ~ 10^{-12}-10^{-11} in the low-masssources. all abundances are up to 1-2 orders of magnitude higher if themolecular emission is assumed to originate mainly from the inner region (&lt; 1000au) of the envelope. for high-mass sources, the cn, so+ and co+ abundances andabundance ratios are best explained by an enhanced far-ultraviolet (fuv) fieldimpacting gas at temperatures of a few hundred k. the observed column densitiesrequire that this region of enhanced fuv has scales comparable to the observingbeam, such as in a geometry in which the enhanced fuv irradiates outflow walls.for low-mass sources, the required temperatures within the fuv models of t &gt;300 k are much higher than found in models, so that an x-ray enhanced regionclose to the protostar (r &lt; 500 au) is more plausible. the observed abundancesimply x-ray fluxes for the class 0 objects of l_x ~ 10^{29}-10^{31} erg s^{-1},comparable to those observed from low-mass class i protostars. spatiallyresolved data are needed to clearly distinguish the effects of fuv and x-raysfor individual species.

astro-ph;0611907	the jcmt spectral legacy survey	stars form in the densest, coldest, most quiescent regions of molecularclouds. molecules provide the only probes which can reveal the dynamics,physics, chemistry and evolution of these regions, but our understanding of themolecular inventory of sources and how this is related to their physical stateand evolution is rudimentary and incomplete. the spectral legacy survey (sls)is one of seven surveys recently approved by the jcmt board. starting in 2007,the sls will produce a spectral imaging survey of the content and distributionof all the molecules detected in the 345 ghz atmospheric window (between 332ghz and 373 ghz) towards a sample of 5 sources. our intended targets are: a lowmass core (ngc1333 iras4), 3 high mass cores spanning a range of star formingenvironments and evolutionary states (w49, afgl2591, and iras20126), and a pdr(the orion bar). the sls will use the unique spectral imaging capabilities ofharp-b/acsis to study the molecular inventory and the physical structure ofthese objects, which span different evolutionary stages and physicalenvironments, to probe their evolution during the star formation process. asits name suggests, the sls will provide a lasting data legacy from the jcmtthat is intended to benefit the entire astronomical community. as such, theentire data set (including calibrated spectral datacubes, maps of molecularemission, line identifications, and calculations of the gas temperature andcolumn density) will be publicly available.
