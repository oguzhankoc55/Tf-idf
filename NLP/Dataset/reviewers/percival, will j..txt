0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

1001.2015	the evolution of luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey  7th data release	we present a comprehensive study of the evolution of luminous red galaxies(lrgs) in the latest and final spectroscopic data release of the sloan digitalsky survey. we test the scenario of passive evolution of lrgs in 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5, bylooking at the evolution of the number and luminosity density of lrgs, as wellas of their clustering. a new weighting scheme is introduced that allows us tokeep a large number of galaxies in our sample and put stringent constraints onthe growth and merging allowed by the data as a function of galaxy luminosity.introducing additional luminosity-dependent weighting for our clusteringanalysis allows us to additionally constrain the nature of the mergers. we findthat, in the redshift range probed, the population of lrgs grows in luminosityby 1.5-6 % gyr^-1 depending on their luminosity. this growth is predominantlyhappening in objects that reside in the lowest-mass haloes probed by thisstudy, and cannot be explained by satellite accretion into massive lrgs, nor bylrg-lrg merging. we find that the evolution of the brightest objects (with ak+e-corrected m_r,0.1 &lt; -22.8) is consistent with that expected from passiveevolution.

1002.1476	evolution of the clustering of photometrically selected sdss galaxies	we measure the angular auto-correlation functions (w) of sdss galaxiesselected to have photometric redshifts 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4 and absolute r-bandmagnitudes mr &lt; -21.2. we split these galaxies into five overlapping redshiftshells of width 0.1 and measure w in each subsample in order to investigate theevolution of sdss galaxies. we find that the bias increases substantially withredshift - much more so than one would expect for a passively evolving sample.we use halo-model analysis to determine the best-fithalo-occupation-distribution (hod) for each subsample, and the best-fit modelsallow us to interpret the change in bias physically. in order to properlyinterpret our best-fit hods, we convert each halo mass to its z = 0 passivelyevolved bias (bo), enabling a direct comparison of the best-fit hods atdifferent redshifts. we find that the minimum halo bo required to host a galaxydecreases as the redshift decreases, suggesting that galaxies with mr &lt; -21.2are forming in halos at the low-mass end of the hods over our redshift range.we use the best-fit hods to determine the change in occupation number dividedby the change in mass of halos with constant bo and we find a sharp peak at bo~ 0.9 - corresponding to an average halo mass of ~ 10^12msol/h. we thus presentthe following scenario: the bias of galaxies with mr &lt; -21.2 decreases as theuniverse evolves because these galaxies form in halos of mass ~ 10^12msol/h(independent of redshift), and the bias of these halos naturally decreases asthe universe evolves.

1003.0896	the effect of redshift-space distortions on projected 2-pt clustering  measurements	although redshift-space distortions only affect inferred distances and notangles, they still distort the projected angular clustering of galaxy samplesselected using redshift dependent quantities. from an eulerian view-point, thiseffect is caused by the apparent movement of galaxies into or out of thesample. from a lagrangian view-point, we find that projecting theredshift-space overdensity field over a finite radial distance does not removeall the anisotropic distortions. we investigate this effect, showing that itstrongly boosts the amplitude of clustering for narrow samples and can alsoreduce the significance of baryonic features in the correlation function. weargue that the effect can be mitigated by binning in apparent galaxypair-centre rather than galaxy position, and applying an upper limit to theradial galaxy separation. we demonstrate this approach, contrasting againststandard top-hat binning in galaxy distance, using sub-samples taken from thehubble volume simulations. using a simple model for the radial distributionexpected for galaxies from a survey such as the dark energy survey (des), weshow that this binning scheme will simplify analyses that will measure baryonacoustic oscillations within such galaxy samples. comparing results fromdifferent binning schemes has the potential to provide measurements of theamplitude of the redshift-space distortions. our analysis is relevant for otherphotometric redshift surveys, including those made by the panoramic surveytelescope &amp; rapid response system (pan-starrs) and the large synoptic surveytelescope (lsst).

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

1006.0609	effects of cosmological model assumptions on galaxy redshift survey  measurements	the clustering of galaxies observed in future redshift surveys will provide awealth of cosmological information. matching the signal at different redshiftsconstrains the dark energy driving the acceleration of the expansion of theuniverse. in tandem with these geometrical constraints, redshift-spacedistortions (rsd) depend on the build up of large-scale structure. as pointedout by many authors measurements of these effects are intrinsically coupled. weinvestigate this link, and argue that it strongly depends on the cosmologicalassumptions adopted when analysing data. using representative assumptions forthe parameters of the euclid survey in order to provide a baseline futureexperiment, we show how the derived constraints change due to different modelassumptions. we argue that even the assumption of a friedman-robertson-walker(frw) space-time is sufficient to reduce the importance of the coupling to asignificant degree. taking this idea further, we consider how the data wouldactually be analysed and argue that we should not expect to be able tosimultaneously constrain multiple deviations from the standard $\lambda$cdmmodel. we therefore consider different possible ways in which the universecould deviate from the $\lambda$cdm model, and show how the coupling betweengeometrical constraints and structure growth affects the measurement of suchdeviations.

1006.1652	simulating redshift-space distortions for galaxy pairs with wide angular  separation	the analysis of redshift-space distortions (rsd) within galaxy surveysprovides constraints on the amplitude of peculiar velocities induced bystructure growth, thereby allowing tests of general relativity on extremelylarge scales. the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys, such as thebaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), and the euclid experiment willsurvey galaxies out to z=2, over 10,000--20,000 sq deg. in such surveys, galaxypairs with large comoving separation will preferentially have a wide angularseparation. in standard plane-parallel theory the displacements of galaxypositions due to rsd are assumed to be parallel for all galaxies, but thisassumption will break down for wide-angle pairs. szapudi 2004 and papai &amp;szapudi 2008 provided a methodology, based on tripolar spherical harmonicsexpansion, for computing the redshift-space correlation function for allangular galaxy pair separations. in this paper we introduce a new procedure foranalysing wide-angle effects in numerical simulations. we are able to separate,demonstrate, and fit each of the effects described by the wide-angle rsdtheory. our analysis highlights some of the nuances of dealing with wide-anglepairs, and shows that the effects are not negligible even for relatively smallangles. this analysis will help to ensure the full exploitation of futuresurveys for rsd measurements, which are currently confined to pair separationsless than \sim80 mpc/h out to z\simeq 0.5.

1006.2825	neutrino masses from clustering of red and blue galaxies: a test of  astrophysical uncertainties	combining measurements of the galaxy power spectrum and the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) is a powerful means of constraining the summed mass ofneutrino species sum(m_nu), but is subject to systematic uncertainties due tonon-linear structure formation, redshift-space distortions and galaxy bias. weempirically test the robustness of neutrino mass results to these effects byseparately analyzing power spectra of red and blue galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss-ii) data release 7 (dr7), combined with the cmbfive-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap5) data. we considerfitting for a range of maximum wavenumber k using twelve different galaxy biasmodels. for example, using a new model based on perturbation theory andincluding redshift space distortions (saito et al. 2009), the all-galaxy powerspectrum combined with wmap5 for a wavenumber range of k&lt;0.2 mpc/h yields 95%cl sum(m_nu)&lt;0.46 ev. the red and blue galaxy power spectra give 0.41 and 0.63ev respectively for this model. using mock catalogues, we find the expecteddifference in these limits assuming a true neutrino mass of zero is 0.10 + or -0.14 ev. thus the difference of 0.22 ev between upper limits on neutrino massfor red and blue galaxies is approximately 1 sigma from the expected value. wefind similar results for the other models and k ranges tested. this indicatesgood agreement for current data but hints at possible issues fornext-generation surveys. being able to perform such systematic tests isadvantageous, and future surveys would benefit by including broad galaxypopulations and luminosities that enable such a decomposition.

1010.1403	understanding the faint red galaxy population using large-scale  clustering measurements from sdss dr7	we use data from the sdss to investigate the evolution of the large-scalegalaxy bias as a function of luminosity for red galaxies. we carefully considercorrelation functions of galaxies selected from both photometric andspectroscopic data, and cross-correlations between them, to obtain multiplemeasurements of the large-scale bias. we find, for our most robust analyses, astrong increase in bias with luminosity for the most luminous galaxies, anintermediate regime where bias does not evolve strongly over a range of twomagnitudes in galaxy luminosity, and no evidence for an upturn in bias forfainter red galaxies. previous work has found an increase in bias to lowluminosities that has been widely interpreted as being caused by a strongpreference for red dwarf galaxies to be satellites in the most massive halos.we can recover such an upturn in bias to faint luminosities if we push ourmeasurements to small scales, and include galaxy clustering measurements alongthe line-of-sight, where we expect non-linear effects to be the strongest. theresults that we expect to be most robust suggest that the low luminositypopulation of red galaxies is not dominated by satellite galaxies occupying themost massive haloes.

1011.2346	the stellar evolution of luminous red galaxies, and its dependence on  colour, redshift, luminosity and modelling	we present a series of colour evolution models for luminous red galaxies(lrgs) in the 7th spectroscopic data release of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), computed using the full-spectrum fitting code vespa on highsignal-to-noise stacked spectra. the colour-evolution models are computed as afunction of colour, luminosity and redshift, and we do not a-priori assume thatlrgs constitute a uniform population of galaxies in terms of stellar evolution.by computing star-formation histories from the fossil record, the measuredstellar evolution of the galaxies is decoupled from the survey's selectionfunction, which also evolves with redshift. we present these evolutionarymodels computed using three different sets of stellar population synthesis(sps) codes. we show that the traditional fiducial model of purely passivestellar evolution of lrgs is broadly correct, but it is not sufficient toexplain the full spectral signature. we also find that higher-order correctionsto this model are dependent on the sps used, particularly when calculating theamount of recent star formation. the amount of young stars can benon-negligible in some cases, and has important implications for theinterpretation of the number density of lrgs within the selection box as afunction of redshift. dust extinction, however, is more robust to the spsmodelling: extinction increases with decreasing luminosity, increasingredshift, and increasing r-i colour. we are making the colour evolution trackspublicly available at http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/~tojeiror/lrg_evolution/.

1102.1014	interpreting large-scale redshift-space distortion measurements	the simplest theory describing large-scale redshift-space distortions (rsd),based on linear theory and distant galaxies, depends on the growth ofcosmological structure, suggesting that strong tests of general relativity canbe constructed from galaxy surveys. as data sets become larger and the expectedconstraints more precise, the extent to which the rsd follow the simple theoryneeds to be assessed in order that we do not introduce systematic errors intothe tests by introducing inaccurate simplifying assumptions. we study theimpact of the sample geometry, non-linear processes, and biases induced by ourlack of understanding of the radial galaxy distribution on rsd measurements.using lasdamas simulations of the sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss-ii)luminous red galaxy (lrg) data, these effects are shown to be important at thelevel of 20 per cent. including them, we can accurately model the recoveredclustering in these mock catalogues on scales 30 -- 200 mpc/h. applying thisanalysis to robustly measure parameters describing the growth history of theuniverse from the sdss-ii data, gives$f(z=0.25)\sigma_8(z=0.25)=0.3512\pm0.0583$ and$f(z=0.37)\sigma_8(z=0.37)=0.4602\pm0.0378$ when no prior is imposed on thegrowth-rate, and the background geometry is assumed to follow a $\lambda$cdmmodel with the wmap + snia priors. the standard wmap constrained $\lambda$cdmmodel with general relativity predicts$f(z=0.25)\sigma_8(z=0.25)=0.4260\pm0.0141$ and$f(z=0.37)\sigma_8(z=0.37)=0.4367\pm0.0136$, which is fully consistent withthese measurements.

1103.2700	disentangling star formation and merger growth in the evolution of  luminous red galaxies	we introduce a novel technique for empirically understanding galaxyevolution. we use empirically determined stellar evolution models to predictthe past evolution of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-ii) luminous redgalaxy (lrg) sample without any a-priori assumption about galaxy evolution. bycarefully contrasting the evolution of the predicted and observed number andluminosity densities we test the passive evolution scenario for galaxies ofdifferent luminosity, and determine minimum merger rates. we find that the lrgpopulation is not purely coeval, with some of galaxies targeted at z&lt;0.23 andat z&gt;0.34 showing different dynamical growth than galaxies targeted throughoutthe sample. our results show that the lrg population is dynamically growing,and that this growth must be dominated by the faint end. for the most luminousgalaxies, we find lower minimum merger rates than required by previous studiesthat assume passive stellar evolution, suggesting that some of the dynamicalevolution measured previously was actually due to galaxies with non-passivestellar evolution being incorrectly modelled. our methodology can be used toidentify and match coeval populations of galaxies across cosmic times, over oneor more surveys.

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1109.1981	the complementarity of redshift-space distortions and the integrated  sachs-wolfe effect: a 3d spherical analysis	assuming general relativity is correct on large-scales, redshift-spacedistortions (rsds) and the integrated sachs-wolfe effect (isw) are bothsensitive to the time derivative of the linear growth function. we investigatethe extent to which these probes provide complementary or redundant informationwhen they are combined to constrain the evolution of the linear velocity powerspectrum, often quantified by the function $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, where $f$ is thelogarithmic derivative of $\sigma_8$ with respect to $(1+z)$. using a sphericalfourier-bessel (sfb) expansion for galaxy number counts and a sphericalharmonic expansion for the cmb anisotropy, we compute the covariance matricesof the signals for a large galaxy redshift survey combined with a cmb surveylike planck. the sfb basis allows accurate isw estimates by avoiding theplane-parallel approximation, and it retains rsd information that is otherwiselost when projecting angular clustering onto redshift shells. it also allowsstraightforward calculations of covariance with the cmb. we find that thecorrelation between the isw and rsd signals are low since the probes aresensitive to different modes. for our default surveys, on large scales ($k&lt;0.05\mpc/h$), the isw can improve constraints on $f\sigma_8$ by more than 10%compared to using rsds alone. in the future, when precision rsd measurementsare available on smaller scales, the cosmological constraints from iswmeasurements will not be competitive; however, they will remain a usefulconsistency test for possible systematic contamination and alternative modelsof gravity.

1201.2172	acoustic scale from the angular power spectra of sdss-iii dr8  photometric luminous galaxies	we measure the acoustic scale from the angular power spectra of the sloandigital sky survey iii (sdss-iii) data release 8 imaging catalog that includes872,921 galaxies over ~ 10,000 deg^2 between 0.45&lt;z&lt;0.65. the extensivespectroscopic training set of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey(boss) luminous galaxies allows precise estimates of the true redshiftdistributions of galaxies in our imaging catalog. utilizing the redshiftdistribution information, we build templates and fit to the power spectra ofthe data, which are measured in our companion paper, ho et al. 2011, to derivethe location of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) while marginalizing overmany free parameters to exclude nearly all of the non-bao signal. we derive theratio of the angular diameter distance to the sound horizon scale d_a/r_s=9.212 + 0.416 -0.404 at z=0.54, and therefore, d_a= 1411+- 65 mpc at z=0.54;the result is fairly independent of assumptions on the underlying cosmology.our measurement of angular diameter distance d_a is 1.4 \sigma higher than whatis expected for the concordance lcdm (komatsu et al. 2011), in accordance tothe trend of other spectroscopic bao measurements for z &gt;~ 0.35. we reportconstraints on cosmological parameters from our measurement in combination withthe wmap7 data and the previous spectroscopic bao measurements of sdss(percival et al. 2010) and wigglez (blake et al. 2011). we refer to ourcompanion papers (ho et al. 2011; de putter et al. 2011) for investigations oninformation of the full power spectrum.

1202.6057	the clustering of galaxies at z~0.5 in the sdss-iii data release 9  boss-cmass sample: a test for the lcdm cosmology	we present results on the clustering of 282,068 galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) sample of massive galaxies withredshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii project.our results cover a large range of scales from ~0.5 to ~90 mpc/h. we comparethese estimates with the expectations of the flat lcdm cosmological model withparameters compatible with wmap7 data. we use the multidark cosmologicalsimulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, toestimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloesand galaxy biases. we find that the lcdm model gives a reasonable descriptionto the observed correlation functions at z~0.5, which is a remarkably goodagreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance ofboss galaxies, does not have any free parameters. however, we find a deviation(&gt;~10%) in the correlation functions for scales less than ~1 mpc/h and ~10-40mpc/h. a more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics fromupcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. we also estimatethat about 12% of the "galaxies" in the abundance-matched sample are satellitesinhabiting central haloes with mass m&gt;~1e14 m_sun/h. using the multidarksimulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched cataloguefinding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtainedusing the measured boss projected correlation function. furthermore, the linearlarge-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matchedsample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/mpc)^3). extrapolating these resultsto bao scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signalproduced by non-linear evolution that leads to ~2-4% dips at ~3 sigma level forwavenumbers k&gt;~0.1 h/mpc in the linear large-scale bias.

1203.6499	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: analysis of potential systematics	we analyze the density field of galaxies observed by the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) included inthe sdss data release nine (dr9). dr9 includes spectroscopic redshifts for over400,000 galaxies spread over a footprint of 3,275 deg^2. we identify,characterize, and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty onlarge-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of theredshift-space correlation function and the spherically averaged powerspectrum, p(k), in order to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will beobtained from these data. a correlation between the projected density of starsand the higher redshift (0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) galaxy sample (the `cmass' sample) dueto imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than thestatistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s &gt; 120h^-1mpc or k&lt; 0.01hmpc^-1. we find that these errors can be ameliorated by weightinggalaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar density. weuse mock galaxy catalogs that simulate the cmass selection function todetermine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in order to simulate theradial selection function of a random sample imparts the least systematic erroron correlation function measurements and that this systematic error isnegligible for the spherically averaged correlation function. the methods werecommend for the calculation of clustering measurements using the cmass sampleare adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon acousticoscillation feature (anderson et al. 2012), constrain cosmological models usingthe full shape of the correlation function (sanchez et al. 2012), and measurethe rate of structure growth (reid et al. 2012).

1203.6609	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: a large sample of mock galaxy catalogues	we present a fast method of producing mock galaxy catalogues that can be usedto compute covariance matrices of large-scale clustering measurements and testthe methods of analysis. our method populates a 2nd-order lagrangianperturbation theory (2lpt) matter field, where we calibrate masses of darkmatter halos by detailed comparisons with n-body simulations. we demonstratethe clustering of halos is recovered at ~10 per cent accuracy. we populatehalos with mock galaxies using a halo occupation distribution (hod)prescription, which has been calibrated to reproduce the clusteringmeasurements on scales between 30 and 80 mpc/h. we compare the samplecovariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discussdifferences. we have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to datarelease 9 of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss),producing 600mock catalogues of the "cmass" galaxy sample. these mocks enabled detailedtests of methods and errors that formed an integral part of companion analysesof these galaxy data.

1203.6641	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: measurements of the growth of structure and expansion  rate at z=0.57 from anisotropic clustering	we analyze the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) datarelease 9 (dr9) sample, which consists of 264,283 galaxies in the redshiftrange 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 spanning 3,275 square degrees. both peculiar velocitiesand errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ("alcock-paczynskieffect") generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientationwith respect to the line-of-sight. together with the sharp baryon acousticoscillation (bao) standard ruler, our measurements of the broadband shape ofthe monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain thecomoving angular diameter distance (2190 +/- 61 mpc) to z=0.57, the hubbleexpansion rate at z=0.57 (92.4 +/- 4.5 km/s/mpc), and the growth rate ofstructure at that same redshift (d sigma8/d ln a = 0.43 +/- 0.069). ouranalysis provides the best current direct determination of both da and h ingalaxy clustering data using this technique. if we further assume a lcdmexpansion history, our growth constraint tightens to d sigma8/d ln a = 0.415+/- 0.034. in combination with the cosmic microwave background, ourmeasurements of da, h, and growth all separately require dark energy at z &gt;0.57, and when combined imply \omega_{\lambda} = 0.74 +/- 0.016, independent ofthe universe's evolution at z&lt;0.57. in our companion paper (samushia et al.prep), we explore further cosmological implications of these observations.

1205.6215	probing deviations from general relativity with the euclid spectroscopic  survey	we discuss the ability of the planned euclid mission to detect deviationsfrom general relativity using its extensive redshift survey of more than 50million galaxies. constraints on the gravity theory are placed measuring thegrowth rate of structure within 14 redshift bins between z=0.7 and z=2. thegrowth rate is measured from redshift-space distortions, i.e. the anisotropy ofthe clustering pattern induced by coherent peculiar motions. this is performedin the overall context of the euclid spectroscopic survey, which willsimultaneously measure the expansion history of the universe, using the powerspectrum and its baryonic features as a standard ruler, accounting for therelative degeneracies of expansion and growth parameters. the resultingexpected errors on the growth rate in the different redshift bins, expressedthrough the quantity f\sigma_8, range between 1.3% and 4.4%. we discuss theoptimisation of the survey configuration and investigate the importantdependence on the growth parameterisation and the assumed cosmological model.we show how a specific parameterisation could actually drive the design towardsartificially restricted regions of the parameter space. finally, in theframework of the popular "\gamma -parameterisation", we show that the euclidspectroscopic survey alone will already be able to provide substantial evidence(in bayesian terms) if the growth index differs from the gr value \gamma=0.55by at least \sim 0.13. this will combine with the comparable inference powerprovided by the euclid weak lensing survey, resulting in euclid's uniqueability to provide a decisive test of modified gravity.

1207.0500	testing gravity using large-scale redshift-space distortions	we use luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ii to test thecosmological structure growth in two alternatives to the standard lcdm+grcosmological model. we compare observed three-dimensional clustering in sdssdr7 with theoretical predictions for the standard vanilla lcdm+gr model,unified dark matter cosmologies and the normal branch dgp. in computing theexpected correlations in udm cosmologies, we derive a parameterized formula forthe growth factor in these models. for our analysis we apply the methodologytested in raccanelli et al. 2010 and use the measurements of samushia et al.2011, that account for survey geometry, non-linear and wide-angle effects andthe distribution of pair orientation. we show that the estimate of the growthrate is potentially degenerate with wide-angle effects, meaning that extremelyaccurate measurements of the growth rate on large scales will need to take sucheffects into account. we use measurements of the zeroth and second ordermoments of the correlation function from sdss dr7 data and the large suite ofdark matter simulations, and perform a likelihood analysis to constrain theparameters of the models. using information on the clustering up to r_max = 120mpc/h, and after marginalizing over the bias, we find, for udm models, a speedof sound &lt; 6.1e-4, and, for the ndgp model, a cross-over scale r_c &gt; 340 mpc,at 95% confidence level.

1207.7326	spectral classification and redshift measurement for the sdss-iii baryon  oscillation spectroscopic survey	(abridged) we describe the automated spectral classification, redshiftdetermination, and parameter measurement pipeline in use for the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii) as of data release 9, encompassing 831,000 moderate-resolutionoptical spectra. we give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe thechanges to the pipeline that have been implemented for boss relative toprevious sdss-i/ii versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasarredshift templates. for the color-selected cmass sample of massive galaxies atredshift 0.4 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 0.8 targeted by boss for the purposes of large-scalecosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classificationsuccess rate of 98.7% and confirms 95.4% of unique cmass targets as galaxies(with the balance being mostly m stars). based on visual inspections of asubset of boss galaxies, we find that ~0.2% of confidently reported cmasssample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and ~0.4% of all cmassspectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentiallyrecoverable. the boss pipeline confirms that ~51.5% of the quasar targets havequasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars. statistical (asopposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise aretypically a few tens of km/s for both galaxies and quasars, with a significanttail to a few hundreds of km/s for quasars. we test the accuracy of thesestatistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding themunderestimated by a factor of 1.19 to 1.34 for galaxies, and by a factor of 2for quasars. we assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, s/n, and otherfactors on galaxy redshift success. finally, we document known issues, anddescribe directions of ongoing development.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1303.3551	the different star-formation histories of blue and red spiral and  elliptical galaxies	[abridged] we study the spectral properties of intermediate mass galaxies asa function of colour and morphology. we use galaxy zoo to define threemorphological classes of galaxies, namely early-types (ellipticals), late-type(disk-dominated) face-on spirals and early-type (bulge-dominated) face-onspirals. we classify these galaxies as blue or red according to their sdss g-rcolour and use the spectral fitting code vespa to calculate time-resolvedstar-formation histories, metallicity and total starlight dust extinction fromtheir sdss fibre spectra. we find that red late-type spirals show lessstar-formation in the last 500 myr than blue late-type spirals by up to afactor of three, but share similar star-formation histories at earlier times.this decline in recent star-formation explains their redder colour: theirchemical and dust content are the same. we postulate that red late-type spiralsare recent descendants of blue late-type spirals, with their star-formationcurtailed in the last 500 myrs. the red late-type spirals are however stillforming stars approximately 17 times faster than red ellipticals over the sameperiod. red early-type spirals lie between red late-type spirals and redellipticals in terms of recent-to-intermediate star-formation and dust content.therefore, it is plausible that these galaxies represent an evolutionary linkbetween these two populations. they are more likely to evolve directly into redellipticals than red late-type spirals. blue ellipticals show similarstar-formation histories as blue spirals (regardless of type), except they haveformed less stars in the last 100 myrs. however, blue ellipticals havedifferent dust content, which peaks at lower extinction values than all spiralgalaxies.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1310.1106	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii dr10 baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: no detectable colour dependence of distance scale or  growth rate measurements	we study the clustering of galaxies, as a function of their colour, from datarelease ten (dr10) of the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. weselect 122,967 galaxies with 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 into a "blue" sample and 131,969into a "red" sample based on k+e corrected (to z=0.55) r-i colours and i bandmagnitudes. the samples are chosen to each contain more than 100,000 galaxies,have similar redshift distributions, and maximize the difference in clusteringamplitude. the red sample has a 40% larger bias than the blue (b_red/b_blue =1.39+-0.04), implying the red galaxies occupy dark matter halos with an averagemass that is 0.5 log mo greater. spherically averaged measurements of thecorrelation function, \xi 0, and the power spectrum are used to locate theposition of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature of both samples.using \xi 0, we obtain distance scales, relative to our reference lcdmcosmology, of 1.010+-0.027 for the red sample and 1.005+-0.031 for the blue.after applying reconstruction, these measurements improve to 1.013+/-0.020 forthe red sample and 1.008+-0.026 for the blue. for each sample, measurements of\xi 0 and the second multipole moment, \xi 2, of the anisotropic correlationfunction are used to determine the rate of structure growth, parameterized byf\sigma 8. we find f\sigma 8,red = 0.511+-0.083, f\sigma 8,blue =0.509+/-0.085, and f\sigma 8,cross = 0.423+-0.061 (from the cross-correlationbetween the red and blue samples). we use the covariance between the bias andgrowth measurements obtained from each sample and their cross-correlation toproduce an optimally-combined measurement of f\sigma 8,comb = 0.443+-0.055. inno instance do we detect significant differences in distance scale or structuregrowth measurements obtained from the blue and red samples.

1312.4611	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: testing gravity with redshift-space distortions using  the power spectrum multipoles	we analyse the anisotropic clustering of the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) cmass data release 11 (dr11) sample, which consists of $690\,827$galaxies in the redshift range $0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ and has a sky coverage of$8\,498\,\text{deg}^2$. we perform our analysis in fourier space using a powerspectrum estimator suggested by yamamoto et al. (2006). we measure themultipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in thesense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and theintegral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic powerspectrum and without the need to split the survey into sub-regions. the maincosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acousticoscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which aredistorted by the alcock-paczynski effect. together, these signals allow us toconstrain the distance ratio $d_v(z_{\rm eff})/r_s(z_d) = 13.89\pm 0.18$, thealcock-paczynski parameter $f_{\rm ap}(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.679\pm0.031$ and thegrowth rate of structure $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.419\pm0.044$at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. we did not find significantsystematic uncertainties for $d_v/r_s$ or $f_{\rm ap}$ but include a systematicerror for $f\sigma_8$ of $3.1\%$. combining our dataset with planck to testgeneral relativity (gr) through the simple $\gamma$-parameterisation, reveals a$\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the data and the prediction by gr. the tensionbetween our result and gr can be traced back to a tension in the clusteringamplitude $\sigma_8$ between cmass and planck.

1312.4841	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: including covariance matrix errors	we present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in theerror budget of baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) galaxyclustering measurements, revisiting data release 9 (dr9) analyses, anddescribing a method that is used in dr10/11 analyses presented in companionpapers. the precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important,due to the precision that boss can now reach: even using as many as 600 mockcatalogues to estimate covariance of 2-point clustering measurements can stilllead to an increase in the errors of ~20%, depending on how the cosmologicalparameters of interest are measured. in this paper we extend previous work onthis contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured byintegrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitparameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix.both are situations that previous analyses of boss have considered. we applythe formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) and redshift-spacedistortion (rsd) measurements from boss in our companion papers. to further aidthese analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for 2-pointmeasurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for bao,and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function foranisotropic-bao and rsd measurements.

1312.4854	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: cosmological implications of the full shape of the  clustering wedges in the data release 10 and 11 galaxy samples	we explore the cosmological implications of the angle-averaged correlationfunction, xi(s), and the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s) and xi_para(s), of thelowz and cmass galaxy samples from data release 10 and 11 of the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. our results show no significantevidence for a deviation from the standard lcdm model. the combination of theinformation from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmicmicrowave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the universeto omega_k = 0.0010 +- 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to sum m_nu &lt; 0.23 ev(95% confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species ton_eff=3.31 +- 0.27, and the dark energy equation of state to w_de = -1.051 +-0.076. these limits are further improved by adding information from type iasupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. in particular,this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent darkenergy equation of state, in which case we find w_de=-1.024 +- 0.052. weexplore the constraints on the growth-rate of cosmic structures assumingf(z)=omega_m(z)^gamma and obtain gamma=0.69 +- 0.15, in agreement with thepredictions from general relativity of gamma=0.55.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1312.4899	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey (boss): measuring growth rate and geometry with  anisotropic clustering	we use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 11 cmass sample to measurethe linear growth rate of structure, the hubble expansion rate and the comovingdistance scale. our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses an effectivevolume of 6.0 ${\rm gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. wefind $f\sigma_8 = 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $h = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}$ and $d_{\rm a} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm mpc}$when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. when we fix thebackground expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\lambda$cdm modelin agreement with recent planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$(6 per cent accuracy). while our measurements are generally consistent with thepredictions of $\lambda$cdm and general relativity, they mildly favor models inwhich the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what ispredicted by general relativity. combining our measurements with recent cosmicmicrowave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmologicalparameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. separatelyvarying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent accuracy)and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equationof state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. bothconstraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of $w=-1$ and$\gamma = 0.554$.

1312.4996	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: analysis of potential  systematics in fitting of baryon acoustic feature	extraction of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) to percent levelaccuracy is challenging and demands an understanding of many potentialsystematic to an accuracy well below 1 per cent, in order ensure that they donot combine significantly when compared to statistical error of the baomeasurement. sloan digital sky survey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) sdss data release eleven (dr11) reaches a distancemeasurement with $\sim 1\%$ statistical error and this prompts an extensivesearch for all possible sub-percent level systematic errors which could besafely ignored previously. in this paper, we analyze the potential systematicsin bao fitting methodology using mocks and data from boss dr10 and dr11. wedemonstrate the robustness of the fiducial multipole fitting methodology to beat $0.1\%-0.2\%$ level with a wide range of tests in mock galaxy catalogs pre-and post-reconstruction. we also find the dr10 and dr11 data from boss to berobust against changes in methodology at similar level. this systematic errorbudget is incorporated into the the error budget of baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) dr10 and dr11 bao measurements. of the wide rangeof changes we have investigated, we find that when fitting pre-reconstructeddata or mocks, the following changes have the largest effect on the best fitvalues of distance measurements both parallel and perpendicular to the line ofsight: (a) changes in non-linear correlation function template; (b) changes infitting range of the correlation function; (c) changes to the non-lineardamping model parameters. the priors applied do not matter in the estimates ofthe fitted errors as long as we restrict ourselves to physically meaningfulfitting regions.[abridged]

1312.5154	using correlations between cmb lensing and large-scale structure to  measure primordial non-gaussianity	we apply a new method to measure primordial non-gaussianity, using thecross-correlation between galaxy surveys and the cmb lensing signal to measuregalaxy bias on very large scales, where local-type primordial non-gaussianitypredicts a $k^2$ divergence. we use the cmb lensing map recently published bythe planck collaboration, and measure its external correlations with a suite ofsix galaxy catalogues spanning a broad redshift range. we then consistentlycombine correlation functions to extend the recent analysis by giannantonio etal. (2013), where the density-density and the density-cmb temperaturecorrelations were used. due to the intrinsic noise of the planck lensing map,which affects the largest scales most severely, we find that the constraints onthe galaxy bias are similar to the constraints from density-cmb temperaturecorrelations. including lensing constraints only improves the previousstatistical measurement errors marginally, and we obtain $ f_{\mathrm{nl}} = 12\pm 21 $ (1$\sigma$) from the combined data set. however, the lensingmeasurements serve as an excellent test of systematic errors: we now have threemethods to measure the large-scale, scale-dependent bias from a galaxy survey:auto-correlation, and cross-correlation with both cmb temperature and lensing.as the publicly available planck lensing maps have had their largest-scalemodes at multipoles $l&lt;10$ removed, which are the most sensitive to thescale-dependent bias, we consider mock cmb lensing data covering allmultipoles. we find that, while the effect of $f_{\mathrm{nl}}$ indeedincreases significantly on the largest scales, so do the contributions of bothcosmic variance and the intrinsic lensing noise, so that the improvement issmall.

1403.4599	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: signs of neutrino mass in current cosmological datasets	we investigate the cosmological implications of the latest growth ofstructure measurement from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)cmass data release 11 with particular focus on the sum of the neutrino masses,$\sum m_{\nu}$. we examine the robustness of the cosmological constraints fromthe baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) scale, the alcock-paczynski effect andredshift-space distortions ($d_v/r_s$, $f_{\rm ap}$, $f\sigma_8$) of\citet{beutler:2013b}, when introducing a neutrino mass in the power spectrumtemplate. we then discuss how the neutrino mass relaxes discrepancies betweenthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) and other low-redshift measurementswithin $\lambda$cdm. combining our cosmological constraints with wmap9 yields$\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), which represents a $2.6\sigma$preference for non-zero neutrino mass. the significance can be increased to$3.3\sigma$ when including weak lensing results and other bao constraints,yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.35\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.). however, combiningcmass with planck data reduces the preference for neutrino mass to $\sim2\sigma$. when removing the cmb lensing effect in the planck temperature powerspectrum (by marginalising over $a_{\rm l}$), we see shifts of $\sim 1\sigma$in $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_m$, which have a significant effect on the neutrinomass constraints. in case of cmass plus planck without the $a_{\rm l}$-lensingsignal, we find a preference for a neutrino mass of $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.34\pm0.14\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.), in excellent agreement with the wmap9+cmass value. theconstraint can be tightened to $3.4\sigma$ yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.10\,$ev ($68\%$ c.l.) when weak lensing data and other bao constraints areincluded.

1408.1348	efficient reconstruction of linear baryon acoustic oscillations in  galaxy surveys	reconstructing an estimate of linear baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) froman evolved galaxy field has become a standard technique in recent analyses. bypartially removing non-linear damping caused by bulk motions, the real-spacebao peak in the correlation function is sharpened, and oscillations in thepower spectrum are visible to smaller scales. in turn these lead to strongermeasurements of the bao scale. future surveys are being designed assuming thatthis improvement has been applied, and this technique is therefore of criticalimportance for future bao measurements. a number of reconstruction techniquesare available, but the most widely used is a simple algorithm that decorrelateslarge-scale and small-scale modes approximately removing the bulk-flowdisplacements by moving the overdensity field (eisenstein et al. 2007;padmanabhan, white &amp; cohn 2009). we consider the practical implementation ofthis algorithm, looking at the efficiency of reconstruction as a function ofthe assumptions made for the bulk-flow scale, the shot noise level in a randomcatalogue used to quantify the mask and the method used to estimate thebulk-flow shifts. we also examine the efficiency of reconstruction againstexternal factors including galaxy density, volume and edge effects, andconsider their impact for future surveys. throughout we make use of the mockscatalogues created for the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) daterelease 11 samples covering 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 (cmass) and 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 (lowz),to empirically test these changes.

1501.00963	the eleventh and twelfth data releases of the sloan digital sky survey:  final data from sdss-iii	the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii) took datafrom 2008 to 2014 using the original sdss wide-field imager, the original andan upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infraredhigh-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. all the datafrom sdss-iii are now made public. in particular, this paper describes datarelease 11 (dr11) including all data acquired through 2013 july, and datarelease 12 (dr12) adding data acquired through 2014 july (including all dataincluded in previous data releases), marking the end of sdss-iii observing.relative to our previous public release (dr10), dr12 adds one million newspectra of galaxies and quasars from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples thenumber of h-band spectra of stars as part of the apache point observatory (apo)galactic evolution experiment (apogee), and includes repeated accurate radialvelocity measurements of 5500 stars from the multi-object apo radial velocityexoplanet large-area survey (marvels). the apogee outputs now include measuredabundances of 15 different elements for each star. in total, sdss-iii added2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of thesloan exploration of galactic understanding and evolution 2 (segue-2) survey;2,497,484 boss spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 apogee spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040marvels spectra of 5,513 stars. since its first light in 1998, sdss has imagedover 1/3 of the celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five millionastronomical spectra.

1501.05571	the information content of anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillation scale  measurements	anisotropic measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) featurewithin a galaxy survey enable joint inference about the hubble parameter $h(z)$and angular diameter distance $d_a(z)$. these measurements are typicallyobtained from moments of the measured 2-point clustering statistics, withrespect to the cosine of the angle to the line of sight $\mu$. the position ofthe bao features in each moment depends on a combination of $d_a(z)$ and$h(z)$, and measuring the positions in two or more moments breaks thisparameter degeneracy. we derive analytic formulae for the parametercombinations measured from moments given by legendre polynomials, power lawsand top-hat wedges in $\mu$, showing explicitly what is being measured by eachin real-space for both the correlation function and power spectrum, and inredshift-space for the power spectrum. the large volume covered by moderngalaxy samples means that the correlation function can be well approximated ashaving no correlations at different $\mu$ on the bao scale, and that the errorson this scale are approximately independent of $\mu$. using theseapproximations, we derive the information content of various moments. we showthat measurements made using either the monopole and quadrupole, or themonopole and $\mu^2$ power-law moment, are optimal for anisotropic baomeasurements, in that they contain all of the available information using twomoments, the minimal number required to measure both $h(z)$ and $d_a(z)$. wetest our predictions using 600 mock galaxy samples, matched to the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey cmass sample, finding a good match toour analytic predictions. our results should enable the optimal extraction ofinformation from future galaxy surveys such as eboss, desi and euclid.

1502.07900	the subaru fmos galaxy redshift survey (fastsound). i. overview of the  survey targeting on h$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 1.4$	fastsound is a galaxy redshift survey using the near-infrared fibermulti-object spectrograph (fmos) mounted on the subaru telescope, targetingh$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 1.18$--$1.54$ down to the sensitivity limit ofh$\alpha$ flux $\sim 2 \times 10^{-16} \ \rm erg \ cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. the primarygoal of the survey is to detect redshift space distortions (rsd), to testgeneral relativity by measuring the growth rate of large scale structure and toconstrain modified gravity models for the origin of the accelerated expansionof the universe. the target galaxies were selected based on photometricredshifts and h$\alpha$ flux estimates calculated by fitting spectral energydistribution (sed) models to the five optical magnitudes of the canada francehawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) wide catalog. the survey started inmarch 2012, and all the observations were completed in july 2014. in total, weachieved $121$ pointings of fmos (each pointing has a $30$ arcmin diametercircular footprint) covering $20.6$ deg$^2$ by tiling the four fields of thecfhtls wide in a hexagonal pattern. emission lines were detected from $\sim4,000$ star forming galaxies by an automatic line detection algorithm appliedto 2d spectral images. this is the first in a series of papers based onfastsound data, and we describe the details of the survey design, targetselection, observations, data reduction, and emission line detections.

1503.04324	the importance of the cosmic web and halo substructure for power spectra	in this work we study the relevance of the cosmic web and substructures onthe matter and lensing power spectra measured from halo mock cataloguesextracted from the n-body simulations. since n-body simulations arecomputationally expensive, it is common to use faster methods that approximatethe dark matter field as a set of halos. in this approximation, we replace massconcentrations in n-body simulations by a spherically symmetricnavarro-frenk-white halo density profile. we also consider the full mass fieldas the sum of two distinct fields: dark matter halos ($m&gt;9\times10^{12}~m_{\odot}$/h) and particles not included into halos. mock halosreproduce well the matter power spectrum, but underestimate the lensing powerspectrum on large and small scales. for sources at $z_{\rm s}=1$ the lensingpower spectrum is underestimated by up to 40% at $\ell\approx 10^4$ withrespect to the simulated halos. the large scale effect can be alleviated bycombining the mock catalogue with the dark matter distribution outside thehalos. in addition, to evaluate the contribution of substructures we havesmeared out the intra-halo substructures in a n-body simulation while keepingthe halo density profiles unchanged. for the matter power spectrum the effectof this smoothing is only of the order of 5%, but for lensing substructures aremuch more important: for $\ell\approx 10^4$ the internal structures contribute30% of the total spectrum. these findings have important implications in theway mock catalogues have to be created, suggesting that some approximatemethods currently used for galaxy surveys will be inadequate for future weaklensing surveys.

1504.02591	reconstruction in fourier space	we present a fast iterative fft-based reconstruction algorithm that allowsfor non- parallel redshift-space distortions (rsd). we test our algorithm onboth n-body dark matter simulations and mock distributions of galaxies designedto replicate galaxy survey conditions. we compare solenoidal and irrotationalcomponents of the redshift distortion and show that an approximation of thisdistortion leads to a better estimate of the real-space potential (andtherefore faster convergence) than ignoring the rsd when estimating thedisplacement field. our iterative reconstruction scheme converges in twoiterations for the mock samples corresponding to boss cmass dr11 when we startwith an approximation of the rsd. the scheme takes six iterations when theinitial estimate, measured from the redshift-space overdensity, has no rsdcorrection. slower convergence would be expected for surveys covering a largerangle on the sky. we show that this fft based method provides a better estimateof the real space displacement field than a configuration space method thatuses finite difference routines to compute the potential for the same gridresolution. finally we show that a lognormal transform of the overdensity, usedas a proxy for the linear overdensity, is beneficial in estimating the fulldisplacement field from a dense sample of tracers. however the lognormaltransform of the overdensity does not perform well when estimating thedisplacements from sparser simulations with a more realistic galaxy density.

1504.03979	cosmological parameter inference from galaxy clustering: the effect of  the posterior distribution of the power spectrum	we consider the shape of the posterior distribution to be used when fittingcosmological models to power spectra measured from galaxy surveys. at verylarge scales, gaussian posterior distributions in the power do not approximatethe posterior distribution $\mathcal{p}_r$ we expect for a gaussian densityfield $\delta_k$, even if we vary the covariance matrix according to the modelto be tested. we compare alternative posterior distributions with$\mathcal{p}_r$, both mode-by-mode and in terms of expected measurements ofprimordial non-gaussianity parameterised by $f_\mathrm{nl}$. marginalising overa gaussian posterior distribution $\mathcal{p}_f$ with fixed covariance matrixyields a posterior mean value of $f_\mathrm{nl}$ which, for a data set with thecharacteristics of euclid, will be underestimated by $\trianglef_\mathrm{nl}=0.4$, while for the data release 9 (dr9) of the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) it will beunderestimated by $\triangle f_\mathrm{nl}=19.1$. adopting a different form ofthe posterior function means that we do not necessarily require a differentcovariance matrix for each model to be tested: this dependence is absorbed intothe functional form of the posterior. thus, the computational burden ofanalysis is significantly reduced.

1506.03737	l-picola: a parallel code for fast dark matter simulation	robust measurements based on current large-scale structure surveys requireprecise knowledge of statistical and systematic errors. this can be obtainedfrom large numbers of realistic mock galaxy catalogues that mimic the observeddistribution of galaxies within the survey volume. to this end we present afast, distributed-memory, planar-parallel code, l-picola, which can be used togenerate and evolve a set of initial conditions into a dark matter field muchfaster than a full non-linear n-body simulation. additionally, l-picola has theability to include primordial non-gaussianity in the simulation and simulatethe past lightcone at run-time, with optional replication of the simulationvolume. through comparisons to fully non-linear n-body simulations we find thatour code can reproduce the $z=0$ power spectrum and reduced bispectrum of darkmatter to within 2% and 5% respectively on all scales of interest tomeasurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions,but 3 orders of magnitude faster. the accuracy, speed and scalability of thiscode, alongside the additional features we have implemented, make it extremelyuseful for both current and next generation large-scale structure surveys.l-picola is publicly available at https://cullanhowlett.github.io/l-picola

1508.04472	the sdss-iv extended baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar  target selection	as part of the sloan digital sky survey iv the extended baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (eboss) will improve measurements of the cosmologicaldistance scale by applying the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) method toquasar samples. eboss will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 sq.deg. first, a "core" quasar sample will combine optical selection in ugrizusing a likelihood-based routine called xdqsoz, with a mid-ir-opticalcolor-cut. eboss core selection (to g &lt; 22 or r &lt; 22) should return ~ 70quasars per sq. deg. at redshifts 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 and ~7 z &gt; 2.1 quasars per sq.deg. second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from thepalomar transient factory should recover an additional ~3-4 z &gt; 2.1 quasars persq. deg. to g &lt; 22.5. a linear model of how imaging systematics affect targetdensity recovers the angular distribution of eboss core quasars over 96.7%(76.7%) of the sdss north (south) galactic cap area. the eboss core quasarsample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 toyield the first few-percent-level bao constraint near z~1.5. eboss quasars at z&gt; 2.1 will be used to improve bao measurements in the lyman-alpha forest.beyond its key cosmological goals, eboss should be the next-generation quasarsurvey, comprising &gt; 500,000 new quasars and &gt; 500,000 uniformly selectedspectroscopically confirmed 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 quasars. at the conclusion of eboss,the sdss will have provided unique spectra of over 800,000 quasars.

1508.04478	the sdss-iv extended baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey: luminous  red galaxy target selection	we describe the algorithm used to select the luminous red galaxy (lrg) samplefor the extended baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (eboss) of the sloandigital sky survey iv (sdss-iv) using photometric data from both the sdss andthe wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). lrg targets are required tomeet a set of color selection criteria and have z-band and i-band modelmagnitudes z &lt; 19.95 and 19.9 &lt; i &lt; 21.8, respectively. our algorithm selectsroughly 50 lrg targets per square degree, the great majority of which lie inthe redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 (median redshift 0.71). we demonstrate thatour methods are highly effective at eliminating stellar contamination andlower-redshift galaxies. we perform a number of tests using spectroscopic datafrom sdss-iii/boss to determine the redshift reliability of our targetselection and its ability to meet the science requirements of eboss. the sdssspectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio that at least 89% of thetarget sample yields secure redshift measurements. we also present tests of theuniformity and homogeneity of the sample, demonstrating that it should be cleanenough for studies of the large-scale structure of the universe at higherredshifts than sdss-iii/boss lrgs reached.

1509.06529	sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey data release 12: galaxy  target selection and large scale structure catalogues	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), part of the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) iii project, has provided the largest survey of galaxyredshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshiftsmeasured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. keyto analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurementsis understanding the detailed properties of this sample. potential issuesinclude variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in thetargeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern ofspectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for whichredshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due toobservational systematics. we document here the target selection algorithmsused to create the galaxy samples that comprise boss. we also present thealgorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final datarelease (dr12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify thesurvey mask. the algorithms are an evolution of those used by the boss team toconstruct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accuratelyquantify the galaxy sample. the code used, designated mksample, is releasedwith this paper.

0807.0810	reconstructing the history of structure formation using redshift  distortions	measuring the statistics of galaxy peculiar velocities using redshift-spacedistortions is an excellent way of probing the history of structure formation.because galaxies are expected to act as test particles within the flow ofmatter, this method avoids uncertainties due to an unknown galaxy density bias.we show that the parameter combination measured by redshift-space distortions,$f\sigma_8^{\rm mass}$ provides a good test of dark energy models, even withoutthe knowledge of bias or $\sigma_8^{\rm mass}$ required to extract $f$ fromthis measurement (here $f$ is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growthrate, and $\sigma_8^{\rm mass}$ is the root-mean-square mass fluctuation inspheres with radius $8h^{-1}$mpc). we argue that redshift-space distortionmeasurements will help to determine the physics behind the cosmic acceleration,testing whether it is related to dark energy or modified gravity, and willprovide an opportunity to test possible dark energy clumping or couplingbetween dark energy and dark matter. if we can measure galaxy bias in addition,simultaneous measurement of both the overdensity and velocity fields can beused to test the validity of equivalence principle, through the continuityequation.

0705.3323	measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation scale using the sdss and  2dfgrs	we introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using baryonacoustic oscillation (bao) distance measurements from galaxy samples coveringdifferent redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn fromthe sdss and 2dfgrs. bao are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dfgrsand sdss main galaxy samples, and measure the distance--redshift relation atz=0.2. bao in the clustering of the sdss luminous red galaxies measure thedistance--redshift relation at z=0.35. the observed scale of the bao calculatedfrom these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed usingestimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distancemeasure d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3). here d_a is the angular diameterdistance, and h(z) is the hubble parameter. this givesr_s/d_v(0.2)=0.1980+/-0.0058 and r_s/d_v(0.35)=0.1094+/-0.0033 (1sigma errors),with correlation coefficient of 0.39, where r_s is the comoving sound horizonscale at recombination. matching the bao to have the same measured scale at allredshifts then gives d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.812+/-0.060. the recovered ratio isroughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift snls supernovaedata for lambda cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmologicalacceleration at low redshift. if we force the cosmological model to be flatwith constant w, then we find om_m=0.249+/-0.018 and w=-1.004+/-0.089 aftercombining with the snls data, and including the wmap measurement of theapparent acoustic horizon angle in the cmb.

0808.1101	scale dependent galaxy bias in the sdss as a function of luminosity and  colour	it has been known for a long time that the clustering of galaxies changes asa function of galaxy type. this galaxy bias acts as a hindrance to theextraction of cosmological information from the galaxy power spectrum orcorrelation function. theoretical arguments show that a change in the amplitudeof the clustering between galaxies and mass on large-scales is unavoidable, butcosmological information can be easily extracted from the shape of the powerspectrum or correlation function if this bias is independent of scale.scale-dependent bias is generally small on large scales, k&lt;0.1 h.mpc^{-1}, buton smaller scales can affect the recovery of \omega_m.h from the measured shapeof the clustering signal, and have a small effect on the baryon acousticoscillations. in this paper we investigate the transition fromscale-independent to scale-dependent galaxy bias as a function of galaxypopulation. we use the sloan digital sky survey dr5 sample to fit variousmodels, which attempt to parametrise the turn-off from scale-independentbehaviour. for blue galaxies, we find that the strength of the turn-off isstrongly dependent on galaxy luminosity, with stronger scale-dependent bias onlarger scales for more luminous galaxies. for red galaxies, thescale-dependence is a weaker function of luminosity. such trends need to bemodelled in order to optimally extract the information available in futuresurveys, and can help with the design of such surveys.

astro-ph;0107437	the build-up of halos within press-schechter theory	modelling the build-up of halos is important for linking the formation ofgalaxies with cosmological models. a simple model of halo growth is provided bypress-schechter (ps) theory, where the initial field of density fluctuations issmoothed using spherically symmetric filters centred on a given position toobtain information about the likelihood of later collapse on varying scales. inthis paper the predicted halo mass growth is compared for three filter shapes:gaussian, top-hat and sharp k-space. preliminary work is also presentedanalysing the build-up of halos within numerical simulations using afriends-of-friends group finder. the best-fit to the simulation mass functionwas obtained using ps theory with a top-hat filter. by comparing both thebackwards conditional mass function, which gives the distribution of haloprogenitors, and the distribution of halo mergers in time, the build-up ofhalos in the simulations is shown to be better fitted by ps theory with a sharpk-space filter. this strengthens previous work, which also found the build-upof halos in simulations to be well matched to ps theory with a sharp k-spacefilter by providing a direct comparison of different filters and by extendingthe statistical tools used to analyse halo mass growth. the usefulness of thiswork is illustrated by showing that the cosmological evolution in theproportion of halos that have undergone recent merger is predicted to beindependent of mass and power spectrum and to only depend upon cosmology.recent results from observations of field galaxies are shown to match theevolution expected, but are not sufficiently accurate to usefully distinguishbetween cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0109152	evidence for a non-zero lambda and a low matter density from a combined  analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey and cosmic microwave background  anisotropies	we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the power spectra of the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropiesunder the assumptions that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic, gaussianand well described by power laws with scalar and tensor indices of n_s and n_t.on its own, the 2dfgrs sets tight limits on the parameter combination omega_mh, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density inbaryons omega_b/omega_m. the cmb anisotropy data alone set poor constraints onthe cosmological constant and hubble constant because of a `geometricaldegeneracy' among parameters. furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the cmbdata allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons andcold dark matter. combining the cmb and 2dfgrs data sets helps to break boththe geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. the values of the parametersderived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models ofinflation, with the baryon density derived from primordial nucleosynthesis andwith direct measurements of the hubble parameter. in particular, we find strongevidence for a positive cosmological constant with a pm 2sigma range of 0.65 &lt;omega_lambda &lt; 0.85, completely independently of constraints on omega_\lambdaderived from type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0112162	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the amplitudes of fluctuations in the  2dfgrs and the cmb, and implications for galaxy biasing	we compare the amplitudes of fluctuations probed by the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey and by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies. by combining the 2dfgrs and cmb data we find the linear-theoryrms mass fluctuations in 8 mpc/h spheres to be sigma_8 = 0.73 +-0.05 (aftermarginalization over the matter density parameter omega_m and three other freeparameters). this normalization is lower than the cobe normalization andprevious estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with somerevised cluster abundance determinations. we also estimate thescale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch l_s = 1.9l_* apm-selectedgalaxies to be b(l_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.15h/mpc. if luminosity segregation operates on these scales, l_* galaxies wouldbe almost un-biased, b(l_*,z=0) = 0.96. these results are derived by assuming aflat lambda-cdm universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters andfixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.we also study the best fit pair (omega_m,b), and the robustness of the resultsto varying n and tau. various modelling corrections can each change theresulting b by 5-15 per cent. the results are compared with other independentmeasurements from the 2dfgrs itself, and from the sdss, cluster abundance andcosmic shear.

astro-ph;0206256	parameter constraints for flat cosmologies from cmb and 2dfgrs power  spectra	we constrain flat cosmological models with a joint likelihood analysis of anew compilation of data from the cosmic microwave background (cmb) and from the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). fitting the cmb alone yields a knowndegeneracy between the hubble constant h and the matter density omega_m, whicharises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular powerspectrum. this `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail andshown to follow a simple relation omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. adding the 2dfgrspower spectrum constrains omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. if tensoranisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the hubbleconstant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and thephysical cdm and baryon densities omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.002 (standard rms errors). including a possible tensor componentcauses very little change to these figures; we set a upper limit to thetensor-to-scalar ratio of r&lt;0.7 at 95% confidence. we then show how these datacan be used to constrain the equation of state of the vacuum, and find w&lt;-0.52at 95% confidence. the preferred cosmological model is thus very wellspecified, and we discuss the precision with which future cmb data can bepredicted, given the model assumptions. the 2dfgrs power-spectrum data andcovariance matrix, and the cmb data compilation used here, are available fromhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/

astro-ph;0306511	fourier analysis of luminosity-dependent galaxy clustering	we extend the fourier transform based method for the analysis of galaxyredshift surveys of feldman, kaiser &amp; peacock (1994: fkp) to modelluminosity-dependent clustering. in a magnitude limited survey, galaxies athigh redshift are more luminous on average than galaxies at low redshift.galaxy clustering is observed to increase with luminosity, so the inferreddensity field is effectively multiplied by an increasing function of radius.this has the potential to distort the shape of the recovered power spectrum. inthis paper we present an extension of the fkp analysis method to incorporatethis effect, and present revised optimal weights to maximize the precision ofsuch an analysis. the method is tested and its accuracy assessed using mockcatalogues of the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we also showthat the systematic effect caused by ignoring luminosity-dependent bias wasnegligible for the initial analysis of the 2dfgrs of percival et al.

astro-ph;0508156	cosmological structure formation in a homogeneous dark energy background	there is now strong evidence that the current energy density of the universeis dominated by dark energy with an equation of state w&lt;-1/3, which is causingaccelerated expansion. the build-up of structure within such universes issubject to significant ongoing study, particularly through the sphericalcollapse model. this paper aims to review and consolidate progress forcosmologies in which the dark energy component remains homogeneous on thescales of the structures being modelled. the equations presented are designedto allow for dark energy with a general time-varying equation of state w(a). inaddition to reviewing previous work, a number of new results are introduced: anew fitting formula for the linear growth factor in constant w cosmologies isgiven. a new formalism for determining the critical density for collapse ispresented based on the initial curvature of the perturbation. the commonly usedapproximation to the critical density for collapse based on the linear growthfactor is discussed for a general dark energy equation of state. virialisationwithin such cosmologies is also considered, and the standard assumption thatenergy is conserved between turn-around and virialisation is questioned andlimiting possiblities are presented.

astro-ph;0604547	likelihood methods for the combined analysis of cmb temperature and  polarisation power spectra	we consider the shape of the likelihood and posterior surfaces to be usedwhen fitting cosmological models to cmb temperature and polarisation powerspectra measured from experiments. in the limit of an all-sky survey withgaussian distributed pixel noise we show that the true combined likelihood ofthe four cmb power spectra (tt, te, ee &amp; bb) has a wishart distribution and wediscuss the properties of this function. we compare various fits to theposterior surface of the cls, both in the case of a single auto-power spectrumand for a combination of temperature and polarisation data. in the latter case,it is important that the fits can accurately match the wishart distribution inthe limit of near full-sky coverage. simple extensions of auto-power spectrumfits to include polarisation data generally fail to match correlations betweenthe different power spectra in this limit. directly fitting pixel values onlarge scales, as undertaken by the wmap team in their analysis of the 3 yeardata, avoids the complications of characterising the shape of the posterior forthe power spectra. finally we demonstrate the importance of the likelihooddistribution on analytic marginalisation, and provide a formula for analyticmarginalisation over a calibration error given an all-sky survey.

astro-ph;0608635	measuring the matter density using baryon oscillations in the sdss	we measure the cosmological matter density by observing the positions ofbaryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we jointly analyse the main galaxies and lrgs in the sdssdr5 sample, using over half a million galaxies in total. the oscillations aredetected with 99.74% confidence (3.0sigma assuming gaussianity) compared to asmooth power spectrum. when combined with the observed scale of the peakswithin the cmb, we find a best-fit value of omega_m=0.256+0.029-0.024 (68%confidence interval), for a flat lambda cosmology when marginalising over thehubble parameter and the baryon density. this value of the matter density isderived from the locations of the baryon oscillations in the galaxy powerspectrum and in the cmb, and does not include any information from the overallshape of the power spectra. this is an extremely clean cosmological measurementas the physics of the baryon acoustic oscillation production is wellunderstood, and the positions of the oscillations are expected to beindependent of systematics such as galaxy bias.

astro-ph;0608636	the shape of the sdss dr5 galaxy power spectrum	we present a fourier analysis of the clustering of galaxies in the combinedmain galaxy and luminous red galaxy (lrg) sloan digital sky survey (sdss) datarelease 5 (dr5) sample. the aim of our analysis is to consider how well we canmeasure the cosmological matter density using the signature of the horizon atmatter-radiation equality embedded in the large-scale power spectrum. the newdata constrains the power spectrum on scales 100--600h^-1mpc with significantlyhigher precision than previous analyses of just the sdss main galaxies, due toour larger sample and the inclusion of the lrgs. this improvement means that wecan now reveal a discrepancy between the shape of the measured power and linearcdm models on scales 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.15hmpc^-1, with linear model fits favouring alower matter density (omega_m=0.22+/-0.04) on scales 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.06hmpc^-1 and ahigher matter density (omega_m=0.32+/-0.01) when smaller scales are included,assuming a flat lcdm model with h=0.73 and n_s=0.96. this discrepancy could beexplained by scale-dependent bias and, by analysing subsamples of galaxies, wefind that the ratio of small-scale to large-scale power increases with galaxyluminosity, so all of the sdss galaxies cannot trace the same power spectrumshape over 0.01&lt;k&lt;0.2hmpc^-1. however, the data are insufficient to clearlyshow a luminosity-dependent change in the largest scale at which a significantincrease in clustering is observed, although they do not rule out such aneffect. significant scale-dependent galaxy bias on large-scales, which changeswith the r-band luminosity of the galaxies, could potentially explaindifferences in our omega_m estimates and differences previously observedbetween 2dfgrs and sdss power spectra and the resulting parameter constraints.
