0901.3256	north ecliptic pole wide field survey of akari: survey strategy and data  characteristics	we present the survey strategy and the data characteristics of the northecliptic pole (nep) wide survey of akari. the survey was carried out for aboutone year starting from may 2006 with 9 passbands from 2.5 to 24 micron and theareal coverage of about 5.8 sq. degrees centered on nep. the survey depthreaches to 21.8 ab magnitude near infrared (nir) bands, and ~ 18.6 abmaggnitude at the mid infrared (mir) bands such as 15 and 18 micron. the totalnumber of sources detected in this survey is about 104,000, with more sourcesin nir than in the mir. we have cross matched infrared sources with opticallyidentified sources in cfht imaging survey which covered about 2 sq. degreeswithin nep-wide survey region in order to characterize the nature of infraredsources. the majority of the mid infrared sources at 15 and 18 micron band arefound to be star forming disk galaxies, with smaller fraction of early typegalaxies and agns. we found that a large fraction (60~80 %) of bright sourcesin 9 and 11 micron stars while stellar fraction decreases toward faintersources. we present the histograms of the sources at mid infrared bands at 9,11, 15 and 18 micron. the number of sources per magnitude thus varies as m^0.6for longer wavelength sources while shorter wavelength sources show steepervariation with m, where m is the ab magnitude.

0704.1182	an optical source catalog of the north ecliptic pole region	we present a five (u*,g',r',i',z') band optical photometry catalog of thesources in the north ecliptic pole (nep) region based on deep observations madewith megacam at cfht. the source catalog covers about 2 square degree areacentered at the nep and reaches depths of about 26 mag for u*, g', r' bands,about 25 mag for i' band, and about 24 mag for z' band (4 sigma detection overan 1 arcsec aperture). the total number of cataloged sources brighter than r'=23 mag is about 56,000 including both point sources and extended sources. fromthe investigation of photometric properties using the color-magnitude diagramsand color-color diagrams, we have found that the colors of extended sources aremostly (u*-r') &lt; 3.0 and (g'-z') &gt; 0.5. this can be used to separate theextended sources from the point sources reliably, even for the faint sourcedomain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly workefficiently. we have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the redsequence galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey data. by applying thisrelation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities,we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group.

0903.1333	hot debris dust around hd 106797	photometry of the a0 v main-sequence star hd 106797 with akari andgemini/t-recs is used to detect excess emission over the expected stellarphotospheric emission between 10 and 20 micron, which is best attributed to hotcircumstellar debris dust surrounding the star. the temperature of the debrisdust is derived as td ~ 190 k by assuming that the excess emission isapproximated by a single temperature blackbody. the derived temperaturesuggests that the inner radius of the debris disk is ~ 14 au. the fractionalluminosity of the debris disk is 1000 times brighter than that of our ownzodiacal cloud. the existence of such a large amount of hot dust around hd106797 cannot be accounted for by a simple model of the steady state evolutionof a debris disk due to collisions, and it is likely that transient events playa significant role. our data also show a narrow spectral feature between 11 and12 micron attributable to crystalline silicates, suggesting that dust heatinghas occurred during the formation and evolution of the debris disk of hd106797.

0904.3788	calibration and performance of the akari far-infrared surveyor (fis) --  slow-scan observation mode for point sources	we present the characterization and calibration of the slow-scan observationmode of the far-infrared surveyor (fis) onboard the akari satellite. the fis,one of the two focal-plane instruments on akari, has four photometric bandsbetween 50--180 um with two types of ge:ga array detectors. in addition to theall-sky survey, fis has also taken detailed far-infrared images of selectedtargets by using the slow-scan mode. the sensitivity of the slow-scan mode isone to two orders of magnitude better than that of the all-sky survey, becausethe exposure time on a targeted source is much longer. the point spreadfunctions (psfs) were obtained by observing several bright point-like objectssuch as asteroids, stars, and galaxies. the derived full widths at the halfmaximum (fwhms) are ~30'' for the two shorter wavelength bands and ~40'' forthe two longer wavelength bands, being consistent with those expected by theoptical simulation, although a certain amount of excess is seen in the tails ofthe psfs. the flux calibration has been performed by the observations ofwell-established photometric calibration standards (asteroids and stars) in awide range of fluxes. after establishing the method of aperture photometry, thephotometric accuracy for point-sources is better than +-15% in all of the bandsexpect for the longest wavelength.

0912.2748	spitzer infrared low-resolution spectroscopic study of buried agns in a  complete sample of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present the results of spitzer irs low-resolution infrared 5-35 micronspectroscopy of 17 nearby ulirgs at z &lt; 0.2, optically classified asnon-seyferts. the presence of optically elusive, but intrinsically luminous,buried agns is investigated, based on the strengths of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emission and silicate dust absorption features detected in thespectra. the signatures of luminous buried agns, whose intrinsic luminositiesrange up to ~10^12 lsun, are found in eight sources. we combine these resultswith those of our previous research to investigate the energy function ofburied agns in a complete sample of optically non-seyfert ulirgs in the localuniverse at z &lt; 0.3 (85 sources). we confirm a trend that we previouslydiscovered: that buried agns are more common in galaxies with higher infraredluminosities. because optical seyferts also show a similar trend, we argue moregenerally that the energetic importance of agns is intrinsically higher in moreluminous galaxies, suggesting that the agn-starburst connections areluminosity-dependent. this may be related to the stronger agn feedback scenarioin currently more massive galaxy systems, as a possible origin of the galaxydownsizing phenomenon.

1008.0859	luminosity functions of local infrared galaxies with akari: implications  to the cosmic star formation history and agn evolution	infrared (ir) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic starformation history and agn evolution. the akari ir space telescope performed allsky survey in 6 ir bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) with 3-10 times bettersensitivity than iras, covering the crucial far-ir wavelengths across the peakof the dust emission. combined with a better spatial resolution, akari can muchmore precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (l_tir) of individualgalaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the localuniverse. by fitting ir sed models, we have re-measured l_tir of the irasrevised bright galaxy sample. we present mid-ir monochromatic luminosity tol_tir conversions for spitzer 8,24um, akari 9,18um, iras 12um, wise 12,22um,and iso 15um filters, with scatter ranging 13-44%. the resulting akari irluminosity function (lf) agrees well with that from the iras. we integrate thelf weighted by l_tir to obtain a cosmic ir luminosity density of omega_tir=(8.5^{+1.5}_{-2.3})x 10^7 l mpc^-3, of which 7+-1% is produced by lirgs, andonly 0.4+-0.1% is from ulirgs in the local universe. once ir contributions fromagn and star-forming galaxies (sfg) are separated, sfg ir lf shows a steepdecline at the bright-end. compared with high-redshift results from the akarinep deep survey, these data show a strong evolution of omega_tirsf propto(1+z)^4.0+-0.5, and omega_tiragn propto (1+z)^4.4+-0.4. for omega_tiragn, theulirg contribution exceeds that from lirg already by z~1. a rapid evolution inboth omega_tiragn and omega_tirsfg suggests the correlation between starformation and black hole accretion rate continues up to higher redshifts. wecompare the evolution of omega_tiragn to that of x-ray luminosity density. theomega_tiragn/omega_x-rayagn ratio shows a possible increase at z&gt;1, suggestingan increase of obscured agn at z&gt;1.

1205.5032	mid and far infrared properties of a complete sample of local agns	we investigate the mid- (mir) to far-infrared (fir) properties of a nearlycomplete sample of local active galactic nuclei (agns) detected in theswift/bat all sky hard x-ray (14-195 kev) survey, based on the crosscorrelation with the akari infrared survey catalogs complemented by those withiras and wise. out of 135 non-blazer agns in the swift/bat 9 month catalog, weobtain the mir photometric data for 128 sources either in the 9, 12, 18, 22,and/or 25 um band. we find good correlation between their hard x-ray and mirluminosities over 3 orders of magnitude (42&lt; log lambda l_{lambda}(9, 18 um)&lt;45), which is tighter than that with the fir luminosities at 90 um. thissuggests that thermal emission from hot dusts irradiated by the agn emissiondominate the mir fluxes. both x-ray unabsorbed and absorbed agns follow thesame correlation, implying isotropic infrared emission, as expected in clumpydust tori rather than homogeneous ones. we find excess signals around 9 um inthe averaged infrared spectral energy distribution from heavy obscured "newtype" agns with small scattering fractions in the x-ray spectra. this could beattributed to the pah emission feature, suggesting that their host galaxieshave strong starburst activities.

1208.4663	infrared spectroscopy of co ro-vibrational absorption lines toward the  obscured agn iras 08572+3915	we present high-resolution spectroscopy of gaseous co absorption in thefundamental ro-vibrational band toward the heavily obscured active galacticnucleus (agn) iras 08572+3915. we have detected absorption lines up to highlyexcited rotational levels (j&lt;=17). the velocity profiles reveal three distinctcomponents, the strongest and broadest (delta_v &gt; 200 km s-1) of which is dueto blueshifted (-160 km s-1) gas at a temperature of ~ 270 k absorbing atvelocities as high as -400 km s-1. a much weaker but even warmer (~ 700 k)component, which is highly redshifted (+100 km s-1), is also detected, inaddition to a cold (~ 20 k) component centered at the systemic velocity of thegalaxy. on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the columndensity of co in the 270 k component is nco ~ 4.5 x 10^18 cm-2, which in fullymolecular gas corresponds to a h2 column density of nh2 ~ 2.5 x 10^22 cm-2. thethermal excitation of co up to the observed high rotational levels requires adensity greater than nc(h2) &gt; 2 x 10^7 cm-3, implying that the thickness of thewarm absorbing layer is extremely small (delta_d &lt; 4 x 10-2 pc) even if it ishighly clumped. the large column densities and high radial velocitiesassociated with these warm components, as well as their temperatures, indicatethat they originate in molecular clouds near the central engine of the agn.

1210.1644	the 3.3 micron pah emission as a star formation rate indicator	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features dominate themid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and can be useful to calibratestar formation rates and diagnose ionized states of grains. however, the pah3.3 micron feature has not been studied as much as other pah features since itis weaker than others and resides outside of spitzer capability. in order todetect and calibrate the 3.3 micron pah emission and investigate its potentialas a star formation rate indicator, we carried out an akari mission program,akari mjy unbiased survey of extragalactic survey (amuses) and compare itssample with various literature samples. we obtained 2 ~5 micron low resolutionspectra of 20 flux-limited galaxies with mixed sed classes, which yields thedetection of the 3.3 micron pah emission from three out of 20 galaxies. for thecombined sample of amuses and literature samples, the 3.3 micron pahluminosities correlate with the infrared luminosities of star-forming galaxies,albeit with a large scatter (1.5 dex). the correlation appears to break down atthe domain of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), and the power of the3.3 micron pah luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity is hampered atlog[l(pah3.3)/(erg/sec)] &gt; -42.0. possible origins for this deviation in thecorrelation are discussed, including contribution from agn and stronglyobscured ysos, and the destruction of pah molecules in ulirgs.

1404.4937	luminosity and redshift dependence of the covering factor of agns viewed  with wise and sdss	in this work, we investigate the dependence of the covering factor (cf) ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) (i) on the mid-infrared (mir) luminosity and (ii)on the redshift. we constructed 12- and 22-micron luminosity functions (lfs) at0.006 &lt; z &lt; 0.3 using the wide-field infrared survey explorer} (wise) data.combining the wise catalog with the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)spectroscopic data, we selected 223,982 galaxies at 12 micron and 25,721galaxies at 22 micron for spectroscopic classification. we then identified16,355 agns at 12 micron and 4,683 agns at 22 micron by their optical emissionlines and cataloged classifications in the sdss. following that, we estimatedthe cf as the fraction of type 2 agn in all agns whose mir emissions aredominated by the active nucleus (not their host galaxies) based on their mircolors. we found that (i) the cf decreased with increasing mir luminosity,regardless of the choice of type 2 agn classification criteria, and (ii) the cfdid not change significantly with the redshift for z &lt; 0.2. furthermore, wecarried out various tests to determine the influence of selection bias andconfirmed similar dependences exist even when taking these uncertainties intoaccount. the luminosity dependence of the cf can be explained by the recedingtorus model, but the "modified" receding torus model gives a slightly betterfit, as suggested by simpson.

1408.5975	akari irc 2.5-5 um spectroscopy of infrared galaxies over a wide  luminosity range	we present the result of a systematic infrared 2.5-5 um spectroscopic studyof 22 nearby infrared galaxies over a wide infrared luminosity range (10 &lt;log(l_ir / lsun) &lt; 13) obtained from akari infrared camera (irc). the uniqueband of the akari irc spectroscopy enables us to access both the 3.3 umpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission feature from star formingactivity and the continuum of torus-dust emission heated by an active galacticnucleus (agn). applying our agn diagnostics to the akari spectra, we discover14 buried agns. the large fraction of buried agns suggests that agn activitybehind the dust is almost ubiquitous in ultra-/luminous infrared galaxies(u/lirgs). we also find that both the fraction and energy contribution ofburied agns increase with infrared luminosity from 10 &lt; log(l_ir / lsun) &lt; 13,including normal infrared galaxies with log (l_ir / lsun) &lt; 11. the energycontribution from agns in the total infrared luminosity is only ~7% in lirgsand ~20% in ulirgs, suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosityoriginates from starburst activity. using the pah emission, we investigate theluminosity relation between star formation and agn. we find that these infraredgalaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected seyfertgalaxies with the same agn luminosities, implying that infrared galaxies couldbe an early evolutionary phase of agn.

0804.0155	timeline analysis and wavelet multiscale analysis of the akari all-sky  survey at 90 micron	we present a careful analysis of the point source detection limit of theakari all-sky survey in the wide-s 90 $\mu$m band near the north ecliptic pole(nep). timeline analysis is used to detect iras sources and then a conversionfactor is derived to transform the peak timeline signal to the interpolated 90$\mu$m flux of a source. combined with a robust noise measurement, the pointsource flux detection limit at s/n $&gt;5$ for a single detector row is$1.1\pm0.1$ jy which corresponds to a point source detection limit of thesurvey of $\sim$0.4 jy.  wavelet transform offers a multiscale representation of the time series data(tsd). we calculate the continuous wavelet transform of the tsd and then searchfor significant wavelet coefficients considered as potential source detections.to discriminate real sources from spurious or moving objects, only sources withconfirmation are selected. in our multiscale analysis, iras sources selectedabove $4\sigma$ can be identified as the only real sources at the point sourcescales. we also investigate the correlation between the non-iras sourcesdetected in timeline analysis and cirrus emission using wavelet transform andcontour plots of wavelet power spectrum. it is shown that the non-iras sourcesare most likely to be caused by excessive noise over a large range of spatialscales rather than real extended structures such as cirrus clouds.

0705.1862	detection of cfirb with akari/fis deep observations	the cosmic far-infrared background (cfirb) contains information about thenumber and distribution of contributing sources and thus gives us an importantkey to understand the evolution of galaxies. using a confusion study to set afundamental limit to the observations, we investigate the potential to explorethe cfirb with akari/fis deep observations. the far-infrared surveyor (fis) isone of the focal-plane instruments on the akari (formerly known as astro-f)satellite, which was launched in early 2006. based upon source distributionmodels assuming three different cosmological evolutionary scenarios (noevolution, weak evolution, and strong evolution), an extensive model fordiffuse emission from infrared cirrus, and instrumental noise estimates, wepresent a comprehensive analysis for the determination of the confusion levelsfor deep far-infrared observations. we use our derived sensitivities to suggestthe best observational strategy for the akari/fis mission to detect the cfirbfluctuations. if the source distribution follows the evolutionary models,observations will be mostly limited by source confusion. we find that we willbe able to detect the cfirb fluctuations and that these will in turn provideinformation to discriminate between the evolutionary scenarios of galaxies inmost low-to-medium cirrus regions.

(2004). using 11 agns with reliable detection of brackettlines, we derive the brackett-line-based bh mass estimators. we also find thatthe observed brackett line ratios can be explained with the commonly adoptedphysical conditions of the broad line region (blr). moreover, we fit the hotand warm dust components of the dust torus by adding photometric data of sdss,2mass, $\it{wise}$, and $\it{iso}$ to the $\it{akari}$ spectra, finding hot andwarm dust temperatures of $\sim1100\,\rm{k}$ and $\sim220\,\rm{k}$,respectively, rather than the commonly cited hot dust temperature of 1500 k.

0808.0363	systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of nearby ultraluminous  infrared galaxies with akari	we report on the results of systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of45 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z &lt; 0.3 using irc onboardthe akari satellite. this paper investigates whether the luminosities of theseulirgs are dominated by starburst activity, or optically elusive buried agnsare energetically important. our criteria include the strengths of the 3.3micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features and the opticaldepths of absorption features at 3.1 micron due to ice-covered dust grains andat 3.4 micron from bare carbonaceous dust grains. because of the akari irc'sspectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 micron wavelength range, unaffectedby earth's atmosphere, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ulirgs atz &gt; 0.15. we estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc),modestly obscured (av &lt; 15 mag) starburst activity based on the 3.3 micron pahemission luminosities measured in akari irc slitless spectra, and confirm thatsuch starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ulirgs. in roughly halfof the observed ulirgs classified optically as non-seyferts, we find signaturesof luminous energy sources that produce no pah emission and/or are morecentrally concentrated than the surrounding dust. we interpret these energysources as buried agns. the fraction of ulirgs with detectable buried agnsignatures increases with increasing infrared luminosity. our overall resultssupport the scenario that luminous buried agns are important in many ulirgs atz &lt; 0.3 classified optically as non-seyferts, and that the opticalundetectability of such buried agns occurs merely because of a large amount ofnuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust columndensity opaque to the ionizing radiation of the agns.

astro-ph;0309425	x-ray evidence for a buried active galactic nucleus in ugc 5101	we present x-ray observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy, ugc 5101,thought to contain a buried active galactic nucleus (agn) based on observationsin other wavebands. we detected an absorbed hard component at &gt;3 kev, as wellas soft emission in the energy range 0.5-2 kev. the soft x-ray component,possibly due to a modestly dust-obscured, extended starburst, has anabsorption-corrected 0.5-2 kev x-ray luminosity of lx(0.5-2 kev) = 1.2 * 10^41ergs s^-1. the 0.5-2 kev x-ray to infrared luminosity ratio is a factor of 5lower than typical values for a normal starburst, suggesting that this extendedstarburst is unlikely to be energetically dominant in ugc 5101. the mostplausible origin of the absorbed hard component is the putative buried agn. the6.4 kev fe k alpha emission line has a modest equivalent width (400 ev),suggesting that this hard component is direct emission from the agn, ratherthan a scattered component. the absorption-corrected 2-10 kev x-ray luminosityof the buried agn was estimated to be lx(2-10 kev) = 5 * 10^42 ergs s^-1. theintrinsic 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity and the 2-10 kev x-ray to infraredluminosity ratio are both comparable to values measured for mrk 463, aseyfert-2 galaxy of similar infrared luminosity.

astro-ph;0411431	far-ir detection limits i: sky confusion due to galactic cirrus	fluctuations in the brightness of the background radiation can lead toconfusion with real point sources. such background emission confusion will beimportant for infrared observations with relatively large beam sizes since theamount of fluctuation tends to increase with angular scale. in order toquantitively assess the effect of the background emission on the detection ofpoint sources for current and future far-infrared observations by space-bornemissions such as spitzer, astro-f, herschel and spica, we have extended thegalactic emission map to higher angular resolution than the currently availabledata. using this high resolution map, we estimate the sky confusion noise dueto the emission from interstellar dust clouds or cirrus, based on fluctuationanalysis and detailed photometry over realistically simulated images. we findthat the confusion noise derived by simple fluctuation analysis agrees wellwith the result from realistic simulations. although the sky confusion noisebecomes dominant in long wavelength bands (&gt; 100 um) with 60 - 90cm aperturemissions, it is expected to be two order of magnitude smaller for the nextgeneration space missions with larger aperture sizes such as herschel andspica.

astro-ph;0509459	type i ulirgs: transition stage from ulirgs to qsos	we examine whether the ultraluminous infrared galaxies that contain a type iseyfert nucleus (a type i ulirg) are in the transition stage from ulirgs toquasi-stellar objects (qsos). to inspect this issue, we compare the black hole(bh) mass, the bulge luminosity and the far infrared luminosity among type iulirgs, qsos and elliptical galaxies. as a result, we find the followingresults; (1) the type i ulirgs have systematically smaller bh masses in spiteof the comparable bulge luminosity relative to qsos and elliptical galaxies.(2) the far-infrared luminosity of most type i ulirgs is larger than theeddington luminosity. we show that above results do not change significantlyfor 3 type i ulirgs that we can estimate the visual extinction from the columndensity. also, for all 8 type i ulirgs, we investigate the effect ofuncertainties of bh mass measurments and our sample bias, so that it turns outthat our results do not alter even if we consider above two effects. inaddition, anabuki (2004) revealed that their x-ray properties are similar tothose of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies. these would indicate that activegalactic nuclei (agns) with a high mass accretion rate exist in the type iulirgs. based on all of these findings, we conclude that it would be a naturalinterpretation that type i ulirgs are the early phase of bh growth, namely themissing link between ulirgs and qsos. moreover, by comparing our results with atheoretical model of a coevolution scenario of a qso bh and a galactic bulge,we show clearly that this explanation would be valid.

astro-ph;0511525	large silicon abundance in photodissociation regions	we have made one-dimensional raster-scan observations of the rho oph andsigma sco star-forming regions with two spectrometers (sws and lws) on boardthe iso. in the rho oph region, [siii] 35um, [oi] 63um, 146um, [cii] 158um, andthe h2 pure rotational transition lines s(0) to s(3) are detected, and the pdrproperties are derived as the radiation field scaled by the solar neighborhoodvalue g_0~30-500, the gas density n~250--2500 /cc, and the surface temperaturet~100-400 k. the ratio of [siii] 35um to [oi] 146um indicates that silicon of10--20% of the solar abundance must be in the gaseous form in thephotodissociation region (pdr), suggesting that efficient dust destruction isundergoing even in the pdr and that part of silicon atoms may be contained involatile forms in dust grains. the [oi] 63um and [cii] 158um emissions are tooweak relative to [oi] 146um to be accounted for by standard pdr models. wepropose a simple model, in which overlapping pdr clouds along the line of sightabsorb the [oi] 63um and [cii] 158um emissions, and show that the proposedmodel reproduces the observed line intensities fairly well. in the sigma scoregion, we have detected 3 fine-structure lines, [oi] 63um, [nii] 122um, and[cii] 158um, and derived that 30-80% of the [cii] emission comes from theionized gas. the upper limit of the [siii] 35um is compatible with the solarabundance relative to nitrogen and no useful constraint on the gaseous si isobtained for the sigma sco region.

astro-ph;0603163	far-ir detection limits ii: probing confusion including source confusion	we present a comprehensive analysis for the determination of the confusionlevels for the current and the next generation of far-infrared surveys assumingthree different cosmological evolutionary scenarios. we include an extensivemodel for diffuse emission from infrared cirrus in order to derive absolutesensitivity levels taking into account the source confusion noise due to pointsources, the sky confusion noise due to the diffuse emission, and instrumentalnoise. we use our derived sensitivities to suggest best survey strategies forthe current and the future far-infrared space missions spitzer, akari(astro-f), herschel, and spica. we discuss whether the theoretical estimatesare realistic and the competing necessities of reliability and completeness. wefind the best estimator for the representation of the source confusion andproduce predictions for the source confusion using far-infrared source countmodels. from these confusion limits considering both source and sky confusions,we obtain the optimal, confusion limited redshift distribution for eachmission. finally, we predict the cosmic far-infrared background (cfirb) whichincludes information about the number and distribution of the contributingsources.

astro-ph;0605589	deep extragalactic surveys around the ecliptic poles with akari  (astro-f)	akari (formerly astro-f) is an infrared space telescope designed for anall-sky survey at 10-180 (mu)m, and deep pointed surveys of selected areas at2-180 (mu)m. the deep pointed surveys with akari will significantly advance ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution, the structure formation of the universe, thenature of the buried agns, and the cosmic infrared background. here we describethe important characteristics of the akari mission: the orbit, and the attitudecontrol system, and investigate the optimum survey area based on the updatedpre-flight sensitivities of akari, taking into account the cirrus confusionnoise as well as the surface density of bright stars. the north ecliptic pole(nep) is concluded to be the best area for 2-26 (mu)m deep surveys, while thelow-cirrus noise regions around the south ecliptic pole (sep) are worthconsidering for 50-180 (mu)m pointed surveys to high sensitivities limited bythe galaxy confusion noise. current observational plans of these pointedsurveys are described in detail. comparing these surveys with the deep surveyswith the spitzer space telescope, the akari deep surveys are particularlyunique in respect of their continuous wavelength coverage over the 2-26 (mu)mrange in broad-band deep imaging, and their slitless spectroscopy mode over thesame wavelength range.

0809.2090	suzaku observations of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we report the results from our analysis of {\it suzaku} xis (0.5-10 kev) andhxd/pin (15-40 kev) observations of five well-known local ulirgs: {\em iras}f05189-2524, {\em iras} f08572+3915, mrk 273, pks 1345+12, and arp 220. the xisobservations of f05189-2524 and mrk 273 reveal strong iron lines consistentwith fe k$\alpha$ and changes in spectral shapes with respect to previous {\itchandra} and {\it xmm-newton} observations. mrk 273 is also detected by thehxd/pin at $\sim$1.8-$\sigma$. for f05189-2524, modeling of the data from thedifferent epochs suggests that the change in spectral shape is likely due tothe central source switching off, leaving behind a residual reflectionspectrum, or an increase in the absorbing column. an increase in the coveringfraction of the absorber can describe the spectral variations seen in mrk 273,although a reduction in the intrinsic agn luminosity cannot be formally ruledout. the {\it suzaku} spectra of mrk 273 are well fit by a ~94% coveringfraction model with a column density of $\sim10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. theabsorption-corrected log[$l_{\rm 2-10 kev}$ / $l_{\rm ir}$] ratio is consistentwith those found in pg quasars. the 0.5-10 kev spectrum of pks 1345+12 and arp220 seem unchanged from previous observations and their hard x-ray emission isnot convincingly detected by the hxd/pin. the large column density derived fromco observations and the large equivalent width of an ionized fe line in arp 220can be reconciled by an ionized reflection model. f08572+3915 is undetected inboth the xis and hxd/pin, but the analysis of unpublished {\em chandra} dataprovides a new measurement at low energies.

astro-ph;0702136	a spitzer irs low-resolution spectroscopic search for buried agns in  nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies - a constraint on geometry between  energy sources and dust -	we present the results of spitzer irs low-resolution infrared 5-35 micronspectroscopy of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z &lt; 0.15. wefocus on the search for the signatures of buried active galactic nuclei (agns)in the complete sample of ulirgs classified optically as non-seyferts (linersor hii-regions). in addition to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emissionfeatures at 6.2 micron, 7.7 micron, and 11.3 micron, the conventional tool ofstarburst-agn separation, we use the optical depths of the 9.7 micron and 18micron silicate dust absorption features to infer the geometry of energysources and dust at the nuclei of these ulirgs, namely, whether the energysources are spatially well mixed with dust(a normal starburst) or are morecentrally concentrated than the dust (a buried agn). infrared spectra of atleast 30%, and possibly 50%, of the observed optical non-seyfert ulirgs arenaturally explained by emission consisting of (1) energetically insignificant,modestly obscured (av &lt; 20-30 mag) pah-emitting normal starbursts, and (2)energetically dominant, highly dust-obscured, centrally concentrated energysources with no pah emission. we interpret the latter component as a buriedagn. the fraction of ulirgs showing some buried agn signatures is higher inliner ulirgs than in hii-region ulirgs. most of the luminous buried agncandidates are found in ulirgs with cool far-infrared colors. where theabsorption-corrected intrinsic agn luminosities are derivable with littleuncertainty, they are found to be of the order of 10^12lsun, accounting for thebulk of the ulirgs' luminosities. the 5-35 micron spectroscopic starburst/agnclassifications are generally consistent with our previous classificationsbased on 3-4 micron spectra for the same sample.

astro-ph;9510002	deficit of far-infrared [cii] line emission toward the galactic center	we have observed the [cii] 158 micron line emission from the galactic plane(-10 deg &lt; l &lt; 25 deg, |b| &lt;= 3 deg) with the balloon-borne infrared carbonexplorer (bice). the observed longitudinal distribution of the [cii] lineemission is clearly different from that of the far-infrared continuum emission;the galactic center is not the dominant peak in the [cii] emission. indeed, theratio of the [cii] line emission to far-infrared continuum (i_[cii] / i_fir) issystematically low within the central several hundred parsecs of the galaxy.the observational results indicate that the abundance of the c+ ions themselvesis low in the galactic center. we attribute this low abundance mainly to softuv radiation with fewer c-ionizing photons. this soft radiation field, togetherwith the pervasively high molecular gas density, makes the molecularself-shielding more effective in the galactic center. the self-shieldingfurther reduces the abundance of c+ ions, and raises the temperature ofmolecular gas at the c+/c/co transition zone.

astro-ph;9712333	far-infrared [c ii] line survey observations of the galactic plane	we present results of our survey observations of the [c ii] 158 micron lineemission from the galactic plane using the balloon-borne infrared carbonexplorer (bice). our survey covers a wide area (350 deg &lt; l &lt; 25 deg, |b| &lt; 3deg) with a spatial resolution of 15'. we employed a new observing methodcalled the ``fast spectral scanning'' to make large-scale observationsefficiently.  strong [c ii] line emission was detected from almost all areas we observed.in the general galactic plane, the spatial distribution of the [c ii] lineemission correlates very well with that of far-infrared continuum emission, butdiffuse components are more prominent in the [c ii] line emission; thei_[cii]/i_fir ratio is ~0.6 % for diffuse components but is ~0.2 % for compactsources such as active star-forming regions. in the galactic center region, onthe other hand, the distribution of the [c ii] line emission is quite differentfrom that of the far-infrared continuum emission, and the i_[cii]/i_fir ratiois systematically lower there.  the fwhm velocity resolution of our instrument is 175 km/s, but we determinedthe central velocity of the line at each observed point very precisely withstatistical errors as small as +- 6 km/s. the longitudinal distribution of thecentral velocity clearly shows the differential rotation pattern of thegalactic disk and also violent velocity fields around the galactic center.
