0901.1138	the acs fornax cluster survey. v. measurement and recalibration of  surface brightness fluctuations and a precise value of the fornax--virgo  relative distance	we present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster imaged withhst/acs. these are combined with measurements for virgo cluster galaxies toderive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band sbf absolute magnitude asa function of g-z. in all, we tabulate recalibrated sbf distances for 134galaxies in virgo, fornax, the virgo w' group, and ngc4697 in the virgosouthern extension. the calibration procedure yields a precise relativedistance modulus for fornax with respect to virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or adistance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. the resulting fornax distance modulus is 31.51+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 mpc, where the second set of error barsreflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed virgo distance of 16.5 mpc.the rms distance scatter for the early-type fornax galaxies is0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.this translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or "cosmic",scatter sigma_cosmic in the sbf calibration, unlike in virgo. as a result, weare able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic&lt;0.08 mag, atleast for galaxies with g-z&gt;1.02. we also present an alternative sbfcalibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter nbar, a proxy for galaxymass, which gives a consistent relative distance. finally, we find no evidencefor systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,no current infall); the fornax cluster appears both compact and wellvirialized.[abridged]

0907.2524	the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor globular clusters in m87:  confirmation from deep hst/acs imaging	metal-poor globular clusters (gcs) are our local link to the earliest epochsof star formation and galaxy building. studies of extragalactic gc systemsusing deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope tothe color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs in a number of galaxies. wepresent a study of the m87 gc system using deep, archival hst/acs imaging withthe f606w and f814w filters, in which we find a significant color-magnituderelation for the metal-poor gcs. the slope of this relation in the i vs. v-icolor-magnitude diagram ($\gamma_i=-0.024\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistentwith expectations based on previously published results using data from the acsvirgo cluster survey. the relation is driven by the most luminous gcs, thosewith $m_i&lt;-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor gcsbrighter than $m_i=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fittedgaussian mean for the luminosity function (lf) of blue, metal-poor gcs (~0.8mag fainter than the mean for all gcs). these results indicate that there is amass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenariowhere self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. we show thatpreviously measured half-light radii of m87 gcs from best-fit psf-convolvedking models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study,and we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs is realand cannot be an artifact of the photometry. we fit gaussian and evolvedschechter functions to the luminosity distribution of gcs across all colors, aswell as divided into blue and red subpopulations, finding that the blue gcshave a brighter mean luminosity and a narrower distribution than the red gcs.finally, we present a catalog of astrometry and photometry for 2250 m87 gcs.

1003.3450	the acs fornax cluster survey vii. half-light radii of globular clusters  in early-type galaxies	we measure the half-light radii of globular clusters (gcs) in 43 galaxiesfrom the acs fornax cluster survey (acsfcs). we use these data to extendprevious work in which the environmental dependencies of the half-light radiiof gcs in early type galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey (acsvcs) werestudied, and a corrected mean half-light radius (corrected for the observedenvironmental trends) was suggested as a reliable distance indicator. this workboth increases the sample size for the study of the environmental dependencies,and adds leverage to the study of the corrected half-light radius as a possibledistance indicator (since fornax lies at a larger distance than the virgocluster). we study the environmental dependencies of the size of gcs using botha principal component analysis as well as 2d scaling relations. we largelyconfirm the environmental dependencies shown in jordan et al. (2005), but findevidence that there is a residual correlation in the mean half-light radius ofgc systems with galaxy magnitude, and subtle differences in the othercorrelations - so there may not be a universal correction for the half-lightradii of lower luminosity galaxy gc systems. the main factor determining thesize of a gc in an early type galaxy is the gc color. red gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; =2.8+/-0.3 pc, while blue gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; = 3.4+/-0.3 pc. we show that for brightearly-type galaxies (m_b &lt; -19 mag), the uncorrected mean half-light radius ofthe gc system is by itself an excellent distance indicator (with error ~11%),having the potential to reach cosmologically interesting distances in the eraof high angular resolution adaptive optics on large optical telescopes.

1004.2883	the acs fornax cluster survey. viii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in virgo and fornax early-type galaxies and its use as a distance  indicator	we use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globularcluster luminosity function (gclf). the globular cluster system of each galaxywas studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic gclfafter accounting for contamination and completeness effects. the resultspresented here update our virgo measurements and confirm our previous resultsshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the gclf and the absolutemagnitude of the parent galaxy. regarding the use of the gclf as a standardcandle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the virgo andfornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distanceestimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived fromsurface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. fromnumerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the valueof the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsicdispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for virgo and fornaxrespectively. all in all, our study shows that the gclf properties varysystematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy betweengiant and dwarf early-type galaxies. these properties may be influenced by thecluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.

0708.1196	the black hole mass of ngc 4151: comparison of reverberation mapping and  stellar dynamical measurements	we present a stellar dynamical estimate of the black hole (bh) mass in theseyfert 1 galaxy, ngc 4151. we analyze ground-based spectroscopy as well asimaging data from the ground and space, and we construct 3-integralaxisymmetric models in order to constrain the bh mass and mass-to-light ratio.the dynamical models depend on the assumed inclination of the kinematicsymmetry axis of the stellar bulge. in the case where the bulge is assumed tobe viewed edge-on, the kinematical data give only an upper limit to the mass ofthe bh of ~4e7 m_sun (1 sigma). if the bulge kinematic axis is assumed to havethe same inclination as the symmetry axis of the large-scale galaxy disk (i.e.,23 degrees relative to the line of sight), a best-fit dynamical mass between4-5e7 m_sun is obtained. however, because of the poor quality of the fit whenthe bulge is assumed to be inclined (as determined by the noisiness of thechi^2 surface and its minimum value), and because we lack spectroscopic datathat clearly resolves the bh sphere of influence, we consider our measurementsto be tentative estimates of the dynamical bh mass. with this preliminaryresult, ngc 4151 is now among the small sample of galaxies in which the bh masshas been constrained from two independent techniques, and the mass values wefind for both bulge inclinations are in reasonable agreement with the recentestimate from reverberation mapping (4.57[+0.57/-0.47]e7 m_sun) published bybentz et al.

0708.1427	infrared emission from the nearby cool core cluster abell 2597	we observed the brightest central galaxy (bcg) in the nearby (z=0.0821) coolcore galaxy cluster abell 2597 with the irac and mips instruments on board thespitzer space telescope. the bcg was clearly detected in all spitzerbandpasses, including the 70 and 160 micron wavebands. we report aperturephotometry of the bcg. the spectral energy distribution exhibits a clear excessin the fir over a rayleigh-jeans stellar tail, indicating a star formation rateof ~4-5 solar masses per year, consistent with the estimates from the uv andits h-alpha luminosity. this large fir luminosity is consistent with that of astarburst or a luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), but together with a verymassive and old population of stars that dominate the energy output of thegalaxy. if the dust is at one temperature, the ratio of 70 to 160 micron fluxesindicate that the dust emitting mid-ir in this source is somewhat hotter thanthe dust emitting mid-ir in two bcgs at higher-redshift (z~0.2-0.3) and higherfir luminosities observed earlier by spitzer, in clusters abell 1835 and zwicky3146.

1009.3270	surface brightness fluctuations in the hubble space telescope acs/wfc  f814w bandpass and an update on galaxy distances	we measure surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) magnitudes in the f814wfilter and g-i colors for nine bright early-type fornax cluster galaxies imagedwith the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs). the goal isto achieve the first systematic sbf calibration for the acs/f814w bandpass.because of its much higher throughput, f814w is more efficient for sbf studiesof distant galaxies than the acs/f850lp bandpass that has been used to studynearby systems. over the color range spanned by the sample galaxies,1.06&lt;g-i&lt;1.32 (ab mag), the dependence of sbf magnitude mbar_i on g-i is linearto a good approximation, with slope $\sim2$. when the f850lp sbf distancemeasurements from the acs fornax cluster survey are used to derive absolutembar_i magnitudes, the dependence on g-i becomes extremely tight, with a slopeof $1.8\pm0.2$ and scatter of 0.03 mag. the small observed scatter indicatesboth that the estimated random errors are correct, and that the intrinsicdeviations from the sbf-color relation are strongly correlated between thef814w and f850lp bandpasses, as expected. the agreement with predictions fromstellar population models is good, both in slope and zero point, indicatingthat our mean fornax distance of 20 mpc is accurate. the models predictcurvature in the relation beyond the color limits of our sample; thus, thelinear calibration should not be extrapolated naively. in the appendices, wereconsider the tonry ground-based and jensen nicmos sbf distance catalogues; weprovide a correction formula to ameliorate the small apparent bias in theformer, and the offset needed to make the latter consistent with other sbfstudies. we also tabulate two new sbf distances to galaxies observed in the acsvirgo cluster survey.

1011.4295	discovery of nuclear x-ray sources in sings galaxies	we present the results of a search for nuclear x-ray activity in nearbygalaxies using chandra archival data in a sample of 62 galaxies from thespitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey (sings). we detect 37 nuclear x-raysources; seven of these are new detections. most of the nuclear x-ray sourcesare likely to be agns. the fraction of galaxies hosting agns is thus about 60%,much higher than that found with optical searches, and demonstrates theefficacy of x-ray observations to find hidden agns in optically normalgalaxies. we find that the nuclear x-ray sources are preferentially present inearlier type galaxies. unlike what is observed at high redshift, we do not finda strong correlation between the agn luminosity and the 24 micron luminosity ofthe host galaxy; we find a strong correlation with the 3.6 micron luminosityinstead. this suggests that at the present epoch the accretion rate depends onthe total mass of the galaxy, as perhaps does the black hole mass.

1012.0306	the acs fornax cluster survey. iv. deprojection of the surface  brightness profiles of early-type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters:  investigating the "core/power-law dichotomy"	although early observations with the hubble space telescope (hst) pointed toa sharp dichotomy among early-type galaxies in terms of the logarithmic slopegamma' of their central surface brightness profiles, several studies in thepast few years have called this finding into question. in particular, recentimaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the virgo and fornaxclusters using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on board hst have notfound a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from centralluminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of thebest-fitting global sersic model. given that earlier studies also found thatthe dichotomy persisted when analyzing the deprojected density profile slopes,we investigate the distribution of the three-dimensional luminosity densityprofiles of the acs virgo and fornax cluster survey galaxies. having fitted thesurface brightness profiles with modified sersic models, we then deproject thegalaxies using an abel integral and measure the inner slopes gamma_3d of theresulting luminosity density profiles at various fractions of the effectiveradius r_e. we find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuousvariation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.we introduce a parameter, delta_3d, that measures the central deviation of thedeprojected luminosity profiles from the global sersic fit, showing that thisparameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.

1012.2634	the acs fornax cluster survey. x. color gradients of globular cluster  systems in early-type galaxies	we use the largest homogeneous sample of globular clusters (gcs), drawn fromthe acsvcs and acsfcs, to investigate the color gradients of gc systems in 76early-type galaxies. we find that most gc systems possess an obvious negativegradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). for gc systems displaying colorbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor gc subpopulations present shallowerbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these twosubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. the fov of acs mainly restrictsus to measuring the inner gradients of gc systems. these gradients, however,can introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of gcsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. inferred correctionsto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the meancolor of metal-poor gcs and their host galaxy luminosity. the gc colorgradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens areweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarfgalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar massof m_stellar~10^10m_sun. we also measure color gradients for field stars in thehost galaxies. we find that gc color gradients are systematically steeper thanfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is thesame for both. if gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse andweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner gcsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidlywith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. the lack ofstrong gradients in the gc systems of dwarfs, which probably have notexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos wereinefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of gc formation.

1201.1031	optical and ir photometry of globular clusters in ngc1399: evidence for  color-metallicity nonlinearity	we combine new wide field camera~3 ir channel (wfc3/ir) f160w (h) imagingdata for ngc1399, the central galaxy in the fornax cluster, with archival f475w(g), f606w (v), f814w (i), and f850lp (z) optical data from the advanced camerafor surveys (acs). the purely optical g-i, v-i, and g-z colors of ngc1399'srich globular cluster (gc) system exhibit clear bimodality, at least formagnitudes $i_814 &gt; 21.5$. the optical-ir i-h color distribution appearsunimodal, and this impression is confirmed by mixture modeling analysis. thev-h colors show marginal evidence for bimodality, consistent with bimodality inv-i and unimodality in i-h. if bimodality is imposed for i-h with a doublegaussian model, the preferred blue/red split differs from that for opticalcolors; these "differing bimodalities" mean that the optical and optical-ircolors cannot both be linearly proportional to metallicity. consistent with thediffering color distributions, the dependence of i-h on g-i for the matched gcsample is significantly nonlinear, with an inflection point near the trough inthe g-i color distribution; the result is similar for the i-h dependence on g-zcolors taken from the acs fornax cluster survey. these g-z colors have beencalibrated empirically against metallicity; applying this calibration yields acontinuous, skewed, but single-peaked metallicity distribution. taken together,these results indicate that nonlinear color-metallicity relations play animportant role in shaping the observed bimodal distributions of optical colorsin extragalactic gc systems.

0711.1358	the acs fornax cluster survey. ii. the central brightness profiles of  early-type galaxies: a characteristic radius on nuclear scales and the  transition from central luminosity deficit to excess	we analyse hst surface brightness profiles for 143 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters. sersic models provide accurate descriptions of theglobal profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviatesystematically inside a characteristic "break" radius of r_b ~ 0.02r_e wherer_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. the sense of the deviation is suchthat bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -20) typically show central light deficits withrespect to the inward extrapolation of the sersic model, while the greatmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 &lt; m_b &lt; -15) showcentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediateluminosities (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.5) are usually well fitted by sersic models overall radii. the slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measuredat fixed fractions of r_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity ina manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. we showthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of thegalaxy selection function used in that study. to provide a more robustcharacterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameterthat describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inwardextrapolation of the outer sersic model. we find that this parameter variessmoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the virgo andfornax sample galaxies, with no evidence for a dichotomy. we argue that thecentral light excesses (nuclei) in m_b &gt; -19 galaxies may be the analogs of thedense central cores that are predicted by some numerical simulations to formvia gas inflows.

1208.0338	the acs fornax cluster survey. vi. the nuclei of early-type galaxies in  the fornax cluster	the advanced camera for surveys (acs) fornax cluster survey is a hubble spacetelescope program to image 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster, usingthe f475w and f850lp bandpasses of the acs. we employ both 1d and 2d techniquesto characterize the properties of the stellar nuclei in these galaxies, definedas the central "luminosity excesses" relative to a sersic model fitted to theunderlying host. we find 72+/-13% of our sample (31 galaxies) to be nucleated,with only three of the nuclei offset by more than 0.5" from their galaxyphotocenter, and with the majority of nuclei having colors bluer than theirhosts. the nuclei are observed to be larger, and brighter, than typical fornaxglobular clusters, and to follow different structural scaling relations. acomparison of our results to those from the acs virgo cluster survey revealsstriking similarities in the properties of the nuclei belonging to thesedifferent environments. we briefly review a variety of proposed formationmodels and conclude that, for the low-mass galaxies in our sample, the mostimportant mechanism for nucleus growth is probably infall of star clustersthrough dynamical friction, while for higher mass galaxies, gas accretiontriggered by mergers, accretions and tidal torques is likely to dominate, withthe relative importance of these two processes varying smoothly as a functionof galaxy mass. some intermediate-mass galaxies in our sample show a complexityin their inner structure that may be the signature of "hybrid nuclei" thatarose through parallel formation channels.

1303.1210	the complex nature of the nuclear star cluster in fcc 277	recent observations have shown that compact nuclear star clusters (nscs) arepresent in up to 80% of galaxies. however, detailed studies of their dynamicaland chemical properties are confined mainly to spiral galaxy hosts, where theyare more easily observed. in this paper we present our study of the nsc in fcc277, a nucleated elliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster. we use a combinationof adaptive optics assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopy, hubblespace telescope imaging, and literature long slit data. we show that while thensc does not appear to rotate within our detection limit of ~6 km/s, rotationis detected at larger radii, where the isophotes appear to be disky, suggestingthe presence of a nuclear disk. we also observe a distinct central velocitydispersion drop that is indicative of a dynamically cold rotating sub-system.following the results of orbit-based dynamical modelling, co-rotating as wellas counter-rotating stellar orbits are simultaneously needed to reproduce theobserved kinematics. we find evidence for varying stellar populations, with thensc and nuclear disk hosting younger and more metal rich stars than the mainbody of the galaxy. we argue that gas dissipation and some level of merginghave likely played an important role in the formation of the nucleus of thisintermediate-mass galaxy. this is in contrast to nscs in low-mass early- typegalaxies, which may have been formed primarily through the infall of starclusters.

1304.0824	the acs virgo cluster survey. xvii. the spatial alignment of globular  cluster systems with early-type host galaxies	we study the azimuthal distribution of globular clusters (gcs) in early-typegalaxies and compare them to their host galaxies using data from the acs virgocluster survey. we find that in host galaxies with visible elongation (epsilon&gt; 0.2) and intermediate to high luminosities (m_z&lt;-19), the gcs arepreferentially aligned along the major axis of the stellar light. the red(metal-rich) gc subpopulations show strong alignment with the major axis of thehost galaxy, which supports the notion that these gcs are associated withmetal-rich field stars. the metal-rich gcs in lenticular galaxies show signs ofbeing more strongly associated with disks rather than bulges. surprisingly, wefind that the blue (metal-poor) gcs can also show the same correlation. if themetal-poor gcs are part of the early formation of the halo and built up throughmergers, then our results support a picture where halo formation and mergingoccur anisotropically, and where the present day major axis is an indicator ofthe preferred merging axis.

0801.4382	low-level nuclear activity in nearby spiral galaxies	we are conducting a search for supermassive black holes (smbhs) with massesbelow 10^7 m_sun by looking for signs of extremely low-level nuclear activityin nearby galaxies that are not known to be agns. our survey has the followingcharacteristics: (a) x-ray selection using the chandra x-ray observatory, sincex-rays are a ubiquitous feature of agns; (b) emphasis on late-type spiral anddwarf galaxies, as the galaxies most likely to have low-mass smbhs; (c) use ofmultiwavelength data to verify the source is an agn; and (d) use of the highestangular resolution available for observations in x-rays and other bands, toseparate nuclear from off-nuclear sources and to minimize contamination by hostgalaxy light. here we show the feasibility of this technique to find agns byapplying it to six nearby, face-on spiral galaxies (ngc 3169, ngc 3184, ngc4102, ngc 4647, ngc 4713, ngc 5457) for which data already exist in the chandraarchive. all six show nuclear x-ray sources. the data as they exist at presentare ambiguous regarding the nature of the nuclear x-ray sources in ngc 4713 andngc 4647. we conclude, in accord with previous studies, that ngc 3169 and ngc4102 are almost certainly agns. most interestingly, a strong argument can bemade that ngc 3184 and ngc 5457, both of type scd, host agns.

1311.1530	supermassive black holes and their host galaxies - i. bulge luminosities  from dedicated near-infrared data	in an effort to secure, refine and supplement the relation between centralsupermassive black hole masses (mbh), and the bulge luminosities of their hostgalaxies, (lbul), we obtained deep, high spatial resolution k-band images of 35nearby galaxies with securely measured mbh, using the wide-field wircam imagerat the canada-france-hawaii-telescope (cfht). a dedicated data reduction andsky subtraction strategy was adopted to estimate the brightness and structureof the sky, a critical step when tracing the light distribution of extendedobjects in the near-infrared. from the final image product, bulge and totalmagnitudes were extracted via two-dimensional profile fitting. as a first orderapproximation, all galaxies were modeled using a simple sersic-bulge +exponential-disk decomposition. however, we found that such models did notadequately describe the structure that we observe in a large fraction of oursample galaxies which often include cores, bars, nuclei, inner disks, spiralarms, rings and envelopes. in such cases, we adopted profile modificationsand/or more complex models with additional components. the derived bulgemagnitudes are very sensitive to the details and number of components used inthe models, although total magnitudes remain almost unaffected. usually, butnot always, the luminosities and sizes of the bulges are overestimated when asimple bulge+disk decomposition is adopted in lieu of a more complex model.furthermore we found that some spheroids are not well fit when the ellipticityof the sersic model is held fixed. this paper presents the details of the imageprocessing and analysis, while in a companion paper we discuss howmodel-induced biases and systematics in bulge magnitudes impact the mbh-lbulrelation.

1311.1531	supermassive black holes and their host galaxies - ii. the correlation  with near-infrared luminosity revisited	we present an investigation of the scaling relations between supermassiveblack hole (smbh) masses (mbh), and their host galaxies' k-band bulge (lbul)and total (ltot) luminosities. the wide-field wircam imager at thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope (cfht) was used to obtain the deepest andhighest resolution near infrared images available for a sample of 35 galaxieswith securely measured mbh, selected irrespective of hubble type. for eachgalaxy, we derive bulge and total magnitudes using a two-dimensional imagedecomposition code that allows us to account, if necessary, for large- andsmall-scale disks, cores, bars, nuclei, rings, envelopes and spiral arms. wefind that the present-day mbh-lbul and mbh-ltot relations have consistentintrinsic scatter, suggesting that mbh correlates equally well with bulge andtotal luminosity of the host. our analysis provides only mild evidence of adecreased scatter if the fit is restricted to elliptical galaxies. thelog-slopes of the mbh-lbul and mbh-ltot relations are 0.75+/-0.10 and0.92+/-0.14, respectively. however, while the slope of the mbh-lbul relationdepends on the detail of the image decomposition, the characterization ofmbh-ltot does not. given the difficulties and ambiguities of decomposing galaxyimages into separate components, our results indicate that ltot is moresuitable as a tracer of smbh mass than lbul, and that the mbh-ltot relationshould be used when studying the co-evolution of smbhs and galaxies.

0803.0330	the acs virgo cluster survey xv. the formation efficiencies of globular  clusters in early-type galaxies: the effects of mass and environment	the fraction of stellar mass contained in globular clusters (gcs), alsomeasured by number as the specific frequency, is a fundamental quantity thatreflects both a galaxy's early star formation and its entire merging history.we present specific frequencies, luminosities, and mass fractions for theglobular cluster systems of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey, the largest homogeneous catalog of its kind. we find that 1) gc massfractions can be high in both giants and dwarfs, but are universally low ingalaxies with intermediate luminosities. 2) the behavior of specific frequencyacross galaxy mass is dominated by the blue gcs. 3) the gc fractions oflow-mass galaxies exhibit a dependence on environment. nearly all dwarfgalaxies with high gc fractions are within 1 mpc of the cd galaxy m87,presenting the first strong evidence that gc formation in dwarfs is biasedtoward dense environments. 4) gc formation in central dwarfs is biased becausetheir stars form earliest and most intensely. comparisons to the millenniumsimulation show that central dwarfs have older stellar populations and formmore stars at higher star formation rates (sfrs) and sfr surface densities. thesfr surface density in simulated dwarfs peaks before the total sfr, naturallyproducing gc populations that are older and more metal-poor than the fieldstars. 5) dwarfs within ~40 kpc of the giant ellipticals m87 and m49 are redand have few or no gcs, suggesting that they have been tidally stripped andhave contributed their gcs to the halos of their giant neighbors. the centraldwarfs with high gc mass fractions are thus likely to be the survivors mostsimilar to the protogalaxies that assembled the rich m87 globular clustersystem.(abridged)

1405.4344	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics) iii. the ultraviolet  source catalogs	in this paper we introduce the deepest and most extensive ultravioletextragalactic source catalogs of the virgo cluster area to date. archival andtargeted galex imaging is compiled and combined to provide the deepest possiblecoverage over ~120 deg^2 in the nuv (lambda_eff=2316 angstroms) and ~40 deg^2in the fuv (lambda_eff=1539 angstroms) between 180 deg &lt;= r.a. &lt;= 195 deg and 0deg &lt;= decl. &lt;= 20 deg. we measure the integrated photometry of 1770 extendeduv sources of all galaxy types and use galex pipeline photometry for 1,230,855point-like sources in the foreground, within, and behind the cluster. extendedsource magnitudes are reliable to m_uv ~22, showing ~0.01 sigma difference fromtheir asymptotic magnitudes. point-like source magnitudes have a 1 sigmastandard deviation within ~0.2 mag down to m_uv ~23. the point-like sourcecatalog is cross-matched with large optical databases and surveys including thesdss dr9 (&gt; 1 million virgo cluster sources), the next generation virgo clustersurvey (ngvs; &gt;13 million virgo cluster sources), and the ned (~30,000 sourcesin the virgo cluster). we find 69% of the entire uv point-like source cataloghas a unique optical counterpart, 11% of which are stars and 129 are virgocluster members neither in the vcc nor part of the bright cgcg galaxy catalog(i.e., m_pg &lt; 14.5). these data are collected in four catalogs containing theuv extended sources, the uv point-like sources, and two catalogs eachcontaining the most relevant optical parameters of uv-optically matchedpoint-like sources for further studies from sdss and ngvs. the guvics catalogsprovide a unique set of data for future works on uv and multiwavelength studiesin the cluster and background environments.

1406.6735	the black hole mass of ngc 4151. ii. stellar dynamical measurement from  near-infrared integral field spectroscopy	we present a revised measurement of the mass of the central black hole (mbh)in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151. the new stellar dynamical mass measurement isderived by applying an axisymmetric orbit-superposition code to near-infraredintegral field data obtained using adaptive optics with the gemini nifsspectrograph. when our models attempt to fit both the nifs kinematics andadditional low spatial resolution kinematics, our results depend sensitively onhow chi-squared is computed--probably a consequence of complex bar kinematicsthat manifest immediately outside the nuclear region. the most robust resultsare obtained when only the high spatial resolution kinematic constraints in thenuclear region are included in the fit. our best estimates for the bh mass andh-band mass-to-light ratio are mbh~(3.76+/-1.15)e7 msun (1-sigma error) andm/l(h-band)~0.34+/-0.03 msun/lsun (3-sigma error), respectively (the quotederrors reflect the model uncertainties). our bh mass measurement is consistentwith estimates from both reverberation mapping (3.57[+0.45/-0.37]e7 msun) andgas kinematics (3.0[+0.75/-2.2]e7 msun; 1-sigma errors), and our best-fitmass-to-light ratio is consistent with the photometric estimate ofm/l(h-band)=0.4+/-0.2 msun/lsun. the nifs kinematics give a central bulgevelocity dispersion sigma_c=116+/-3 km/s, bringing this object slightly closerto the m-sigma relation for quiescent galaxies. although ngc 4151 is one ofonly a few seyfert 1 galaxies in which it is possible to obtain a directdynamical bh mass measurement--and thus, an independent calibration of thereverberation mapping mass scale--the complex bar kinematics makes it less thanideally suited for this purpose.

1407.2263	the next generation virgo cluster survey. v. modelling the dynamics of  m87 with the made-to-measure method	we study the dynamics of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 from the central tothe outermost regions with the made-to-measure (m2m) method. we use a newcatalogue of 922 globular cluster line-of- sight velocities extending to aprojected radius of 180 kpc (equivalent to 25 m87 effective radii), and sauronintegral field unit data within the central 2.4 kpc. 263 globular clusters,mainly located beyond 40 kpc, are newly observed by the next generation virgosurvey (ngvs). for the m2m modelling, the gravitational potential is taken as acombination of a luminous matter potential with a constant stellarmass-to-light ratio and a dark matter potential modelled as a logarithmicpotential. our best dynamical model returns a stellar mass-to-light ratio inthe i band of m/li = 6.0(+ -0.3) m_sun/l_sun with a dark matter potential scalevelocity of 591(+ -50) km/s and scale radius of 42(+ -10) kpc. we determine thetotal mass of m87 within 180 kpc to be (1.5 + - 0.2) 10^13 m_sun. the masswithin 40 kpc is smaller than previous estimates determined using globularcluster kinematics that did not extend beyond 45 kpc. with our new globularcluster velocities at much larger radii, we see that globular clusters around40 kpc show an anomalously large velocity dispersion which affected previousresults. the mass we derived is in good agreement with that inferred from rosatx-ray observation out to 180 kpc. within 30 kpc our mass is also consistentwith that inferred from chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations, while within120 kpc it is about 20% smaller. the model velocity dispersion anisotropy betaparameter for the globular clusters in m87 is small, varying from -0.2 at thecentre to 0.2 at 40 kpc, and gradually decreasing to zero at 120 kpc.

1408.2821	the next generation virgo cluster survey. viii. the spatial distribution  of globular clusters in the virgo cluster	we report on a large-scale study of the distribution of globular clusters(gcs) throughout the virgo cluster, based on photometry from the nextgeneration virgo cluster survey, a large imaging survey covering virgo'sprimary subclusters to their virial radii. using the g', (g'-i')color-magnitude diagram of unresolved and marginally-resolved sources, weconstructed 2-d maps of the gc distribution. we present the clearest evidenceto date showing the difference in concentration between red and blue gcs overthe extent of the cluster, where the red (metal-rich) gcs are largely locatedaround the massive early-type galaxies, whilst the blue (metal-poor) gcs have amore extended spatial distribution, with significant populations present beyond83' (215 kpc) along the major axes of m49 and m87. the gc distribution aroundm87 and m49 shows remarkable agreement with the shape, ellipticity and boxinessof the diffuse light surrounding both galaxies. we find evidence for spatialenhancements of gcs surrounding m87 that may be indicative of recentinteractions or an ongoing merger history. we compare the gc map to thelocations of virgo galaxies and the intracluster x-ray gas, and find goodagreement between these baryonic structures. the virgo cluster contains a totalpopulation of 67300$\pm$14400 gcs, of which 35% are located in m87 and m49alone. we compute a cluster-wide specific frequency s_n,cl=$2.8\pm0.7$,including virgo's diffuse light. the gc-to-baryonic mass fraction ise_b=$5.7\pm1.1\times10^{-4} $and the gc-to-total cluster mass formationefficiency is e_t=$2.9\pm0.5\times10^{-5}$, values slightly lower than, butconsistent with, those derived for individual galactic halos. our results showthat the production of the complex structures in the unrelaxed virgo clustercore (including the diffuse intracluster light) is an ongoingprocess.(abridged)

1504.03714	the next generation virgo cluster survey. xii. stellar populations and  kinematics of compact, low-mass early-type galaxies from gemini gmos-ifu  spectroscopy	we present gemini gmos-ifu data of eight compact low-mass early-type galaxies(etgs) in the virgo cluster. we analyse their stellar kinematics, stellarpopulation, and present two-dimensional maps of these properties covering thecentral 5"x 7" region. we find a large variety of kinematics: from non- tohighly-rotating objects, often associated with underlying disky isophotesrevealed by deep images from the next generation virgo cluster survey. in halfof our objects, we find a centrally-concentrated younger and more metal-richstellar population. we analyze the specific stellar angular momentum throughthe lambdar parameter and find six fast-rotators and two slow-rotators, onehaving a thin counter-rotating disk. we compare the local galaxy density andstellar populations of our objects with those of 39 more extended low-massvirgo etgs from the smakced survey and 260 massive ($m&gt;10^{10}$\msun) etgs fromthe a3d sample. the compact low-mass etgs in our sample are located in highdensity regions, often close to a massive galaxy and have, on average, olderand more metal-rich stellar populations than less compact low-mass galaxies. wefind that the stellar population parameters follow lines of constant velocitydispersion in the mass-size plane, smoothly extending the comparable trendsfound for massive etgs. our study supports a scenario where low-mass compactetgs have experienced long-lived interactions with their environment, includingram-pressure stripping and gravitational tidal forces, that may be responsiblefor their compact nature.

1505.05421	a gemini/gmos study of intermediate luminosity early-type virgo cluster  galaxies. i. globular cluster and stellar kinematics	we present a kinematic analysis of the globular cluster systems and diffusestellar light of four intermediate luminosity (sub-$l^{\ast}$) early-typegalaxies in the virgo cluster based on gemini/gmos data. our galaxy sample isfainter ($-23.8&lt;m_k&lt;-22.7$) than most previous studies, nearly doubling thenumber of galaxies in this magnitude range that now have gc kinematics. thedata for the diffuse light extends to $4r_e$, and the data for the globularclusters reaches 8--$12r_e$. we find that the kinematics in these outer regionsare all different despite the fact that these four galaxies have similarphotometric properties, and are uniformly classified as "fast rotators" fromtheir stellar kinematics within $1r_e$. the globular cluster systems exhibit awide range of kinematic morphology. the rotation axis and amplitude can changebetween the inner and outer regions, including a case of counter-rotation. thisdifference shows the importance of wide-field kinematic studies, and shows thatstellar and gc kinematics can change significantly as one moves beyond theinner regions of galaxies. moreover, the kinematics of the globular clustersystems can differ from that of the stars, suggesting that the formation of thetwo populations are also distinct.

1507.02270	galaxies at the extremes: ultra-diffuse galaxies in the virgo cluster	we report the discovery of three large (r29 &gt;~ 1 arcminute) extremely lowsurface brightness (mu_(v,0) ~ 27.0) galaxies identified using our deep,wide-field imaging of the virgo cluster from the burrell schmidt telescope.complementary data from the next generation virgo cluster survey do not resolvered giant branch stars in these objects down to i=24, yielding a lower distancelimit of 2.5 mpc. at the virgo distance, these objects have half-light radii3-10 kpc and luminosities l_v=2-9x10^7 lsun. these galaxies are comparable insize but lower in surface brightness than the large ultradiffuse lsb galaxiesrecently identified in the coma cluster, and are located well within virgo'svirial radius; two are projected directly on the cluster core. one objectappears to be a nucleated lsb in the process of being tidally stripped to forma new virgo ultracompact dwarf galaxy. the others show no sign of tidaldisruption, despite the fact that such objects should be most vulnerable totidal destruction in the cluster environment. the relative proximity of virgomakes these objects amenable to detailed studies of their structural propertiesand stellar populations. they thus provide an important new window onto theconnection between cluster environment and galaxy evolution at the extremes.

1507.02737	the next generation virgo cluster survey. ix. estimating the efficiency  of galaxy formation on the lowest-mass scales	the next generation virgo cluster survey has recently determined theluminosity function of galaxies in the core of the virgo cluster down tounprecedented magnitude and surface brightness limits. comparing simulations ofcluster formation to the derived central stellar mass function, we attempt toestimate the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio (shmr) for dwarf galaxies, as it wouldhave been before they fell into the cluster. this approach ignores severaldetails and complications, e.g., the contribution of ongoing star formation tothe present-day stellar mass of cluster members, and the effects of adiabaticcontraction and/or violent feedback on the subhalo and cluster potentials. thefinal results are startlingly simple, however; we find that the trends in theshmr determined previously for bright galaxies appear to extend down in ascale-invariant way to the faintest objects detected in the survey. theseresults extend measurements of the formation efficiency of field galaxies bytwo decades in halo mass, or five decades in stellar mass, down to some of theleast massive dwarf galaxies known, with stellar masses of $\sim 10^5 m_\odot$.

1508.07334	the next generation virgo cluster survey. x. properties of ultra-compact  dwarfs in the m87, m49 and m60 regions	we use imaging from the next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) topresent a comparative study of ultra-compact dwarf (ucd) galaxies associatedwith three prominent virgo sub-clusters: those centered on the massive,red-sequence galaxies m87, m49 and m60. we show how ucds can be selected withhigh completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location incolor-color diagrams ($u^*ik_s$ or $u^*gz$). although the central galaxies ineach of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellarmasses, we find large differences in the sizes of their ucd populations, withm87 containing ~3.5 and 7.8 times more ucds than m49 and m60, respectively. therelative abundance of ucds in the three regions scales in proportion tosub-cluster mass, as traced by x-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, numberof globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. we find that the ucds arepredominantly blue in color, with ~85% of the ucds having colors similar toblue gcs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. we present evidence that ucdssurrounding m87 and m49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by theprominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately mergingwith the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominencecorrelates with distance from either galaxy. our analysis provides evidencethat tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in theformation of ucds.

1508.07373	the most massive ultra-compact dwarf galaxy in the virgo cluster	we report on the properties of the most massive ultra-compact dwarf galaxy(ucd) in the nearby virgo cluster of galaxies using imaging from the nextgeneration virgo cluster survey (ngvs) and spectroscopy from keck/deimos. thisobject (m59-ucd3) appears to be associated with the massive virgo galaxy m59(ngc 4621), has an integrated velocity dispersion of 78 km/s, a dynamical massof $3.7\times10^8 m_\odot$, and an effective radius ($r_e$) of 25 pc. with aneffective surface mass density of $9.4\times10^{10} m_\odot/kpc^2$, it is thedensest galaxy in the local universe discovered to date, surpassing the densityof the luminous virgo ucd, m60-ucd1. m59-ucd3 has a total luminosity of$m_{g'}=-14.2$ mag, and a spectral energy distribution consistent with an old(14 gyr) stellar population with [fe/h]=0.0 and [$\alpha$/fe]=+0.2. we alsoexamine deep imaging around m59 and find a broad low surface brightness streampointing towards m59-ucd3, which may represent a tidal remnant of the ucdprogenitor. this ucd, along with similar objects like m60-ucd1 and m59co,likely represents an extreme population of tidally stripped galaxies more akinto larger and more massive compact early-type galaxies than to nuclear starclusters in present-day dwarf galaxies.

1509.02537	the sensitivity of harassment to orbit: mass loss from early-type dwarfs  in galaxy clusters	we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of the orbital dependence ofharassment on early-type dwarfs consisting of 168 different orbits within arealistic, virgo-like cluster, varying in eccentricity and pericentre distance.we find harassment is only effective at stripping stars or truncating theirstellar disks for orbits that enter deep into the cluster core. comparing tothe orbital distribution in cosmological simulations, we find that the majorityof the orbits (more than three quarters) result in no stellar mass loss. wealso study the effects on the radial profiles of the globular cluster systemsof early-type dwarfs. we find these are significantly altered only ifharassment is very strong. this suggests that perhaps most early-type dwarfs inclusters such as virgo have not suffered any tidal stripping of stars orglobular clusters due to harassment, as these components are safely embeddeddeep within their dark matter halo. we demonstrate that this result is actuallyconsistent with an earlier study of harassment of dwarf galaxies, despite theapparent contradiction. those few dwarf models that do suffer stellar strippingare found out to the virial radius of the cluster at redshift=0, which mixesthem in with less strongly harassed galaxies. however when placed onphase-space diagrams, strongly harassed galaxies are found offset to lowervelocities compared to weakly harassed galaxies. this remains true in acosmological simulation, even when halos have a wide range of masses andconcentrations. thus phase-space diagrams may be a useful tool for determiningthe relative likelihood that galaxies have been strongly or weakly harassed.

0806.0374	the nature of ucds: internal dynamics from an expanded sample and  homogeneous database	we have obtained high-resolution spectra of 23 ultra-compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) in the fornax cluster with -10.4&gt;m_v&gt;-13.5 mag (10^6&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8), usingflames/giraffe at the vlt. this is the largest homogeneous data set of ucdinternal dynamics assembled to date. we derive dynamical m/l ratios for 15 ucdscovered by hst imaging. in the m_v-sigma plane, ucds with m_v&lt;-12 mag areconsistent with the extrapolated faber-jackson relation for luminousellipticals, while fainter ucds are closer to the extrapolated globular cluster(gc) relation. at a given metallicity, fornax ucds have on average 30-40% lowerm/l ratios than virgo ucds, suggesting possible differences in age or darkmatter content between fornax and virgo ucds. for our sample of fornax ucds wefind no significant correlation between m/l ratio and mass. we combine our datawith available m/l ratio measurements of compact stellar systems with10^4&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8, and normalise all m/l estimates to solar metallicity. we findthat ucds (m &gt; 2*10^6 m_*) have m/l ratios twice as large as gcs (m &lt; 2*10^6m_*). we show that stellar population models tend to under-predict dynamicalm/l ratios of ucds and over-predict those of gcs. considering the scalingrelations of stellar spheroids, ucds align well along the 'fundamentalmanifold', constituting the small-scale end of the galaxy sequence. thealignment for ucds is especially clear for r_e &gt;~ 7 pc, which corresponds todynamical relaxation times that exceed a hubble time. in contrast, gcs exhibita broader scatter and do not appear to align along the manifold. we argue thatucds are the smallest dynamically un-relaxed stellar systems, with m &gt; 2*10^6m_* and 7&lt;r_e&lt;100 pc. future studies should aim at explaining the elevated m/lratios of ucds and the environmental dependence of their properties.

1512.00253	evidence for the rapid formation of low mass early-type galaxies in  dense environments	we explore the environmental dependence of star formation timescales in lowmass galaxies using the [$\alpha$/fe] abundance ratio as an evolutionary clock.we present integrated [$\alpha$/fe] measurements for 11 low mass ($m_\star \sim10^9~m_\odot$) early-type galaxies (etgs) with a large range of cluster-centricdistance in the virgo cluster. we find a gradient in [$\alpha$/fe], where thegalaxies closest to the cluster center (the cd galaxy, m87) have the highestvalues. this trend is driven by galaxies within a projected radius of 0.4~mpc(0.26 times the virial radius of virgo~a), all of which have super-solar[$\alpha$/fe]. galaxies in this mass range exhibit a large scatter in the[$\alpha$/fe]--$\sigma$ diagram, and do not obviously lie on an extension ofthe relation defined by massive etgs. in addition, we find a correlationbetween [$\alpha$/fe] and globular cluster specific frequency ($s_n$),suggesting that low-mass etgs that formed their stars over a short period oftime, were also efficient at forming massive star clusters. the innermostlow-mass etgs in our sample have [$\alpha$/fe] values comparable to that ofm87, implying that environment is the controlling factor for star formationtimescales in dense regions. these low-mass galaxies could be the survivingcounterparts of the objects that have already been accreted into the halo ofm87, and may be the link between present-day low-mass galaxies and the old,metal-poor, high-[$\alpha$/fe], high-$s_n$ stellar populations seen in theouter halos of massive etgs.

0806.3271	first stellar velocity dispersion measurement of a luminous quasar host  with gemini north laser guide star adaptive optics	we present the first use of the gemini north laser guide star adaptive optics(lgs ao) system and an integral field unit (ifu) to measure the stellarvelocity dispersion of the host of a luminous quasar. the quasar pg1426+015(z=0.086) was observed with the near-infrared integral field spectrometer(nifs) on the 8m gemini north telescope in the h-band as part of the scienceverification phase of the new altair lgs ao system. the nifs ifu and lgs ao arewell suited for host studies of luminous quasars because one can achieve alarge ratio of host to quasar light. we have measured the stellar velocitydispersion of pg1426+015 from 0.1'' to 1'' (0.16 kpc to 1.6 kpc) to be 217+/-15km/s based on high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of si i, mg i, andseveral co bandheads. this new measurement is a factor of four more precisethan a previous measurement obtained with long-slit spectroscopy and good,natural seeing, yet was obtained with a shorter net integration time. we findthat pg1426+015 has a velocity dispersion that places it significantly abovethe m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies and lower-luminosity active galacticnuclei with black hole masses estimated from reverberation mapping. we discussseveral possible explanations for this discrepancy that could be addressed withsimilar observations of a larger sample of luminous quasars.

astro-ph;0012377	a revised cepheid distance to ngc 4258 and a test of the distance scale	in a previous paper (maoz et al. 1999), we reported a hubble space telescope(hst) cepheid distance to the galaxy ngc 4258 obtained using the calibrationsand methods then standard for the key project on the extragalactic distancescale. here, we reevaluate the cepheid distance using the revised key projectprocedures described in freedman et al.

astro-ph;0203469	beyond the bulge: a fundamental relation between supermassive black  holes and dark matter halos	the possibility that the masses of supermassive black holes (sbhs) correlatewith the total gravitational mass of their host galaxy, or the mass of the darkmatter halo in which they presumably formed, is investigated using a sample of16 spiral and 20 elliptical galaxies. the bulge velocity dispersion, typicallydefined within an aperture of size less than 0.5 kpc, is found to correlatetightly with the galaxy's circular velocity, the latter measured at distancesfrom the galactic center at which the rotation curve is flat, 20 to 80kpc. byusing the well known m-sigma relation for sbhs, and a prescription to relatethe circular velocity to the mass of the dark matter halo in a standard cdmcosmology, the correlation between velocity dispersion and circular velocity isequivalent to one between sbh and halo masses. such a correlation is found tobe nonlinear, with the ratio between the two masses decreasing from 2x10^-4 forhalos of 10^14 solar masses, to 10^-5 for halos of 10^12 solar masses.preliminary evidence suggests that halos smaller than ~5x10^11 solar masses areincreasingly less efficient -- perhaps unable -- at forming sbhs.

astro-ph;0310006	hubble space telescope observations of novae in m49	a search for novae in m49 (ngc 4472) has been undertaken with the hubblespace telescope. a 55-day observing campaign in f555w (19 epochs) and f814w(five epochs) has led to the discovery of nine novae. we find that m49 may beunder-abundant in slow, faint novae relative to the milky way and m31. instead,the decline rates of the m49 novae are remarkably similar to those of novae inthe lmc. this fact argues against a simple classification of novae in "bulge"and "disk" sub-classes. we examine the maximum-magnitude versus rate of decline(mmrd) relation for novae in m49, finding only marginal agreement with thegalactic and m31 mmrd relations. a recalibration of the buscombe-de vaucouleursrelation gives an absolute magnitude 15 days past maximum of m_{v,15} =-6.36+/-0.19, which is substantially brighter than previous calibrations basedon galactic novae. monte carlo simulations yield a global nova rate for m49 of100{+35}{-30} per year, and a luminosity-specific nova rate in the range \nu_k= 1.7-2.5 per year per 10^{-10} l_k,solar. these rates are far lower than thosepredicted by current models of nova production in elliptical galaxies and maypoint to a relative scarity of novae progenitors, or an increased recurrencetimescale, in early-type environments.

astro-ph;0405188	the acs virgo cluster survey iii. chandra and hst observations of  low-mass x-ray binaries and globular clusters in m87	the acis instrument on board the chandra x-ray observatory has been used tocarry out the first systematic study of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in m87.we identify 174 x-ray point-sources, of which ~150 are likely lmxbs. this lmxbcatalog is combined with deep f475w and f850lp images taken with acs on hst toexamine the connection between lmxbs and globular clusters in m87. of the 1688globular clusters in our catalog, f_x = 3.6 +- 0.5% contain a lmxb and we findthat the metal-rich clusters are 3 +- 1 times more likely to harbor a lmxb thantheir metal-poor counterparts. in agreement with previous findings for othergalaxies, we find that brighter, more metal-rich clusters are more likely tocontain a lmxb. for the first time, however, we are able to demonstrate thatthe probability, p_x, that a given cluster will contain a lmxb dependssensitively on the dynamical properties of the host cluster. specifically, weuse the hst images to measure the half-light radius, concentration index andcentral density, \rho_0, for each globular, and define a parameter, \gamma,which is related to the tidal capture and binary-neutron star exchange rate.our preferred form for p_x is then p_x \propto \gamma \rho_0^{-0.42\pm0.11}(z/z_{\odot})^{0.33\pm0.1}. we argue that if the form of p_x is determined bydynamical processes, then the observed metallicity dependence is a consequenceof an increased number of neutron stars per unit mass in metal-rich globularclusters. finally, we find no compelling evidence for a break in the luminositydistribution of resolved x-ray point sources. instead, the lmxb luminosityfunction is well described by a power law with an upper cutoff at l_x ~ 10^39erg/s.

astro-ph;0501325	the acs virgo cluster survey iv: data reduction procedures for surface  brightness fluctuation measurements with the advanced camera for surveys	the advanced camera for surveys (acs) virgo cluster survey is a large programto image 100 early-type virgo galaxies using the f475w and f850lp bandpasses ofthe wide field channel of the acs instrument on the hubble space telescope(hst). the scientific goals of this survey include an exploration of thethree-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster and a critical examination ofthe usefulness of the globular cluster luminosity function as a distanceindicator. both of these issues require accurate distances for the full sampleof 100 program galaxies. in this paper, we describe our data reductionprocedures and examine the feasibility of accurate distance measurements usingthe method of surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) applied to the acs virgocluster survey f850lp imaging. the acs exhibits significant geometricaldistortions due to its off-axis location in the hst focal plane; correcting forthese distortions by resampling the pixel values onto an undistorted frameresults in pixel correlations that depend on the nature of the interpolationkernel used for the resampling. this poses a major challenge for the sbftechnique, which normally assumes a flat power spectrum for the noise. weinvestigate a number of different interpolation kernels and show through ananalysis of simulated galaxy images having realistic noise properties that itis possible, depending on the kernel, to measure sbf distances usingdistortion-corrected acs images without introducing significant additionalerror from the resampling. we conclude by showing examples of real image powerspectra from our survey.

astro-ph;0502493	the low end of the supermassive black hole mass function: constraining  the mass of a nuclear black hole in ngc 205 via stellar kinematics	hubble space telescope (hst) images and spectra of the nucleated dwarfelliptical galaxy ngc 205 are combined with 3-integral axisymmetric dynamicalmodels to constrain the mass (m_bh) of a putative nuclear black hole. this isonly the second attempt, after m33, to use resolved stellar kinematics tosearch for a nuclear black hole with mass below 10^6 solar masses. we areunable to identify a best-fit value of m_bh in ngc 205; however, the dataimpose a upper limit of 2.2x10^4 m_sun (1sigma confidence) and and upper limitof 3.8x10^4 m_sun (3sigma confidence). this upper limit is consistent with theextrapolation of the m_bh-sigma relation to the m_bh &lt; 10^6 m_sunregime. if weassume that ngc 205 and m33 both contain nuclear black holes, the upper limitson m_bh in the two galaxies imply a slope of ~5.5 or greater for the m_bh-sigmarelation. we use our 3-integral models to evaluate the relaxation time (t_r)and stellar collision time (t_coll) in ngc 205; t_r~10^8 yr or less in thenucleus and t_coll~10^11 yr. the low value of t_r is consistent with corecollapse having already occurred, but we are unable to draw conclusions fromnuclear morphology about the presence or absence of a massive black hole.

astro-ph;0503566	the acs virgo cluster survey. vii. resolving the connection between  globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	we investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultra-compactdwarf galaxies (ucds) by examining the properties of several compact objectsassociated with m87, all of which were previously classified as globularclusters. combining imaging from the hubble space telescope with ground-basedkeck spectroscopy, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocitydispersions and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictionsof population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately20pc, and have v-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. these objects,which we consider to be ucds, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticalgalaxies in virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities andcolors. these ucds are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations ofgalaxies more closely than those of galactic globular clusters. there appearsto be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of abouttwo million solar masses. if the ucds are gravitationally bound, then wesuggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental propertydistinguishing globular clusters from ucds. more than half of the ucdcandidates uncovered in the acs virgo cluster survey are associated with asingle galaxy -- m87 -- which suggests that proximity to the virgo center maybe of critical importance for the formation of these objects. these resultsshow that distinguishing bonafide ucds from bright globular clusters requires acareful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,particularly their mass-to-light ratios.

astro-ph;0506314	the acs virgo cluster survey v: sbf calibration for giant and dwarf  early-type galaxies	as part of the advanced camera for survey (acs) virgo cluster survey, we havemeasured surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 100 early-typevirgo galaxies. distances derived from these measurements are needed to explorethe three-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster, study the intrinsicparameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, andcompare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosityfunctions. our sbf measurements have been performed in the f850lp bandpass ofthe wide field channel of the acs on the hubble space telescope. these are thefirst measurements of this kind, and we present the first sbf calibration forthis bandpass. the measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar populationvariations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 andz_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the f475w and f850lp acsfilters. we derive the following calibration for the absolute sbf magnitudem_850: m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in therange 1.3 &lt;(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.6, and m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 &lt;=(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.3. physically,the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giantellipticals and s0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. forthe first time in sbf studies, we are able to provide a firm empiricalcalibration of sbf in early-type dwarf galaxies. our results agree with stellarpopulation model predictions from bruzual &amp; charlot (2003).

astro-ph;0509654	the acs virgo cluster survey ix: the color distributions of globular  cluster systems in early-type galaxies	we present the color distributions of globular cluster (gc) systems for 100virgo cluster early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. thecolor distributions of individual gc systems are consistent with continuoustrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. on average, almostall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor gcs, with the average fractionof metal-rich gcs ranging from 15 to 60%. the colors of both subpopulationscorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red gcs having asteeper slope. to convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary(g-z)-[fe/h] relation calibrated to galactic, m49 and m87 gcs. this relation isnonlinear with a steeper slope for [fe/h] &lt; -0.8. as a result, themetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich gcs vary similarly with respectto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [fe/h]_mp ~ l^0.16 ~m_star^0.17 and [fe/h]_mr ~ l^0.26 ~ m_star^0.22, respectively. although theserelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by windmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to themass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. theoffset between the two gc populations varies slowly (~ m_star^0.05) and isapproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting anearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the twopopulations of gcs. we also find that although the metal-rich gcs show a largerdispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor gcs* that have an equal or largerdispersion in metallicity. like the color-magnitude relation, these relationsderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formationand evolution of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0511251	the acs virgo cluster survey xi. the nature of diffuse star clusters in  early-type galaxies	we use hst/acs imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (dscs). compared toglobular clusters (gcs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities(m_v &gt; -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 &lt; r_h &lt; 30 pc), but they areprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can bemore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical gc (mu_g &gt; 20 mag arcsec^-2).the median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 &lt; g-z &lt; 1.6,which is redder than metal-rich gcs and often as red as the galaxy itself. mostdsc systems thus have mean ages older than 5 gyr or else have super-solarmetallicities. we find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significantexcess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (s0s), andfive visibly contain dust. we also find a substantial population of dscs in thehalo of the giant elliptical m49, associated with the companion galaxy vcc1199. most dsc systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light andassociated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do nothost substantial dsc populations. diffuse star clusters in our sample sharesimilar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that dscs preferentially form, survive, andcoevolve with galactic disks. their properties are broadly consistent withthose of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5magnitudes brighter than dscs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surfacebrightnesses. the closest galactic analogs to the dscs are the old openclusters. we suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in thedisk of the milky way, it would be very difficult to find.

astro-ph;0603840	a fundamental relation between compact stellar nuclei, supermassive  black holes, and their host galaxies	imaging surveys with the hubble space telescope (hst) have shown that roughly50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellarnucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. wecombine hst imaging for early-type galaxies from the acs virgo cluster surveywith ground-based long-slit spectra from kpno to show that the masses ofcompact stellar nuclei in virgo cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation withthe masses of the host galaxies. the same correlation is obeyed by thesupermassive black holes (sbhs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. thecompact stellar nuclei in the local group galaxies m33 and ngc205 are alsofound to fall along this same scaling relation. these results indicate that ageneric by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a central massiveobject (cmo) -- either a sbh or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains amean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. in galaxies with massesgreater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, sbhs appear to be the dominantmode of cmo formation.

astro-ph;0609371	trends in the globular cluster luminosity function of early-type  galaxies	we present results from a study of the globular cluster luminosity function(gclf) in a sample of 89 early-type galaxies observed as part of the acs virgocluster survey. using a gaussian parametrization of the gclf, we find a highlysignificant correlation between the gclf dispersion, sigma, and the galaxyluminosity, m_b, in the sense that the gc systems in fainter galaxies havenarrower luminosity functions. the gclf dispersions in the milky way and m31are fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation betweensigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions thatgclf shape is a function of galaxy hubble type. we show that the sigma - m_brelation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)cluster masses in fainter galaxies. we further show that this behavior ismirrored by a steepening of the gc mass function for relatively high masses, m&gt;~ 3 x 10^5 m_sun, a mass regime in which the shape of the gclf is not stronglyaffected by dynamical evolution over a hubble time. we argue that this trendarises from variations in initial conditions and requires explanation bytheories of cluster formation. finally, we confirm that in bright galaxies, thegclf "turns over" at the canonical mass scale of m_to ~ 2 x 10^5 m_sun.however, we find that m_to scatters to lower values (~1-2 x 10^5 m_sun) ingalaxies fainter than m_b &gt;~ -18.5, an important consideration if the gclf isto be used as a distance indicator for dwarf ellipticals.

astro-ph;0612139	the inner workings of early-type galaxies: cores, nuclei and  supermassive black holes (including a critical comparison of nuker and  core-sersic/sersic models)	recent years have seen dramatic progress in the study of the core and nuclearproperties of galaxies. the structure of the cores has been shown to varymethodically with global and nuclear properties, as cores respond to themechanisms by which galaxies form/evolve. the dynamical centers of galaxieshave been found capable of hosting two seemingly disparate objects:supermassive black holes (sbhs) and compact stellar nuclei. in a drasticdeparture from previous beliefs, it has been discovered that both structuresare common: galaxies lacking sbhs and/or stellar nuclei are the exception,rather than the norm. this review explores the connection between cores, sbhsand stellar nuclei in early-type galaxies, as revealed by the acs virgo clustersurvey. we find that, from parsec to kiloparsec scales, the surface brightnessprofiles of early-type galaxies are well described by a sersic model -- aparametrization that is shown to be preferable to the so called `nuker' model.relative to the inward extrapolation of the best fitting sersic model, theprofiles within the inner few tens of parsecs transition from luminosity`deficits', in the brightest (m_b &lt; ~-20) galaxies, to luminosity `excesses' inthe faintest. the compact stellar nuclei responsible for such luminosityexcesses comprise approximatively 0.2% of the total galactic mass. remarkably,this is the same fraction believed to reside in the sbhs, which arepredominantly found in the brightest galaxies showing luminosity deficits.

astro-ph;0702496	the acs virgo cluster survey. xii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in early type galaxies	we analyze the luminosity function of the globular clusters (gcs) belongingto the early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. we haveobtained estimates for a gaussian representation of the gc luminosity function(gclf) for 89 galaxies. we have also fit the gclfs with an "evolved schechterfunction", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-massgcs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initialschechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. we find asignificant trend of the gclf dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sensethat smaller galaxies have narrower gclfs. we show that this narrowing of thegclf in a gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the gc massfunction above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. weargue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the gc mass function is mostlikely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster massfunction. the gclf turnover mass m_to is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5m_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with m_b &gt;~ -18.we show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamicalfriction timescales in smaller galaxies. we probe the variation of the gclf toprojected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the virgo giants m49 and m87,finding that m_to is essentially constant over these spatial scales. our fitsof evolved schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (delta) overa hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10^5 &lt;~ (delta/m_sun) &lt; 10^6 per gc.we agree with previous suggestions that if the full gclf is to be understood inmore detail gclf models will have to include self-consistent treatments ofdynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials.

(1) assuming thisdistance for the fornax cluster as a whole yields a local hubble constant of 70+/-18_{random} [+/-7]_{systematic} km/s/mpc. (2) nine cepheid-based distancesto groups of galaxies out to and including the fornax and virgo clusters yieldho = 73 (+/-16)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/mpc. (3) recalibrating the i-band tully-fisherrelation using ngc 1365 and six nearby spiral galaxies, and applying it to 15galaxy clusters out to 100 mpc gives ho = 76 (+/-3)_r [+/-8]_s km/s/mpc. (4)using a broad-based set of differential cluster distance moduli ranging fromfornax to abell 2147 gives ho = 72 (+/-)_r [+/-6]_s km/s/mpc. and finally, (5)assuming the ngc 1365 distance for the two additional type ia supernovae infornax and adding them to the snia calibration (correcting for light curveshape) gives ho = 67 (+/-6)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/mpc out to a distance in excess of500 mpc. all five of these ho determinations agree to within their statisticalerrors. the resulting estimate of the hubble constant combining all thesedeterminations is ho = 72 (+/-5)_r [+/-12]_s km/s/mpc.

astro-ph;9908140	a cepheid distance to ngc 4258	distances measured using cepheid variable stars have been essential forestablishing the cosmological distance scale and the value of the hubbleconstant. these stars have remained the primary extragalactic distanceindicator since 1929 because of the small observed scatter in the relationshipbetween their pulsation period and luminosity, their large numbers, which allowmany independent measures of the distance to a galaxy, and the simplicity ofthe basic physics underlying their variability. potential systematicuncertainties in the use of the lmc-calibrated cepheid period-luminosityrelation to determine distances using hst are estimated to be 8-10%. here wedescribe the results of a search for cepheids in the nearby galaxy ngc 4258,which has an independently determined geometric distance of 7.2 +/- 0.5 mpc(herrnstein et al. 1999). we obtain a cepheid distance of 8.1 +/- 0.4(excluding possible systematic errors affecting all hst cepheid distances) mpc;there is a 1.3 sigma difference between the two measurements. if themaser-based distance is adopted and other hst cepheid distances are revisedaccording to our results, the derived value of the hubble constant would beincreased by 12 +/- 9%, and the corresponding age of the universe woulddecrease by the same factor.

astro-ph;9908192	the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale xxvi. the  calibration of population ii secondary distance indicators and the value of  the hubble constant	a cepheid-based calibration is derived for four distance indicators thatutilize stars in the old stellar populations: the tip of the red giant branch(trgb), the planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf), the globular clusterluminosity function (gclf) and the surface brightness fluctuation method (sbf).the calibration is largely based on the cepheid distances to 18 spiral galaxieswithin cz =1500 km/s obtained as part of the hst key project on theextragalactic distance scale, but relies also on cepheid distances fromseparate hst and ground-based efforts. the newly derived calibration of the sbfmethod is applied to obtain distances to four abell clusters in the velocityrange between 3800 and 5000 km/s, observed by lauer et al. (1998) using thehst/wfpc2. combined with cluster velocities corrected for a cosmological flowmodel, these distances imply a value of the hubble constant of h0 = 69 +/- 4(random) +/- 6 (systematic) km/s/mpc. this result assumes that the cepheid plrelation is independent of the metallicity of the variable stars; adopting ametallicity correction as in kennicutt et al. (1998), would produce a (5 +/-3)% decrease in h0. finally, the newly derived calibration allows us toinvestigate systematics in the cepheid, pnlf, sbf, gclf and trgb distancescales.
