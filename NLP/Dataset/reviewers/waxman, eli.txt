0706.2070	probing cp violation in neutrino oscillations with neutrino telescopes	measurements of flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrino fluxes are sensitiveto the two yet unknown mixing parameters $\theta_{13}$ and $\delta$ through thecombination $\sin\theta_{13}\cos\delta$. we extend previous studies byconsidering the possibility that neutrino fluxes from more than a single typeof sources will be measured. we point out that, if reactor experimentsestablish a lower bound on $\theta_{13}$, then neutrino telescopes mightestablish an upper bound on $|\cos\delta|$ that is smaller than one, and bythat prove that cp is violated in neutrino oscillations. such a measurementrequires several favorable ingredients to occur: (i) $\theta_{13}$ is not farbelow the present upper bound; (ii) the uncertainties in $\theta_{12}$ and$\theta_{23}$ are reduced by a factor of about two; (iii) neutrino fluxes frommuon-damped sources are identified, and their flavor ratios measured withaccuracy of order 10% or better. for the last condition to be achieved with theplanned km^3 detectors, the neutrino flux should be close to the waxman-bahcallbound. it motivates neutrino telescopes that are effectively about 10 timeslarger than icecube for energies of o(100 tev), even at the expense of a higherenergy threshold.

0902.4708	fast radiation mediated shocks and supernova shock breakouts	we present a simple analytic model for the structure of non-relativistic andrelativistic radiation mediated shocks. at shock velocities \beta_s\equivv_s/c\gtrsim 0.1, the shock transition region is far from thermal equilibrium,since the transition crossing time is too short for the production of ablack-body photon density (by bremsstrahlung emission). in this region,electrons and photons (and positrons) are in compton (pair) equilibrium attemperatures t_s significantly exceeding the far downstream temperature, t_s\ggt_d\approx 2(\varepsilon n_u \hbar^3c^3)^{1/4}. t_s\gtrsim 10 kev is reached atshock velocities \beta_s\approx 0.2. at higher velocities, \beta_s\gtrsim0.6,the plasma is dominated in the transition region by e^\pm pairs and 60kev\lesssim t_s \lesssim 200 kev. we argue that the spectrum emitted during thebreaking out of supernova shocks from the stellar envelopes (or the surroundingwinds) of blue super giants and wolf-rayet stars, which reach \beta_s&gt;0.1 forreasonable stellar parameters, may include a hard component with photonenergies reaching tens or even hundreds of kev. this may account for the x-rayoutburst associated with sn2008d, and possibly for other sn-associatedoutbursts with spectra not extending beyond few 100 kev (e.g.xrf060218/sn2006aj).

0903.2271	nonthermal emission from clusters of galaxies	we show that the spectral and radial distribution of the nonthermal emissionof massive, m&gt;10^{14.5}m_sun, galaxy clusters (gcs) may be approximatelydescribed by simple analytic expressions, which depend on the gc thermal x-rayproperties and on two model parameter, beta_{core} and eta_e. beta_{core} isthe ratio of cr energy density (within a logarithmic cr energy interval) andthe thermal energy density at the gc core, and eta_{e(p)} is the fraction ofthe thermal energy generated in strong collisionless shocks, which is depositedin cr electrons (protons). using a simple analytic model for the evolution oficm crs, which are produced by accretion shocks (primary crs), we find thatbeta_{core} ~ eta_{p}/200, nearly independent of gc mass and with a scatterdelta ln(beta_{core}) ~ 1 between gcs of given mass. we show that the hxr andgamma-ray luminosities produced by ic scattering of cmb photons by primaryelectrons exceed the luminosities produced by secondary particles (generated inhadronic interactions within the gc) by factors ~500(eta_e/eta_p)(t/10kev)^{-1/2} and ~150(eta_e/eta_p)(t/10 kev)^{-1/2} respectively, where t is thegc temperature. secondary particle emission may dominate at the radio and vhe(&gt; 1 tev) gamma-ray bands. our model predicts, in contrast with some earlierwork, that the hxr and gamma-ray emission from gcs are extended, since theemission is dominated at these energies by primary electrons. our predictionsare consistent with the observed nonthermal emission of the coma cluster foreta_peta_e ~ 0.1. the implications of our predictions to future hxrobservations (e.g. by nustar, simbol-x) and to (space/ground based) gamma-rayobservations (e.g. by fermi, hess, magic, veritas) are discussed. finally, weshow that our model's results agree with results of detailed numericalcalculations.

0903.2275	magnetic fields and cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies	we argue that the observed correlation between the radio luminosity and thex-ray luminosity in radio emitting galaxy clusters implies that the radioemission is due to secondary electrons that are produced by p-p interactionsand lose their energy by emitting synchrotron radiation in a strong magneticfield, b&gt;(8\pi a t_{cmb}^4)^{1/2}\simeq 3\mug. we construct a simple model thatnaturally explains the correlation, and show that the observations providestringent constraints on cluster magnetic fields and cosmic rays (crs): withinthe cores of clusters, the ratio beta_{core} between the cr energy (perlogarithmic particle energy interval) and the thermal energy is beta_{core}\sim2*10^{-4}; the source of these crs is most likely the cluster accretion shock,which is inferred to deposit in crs ~ 0.1 of the thermal energy it generates;the diffusion time of 100 gev crs over scales \gtrsim100 kpc is not shortcompared to the hubble time; cluster magnetic fields are enhanced by mergers to\gtrsim 1 % of equipartition, and decay (to &lt;1 mug) on 1 gyr time scales. theinferred value of beta_{core} implies that high energy gamma-ray emission fromsecondaries at cluster cores will be difficult to detect with existing andplanned instruments.

0706.3485	in which shell-type snrs should we look for gamma-rays and neutrinos  from p-p collisions?	we present a simple analytic model for the various contributions to thenon-thermal emission from shell type snrs, and show that this model's resultsreproduce well the results of previous detailed calculations. we show that the\geq 1 tev gamma ray emission from the shell type snrs rx j1713.7-3946 and rxj0852.0-4622 is dominated by inverse-compton scattering of cmb photons (andpossibly infra-red ambient photons) by accelerated electrons. pion decay (dueto proton-proton collisions) is shown to account for only a small fraction,\lesssim10^-2, of the observed flux, as assuming a larger fractionalcontribution would imply nonthermal radio and x-ray synchrotron emission andthermal x-ray bremsstrahlung emission that far exceed the observed radio andx-ray fluxes. models where pion decay dominates the \geq 1 tev flux avoid theimplied excessive synchrotron emission (but not the implied excessive thermalx-ray bremsstrahlung emission) by assuming an extremely low efficiency ofelectron acceleration, k_ep \lesssim 10^-4 (k_ep is the ratio of the number ofaccelerated electrons and the number of accelerated protons at a given energy).we argue that observations of snrs in nearby galaxies imply a lower limit ofk_ep \gtrsim 10^-3, and thus rule out k_ep values \lesssim 10^-4 (assuming thatsnrs share a common typical value of k_ep). it is suggested that snrs withstrong thermal x-ray emission, rather than strong non-thermal x-ray emission,are more suitable candidates for searches of gamma rays and neutrinos resultingfrom proton-proton collisions. in particular, it is shown that the neutrinoflux from the snrs above is probably too low to be detected by current andplanned neutrino observatories (abridged).

0907.1354	anisotropy vs chemical composition at ultra-high energies	this paper proposes and discusses a test of the chemical composition ofultra-high energy cosmic rays that relies on the anisotropy patterns measuredas a function of energy. in particular, we show that if one records ananisotropy signal produced by heavy nuclei of charge z above an energy e_{thr},one should record an even stronger (possibly much stronger) anisotropy atenergies &gt;e_{thr}/z due to the proton component that is expected to beassociated with the sources of the heavy nuclei. this conclusion remains robustwith respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does notdepend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. as a concreteexample, we apply this test to the most recent data of the pierre augerobservatory. assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55eev is not astatistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed atenergies &lt;10eev, we show that the apparent clustering toward cen a cannot beattributed to heavy nuclei. similar conclusions are drawn regarding theapparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei. we then discussa robust lower bound to the magnetic luminosity that a source must possess inorder to be able to accelerate particles of charge z up to 100eev,l_b&gt;10^{45}z^{-2}erg/s. using this bound in conjunction with the aboveconclusions, we argue that the current pao data does not support the model ofcosmic ray origin in active radio-quiet or even radio-loud galaxies. finally,we demonstrate that the apparent clustering in the direction of cen a can beexplained by the contribution of the last few gamma-ray bursts or magnetars inthe host galaxy thanks to the scattering of the cosmic rays on the magnetizedlobes.

0907.1686	what can we really learn from positron flux 'anomalies'?	we present a critical analysis of the observational constraints on, and ofthe theoretical modeling of, aspects of cosmic ray (cr) generation andpropagation in the galaxy, which are relevant for the interpretation of recentpositron and anti-proton measurements. we give simple, analytic, modelindependent expressions for the secondary pbar flux, and an upper limit for thesecondary e+ flux, obtained by neglecting e+ radiative losses, e+/(e+ +e-)&lt;0.2\pm0.1 up to ~300 gev. these expressions are completely determined bythe rigidity dependent grammage, which is measured from stable cr secondariesup to ~150 gev/nuc, and by nuclear cross sections measured in the laboratory.pbar and e+ measurements, available up to ~100 gev, are consistent with theseestimates, implying that there is no need for new, non-secondary, pbar or e+sources. the radiative loss suppression factor f_{s,e+} of the e+ flux dependson the e+ propagation in the galaxy, which is not understood theoretically. arough, model independent estimate of f_{s,e+} 1/3 can be obtained at a singleenergy, e\sim20 gev, from unstable secondary decay and is found to beconsistent with e+ measurements, including the positron fraction measured bypamela. we show that specific detailed models, that agree with compositional crdata, agree with our simple expressions for the e+ and pbar flux, and that theclaims that the positron fraction measured by pamela requires new primary e+sources are based on assumptions, that are not supported by observations. ifpamela results are correct, they suggest that f_{s,e+} is slightly increasingwith energy, which provides an interesting constraint on cr propagation models.we argue that measurements of the e+ to pbar ratio are more useful forchallenging secondary production models than the positron fraction.

1001.0134	the spectrum of cosmic rays escaping from relativistic shocks	we derive expressions for the time integrated spectrum of cosmic rays (crs)that are accelerated in a decelerating relativistic shock wave and escape aheadof the shock. it is assumed that at any given time the crs have a power lawform, carry a constant fraction of the energy e_tot of the shocked plasma, andescape continuously at the maximal energy attainable. the spectrum of escapingparticles is highly sensitive to the instantaneous spectral index due to thefact that the minimal energy, e_min ~ \gamma^2 m_pc^2 where \gamma is the shocklorentz factor, changes with time. in particular, the escaping spectrum may beconsiderably harder than the canonical n(e)\propto e^-2 spectrum. for a shockexpanding into a plasma of density n, a spectral break is expected at themaximal energy attainable at the transition to non relativistic velocities, e ~10^19 (\epsilon_b/0.1)(n/1 cm^-3)^(1/6)(e_tot/10^51 erg)^(1/3) ev where\epsilon_b is the fraction of the energy flux carried by the magnetic field. ifultra-high energy crs are generated in decelerating relativistic blast wavesarising from the explosion of stellar mass objects, their generation spectrummay therefore be different than the canonical n(e)\propto e^-2.

1002.3414	the early uv/optical emission from core-collapse supernovae	we derive a simple approximate model describing the early, hours to days,uv/optical supernova emission, which is produced by the expansion of the outer&lt;~0.01 solar mass part of the shock-heated envelope, and precedes the opticalemission driven by radioactive decay. our model includes an approximatedescription of the time dependence of the opacity (due mainly torecombination), and of the deviation of the emitted spectrum from a black bodyspectrum. we show that the characteristics of the early uv/o emission constrainthe radius of the progenitor star, its envelope composition, and the ratio ofthe ejecta energy to its mass, e/m. for he envelopes, neglecting the effect ofrecombination may lead to an over estimate of progenitor radius by more than anorder of magnitude. we also show that the relative extinction at differentwavelengths may be inferred from the light-curves at these wave-lengths,removing the uncertainty in the estimate of progenitor radius due to reddening(but not the uncertainty in e/m due to uncertainty in absolute extinction). theearly uv/o observations of the type ib sn2008d and of the type iip snls-04d2dcare consistent with our model predictions. for sn2008d we find progenitorradius to be approx. 10^11 cm, and an indication that the he envelope containsa significant c/o fraction.

1002.3869	closing the gap in the solutions of the strong explosion problem: an  expansion of the family of second-type self-similar solutions	shock waves driven by the release of energy at the center of a cold ideal gassphere of initial density rho\propto r^{-omega} approach a self-similar (sls)behavior, with velocity \dot{r}\propto r^delta, as r-&gt;\infty. for omega&gt;3 thesolutions are of the second-type, i.e., delta is determined by the requirementthat the flow should include a sonic point. no solution satisfying thisrequirement exists, however, in the 3\leq omega\leq omega_{g}(gamma) ``gap''(\omega_{g}=3.26 for adiabatic index gamma=5/3). we argue that second-typesolutions should not be required in general to include a sonic point. rather,it is sufficient to require the existence of a characteristic line r_c(t), suchthat the energy in the region r_c(t)&lt;r&lt;r approaches a constant as r-&gt;\infty,and an asymptotic solution given by the sls solution at r_c(t)&lt;r&lt;r anddeviating from it at r&lt;r_c may be constructed. the two requirements coincidefor omega&gt;omega_g and the latter identifies delta=0 solutions as the asymptoticsolutions for 3\leq omega\leq omega_{g} (as suggested by gruzinov03). in thesesolutions, r_c is a c_0 characteristic. it is difficult to check, usingnumerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, whether the flow indeedapproaches a delta=0 sls behavior as r-&gt;\infty, due to the slow convergence tosls for omega~3. we show that in this case the flow may be described by amodified sls solution, d\ln\dot{r}/d\ln r=delta with slowly varying delta(r),eta\equiv d delta/d\ln r&lt;&lt;1, and spatial profiles given by a sum of the slssolution corresponding to the instantaneous value of delta and a sls correctionlinear in eta. the modified sls solutions provide an excellent approximation tonumerical solutions obtained for omega~3 at large r, with delta-&gt;0 (andeta\neq0) for 3\leq omega\leq omega_{g}.

1003.0566	fermi constraints on the high energy, ~1 gev, emission of long grbs	we investigate the constraints imposed on the luminosity function (lf) oflong duration gamma ray bursts (lgrbs) by the flux distribution of burstsdetected by the gbm at ~1 mev, and the implications of the non detection of thevast majority, ~95%, of the lgrbs at higher energy, ~1 gev, by the latdetector. we find a lf that is consistent with those determined by batse andswift. the non detections by lat set upper limits on the ratio r of the promptfluence at ~1 gev to that at ~1 mev. the upper limits are more stringent forbrighter bursts, with r&lt;{0.1,0.3,1} for {5,30,60}% of the bursts. this impliesthat for most bursts the prompt ~1 gev emission may be comparable to the ~1 mevemission, but can not dominate it. the value of r is not universal, with aspread of (at least) an order of magnitude around r~10^(-1). for several brightbursts with reliable determination of the photon spectral index at ~1 mev, thelat non detection implies an upper limit to the ~100 mev flux which is &lt;0.1 ofthe flux obtained by extrapolating the ~1 mev flux to high energy. for thewidely accepted models, in which the ~1 mev power-law photon spectrum reflectsthe power-law energy distribution of fast cooling electrons, this suggests thateither the electron energy distribution does not follow a power-law over a wideenergy range, or that the high energy photons are absorbed. requiring an orderunity pair production optical depth at ~100 mev sets an upper limit for thelorentz factor, gamma&lt;=10^(2.5).

1108.5548	early emission from type ia supernovae	a unique feature of deflagration-to-detonation (ddt) white dwarf explosionmodels of sne of type ia is the presence of a strong shock wave propagatingthrough the outer envelope. we consider the early emission expected in suchmodels, which is produced by the expanding shock-heated outer part of theejecta and precedes the emission driven by radioactive decay. we expand onearlier analyses by considering the modification of the pre-detonation densityprofile by the weak-shocks generated during the deflagration phase, the timeevolution of the opacity, and the deviation of the post-shock equation of statefrom that obtained for radiation pressure domination. a simple analytic modelis presented and shown to provide an acceptable approximation to the results of1d numerical ddt simulations. our analysis predicts a thousand second longuv/optical flash with a luminosity of ~1 to 3*1e39 erg/s. lower luminositycorresponds to faster (turbulent) deflagration velocity. the predictedluminosity of the uv flash is an order of magnitude lower than that of earlierestimates, and is expected to be strongly suppressed at times longer than anhour due to the deviation from pure radiation domination.

0711.2379	prompt optical emission from residual collisions in grb outflows	the prompt gamma-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts is believed to be producedby internal shocks within a relativistic unsteady outflow. the recent detectionof prompt optical emission accompanying the prompt gamma-ray emission appearsto be inconsistent with this model since the out flowing plasma is expected tobe highly optically thick to optical photons. we show here that fluctuations inflow properties on short, ~ 1 ms, time scale, which drive the gamma-rayproducing collisions at small radii, are expected to lead to "residual"collisions at much larger radii, where the optical depth to optical photons islow. the late residual collisions naturally account for the relatively brightoptical emission. the apparent simultaneity of gamma-ray and optical emissionis due to the highly relativistic speed with which the plasma expands. residualcollisions may also account for the x-ray emission during the early "steepdecline" phase, where the radius is inferred to be larger than the gamma-rayemission radius. finally, we point out that inverse-compton emission fromresidual collisions at large radii is expected to contribute significantly tothe emission at high energy, and may therefore "smear" the pair productionspectral cut-off.

1207.4043	a search for correlation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with iras-pscz  and 2mass-6df galaxies	we study the arrival directions of 69 ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs)observed at the pierre auger observatory (pao) with energies exceeding 55 eev.we investigate whether the uhecrs exhibit the anisotropy signal expected if theprimary particles are protons that originate in galaxies in the local universe,or in sources correlated with these galaxies. we cross-correlate the uhecrarrival directions with the positions of iras-pscz and 2mass-6df galaxiestaking into account particle energy losses during propagation. this is thefirst time that the 6df survey is used in a search for the sources of uhecrsand the first time that the pscz survey is used with the full 69 pao events.the observed cross-correlation signal is larger for the pao uhecrs than for 94%(98%) of realisations from an isotropic distribution when cross-correlated withthe pscz (6df). on the other hand the observed cross-correlation signal islower than that expected from 85% of realisations, had the uhecrs originated ingalaxies in either survey. the observed cross-correlation signal does exceedthat expected by 50% of the realisations if the uhecrs are randomly deflectedby intervening magnetic fields by 5 degrees or more. we propose a new method ofanalysing the expected anisotropy signal, by dividing the predicted uhecrsource distribution into equal predicted flux radial shells, which can helplocalise and constrain the properties of uhecr sources. we find that the 69 paoevents are consistent with isotropy in the nearest of three shells we define,whereas there is weak evidence for correlation with the predicted sourcedistribution in the two more distant shells in which the galaxy distribution isless anisotropic.

1210.1574	detection of a virial shock around the coma galaxy cluster	galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe,are thought to grow by accreting mass from their surroundings throughlarge-scale virial shocks. due to electron acceleration in such a shock, itshould appear as a gamma-ray, hard x-ray, and radio ring, elongated towards thelarge-scale filaments feeding the cluster, coincident with a cutoff in thethermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) signal. however, no such signature was found sofar, and the very existence of cluster virial shocks has remained a theory. wereport the discovery of a large, ~5 mpc diameter gamma-ray ring around the comacluster, elongated towards the large scale filament connecting coma and abell1367. the gamma-ray ring correlates both with a synchrotron signal and with thesz cutoff. the gamma-ray and radio signatures agree with analytic and numericalpredictions, if the shock deposits ~1% of the thermal energy in relativisticelectrons over a hubble time, and ~1% of the energy in magnetic fields. theimplied inverse-compton and synchrotron cumulative emission from similar shockssignificantly contributes to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray and lowfrequency radio backgrounds. our results reveal the prolate structure of thehot gas in coma, the feeding pattern of the cluster, and properties of thesurrounding large scale voids and filaments. the anticipated detection of suchshocks around other clusters would provide a powerful new cosmological probe.

1304.4234	what can we really learn about magnetic fields in galaxy clusters from  faraday rotation observations?	we construct a simple and robust approach for deriving constraints onmagnetic fields in galaxy clusters from rotation measure (rm) maps. relaxingthe commonly used assumptions of a correlation between the magnetic fieldstrength and the plasma density and of a power-law (in wave number) magneticfield power spectrum, and using an efficient numerical analysis method, we testthe consistency of a wide range of magnetic field models with rm maps of 11extended sources in 5 clusters, for which the data were made available to us.we show that the data reveal no indication for a radial dependence of theaverage magnetic field strength, and in particular no indication for acorrelation between the gas density and the field strength. the rm maps of aconsiderable fraction of the sources either require or are consistent with thepresence of a spatially uniform magnetic field of a relatively small strength,0.02-0.3 mug, which contributes significantly to the rm. the rm maps of all butone source do not require a power-law magnetic field power spectrum, and mostare consistent with a power spectrum dominated by a single wave length. theuncertainties in the magnetic field strengths (and spatial correlation lengths)derived from rm maps exceed an order of magnitude (and often more). theseuncertainties imply, in particular, that there is no indication in current rmdata for a systematic difference between the magnetic field strengths inradio-halo clusters and in radio-quiet clusters. with the improvement expectedin the near future of the quality and quantity of rm data, our analysis methodwill enable one to derive more accurate constraints on magnetic fields ingalaxy clusters.

1308.5699	constraints on the source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays using  anisotropy vs chemical composition	the joint analysis of anisotropy signals and chemical composition ofultra-high energy cosmic rays offers strong potential for shedding light on thesources of these particles. following up on an earlier idea, this paper studiesthe anisotropies produced by protons of energy &gt;e/z, assuming that anisotropiesat energy &gt;e have been produced by nuclei of charge z, which share the samemagnetic rigidity. we calculate the number of secondary protons producedthrough photodisintegration of the primary heavy nuclei. making the extremeassumption that the source does not inject any proton, we find that thesource(s) responsible for anisotropies such as reported by the pierre augerobservatory should lie closer than ~20-30, 80-100 and 180-200 mpc if theanisotropy signal is mainly composed of oxygen, silicon and iron nucleirespectively. a violation of this constraint would otherwise result in thesecondary protons forming a more significant anisotropy signal at lowerenergies. even if the source were located closer than this distance, it wouldrequire an extraordinary metallicity &gt;120, 1600, 1100 times solar metallicityin the acceleration zone of the source, for oxygen, silicon and ironrespectively, to ensure that the concomitantly injected protons not to producea more significant low energy anisotropy. this offers interesting prospects forconstraining the nature and the source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays withthe increase in statistics expected from next generation detectors.

0801.4954	x-ray hotspot flares and implications for cosmic ray acceleration and  magnetic field amplification in supernova remnants	for more than fifty years, it has been believed that cosmic ray (cr) nucleiare accelerated to high energies in the rapidly expanding shockwaves created bypowerful supernova explosions. yet observational proof of this conjecture isstill lacking. recently, uchiyama and collaborators reported the detection ofsmall-scale x-ray flares in one such supernova remnant, dubbed 'rx j1713-3946'(a.k.a. g347.3-0.5), which also emits very energetic, tev (10^12 ev) range,gamma-rays. they contend that the variability of these x-ray 'hotspots' impliesthat the magnetic field in the remnant is about a hundred times larger thannormally assumed; and this, they say, means that the detected tev range photonswere produced in energetic nuclear interactions, providing 'a strong argumentfor acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1 pev (10^15 ev) andbeyond in young supernova remnants.' we point out here that the existingmultiwavelength data on this object certainly do not support such conclusions.though intriguing, the small-scale x-ray flares are not the long sought-after'smoking gun' of nucleonic cr acceleration in snrs.

astro-ph;0007049	fluctuations in the radio background from intergalactic synchrotron  emission	the shocks produced in the intergalactic medium during large-scale structureformation accelerate a population of highly relativistic electrons which emitsynchrotron radiation due to intergalactic magnetic fields. in a previous paper(loeb &amp; waxman 2000) we have shown that these electrons cool primarily byinverse-compton scattering of the microwave background photons and can therebyproduce the observed intensity and spectrum of the diffuse gamma-raybackground. here we calculate the intensity and angular fluctuations of theradio synchrotron background that results from the same high-energy electrons,as well as the expected angular fluctuations in the gamma-ray background. onangular scales smaller than a degree, the predicted fluctuations in themicrowave background temperature are of order 40micro-k*(xi_b/0.01)(nu/10ghz)^{-3}, where xi_b is the magnetic fraction of the post-shock energydensity. this foreground might have already dominated the anisotropy signaldetected in existing low-frequency cmb experiments, and can be identified withconfidence through multi-frequency observations. detection of the synchrotronfluctuations would allow to determine the strength of the intergalacticmagnetic field. we predict a strong correlation between high-resolution mapstaken at low-frequency radio waves and at high-energy gamma-rays. young x-rayclusters may also appear as radio or gamma-ray clusters. the detailed study ofthis correlation will become easily accessible with the future launch of glast.

astro-ph;0202318	gamma-rays from intergalactic shocks	structure formation in the intergalactic medium (igm) produces large-scale,collisionless shock waves, where electrons can accelerate to highlyrelativistic energies. such electrons can compton scatter cosmic microwavebackground photons up to gamma-ray energies. we study the radiation emitted inthis process using a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of a lcdm universe.this radiation, extending beyond tev energies, has roughly constant energy fluxper decade in photon energy, in agreement with the predictions of loeb &amp; waxman(2000). assuming that a fraction xi_e=0.05 of the shock thermal energy istransferred to relativistic electrons, as inferred from collisionlessnon-relativistic shocks in the interstellar medium, we find that the radiationenergy flux, e^2(dj/de)~ 50-160 ev cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1, constitutes ~10% of theextragalactic gamma-ray background. the associated point-sources are too faintto account for the ~60 unidentified egret gamma-ray sources, but glast shouldresolve several sources associated with large-scale igm structures forxi_e~0.03, and many more sources for larger xi_e. the intergalactic origin ofthe radiation can be verified through a cross-correlation with, e.g., thegalaxy distribution that traces the same structure. its shock-origin may betested by a cross-correlation with radio synchrotron radiation, emitted as thesame electrons gyrate in post-shock magnetic fields. we predict that glast andcherenkov telescopes such as magic, veritas and hess should resolve gamma-raysfrom nearby (redshifts z &lt; 0.01) rich galaxy clusters, perhaps in the form of a\~5-10 mpc diameter ring-like emission tracing the cluster accretion shock,with luminous peaks at its intersections with galaxy filaments detectable evenat z~0.025.

astro-ph;0202337	collective processes in relativistic plasma and their implications for  gamma-ray burst afterglows	we consider the effects of collective plasma processes on synchrotronemission from highly relativistic electrons. we find, in agreement with sazonov(1970), that strong effects are possible also in the absence of anon-relativistic plasma component, due to the relativistic electrons (andprotons) themselves. in contrast with sazonov, who infers strong effects onlyin cases where the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency is muchlarger than the square of the characteristic electron lorentz factor, nu_p/nu_b&gt;&gt; gamma^2, we find strong effects also for 1 &lt;&lt; nu_p/nu_b &lt;&lt; gamma^2. themodification of the spectrum is prominent at frequencies nu &lt; nu_{r*} = nu_pmin[gamma, (nu_p/nu_b)^(1/2)], where nu_{r*} generalizes the razin-tsytovichfrequency, nu_r = gamma nu_p, to the regime nu_p/nu_b &lt;&lt; gamma^2. applying ourresults to gamma-ray burst (grb) plasmas, we predict a strong modification ofthe radio spectrum on minute time scale following the grb, at the onset offireball interaction with its surrounding medium, in cases where the ratio ofthe energy carried by the relativistic electrons to the energy carried by themagnetic field exceeds ~ 10^5. plausible electron distribution functions maylead to negative synchrotron reabsorption, i.e to coherent radio emission,which is characterized by a low degree of circular polarization. detection ofthese effects would constrain the fraction of energy in the magnetic field,which is currently poorly determined by observations, and, moreover, wouldprovide a novel handle on the properties of the environment into which thefireball expands.

astro-ph;0307290	implications of the $\gamma$-ray polarization of grb 021206	we compare two possible scenarios for the producing of high level ofpolarization within the prompt emission of a grb: synchrotron emission from arelativistic jet with a uniform (in space and time) magnetic field andsynchrotron emission from a jet with a random magnetic field in the plane ofthe shock. somewhat surprisingly we find that both scenarios can produce acomparable level of polarization ($\sim 45-50$% for the uniform field and $\sim30-35$% for a random field). uniform time independent field most naturallyarises by expansion of the field from the compact object. it requires a$10^{12}$g field at the source and a transport of the field as $\proptor^{-1}$. it {\it does not} imply poynting flux domination of the energy of thewind. there is a serious difficulty however, within this scenario, accountingfor particle acceleration (which requires random magnetic fields) both forpoynting flux and non-poynting flux domination. significant polarization canalso arise from a random field provided that the observer is located within$1/\gamma$ orientation from a narrow ($\theta_j \sim 1/\gamma$) jet. while mostjets are wider, the jet of grb 021206 from which strong polarization wasrecently observed, was most likely very narrow. grb 021206 is among thestrongest bursts ever. adopting the energy-angle relation we find an estimatedangle of $&lt;1/40$rad or even smaller. thus, for this particular burst therequired geometry is not unusual. we conclude that the rhessi observationssuggest that the prompt emission results from synchrotron radiation. however,in view of the comparable levels of polarizations predicted by both the randomfield and the homogeneous field scenarios these observations are insufficientto rule out or confirm either one.

astro-ph;0401620	probing the magnetic field structure in gamma-ray bursts through  dispersive plasma effects on the afterglow polarization	(abr) the origin and structure of magnetic fields in gamma-ray burst (grb)fireball plasmas are two of the most important open questions in all grbmodels. we show that the structure and strength of the magnetic field may beconstrained by radio and ir observations of the early afterglow, where plasmaeffects on the polarization of propagating radiation are significant. wecalculate these propagation effects for cold and relativistic plasmas, and findthat in the presence of a uniform equipartition field the degree of linearpolarization is suppressed, and circular polarization prevails at lowfrequencies, nu &lt; 1-3 ghz, (2x10^11 hz &lt; nu &lt; few x 10^14 hz) in the forward(reverse) shock. at higher frequencies linear polarization dominates. at thefrequency of the transition between circular and linear polarization, the netlevel of polarization is minimal, ~10-20%. these features are nearlyindependent of the circumburst density. the transition frequency is smaller bya factor of ~10 when the uniform field is much weaker than equipartition. thedependence of these results on viewing geometry, outflow collimation andmagnetic field orientation is discussed. when the configuration of the field isentangled over length scales much smaller than the extent of the emittingplasma, the aforementioned effects should not be observed and a linearpolarization at the few % level is expected. polarimetric observations duringthe early afterglow, and particularly of the reverse shock emission, maytherefore place strong constraints on the structure and strength of themagnetic field within the fireball plasma.

astro-ph;0508629	a complete survey of the transient radio sky and implications for  gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and other relativistic explosions	we had previously reported on a survey for radio transients, used to set anupper limit on the number of orphan gamma-ray burst (grb) radio afterglows, andthus a lower limit on the typical grb beaming factor. here we report radio andoptical follow-up observations of these possible transients, achieving thefirst full characterization of the transient radio sky. we find that only twosource are likely to be real radio transients, an optically obscured radiosupernova (sn) in the nearby galaxy ngc 4216, and a source not associated witha bright host galaxy, which is too radio luminous to be a grb afterglow. wespeculate that this may be a flare from a peculiar active galactic nucleus, ora burst from an unusual galactic compact object. we place an upper limit of 65radio transients above 6 mjy over the entire sky at the 95% confidence level.the implications are as follows. first, we derive a limit on the typicalbeaming of grbs; we find f_b^{-1} &gt;~ 60, ~5 times higher than our earlierresults. second, we impose an upper limit on the rate of events that eject &gt;~10^{51} erg in unconfined relativistic ejecta, whether or not accompanied bydetectable emission in wavebands other than the radio. our estimated rate,&lt;=1000/y/gpc, is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the rate ofcore-collapse sne (and type ib/c events in particular), indicating that only aminority of such events eject significant amounts of relativistic material,which are required by fireball models of long-soft grbs. finally, we show thatfuture wider and/or deeper radio variability surveys are expected to detectnumerous orphan radio grb afterglows. our survey also illustrates the greatpotential of sensitive surveys with new instruments to revolutionize the studyof nearby sne (abridged).

astro-ph;0601626	magnetic fields in starburst galaxies and the origin of the fir-radio  correlation	we estimate minimum energy magnetic fields (b_min) for a sample of galaxieswith measured gas surface densities, spanning from normal spirals tostarbursts. we show that the ratio of the minimum energy magnetic pressure tothe total pressure in the ism decreases substantially with increasing surfacedensity; for arp 220 this ratio is ~10^-4. therefore, if the minimum energyestimate is applicable, magnetic fields in starbursts are dynamically weakcompared to gravity, in contrast to normal spiral galaxies. we argue, however,that rapid cooling of relativistic electrons in starbursts invalidates theminimum energy estimate. we critically assess a number of independentconstraints on the magnetic field strength in starbursts. in particular, weargue that the existence of the fir-radio correlation implies that thesynchrotron cooling timescale for cosmic ray electrons is much shorter thantheir escape time from the galactic disk; this in turn implies that the truemagnetic field in starbursts is significantly larger than b_min. the strongestargument against such large fields is that one might expect starbursts to havesteep radio spectra indicative of strong synchrotron cooling, which is notobserved. we show, however, that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses canflatten the nonthermal spectra of starburst galaxies even in the presence ofrapid cooling, providing much better agreement with observed spectra. wefurther demonstrate that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses are likely to beimportant in shaping the radio spectra of most starbursts at ghz frequencies,thereby preserving the linearity of the fir-radio correlation. we thus concludethat magnetic fields in starbursts are significantly larger than b_min. wehighlight several observations that can test this conclusion.

astro-ph;0603440	the redshift distribution of short gamma-ray bursts from dynamically  formed neutron star binaries	short-hard gamma-ray bursts (shbs) may arise from gravitational wave (gw)driven mergers of double neutron star (dns) systems. dnss may be "primordial"or can form dynamically by binary exchange interactions in globular clustersduring core-collapse. for primordial binaries, the time delay between formationand merger is expected to be short, tau~0.1 gyr, implying that the redshiftdistribution of merger events should follow that of star-formation. we pointout here that for dynamically formed dnss, the time delay betweenstar-formation and merger is dominated by the cluster core-collapse time,rather than by the gw inspiral time, yielding delays comparable to the hubbletime. we derive the redshift distribution of merger events of dynamicallyformed dnss, and find it to differ significantly from that typically expectedfor primordial binaries. the observed redshift distribution of shbs favorsdynamical formation, although a primordial origin cannot be ruled out due topossible detection biases. future red-shift observations of shbs may allow todetermine whether they are dominated by primordial or dynamically formed dnss.

astro-ph;0607345	self-similar collisionless shocks	observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows suggest that the correlationlength of magnetic field fluctuations downstream of relativistic non-magnetizedcollisionless shocks grows with distance from the shock to scales much largerthan the plasma skin depth. we argue that this indicates that the plasmaproperties are described by a self-similar solution, and derive constraints onthe scaling properties of the solution. for example, we find that the scalingof the characteristic magnetic field amplitude with distance from the shock isb \propto d^{s_b} with -1&lt;s_b&lt;=0, that the spectrum of accelerated particles isdn/de \propto e^{-2/(s_b+1)}, and that the scaling of the magnetic correlationfunction is &lt;b_i(x)b_j(x+dx)&gt; \propto x^{2s_b} (for x&gt;&gt;d). we show that theplasma may be approximated as a combination of two self-similar components: akinetic component of energetic particles and an mhd-like component representing"thermal" particles. we argue that the latter may be considered as infinitelyconducting, in which case s_b=0 and the scalings are completely determined(e.g. dn/de \propto e^{-2} and b \propto d^0). similar claims apply to non-relativistic shocks such as in supernova remnants, if the upstream magneticfield can be neglected. self-similarity has important implications for anymodel of particle acceleration and/or field generation. for example, we showthat the diffusion function in the angle \mu of momentum p in diffusive shockacceleration models must satisfy d_{\mu\mu}(p,d) = d^{-1}d'_{\mu\mu}(p/d), andthat a previously suggested model for the generation of large scale magneticfields through a hierarchical merger of current-filaments should begeneralized. a numerical experiment testing our analysis is outlined(abridged).

astro-ph;9504008	the distribution of mass and gas in the center of clusters of galaxies  implied by x-ray and lensing observations	observations of gravitational lensing indicate that the mass distribution inclusters of galaxies (where most of the mass is dark matter) is highly peakedtowards the center, while x-ray observations imply that the gas is moreextended. the additional fact that the gas is cooling in the center has oftenled one to expect that the gas temperature should be lower near the center, andtherefore the gas should be more concentrated than the dark matter. we showthat such expectation is not correct, and that the gas temperature must remainapproximately constant within the cooling region in order to have consistencywith the observed x-ray profiles and lenses. a multiphase cooling flownaturally produces an approximately constant temperature profile, and a moreextended distribution for the gas compared to the mass. cool phases aredeposited at relatively large radius, while hot phases are adiabatically heatedas they flow inwards and can keep the average temperature constant. thus,cooling flows result in an {\it increase} of the central temperature, relativeto a case where there is no cooling and the gas follows the mass distribution.  the increased central temperatures caused by cooling flows give acharacteristic core radius to the gas profiles, which is of order the coolingradius. this provides a natural explanation for the typical cores observed inx-ray clusters. it also brings into better agreement with observations the rateof cluster evolution expected in self-similar hierarchical models. we proposethat clusters having core radii much larger than their cooling radii are in theprocess of merging and are not in dynamical equilibrium.

astro-ph;9511044	cooling flows and metallicity gradients in clusters of galaxies	the x-ray emission by hot gas at the centers of clusters of galaxies iscommonly modeled assuming the existence of steady-state, inhomogeneous coolingflows. we derive the metallicity profiles of the intracluster medium expectedfrom such models. the inflowing gas is chemically enriched by type iasupernovae and stellar mass loss in the outer parts of the central galaxy,which may give rise to a substantial metallicity gradient. the amplitude of theexpected metallicity enhancement towards the cluster center is proportional tothe ratio of the central galaxy luminosity to the mass inflow rate. themetallicity of the hotter phases is expected to be higher than that of thecolder, denser phases. the metallicity profile expected for the centauruscluster is in good agreement with the metallicity gradient recently inferredfrom asca measurements (fukazawa et al. 1994). however, current data do notrule out alternative models where cooling is balanced by some heat source. themetallicity gradient does not need to be present in all clusters, depending onthe recent merging history of the gas around the central cluster galaxy, and onthe ratio of the stellar mass in the central galaxy to the gas mass in thecooling flow.

astro-ph;9705229	gamma-ray burst after-glow: confirming the cosmological fireball model	the recent detection of delayed x-ray and optical emission, ``afterglow,''associated with gamma-ray bursts (grbs) supports models, where the bursts areproduced by relativistic expanding blastwaves, ``fireballs,'' at cosmologicaldistances. the detection of absorption lines in the optical afterglow of thegrb of 8 may 1997 confirms that the sources lie at cosmological distance. weshow here that the new features detected in grb970508 afterglow, radio emissionone week following the burst and a 2 day increase in optical flux, areconsistent with the blastwave model. the fireball optical depth at radiofrequencies is much smaller than previously estimated, which accounts for theobserved radio emission. the initial suppression of optical flux is consistentwith that predicted due to electron cooling. the combined radio and opticaldata imply that the fireball energy is $\sim10^{52}$erg, and that the densityof the medium into which the blastwave expands is $\sim 1cm^{-3}$, a valuetypical for gas within galaxies. we predict the time dependence of the radioflux and the absorption frequency, which constitute tests of the fireball modelas described in this paper.

astro-ph;9709190	angular size and emission time scales of relativistic fireballs	the detection of delayed x-ray, optical and radio emission, ``afterglow,''associated with gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is consistent with models, where thebursts are produced by relativistic expanding blast waves, driven by expandingfireballs at cosmological distances. in particular, the time scales over whichradiation is observed at different wave bands agree with model predictions. ithad recently been claimed that the commonly used relation between observationtime t and blast wave radius r, t=r/2\gamma^{2}c where \gamma(r) is the fluidlorentz factor, should be replaced with t=r/16\gamma^{2}c due to blast wavedeceleration. applying the suggested deceleration modification would make itdifficult to reconcile observed time scales with model predictions. it wouldalso imply an apparent source size which is too large to allow attributingobserved radio variability to diffractive scintillation. we present a detailedanalysis of the implications of the relativistic hydrodynamics of expandingblast waves to the observed afterglow. we find that modifications due to shockdeceleration are small, therefore allowing for both the observed afterglow timescales and for diffractive scintillation. we show that at time t the fireballappears on the sky as a narrow ring of radius h=r/\gamma and width 0.1h, wherer and t are related by t=r/2\gamma^{2}c.

astro-ph;9709199	implications of the radio afterglow from the gamma-ray burst of may 8,  1997	radio observations of the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst grb970508 provideunique new constraints on afterglow models. the quenching of diffractivescintillation at 4 week delay provides the first direct estimate of source sizeand expansion rate. it implies an apparent size $r\sim10^{17}$cm and expansionat a speed comparable to that of light at 4 weeks delay, in agreement with thefireball model prediction $r=10^{17}(t/week)^{5/8}$cm. the radio flux and itsdependence on time and frequency at 1--5 week delay are in agreement with themodel and imply a fireball energy (assuming spherical symmetry) of order10^{52}erg, consistent with the value inferred from observations at shorterdelay. the observed radio behavior deviates from model predictions at delayslarger than 5 weeks. this is expected, since at this delay the fireball is intransition from highly-relativistic to sub-relativistic expansion, with lorentzfactor \gamma&lt;2. deviation may be due to a change in the physical processesassociated with the shock wave as it becomes sub-relativistic (e.g. a decreasein the fraction of energy carried by magnetic field), or to the fireball beinga cone of opening angle $1/\gamma\sim0.5$. we predict the future behavior ofthe radio flux assuming that the latter interpretation is valid. thesepredictions may be tested by radio observations in the frequency range0.1--10ghz on time scale of months.

astro-ph;9804023	can high energy neutrino annihilation on relic neutrinos generate the  observed highest energy cosmic-rays?	annihilation of high energy, $\sim 10^{21}$ev, neutrinos on big bang relicneutrinos of $\sim 1$ev mass, clustered in the galactic halo or in a nearbygalaxy cluster halo, has been suggested to generate, through hadronic z decay,high energy nucleons and photons which may account for the detected flux of  &gt;10^{20}ev cosmic-rays. we show that the flux of high energy nucleons andphotons produced by this process is dominated by annihilation on the uniform,non-clustered, neutrino background, and that the energy generation rate of10^{21}ev neutrinos required to account for the detected flux of &gt;10^{20}evparticles is &gt;10^{48} erg/mpc^3 yr. this energy generation rate, comparable tothe total luminosity of the universe, is 4 orders of magnitude larger than therate of production of high energy nucleons required to account for the flux of  &gt;10^{19}ev cosmic-rays. thus, in order for neutrino annihilation tocontribute significantly to the detected flux of &gt;10^{20}ev cosmic-rays, theexistence of a new class of high-energy neutrino sources, likely unrelated tothe sources of &gt;10^{19}ev cosmic-rays, must be invoked.

0811.3759	the energy production rate &amp; the generation spectrum of uhecrs	we derive simple analytic expressions for the flux and spectrum of ultra-highenergy cosmic-rays (uhecrs) predicted in models where the crs are protonsproduced by extra-galactic sources. for a power-law scaling of the crproduction rate with redshift and energy, d\dot{n} /de\propto e^-\alpha(1+z)^m, our results are accurate at high energy, e&gt;10^18.7 ev, to better than15%, providing a simple and straightforward method for inferring d\dot{n}/defrom the observed flux at e. we show that current measurements of the uhecrspectrum, including the latest auger data, implye^2d\dot{n}/de(z=0)=(0.45\pm0.15)(\alpha-1) 10^44 erg mpc^-3 yr^-1 at e&lt;10^19.5ev with \alpha roughly confined to 2\lesseq\alpha&lt;2.7. the uncertainty isdominated by the systematic and statistic errors in the experimentaldetermination of individual cr event energy, (\delta e/e)_{sys} (\deltae/e)_{stat} ~20%. at lower energy, d\dot{n}/de is uncertain due to the unknowngalactic contribution. simple models in which \alpha\simeq 2 and the transitionfrom galactic to extra-galactic sources takes place at the "ankle", e ~10^19ev, are consistent with the data. models in which the transition occurs atlower energies require a high degree of fine tuning and a steep spectrum,\alpha\simeq 2.7, which is disfavored by the data. we point out that in theabsence of accurate composition measurements, the (all particle) energyspectrum alone cannot be used to infer the detailed spectral shapes of thegalactic and extra-galactic contributions.

hep-ph;0009152	high energy neutrinos from gamma-ray bursts	observations suggest that gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are produced by thedissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistic fireball. in this talk,recent work on the production of high energy neutrinos by grb fireballs isreviewed. a significant fraction of grb energy is expected to be converted toan accompanying burst of high energy neutrinos. photomeson interactions producea burst of ~100 tev neutrinos in coincidence with the grb, and a burst of\~10^18 ev neutrinos following the grb on a time scale of 10 s. inelastic p-nnuclear collisions result in the production of a burst of ~10 gev neutrinos incoincidence with the grb. planned 1 km^3 neutrino telescopes are expected todetect tens of 100 tev neutrino events, and several 10^18 ev events, correlatedwith grbs per year. a suitably densely spaced detector may allow the detectionof several 10 gev events per year. the detection of high-energy neutrino eventscorrelated with grbs will allow to constrain grb progenitor models and to testthe suggestion that grbs accelerate protons to &gt;10^20 ev. moreover, suchdetection will allow to test for neutrino properties, e.g. flavor oscillations(for which upward moving tau's would be a unique signature) and coupling togravity, with an accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currentlypossible.
