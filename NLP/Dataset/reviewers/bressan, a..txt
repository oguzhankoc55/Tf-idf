0902.1202	the energetic environment and the dense interstellar medium in ulirgs	we fit the near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of a sampleof 30 luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with models that includeboth starburst and agn components. the aim of the work was to determineimportant physical parameters for this kind of objects such as the opticaldepth towards the luminosity source, the star formation rate, the starformation efficiency and the agn fraction. we found that although about half ofour sample have best-fit models that include an agn component, only 30 % havean agn which accounts for more than 10 % of the infrared luminosity whereas allhave an energetically dominant starburst. our models also determine the mass ofdense molecular gas. assuming that this mass is that traced by the hcnmolecule, we reproduce the observed linear relation between hcn luminosity andinfrared luminosity found by gao and solomon (2004). however, our derivedconversion factor between hcn luminosity and the mass of dense molecular gas isa factor of 2 smaller than that assumed by these authors. finally, we find thatthe star formation efficiency falls as the starburst ages.

0903.0346	wimp annihilation effects on primordial star formation	we study the effects of wimp dark matter (dm) annihilations on the thermaland chemical evolution of the gaseous clouds where the first generation ofstars in the universe is formed. we follow the collapse of the gas inside atypical halo virializing at very high redshift, from well before virializationuntil a stage where the heating from dm annihilations exceeds the gas coolingrate. the dm energy input is estimated by inserting the energy released by dmannihilations (as predicted by an adiabatic contraction of the original dmprofile) in a spherically symmetric radiative transfer scheme. in addition tothe heating effects of the energy absorbed, we include its feedback upon thechemical properties of the gas, which is critical to determine the cooling ratein the halo, and hence the fragmentation scale and jeans mass of the firststars. we find that dm annihilation does alter the free electron and especiallythe h2 fraction when the gas density is n&gt;~ 10^4 cm^-3, for our fiducialparameter values. however, even if the change in the h2 abundance and thecooling efficiency of the gas is large (sometimes exceeding a factor 100), theeffects on the temperature of the collapsing gas are far smaller (a reductionby a factor &lt;~1.5), since the gas cooling rate depends very strongly ontemperature: then, the fragmentation mass scale is reduced only slightly,hinting towards no dramatic change in the initial mass function of the firststars.

0905.3664	popstar i: evolutionary synthesis models description	we present new evolutionary synthesis models for simple stellar populationsfor a wide range of ages and metallicities. the models are based on the padovaisochrones. the core of the spectral library is provided by the mediumresolution lejeune et al. atmosphere models. these spectra are complemented bynlte atmosphere models for hot stars that have an important impact in thestellar cluster's ionizing spectra: o, b and wr stellar spectra at the earlyages, and spectra of post-agb stars and planetary nebulae, at intermediate andold ages. at young ages, our models compare well with other existing models butwe find that, the inclusion of the nebular continuum, not considered in severalother models, reddens significantly the integrated colours of very youngstellar populations. this is consistent with the results of spectral synthesiscodes particularly devised for the study of starburst galaxies. at intermediateand old ages, the agreement with literature model is good and, in particular,we reproduce well the observed colours of star clusters in lmc. given theability to produce good integrated spectra from the far-uv to the infrared atany age, we consider that our models are particularly suited for the study ofhigh redshift galaxies. these models are available on the web site{http://www.fractal-es.com/sedmod.htm} and also through the virtual observatorytools on the popstar server.

0906.3522	modelling the dusty universe i: introducing the artificial neural  network and first applications to luminosity and colour distributions	we introduce a new technique based on artificial neural networks which allowsus to make accurate predictions for the spectral energy distributions (seds) oflarge samples of galaxies, at wavelengths ranging from the far-ultra-violet tothe sub-millimetre and radio. the neural net is trained to reproduce the sedspredicted by a hybrid code comprised of the galform semi-analytical model ofgalaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy mergerhistories, and the grasil spectro-photometric code, which carries out aself-consistent calculation of the sed, including absorption and emission ofradiation by dust. using a small number of galaxy properties predicted bygalform, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority ofcases to within 10% of those computed directly using grasil. the methodperforms best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared and thefar-ultra-violet. the luminosity error introduced by the method has negligibleimpact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions orcolour distributions of galaxies. we use the neural net to predict the overlapbetween galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv and in the observer-frame sub-mmat z=2. we find that around half of the galaxies with a 850um flux above 5 mjyshould have optical magnitudes brighter than r_ab &lt; 25 mag. however, only 1% ofthe galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv down to r_ab &lt; 25 mag should have850um fluxes brighter than 5 mjy. our technique will allow the generation ofwide-angle mock catalogues of galaxies selected at rest-frame uv or mid- andfar-infrared wavelengths.

0909.1567	predictions for herschel from lambdacdm: unveiling the cosmic star  formation history	we use a model for the evolution of galaxies in the far-ir based on thelambdacdm cosmology to make detailed predictions for upcoming cosmologicalsurveys with the herschel space observatory. we use the combined galformsemi-analytical galaxy formation model and grasil spectrophotometric code tocompute galaxy seds including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model,which is the same as that in baugh et al. (2005), assumes two different imfs: anormal solar neighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and avery top-heavy imf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shownpreviously that the top-heavy imf appears necessary to explain the numbercounts and redshifts of faint sub-mm galaxies. in this paper, we presentpredictions for galaxy luminosity functions, number counts and redshiftdistributions in the herschel imaging bands. we find that source confusion willbe a serious problem in the deepest planned surveys. we also show predictionsfor physical properties such as star formation rates and stellar, gas and halomasses, together with fluxes at other wavelengths (from the far-uv to theradio) relevant for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. we investigatewhat fraction of the total ir emission from dust and of the high-mass starformation over the history of the universe should be resolved by plannedsurveys with herschel, and find a fraction ~30-50%, depending on confusion.finally, we show that galaxies in herschel surveys should be significantlyclustered.

0704.1562	galaxy evolution in the infra-red: comparison of a hierarchical galaxy  formation model with spitzer data	we present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function,number counts and redshift distributions in the ir based on the lambda-cdmcosmological model. we use the combined galform semi-analytical galaxyformation model and grasil spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy sedsincluding the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model, which is the sameas that in baugh et al (2005), assumes two different imfs: a normal solarneighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavyimf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shown previously thatthe top-heavy imf seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faintsub-mm galaxies. we compare the model with observational data from the spitzerspace telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen beforespitzer data became available. we find that the model matches the observedevolution in the ir remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probedby spitzer. in particular, the spitzer data show that there is strong evolutionin the mid-ir galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, andthis is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.on the other hand, a model with a normal imf in starbursts predicts far toolittle evolution in the mid-ir luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

1002.3334	starburst evolution: free-free absorption in the radio spectra of  luminous iras galaxies	we describe radio observations at 244 and 610 mhz of a sample of 20 luminousand ultra-luminous iras galaxies. these are a sub-set of a sample of 31 objectsthat have well-measured radio spectra up to at least 23 ghz. the radio spectraof these objects below 1.4 ghz show a great variety of forms and are rarely asimple power-law extrapolation of the synchrotron spectra at higherfrequencies. most objects of this class have spectral turn-overs or bends intheir radio spectra. we interpret these spectra in terms of free-freeabsorption in the starburst environment.  several objects show radio spectra with two components having free-freeturn-overs at different frequencies (including arp 220 and arp 299), indicatingthat synchrotron emission originates from regions with very different emissionmeasures. in these sources, using a simple model for the supernova rate, weestimate the time for which synchrotron emission is subject to strong free-freeabsorption by ionized gas, and compare this to expected hii region lifetimes.we find that the ionized gas lifetimes are an order of magnitude larger thanplausible lifetimes for individual hii regions. we discuss the implications ofthis result and argue that those sources which have a significant radiocomponent with strong free-free absorption are those in which the starformation rate is still increasing with time.  we note that if ionization losses modify the intrinsic synchrotron spectrumso that it steepens toward higher frequencies, the often observed deficit influxes higher than ~10 ghz would be much reduced.

1003.0676	first star formation with dark matter annihilation	we include an energy term based on dark matter (dm) self-annihilation duringthe cooling and subsequent collapse of the metal-free gas, in halos hosting theformation of the first stars in the universe. we have found that the feedbackinduced on the chemistry of the cloud does modify the properties of the gasthroughout the collapse. however, the modifications are not dramatic, and thetypical jeans mass within the halo is conserved throughout the collapse, forall the dm parameters we have considered. this result implies that the presenceof dark matter annihilations does not substantially modify the initial massfunction of the first stars, with respect to the standard case in which suchadditional energy term is not taken into account. we have also found that whenthe rate of energy produced by the dm annihilations and absorbed by the gasequals the chemical cooling (at densities yet far from the actual formation ofa proto-stellar core) the structure does not halt its collapse, although thatproceeds more slowly by a factor smaller than few per cent of the totalcollapse time.

0708.0149	modeling the spectral energy distribution of ulirgs i: the radio spectra	as a constraint for new starburst/agn models of iras bright galaxies wedetermine the radio spectra of 31 luminous and ultraluminous iras galaxies(lirgs/ulirgs). we construct the radio spectra using both new and archivaldata. from our sample of radio spectra we find that very few have a straightpower-law slope. although some sources show a flattening of the radio spectralslope at high frequencies the average spectrum shows a steepening of the radiospectrum from 1.4 to 22.5 ghz. this is unexpected because in sources with highrates of star formation we expect flat spectrum, free-free emission to make asignificant contribution to the radio flux at higher radio frequencies. despitethis trend the radio spectral indices between 8.4 and 22.5 ghz are flatter forsources with higher values of the fir-radio flux density ratio q, when this iscalculated at 8.4 ghz. therefore, sources that are deficient in radio emissionrelative to fir emission (presumably younger sources) have a larger thermalcomponent to their radio emission. however, we find no correlation between theradio spectral index between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz and q at 8.4 ghz. because the lowfrequency spectral index is affected by free-free absorption, and this is afunction of source size for a given mass of ionized gas, this is evidence thatthe ionized gas in ulirgs shows a range of densities. the youngest lirgs andulirgs are characterized by a larger contribution to their high-frequency radiospectra from free-free emission. however, the youngest sources are not thosethat have the greatest free-free absorption at low radio frequencies. thesources in which the effects of free-free absorption are strongest are insteadthe most compact sources. although these have the warmest fir colours, they arenot necessarily the youngest sources.

1004.1647	nearby early-type galaxies with ionized gas.iv. origin and powering  mechanism of the ionized gas	[abridged] with the aim of constraining the source of excitation and theorigin of the ionized gas in early-type galaxies (etgs), we analyzed opticalspectra of a sample of 65 etgs mostly located in low density environments.optical emission lines are detected in 89% of the sample. the incidence andstrength of emission do not correlate either with the e/s0 classification, orwith the fast/slow rotator classification. comparing the nuclear r&lt;r_e/16 lineemission with the classical [oiii]/hb vs [nii]/ha diagnostic diagram, thegalaxy activity is so classified: 72% are liners, 9% are seyferts, 12% arecomposite/transition objects, and 7% are non-classified. seyferts have youngluminosity-weighted ages (&lt;5 gyr), and are significantly younger than linersand composites. seyferts excluded, the spread in the ([oiii], ha or [nii])emission strength increases with the galaxy central velocity dispersion. the[nii]/ha ratio decreases with increasing galacto-centric distance, indicatingeither a decrease of the nebular metallicity, or a progressive "softening" ofthe ionizing spectrum. the average oxygen abundance of the ionized gas isslightly less than solar, and a comparison with the results obtained in paperiii from lick indices reveals that it is ~0.2 dex lower than that of stars.conclusions: the nuclear emission can be explained with photoionization by pagbstars alone only in ~22% of the liners/composite sample. on the other hand, wecan not exclude an important role of pagb star photoionization at larger radii.for the major fraction of the sample, the nuclear emission is consistent withexcitation from a low-accretion rate agn, fast shocks (200 -500 km/s) in arelatively gas-poor environment (n&lt; 100 cm^-3), or coexistence of the two. thederived nebular metallicities suggest either an external origin of the gas, oran overestimate of the oxygen yields by sn models.

1006.2303	cosmic evolution of size and velocity dispersion for early type galaxies	[abridged] massive, passively evolving galaxies at redshifts z&gt;1 exhibit onthe average physical sizes smaller by factors ~3 than local early type galaxies(etgs) endowed with the same stellar mass. small sizes are in fact expected ontheoretical grounds, if dissipative collapse occurs. recent results show thatthe size evolution at z&lt;1 is limited to less than 40%, while most of theevolution occurs at z&gt;1, where both compact and already extended galaxies areobserved and the scatter in size is remarkably larger than locally. thepresence at high z of a significant number of etgs with the same size as theirlocal counterparts as well as of etgs with quite small size, points to atimescale to reach the new, expanded equilibrium configuration of less than thehubble time. we demonstrate that the projected mass of compact, high-z galaxiesand that of local etgs within the *same physical radius*, the nominalhalf-luminosity radius of high-z etgs, differ substantially, in that the high-zetgs are on the average significantly denser. we propose that quasar activity,which peaks at z~2, can remove large amounts of gas from central galaxy regionson a timescale shorter than of the dynamical one, triggering a puffing up ofthe stellar component at constant stellar mass; in this case the size increasegoes together with a decrease of the central mass. the size evolution isexpected to parallel that of the quasars and the inverse hierarchy, ordownsizing, seen in the quasar evolution is mirrored in the size evolution.

1008.0009	unusual pah emission in nearby early-type galaxies: a signature of an  intermediate age stellar population?	we present the analysis of spitzer-irs spectra of four early-type galaxies,ngc 1297, ngc 5044, ngc 6868, and ngc 7079, all classified as liners in theoptical bands. their irs spectra present the full series of h2 rotationalemission lines in the range 5--38 microns, atomic lines, and prominent pahfeatures. we investigate the nature and origin of the pah emission,characterized by unusually low 6 -- 9/11.3 microns inter-band ratios. after thesubtraction of a passive early type galaxy template, we find that the 7 -- 9microns spectral region requires dust features not normally present in starforming galaxies. each spectrum is then analyzed with the aim of identifyingtheir components and origin. in contrast to normal star forming galaxies, wherecationic pah emission prevails, our 6--14 microns spectra seem to be dominatedby large and neutral pah emission, responsible for the low 6 -- 9/11.3 micronsratios, plus two broad dust emission features peaking at 8.2 microns and 12microns. theses broad components, observed until now mainly in evolved carbonstars and usually attributed to pristine material, contribute approximately30-50% of the total pah flux in the 6--14 microns region. we propose that thepah molecules in our etgs arise from fresh carbonaceous material which iscontinuously released by a population of carbon stars, formed in a rejuvenationepisode which occurred within the last few gyr. the analysis of the mir spectraallows us to infer that, in order to maintain the peculiar size and chargedistributions biased to large and neutral pahs, this material must be shocked,and excited by the weak uv interstellar radiation field of our etg.

1011.5782	mid-infrared colour gradients and the colour-magnitude relation in virgo  early-type galaxies	we make use of spitzer imaging between 4 and 16 micron and near-infrared dataat 2.2 micron to investigate the nature and distribution of the mid-infraredemission in a sample of early-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. these dataallow us to conclude, with some confidence, that the emission at 16 micron inpassive etgs is stellar in origin, consistent with previous work concludingthat the excess mid-infrared emission comes from the dusty envelopes aroundevolved agb stars. there is little evidence for the mid-infrared emission of anunresolved central component, as might arise in the presence of a dusty torusassociated with a low-luminosity agn. we nonetheless find that the 16 micronemission is more centrally peaked than the near-infrared emission, implying aradial stellar population gradient. by comparing with independent evidence fromstudies at optical wavelengths, we conclude that a metallicity that falls withincreasing radius is the principal driver of the observed gradient. we alsoplot the mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagram and combine with similar work onthe coma cluster to define the colour-magnitude relation for absolute k-bandmagnitudes from -26 to -19. because a correlation between mass and age wouldproduce a relation with a gradient in the opposite sense to that observed, weconclude that the relation reflects the fact that passive etgs of lower massalso have a lower average metallicity. the colour-magnitude relation is thusdriven by metallicity effects. in contrast to what is found in coma, we do notfind any objects with anomalously bright 16 micron emission relative to thecolour-magnitude relation. although there is little overlap in the mass rangesprobed in the two clusters, this may suggest that observable ``rejuvenation''episodes are limited to intermediate mass objects.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1206.1298	pre-ms depletion, accretion and primordial 7li	we reconsider the role of pre-main sequence (pre-ms) li depletion on thebasis of new observational and theoretical evidence: i) new observations ofhalpha emissions in young clusters show that mass accretion could be continuingtill the first stages of the ms, ii) theoretical implications fromhelioseismology suggest large overshooting values below the bottom of theconvective envelopes. we argue here that a significant pre-ms 7li destruction,caused by efficient overshoot mixing, could be followed by a matter accretionafter 7li depletion has ceased on ms thus restoring li almost to the pristinevalue. as a test case we show that a halo dwarf of 0.85 msun with an extendedovershooting envelope starting with an initial abundance of a(li) = 2.74 wouldburn li completely, but an accretion rate of the type 1e-8xe^{-t/3e6} msunyr$^{-1}$ would restore li to end with an a(li) = 2.31. a self-regulatingprocess is required to produce similar final values in a range of differentstellar masses to explain the popii spite plateau. however, this frameworkcould explain why open cluster stars have lower li abundances than thepre-solar nebula, the absence of li in the most metal poor dwarfs and a numberof other features which lack of a satisfactory explanation.

1207.2022	measurement of the cross section for high-p_t hadron production in  scattering of 160 gev/c muons off nucleons	the differential cross section for production of charged hadrons with hightransverse momenta in scattering of 160\,gev/$c$ muons off nucleons at lowphoton virtualities has been measured at the compass experiment at cern. theresults, which cover transverse momenta from 1.1\,gev/$c$ to 3.6\,gev/$c$, arecompared to a perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pqcd) calculation, in orderto evaluate the applicability of pqcd to this process in the kinematic domainof the experiment. the shape of the calculated differential cross section as afunction of transverse momentum is found to be in good agreement with theexperimental data, but the absolute scale is underestimated by next-to-leadingorder (nlo) pqcd. the inclusion of all-order resummation of large logarithmicthreshold corrections reduces the discrepancy from a factor of three to four toa factor of two. the dependence of the cross section on the pseudo-rapidity andon virtual photon energy fraction is investigated. finally the dependence onthe charge of the hadrons is discussed.

1211.6441	dynamics of stellar black holes in young star clusters with different  metallicities - i. implications for x-ray binaries	we present n-body simulations of intermediate-mass (3000-4000 msun) youngstar clusters (scs) with three different metallicities (z=0.01, 0.1 and 1zsun), including metal-dependent stellar evolution recipes and binaryevolution. following recent theoretical models of wind mass loss and corecollapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends onthe metallicity of the progenitor stars. in particular, massive metal-poorstars (z&lt;=0.3 zsun) are enabled to form massive stellar black holes (msbhs,with mass &gt;=25 msun) through direct collapse. we find that three-bodyencounters, and especially dynamical exchanges, dominate the evolution of themsbhs formed in our simulations. in scs with z=0.01 and 0.1 zsun, about 75 percent of simulated msbhs form from single stars and become members of binariesthrough dynamical exchanges in the first 100 myr of the sc life. this is afactor of &gt;~3 more efficient than in the case of low-mass (&lt;25 msun) stellarblack holes. a small but non-negligible fraction of msbhs power wind-accreting(10-20 per cent) and roche lobe overflow (rlo, 5-10 per cent) binary systems.the vast majority of msbh binaries that undergo wind accretion and/or rlo wereborn from dynamical exchange. this result indicates that msbhs can power x-raybinaries in low-metallicity young scs, and is very promising to explain theassociation of many ultraluminous x-ray sources with low-metallicity andactively star forming environments.

0712.1202	modelling the spectral energy distribution of ulirgs ii: the energetic  environment and the dense interstellar medium	we fit the near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of 30luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with pure starburst models ormodels that include both starburst and agn components to determine importantphysical parameters for this population of objects. in particular we constrainthe optical depth towards the luminosity source, the star formation rate, thestar formation efficiency and the agn fraction. we find that although abouthalf of our sample have best-fit models that include an agn component, only 30%have an agn which accounts for more than 10% of the infrared luminosity,whereas all have an energetically dominant starburst. our derived agn fractionsare generally in good agreement other measurements based in the mid-infraredline ratios measured by spitzer irs, but lower than those derived from pahequivalent widths or the mid-infrared spectral slope. our models determine themass of dense molecular gas via the extinction required to reproduce the sed.assuming that this mass is that traced by hcn, we reproduce the observed linearrelation between hcn and infrared luminosities found by gao &amp; solomon. we alsofind that the star formation efficiency, defined as the current star formationrate per unit of dense molecular gas mass, is enhanced in the ulirgs phase. ifthe evolution of ulirgs includes a phase in which an agn contributes animportant fraction to the infrared luminosity, this phase should last an orderof magnitude less time than the starburst phase. because the mass of densemolecular gas which we derive is consistent with observations of the hcnmolecule,it should be possible to estimate the mass of dense, star-formingmolecular gas in such objects when molecular line data are not available.

1303.4584	a spitzer-irs spectroscopic atlas of early-type galaxies in the revised  shapley-ames catalog	we produce an atlas of homogeneously reduced and calibrated low resolutionirs spectra of the nuclear regions of nearby early-type galaxies (i.e. es ands0s, etgs), in order to build a reference sample in the mid-infrared window.from the spitzer heritage archive we extract etgs in the "revised shapley-amescatalog of bright galaxies" having an irs sl and/or ll spectrum. we recover 91spectra out of 363 galaxies classified as etgs in the catalog: 56 e (e0-e6), 8mixed e/s0+s0/e, 27 s0 (both normal and barred - sb0) plus mixed typessb0/sa+sb0/sba. for each galaxy, we provide the fully reduced and calibratedspectrum, the intensity of nebular and molecular emission lines as well as ofthe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) after a template spectrum of apassively evolving etg has been subtracted. spectra are classified into fivemid-infrared classes, ranging from agn (class-4) and star forming nuclei(class-3), transition class-2 (with pahs) and class-1 (no-pahs) to passivelyevolving nuclei (class-0). a demographic study of mid-infrared spectra showsthat es are significantly more passive than s0s: 46^{+11}_{-10}% of es and20^{+11}_{-7}% of s0s have a spectrum of class-0. emission lines are revealedin 64^{+12}_{-6}% of etgs. the h_2-s(1) line is found with similar rate in es(34^{+10}_{-8}%) and in s0s (51^{+15}_{-12}%). pahs are detected in47^{+8}_{-7}% of etgs, but only 9^{+4}_{-3}% have pahs ratios typical of starforming galaxies. several indicators, such as peculiar morphologies andkinematics, dust--lane irregular shape, radio and x-ray properties, suggestthat mid-infrared spectral classes are connected to phases ofaccretion/feedback phenomena occurring in the nuclei of etgs.

0802.0787	long gamma-ray bursts and their host galaxies at high redshift	motivated by the recent observational and theoretical evidence that longgamma-ray bursts (grbs) are likely associated with low metallicity, rapidlyrotating massive stars, we examine the cosmological star formation rate (sfr)below a critical metallicity z_crit z_sun/10 - z_sun/5, to estimate the eventrate of high-redshift long grb progenitors. to this purpose, we exploit agalaxy formation scenario already successfully tested on a wealth ofobservational data on (proto)spheroids, lyman break galaxies, lyman alphaemitters, submm galaxies, quasars, and local early-type galaxies. we find thatthe predicted rate of long grbs amounts to about 300 events/yr/sr, of whichabout 30 per cent occur at z&gt;~6. correspondingly, the grb number counts wellagree with the bright swift data, without the need for an intrinsic luminosityevolution. moreover, the above framework enables us to predict properties ofthe grb host galaxies. most grbs are associated with low mass galaxy halosm_h&lt;~10^11 m_sun, and effectively trace the formation of small galaxies in suchhalos. the hosts are young, with age smaller than 5*10^7 yr, gas rich, butpoorly extincted (a_v&lt;~0.1) because of their chemical immaturity; this alsoimplies high specific sfr and quite extreme alpha-enhancement. only theminority of hosts residing in large halos with m_h&gt;~10^12 m_sun have largerextinction (a_v~0.7-1), sfrs exceeding 100 m_sun/yr and can be detected atsubmm wavelengths. most of the hosts have uv magnitudes in the range -20&lt;~m_1350&lt;~ -16, and lyman alpha luminosity in the range 2*10^40&lt;~l_lya&lt;~2*10^42 erg/s. grb hosts are thus tracing the faint end of theluminosity function of lyman break galaxies and lyman alpha emitters.

1403.4082	a spitzer-irs view of early-type galaxies with cuspy/core nuclei and  with fast/slow rotation	the recent literature suggests that an evolutionary dichotomy exists forearly-type galaxies (es and s0s, etgs) whereby their central photometricstructure (cuspy versus core central luminosity profiles), and figure ofrotation (fast (fr) vs. slow (sr) rotators), are determined by whether theyformed by "wet" or "dry" mergers. we consider whether the mid infrared (mir)properties of etgs, with their sensitivity to accretion processes in particularin the last few gyr (on average z &lt; 0.2), can put further constraints on thispicture. we investigate a sample of 49 etgs for which nuclear mir propertiesand detailed photometrical and kinematical classifications are available fromthe recent literature. in the stellar light cuspy/core etgs show a dichotomythat is mainly driven by their luminosity. however in the mir, the brightestcore etgs show evidence that accretions have triggered both agn and starformation activity in the recent past, challenging a "dry" merger scenario. incontrast, we do find, in the virgo and fornax clusters, that cuspy etgs,fainter than m$_{k_s}=-24$, are predominantly passively evolving in the sameepoch, while, in low density environments, they tend to be more active. asignificant and statistically similar fraction of both fr (38$^{+18}_{-11}$\%)and sr (50$^{+34}_{-21}$\%) shows pah features in their mir spectra. ionizedand molecular gas are also frequently detected. recent star formation episodesare then a common phenomenon in both kinematical classes, even in thosedominated by agn activity, suggesting a similar evolutionary path in the lastfew gyr. mir spectra suggest that the photometric segregation between cuspy andcore nuclei and the dynamical segregation between fr and sr must haveoriginated before z~0.2.

1408.3234	exploring the relationship between black hole accretion and star  formation with blind mid-/far-infrared spectroscopic surveys	we present new estimates of redshift-dependent luminosity functions of irlines detectable by spica/safari and excited both by star formation and by agnactivity. the new estimates improve over previous work by using updatedevolutionary models and dealing in a self consistent way with emission ofgalaxies as a whole, including both the starburst and the agn component. newrelationships between line and agn bolometric luminosity have been derived andthose between line and ir luminosities of the starburst component have beenupdated. these ingredients were used to work out predictions for the sourcecounts in 11 mid/far-ir emission lines partially or entirely excited by agnactivity. we find that the statistics of the emission line detection ofgalaxies as a whole is mainly determined by the star formation rate, because ofthe rarity of bright agns. we also find that the slope of the line integralnumber counts is flatter than 2 implying that the number of detections at fixedobserving time increases more by extending the survey area than by goingdeeper. we thus propose a wide spectroscopic survey of 1 hour integration perfield-of-view over an area of 5 deg$^{2}$ to detect (at 5$\sigma$) $\sim$760agns in [oiv]25.89$\mu$m $-$ the brightest agn mid-infrared line $-$ out to$z\sim2$. pointed observations of strongly lensed or hyper-luminous galaxiespreviously detected by large area surveys such as those by herschel and by thespt can provide key information on the galaxy-agn co-evolution out to higherredshifts.

astro-ph;0001308	the infrared side of galaxy formation. i. the local universe in the  semi-analytical framework	we present a new evolutionary model for the far-uv to sub-mm properties ofthe galaxy population. this combines a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelbased on hierarchical clustering (galform) with a spectro-photometric codewhich includes dust reprocessing (grasil). the former provides the starformation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass andvarious geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formedin different density environments. these quantities allow us to model the sedsof galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction andre-emission. two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes,where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. themodel includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starburststriggered by galaxy mergers. we test our models against the observedspectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local universe. the modelsreproduce fairly well the seds of normal spirals and starbursts, and theirinternal extinction properties. the starbursts follow the observed relationshipbetween the fir to uv luminosity ratio and the slope of the uv continuum. theyalso reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (calzetti et al 99). thisresult is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the milkyway extinction law. it suggests that the observed attenuation law is related tothe geometry of the stars and dust. we compute galaxy luminosity functions overour wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement withobservational data. the uv continuum turns out to be a poor star formationindicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.

astro-ph;0008216	modelling the extinction properties of galaxies	recently (granato, lacey, silva et al. 2000, astro-ph/0001308) we havecombined our spectrophotometric galaxy evolution code which includes dustreprocessing (grasil, silva et al. 1998) with semi-analytical galaxy formationmodels (galform, cole et al. 1999). one of the most characteristic features ofthe former is that the dust is divided in two main phases: molecular cloudcomplexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellarmedium. as a consequence, stellar populations of different ages have differentgeometrical relationships with the two phases, which is essential inunderstanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular thoseundergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. indeed, our mergedgrasil+galform model reproduces fairly well the seds of normal spirals andstarbursts from the far-uv to the sub-mm and their internal extinctionproperties. in particular in the model the observed starburst attenuation law(calzetti 1999) is accounted for as an effect of geometry of stars and dust,and has nothing to do with the optical properties of dust grains.

astro-ph;0201085	on core collapse supernovae in normal and in seyfert galaxies	this paper estimates the relative frequency of different types ofcore-collapse supernovae, in terms of the ratio f between the number of typeib--ic and of type ii supernovae. we estimate f independently for all normaland seyfert galaxies whose radial velocity is &lt;=14000 km/s, and which had atleast one supernova event recorded in the asiago catalogue from january 1986 toaugust 2000. we find that the ratio f is approx. 0.23+/-0.05 in normalgalaxies. this value is consistent with constant star formation rate and with asalpeter initial mass function and average binary rate approx. 50 %. on thecontrary, seyfert galaxies exceed the ratio f in normal galaxies by a factorapprox. 4 at a confidence level &gt;= 2 sigma. a caveat is that the numbers forseyferts are still small (6 type ib-ic and 6 type ii supernovae discovered asyet). assumed real, this excess of type ib and ic with respect to type iisupernovae, may indicate a burst of star formation of young age (&lt;= 20 myr), ahigh incidence of binary systems in the inner regions (r &lt;= 0.4 r25) of seyfertgalaxies, or a top-loaded mass function.

0808.2899	the mid-infrared colour-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies in the  coma cluster as measured by spitzer-irs	we use 16 micron, spitzer-irs, blue peakup photometry of 50 early-typegalaxies in the coma cluster to define the mid-infrared colour-magnituderelation. we compare with recent simple stellar population models that includethe mid-infrared emission from the extended, dusty envelopes of evolved stars.the ks-[16] colour in these models is very sensitive to the relative populationof dusty asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. we find that the passivelyevolving early-type galaxies define a sequence of approximately constant age(~10 gyr) with varying metallicity. several galaxies that lie on theoptical/near-infrared colour-magnitude relation do not lie on the mid-infraredrelation. this illustrates the sensitivity of the ks-[16] colour to age. thefact that a colour-magnitude relation is seen in the mid-infrared underlinesthe extremely passive nature of the majority (68%) of early-type galaxies inthe coma cluster. the corollary of this is that 32% of the early-type galaxiesin our sample are not `passive', insofar as they are either significantlyyounger than 10 gyr or they have had some rejuvenation episode within the lastfew gyr.

astro-ph;0307096	dust and nebular emission. i. models for normal galaxies	we present a model for nebular emission in star forming galaxies, which takesinto account the effects of dust reprocessing. the nebular emissions have beencomputed with cloudy and then included into grasil, our spectrophotometric codespecifically developed for dusty galaxies. the interface between nebularemission and population synthesis is based on a set of pre-computed hii regionemission models covering a wide range of physical quantities. concerning theextinction properties of normal star forming galaxies, we are able to interpretthe observed lack of correlation between the attenuation measured at halpha andin the uv band as a consequence of age selective extinction. we also find that,for these galaxies with modest sfr, the ratio fir/uv provides the bestconstraints on the uv attenuation. our model also allows to deal with differentsfr estimators in a consistent way, from the uv to radio wavelengths, and todiscuss the uncertainties arising from the different physical conditionsencountered in star forming galaxies. we provide our best estimates ofsfr/luminosity calibrations, together with their expected range of variation.it results that sfr derived through halpha, even when corrected for extinctionusing the balmer decrement, is affected by important uncertainties due to ageselective extinction. another remarkable result is that sfr from uv luminositycorrected by means of the ratio fir/uv has a small uncertainty. finally, ourmodel provides a calibration of sfr from radio luminosity; we are also able toreproduce the observed fir/radio ratio.

astro-ph;0403581	modelling the spectral energy distribution of compact luminous infrared  galaxies: constraints from high frequency radio data	we have performed 23 ghz vla observations of 7 compact, luminous infraredgalaxies, selected to have evidence of starburst activity. new and publishedmulti-frequency data are combined to obtain the spectral energy distributionsof all 7 galaxies from the near-infrared to the radio (at 1.4 ghz). these sedsare compared with new models, for dust enshrouded galaxies, which account forboth starburst and agn components. in all 7 galaxies the starburst provides thedominant contribution to the infrared luminosity; in 4 sources no contributionfrom an agn is required. although agn may contribute up to 50 percent of thetotal far--infrared emission, the starbursts always dominate in the radio. theseds of most of our sources are best fit with a very high optical depth of(&gt;=50) at 1 micron. the scatter in the far-infrared/radio correlation, foundamong luminous iras sources, is due mainly to the different evolutionary statusof their starburst components. the short time-scale of the star formationprocess amplifies the delay between the far-infrared and radio emission. thisbecomes more evident at low radio frequencies (below about 1 ghz) wheresynchrotron radiation is the dominant process. in the far-infrared (atwavelengths shorter than 100 micron) an additional source of scatter isprovided by agn, where present. agn may be detected in the near-infrared by theabsence of the knee, typical of stellar photospheres. however, near-infrareddata alone cannot constrain the level at which agn contribute because theinterpretation of their observed properties, in this wave-band, dependsstrongly on model parameters.

astro-ph;0406506	is the giant elliptical galaxy ngc5018 a post-merger remnant?	ngc5018, one of the weakest uv emitters among giant ellipticals (ge) observedwith iue, appears to consist of an optical stellar population very similar tothat of the compact, dwarf elliptical m32, which is several magnitudes fainterin luminosity than ngc5018 and whose stellar population is know to be ~3 gyrold. here we show that the mid-uv spectra of these two galaxies are also verysimilar down to an angular scale hundreds times smaller than the iue largeaperture (as probed by hst/fos uv spectra obtained through 0.86 arcsecapertures). this implies a reasonably close match of the populations dominatingtheir mid-uv light (namely, their main-sequence turnoff stars). these dataindicate that ngc5018 has, in its inner regions, a rather uniform dominance ofa ~3 gyr-old stellar population, probably a bit different in metallicity fromm32. combined with the various structures that indicate that ngc5018 is theresult of a recent major merger, it appears that almost all of stars we see inits center regions were formed about 3 gyr ago, in that merger event. ngc5018is likely the older brother of ngc7252, the canonical ge-in-formation merger.as such, ngc5018 is perhaps the best galaxy which can tell us how a mergerworks, after the fireworks subside, to form a ge galaxy today. for this reasonalone, the stellar populations in ngc5018 at all radii are worth studying indetail.

astro-ph;0609175	nearby early-type galaxies with ionized gas. iii. analysis of  line-strength indices with new stellar population models	in this paper we study the underlying stellar population of a sample of 65nearby early-type galaxies predominantly located in low density environments.ages, metallicities and [alpha/fe] ratios have been derived through thecomparison of lick indices measured at different galacto-centric distances withnew ssp models which account for the presence of alpha/fe enhancement. the sspscover a wide range of ages, metallicities and [alpha/fe] ratios. to derive thestellar population parameters we have devised an algorithm based on theprobability density function. we derive a large spread in age ((1-15) gyrs).age does not show any significant trend with central velocity dispersionsigma_c but e galaxies appear on average older than s0. on the contrary, anincreasing trend of metallicity and [alpha/fe] with sigma_c is observed,testifying that the chemical enrichment was more efficient and the duration ofthe star formation shorter in more massive galaxies. we have also sought forpossible correlations with the local galaxy density but neither metallicity noralpha-enhancement show clear trends. however we find that while low densityenvironments (lde) contain very young objects (from 1 to 4 gyr), none of thegalaxies in the higher density environments (hde) is younger than 5 gyrs.considering the lack of environmental effect on the [alpha/fe] ratio and thehigh value of [alpha/fe] in some young massive objects, we argue that younggalaxies in lde are more likely due to recent rejuvenation episodes. bycomparing the number of rejuvenated objects with the total number of galaxiesin our sample, and by means of simple two-ssp component models, we estimatethat, on average, the rejuvenation episodes do not involve more than 25 % ofthe total galaxy mass.

astro-ph;0612087	uv dust attenuation in spiral galaxies: the role of age-dependent  extinction and of the imf	we analyse the attenuation properties of a sample of uv selected galaxies,with the use of the spectrophotometric model grasil. in particular, we focus onthe relation between dust attenuation and the reddening in the uv spectralregion. we show that a realistic modelling of geometrical distribution of dustand of the different population of stars can explain the uv reddening of normalspiral galaxies also with a standard milky way dust. our results clearlyunderline that it is fundamental to take into account that younger stars suffera higher attenuation than older stars (the age-dependent extinction) becausestars are born in more-than-average dusty environments. in this work we alsofind that the concentration of young stars on the galactic plane of spirals hasa relevant impact on the expected uv colours, impact that has not been exploredbefore this paper. finally, we discuss the role of imf in shaping the relationbetween uv reddening and dust attenuation, and we show that a kroupa imf ismore consistent with observed data than the classical salpeter imf.

astro-ph;0702451	stellar populations in field early-type galaxies	we have acquired intermediate resolution spectra in the 3700-7000 awavelength range for a sample of 65 early-type galaxies predominantly locatedin low density environments, a large fraction of which show emission lines. thespectral coverage and the high quality of the spectra allowed us to derive lickline-strength indices and to study their behavior at different galacto-centricdistances. ages, metallicities and element abundance ratios have been derivedfor the galaxy sample by comparison of the line-strength index data set withour new developed simple stellar population (ssp) models. we have analyzed thebehavior of the derived stellar population parameters with the central galaxyvelocity dispersion and the local galaxy density in order to understand therole played by mass and environment on the evolution of early-type galaxies. wefind that the chemical path is mainly driven by the halo mass, more massivegalaxies exhibiting the more efficient chemical enrichment and shorter starformation timescales. galaxies in denser environments are on average older thangalaxies in less dense environments. the last ones show a large age spreadwhich is likely to be due to rejuvenation episodes.

astro-ph;9602003	spectro-photometric evolution of elliptical galaxies. ii. models with  infall	in this paper we present new chemo-spectro-photometric models of ellipticalgalaxies in which infall of primordial gas is allowed to occur. they aim tosimulate the collapse of a galaxy made of two components, i.e. luminousmaterial and dark matter. the mass of the dark component is assumed to beconstant in time, whereas that of the luminous material is supposed to accreteat a suitable rate. they also include the effect of galactic winds powered bysupernova explosions and stellar winds from massive, early-type stars. themodels are constrained to match a number of properties of elliptical galaxies,i.e. the slope and mean colours of the colour-magnitude relation (cmr), vversus (v--k), the uv excess as measured by the colour (1550--v) together withthe overall shape of the integrated spectral energy distribution (ised) in theultraviolet, the relation between the mg2 index and (1550--v), the mass to blueluminosity ratio m/lb as a function of the b luminosity, and finally thebroad-band colours (u--b), (b--v), (v--i), (v--k), etc.

astro-ph;9705060	diagnostic of chemical abundances and ages from the line strength  indices hb, &lt;fe&gt;, and mg2: what do they really imply ?	the line strength indices hb, mg2, and &lt;fe&gt;, together with their gradientsand dependence on the galaxy luminosity (mass), observed in elliptical galaxiesare customarily considered as reliable indicators of systematic differences inage and abundances of mg and fe. in this paper, we address the question whetheror not the indices mg2 and &lt;fe&gt; (and their gradients) are real indicators ofchemical abundances and enhancement of these or other effects must be takeninto account. we show that this is not the case because the above indices areseverely affected by the unknown relative percentage of stars as function ofthe metallicity. in order to cast the problem, first we provide basiccalibrations for the variations dhb, dmg2, and d&lt;fe&gt; as a function of the agedlog(t) (in gyr), metallicity dlog(z/z_o), and d[mg/fe]. second, we analyze theimplications of the gradients in mg2 and &lt;fe&gt; observed across these systems.finally, the above calibration is used to explore the variations from galaxy togalaxy of the nuclear values of hb, mg2, and &lt;fe&gt;. the differences dhb, dmg2,and d&lt;fe&gt; are converted to differences dlog(t), dlog(z/z_o), and d[mg/fe]. wethoroughly examine the relationship dlog(t)-mv, dlog(z/z_o)-mv, andd[mg/fe]-mv, and advance the suggestion that the duration of the star formingperiod gets longer or the age of the last episode of stellar activity getscloser to the present at decreasing galaxy mass. this result is discussed inthe context of current theories of galaxy formation and evolution. i.e. mergerand isolation. in brief, we conclude that none of these can explain the resultsof our analysis, and suggest that the kind of time and space dependent imfproposed by padoan et al. (1997) and the associated models of ellipticalgalaxies elaborated by chiosi et al. (1997) should be at work.

astro-ph;9707080	source counts and background radiation	our present understanding of the extragalactic source counts and backgroundradiation at infrared and sub-mm wavelengths is reviewed. available count dataare used to constrain evolutionary models of galaxies and active nuclei. thecirb, on the other hand, provides crucial information on the integrated past iremissivity, including sources so faint to be never accessible. the near-ir andsub-mm are suited to search for the cirb. these cosmological windows are idealto detect redshifted photons from the two most prominent broad emissionfeatures in galaxy spectra: the stellar photospheric 1 micron peak and the oneat 100 micron due to dust re-radiation. the recently claimed detection of anisotropic diffuse component at 100-200 microns would support the evidence forstrong cosmic evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim 2$ of faint gas-rich late-typegalaxies, as inferred from direct long-$\lambda$ counts. furthermore, anequally intense cirb flux measured in the wavelength range 200 to 500 $\mu m$may be in support of models envisaging a dust-enshrouded phase during formationof spheroidal galaxies (e.g. franceschini et al., 1994): the backgroundspectrum at such long wavelengths would indicate an high redshift ($z&gt;2-3$) forthis active phase of star formation, implying a relevant constraint onstructure formation scenarios. we argue that, given the difficulties for skysurveys in this spectral domain, only sporadic tests of these ideas will beachieved in the next several years. only a mission like first, in combinationwith large mm arrays and optical telescopes, will allow to thoroughlyinvestigate, via photometric and spectroscopic surveys, these ir-bright earlyphases in the evolution of galaxies and agns.

astro-ph;9708123	a new scenario of galaxy evolution under a universal imf	in this paper, basic observational properties of elliptical galaxies such asthe integrated spectra, the chemical abundances and the enhancement of$\alpha$-elements inferred from broad-band colors and line strength indices$mg_2$ and $&lt; fe &gt;$ (and their gradients), the color-magnitude relation, the uvfluxes, and the mass-luminosity ratios, are examined in the light of currenttheoretical interpretations, and attention is called on several points ofinternal contradiction. indeed existing models for the formation and evolutionof elliptical galaxies are not able to simultaneously account for all of theabove observational features. we suggest that the new initial mass function(imf) by padoan et al. (1997), which depends on the temperature, density, andvelocity dispersion of the medium in which stars are formed, may constitute abreak-through in the difficulties in question. models of elliptical galaxiesincorporating the new imf (varying with time and position inside a galaxy) arepresented and discussed at some extent. as a result of the changing imf, theenhancement of $\alpha$-elements and tilt of the fundamental plane are easilyexplained leaving unaltered the interpretation of the remaining propertiesunder examination. finally, some implications concerning the relativeproportions of visible stars, collapsed remnants (baryonic dark matter), andgas left over by the star forming process are examined.

astro-ph;9709084	modelling intermediate age and old stellar populations in the infrared	we have investigated the spectro-photometric properties of the asymptoticgiant branch (agb) stars and their contribution to the integrated infraredemission in simple stellar populations (ssp). adopting analytical relationsdescribing the evolution of these stars in the hr diagram and empiricalrelations for the mass-loss rate and the wind terminal velocity, we were ableto model the effects of the dusty envelope around these stars, with a minimalnumber of parameters. we computed isochrones at different age and initial metalcontent. we compare our models with existing infrared colors of m giants andmira stars and with iras psc data. contrary to previous models, in the newisochrones the mass-loss rate, which establishes the duration of the agb phase,also determines the spectral properties of the stars. the contribution of thesestars to the integrated light of the population is thus obtained in aconsistent way. we find that the emission in the mid infrared is about oneorder of magnitude larger when dust is taken into account in an intermediateage population, irrespective of the particular mixture adopted. the dependenceof the integrated colors on the metallicity and age is discussed, withparticular emphasis on the problem of age-metallicity degeneracy. we show that,contrary to the case of optical or near infrared colors, the adoption of asuitable pass-band in the mid infrared allows a fair separation of the twoeffects. we suggest intermediate redshift elliptical galaxies as possibletargets of this method of solving the age-metallicity dilemma. the new sspmodels constitute a first step in a more extended study aimed at modelling thespectral properties of the galaxies from the ultraviolet to the far infrared.

astro-ph;9710079	spectro-photometric evolution of elliptical galaxies. iii. infall models  with gradients in mass and star formation	in this study we present a simple model of elliptical galaxies aimed atinterpreting the gradients in colours and narrow band indices observed acrossthese systems. salient features of the model are the gradients in mass densityand star formation and infall of primordial gas aimed at simulating thecollapse of a galaxy into the potential well of dark matter. adopting amulti-zone model we follow in detail the history of star formation, gasconsumption, and chemical enrichment of the galaxy and also allow for theoccurrence of galactic winds according to the classical supernova (and stellarwinds) energy deposit. the outline of the model, the time scale of gasaccretion and rate of star formation as a function of the galacto-centricdistance in particular, seek to closely mimic the results from tree-sphdynamical models. although same specific ingredients of the model can bequestioned from many points of view (of which we are well aware) the modelpredictions have to be considered as a gross tool for exploring theconsequences of different receipts of gas accretion and star formation in whichthe simple one-zone scheme is abandoned. with the aid of this model we discussthe observational data on the gradients in metallicity, colour, and narrow bandindices across elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9710093	tp-agb stars with envelope burning	in this paper we focus on the tp-agb evolution of intermediate-mass starsexperiencing envelope burning (m=4-5mo). the approach we have adopted is asemi-analytical one as it combines analytical relationships derived fromcomplete models of tp-agb stars with sole envelope models in which the physicalstructure is calculated from the photosphere down to the core. our efforts aredirected to analyse the effects produced by envelope burning, such as: i) theenergy contribution which may drive significant deviations from the standardcore mass-luminosity relationship; and ii) the changes in the surface chemicalcomposition due to nuclear burning via the cno cycle. evolutionary models forstars with initial mass of 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 mo and two choices of the initialchemical composition ([y=0.28,z=0.02] and [y=0.25,z=0.008]) are calculated fromthe first thermal pulse till the complete ejection of the envelope. we findthat massive tp-agb stars can rapidly reach high luminosities (-6&gt;mbol&gt;-7),without exceeding, however, the classical limit to the agb luminosity ofmbol~-7.1 corresponding to the chandrasekhar value of the core mass. no carbonstars brighter than mbol~-6.5 are predicted to form (the alternative of apossible transition from m-star to c-star during the final pulses is alsoexplored), in agreement with observations which indicate that most of the veryluminous agb stars are oxygen-rich. finally, new chemical yields from stars inthe mass range 4-5 mo are presented, so as to extend the sets of stellar yieldsfrom low-mass stars already calculated by marigo et al. (1996). for each cnoelement we give both the secondary and the primary components.

astro-ph;9711141	evolution of massive stars under new mass-loss rates for rsg: is the  mystery of the missing blue gap solved ?	in this paper we present new models of massive stars based on recentadvancements in the theory of diffusive mixing and a new empirical formulationof the mass-loss rates of red supergiant stars. we compute two sets of stellarmodels of massive stars with initial chemical composition [z=0.008, y=0.25] and[z=0.020, y=0.28]. mass loss by stellar wind is also taken into accountaccording to the empirical relationship by de jager et al. (1988). despite thenew mixing prescription, these models share the same problems of older modelsin literature as far as the interpretation of the observational distribution ofstars across the hrd is concerned. examining possible causes of the failure, wefind that the adopted rate of mass loss for the red supergiant stagesunder-estimates the observational values by a large factor. revising the wholeproblem, first we adopt the recent formulation by feast (1991), and secondly wetake also into account the possibility that the dust to gas ratio varies withthe stellar luminosity. stellar models are then calculated with the newprescription for the mass-loss rates. the models now possess very extendedloops in the hrd and are able to match the distribution of stars across the hrdfrom the earliest to the latest spectral types both in the milky way, lmc andsmc. finally, because the surface h-abundance is close to the limit adopted tostart the wolf-rayet phase (wnl type), we suggest that a new channel ispossible for the formation of low luminosity wnl stars, i.e. by progenitorswhose mass can be as low as 20 \msol, that have evolved horizontally across thehrd following the blue-red-blue scheme and suffering large mass loss during thered supergiant stages.

astro-ph;9910032	star formation history of early-type galaxies in low density  environments	in this paper we analyze the line-strength indices in the lick-systemmeasured by longhetti et al. (1998a, b) for a sample of 51 early-type galaxieslocated in low density environments (lde) and showing signatures of finestructures and/or interactions. the sample contains 21 shell-galaxies and 30members of interacting pairs. firstly we perform a preliminary comparisonbetween three different sources of calibrations of the line strength indices,namely buzzoni et al. (1992, 1994), worthey (1992), worthey et al. (1994) andidiart et al. (1995), derived from stars with different effective temperature,gravity, and metallicity. secondly, we discuss the properties of the galaxiesin our sample by comparing them both with theoretical single stellarpopulations (ssps) and the {\sl normal} galaxies of the gonz\'alez (1993: g93)sample. the analysis is performed by means of several diagnostic planes. in theh$\beta$ vs. [mgfe] plane, which is perhaps best suited to infer the age of thestellar populations, the peculiar galaxies in our sample show nearly the samedistribution of the {\sl normal} galaxies in the g93 sample. there is however anumber of peculiar galaxies with much stronger h$\beta$. does this mean thatthe scatter in the h$\beta$ vs. [mgfe] plane, of normal, shell- andpair-galaxies has a common origin, perhaps a secondary episode of starformation? we suggest that, owing to their apparent {\sl youth}, shell- andpair-galaxies should have experienced at least one interaction event aftertheir formation. the explanation comes natural for shell- and pair-galaxieswhere the signatures of interactions are evident. it is more intrigued in {\slnormal} galaxies (perhaps other causes may concur).
