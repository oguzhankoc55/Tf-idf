0901.1133	grb light curves in the relativistic turbulence model	randomly oriented relativistic emitters in a relativistically expanding shellprovides an alternative to internal shocks as a mechanism for producing grbs'variable light curves with efficient conversion of energy to radiation. in thismodel the relativistic outflow is broken into small emitters movingrelativistically in the outflow's rest frame. variability arises because anobserver sees an emitter only when its velocity points towards him so that onlya small fraction of the emitters are seen by a given observer. models withsignificant relativistic random motions require converting and maintaining alarge fraction of the overall energy into these motions. while it is not clearhow this is achieved, we explore here, using two toy models, the constraints onparameters required to produce light curves comparable to the observations. wefind that a tight relation between the size of the emitters and the bulk andrandom lorentz factors is needed and that the random lorentz factor determinesthe variability. while both models successfully produce the observedvariability there are several inconsistencies with other properties of thelight curves. most of which, but not all, might be resolved if the centralengine is active for a long time producing a number of shells, resembling tosome extent the internal shocks model.

0902.0376	inhomogeneity in the supernova remnant distribution as the origin of the  pamela anomaly	recent measurements of the positron/electron ratio in the cosmic ray (cr)flux exhibits an apparent anomaly, whereby this ratio increases between 10 and100 gev. we show that inhomogeneity of cr sources on a scale of order a kpc,can naturally explain this anomaly. if the nearest major cr source is about akpc away, then low energy electrons ($\sim 1$ gev) can easily reach us. athigher energies ($\gtrsim 10$ gev), the source electrons cool via synchrotronand inverse-compton before reaching earth. pairs formed in the local vicinitythrough the proton/ism interactions can reach earth also at high energies, thusincreasing the positron/electron ratio. a natural origin of sourceinhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae in the galactic spiralarms. assuming supernova remnants (snrs) as the sole primary source of crs, andtaking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, weconsistently recover the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 gev.atic's electron excess at $\sim 600$ gev is explained, in this picture, as thecontribution of a few known nearby snrs. the apparent coincident similaritybetween the cooling time of electrons at 10 gev (where the positron/electronratio upturn), $\sim 10$ myr, and the crs protons cosmogenic age at the sameenergy is predicted by this model.

0902.1527	astro2010 decadal survey whitepaper: coordinated science in the  gravitational and electromagnetic skies	it is widely expected that the coming decade will witness the first directdetection of gravitational waves (gws). the ground-based ligo and virgo gwobservatories are being upgraded to advanced sensitivity, and are expected toobserve a significant binary merger rate. the launch of the laserinterferometer space antenna (lisa) would extend the gw window to lowfrequencies, opening new vistas on dynamical processes involving massive (m &gt;~10^5 m_sun) black holes. gw events are likely to be accompanied byelectromagnetic (em) counterparts and, since information carriedelectromagnetically is complementary to that carried gravitationally, a greatdeal can be learned about an event and its environment if it becomes possibleto measure both forms of radiation in concert. measurements of this kind willmark the dawn of trans-spectral astrophysics, bridging two distinct spectralbands of information. the aim of this whitepaper is to articulate futuredirections in both theory and observation that are likely to impact broadastrophysical inquiries of general interest. what will em observations reflecton the nature and diversity of gw sources? can gw sources be exploited ascomplementary probes of cosmology? what cross-facility coordination will expandthe science returns of gravitational and electromagnetic observations?

0903.2557	klein-nishina effects on optically thin synchrotron and synchrotron  self-compton spectrum	we present analytic approximations to the optically thin synchrotron andsynchrotron self-compton (ssc) spectra when klein-nishina (kn) effects areimportant and pair production and external radiation fields can be neglected.this theory is useful for analytical treatment of radiation from astrophysicalsources, such as gamma-ray bursts (grbs), active galactic nuclei and pulsarwind nebula, where kn effects may be important. we consider a source with acontinuous injection of relativistic electrons with a power-law energydistribution above some typical injection energy. we find that thesynchrotron-ssc spectra can be described by a broken power-law, and provideanalytic estimates for the break frequencies and power-law indices. in general,we show that the dependence of the kn cross-section on the energy of theupscattering electron results in a hardening of the energy distribution of fastcooling electrons and therefore in a hardening of the observed synchrotronspectrum. as a result the synchrotron spectrum of fast cooling electrons, belowthe typical injection energy, can be as hard as $f_\nu \propto \nu^0$, insteadof the classical $\nu^{-1/2}$ when kn effects are neglected. the synchrotronenergy output can be dominated by electrons with energy above the typicalinjection energy. we solve self-consistently for the cooling frequency and findthat the transition between synchrotron and ssc cooling can result in adiscontinuous variations of the cooling frequency and the synchrotron and sscspectra. we demonstrate the application of our results to theory by applyingthem to prompt and afterglow emission models of grbs.

0706.2881	cluster merger shock constraints on particle acceleration and nonthermal  pressure in the intracluster medium	x-ray observations of galaxy cluster merger shocks can be used to constrainnonthermal processes in the intracluster medium (icm). the presence ofnonthermal pressure components in the icm, as well as the shock acceleration ofparticles and their escape, all affect shock jump conditions in distinct ways.therefore, these processes can be constrained using x-ray surface brightnessand temperature maps of merger shock fronts. here we use these observations toplace constraints on particle acceleration efficiency in intermediate machnumber (m ~ 2-3) shocks and explore the potential to constrain the contributionof nonthermal components (e.g., cosmic rays, magnetic field, and turbulence) toicm pressure in cluster outskirts. we model the hydrodynamic jump conditions inmerger shocks discovered in the galaxy clusters a520 (m ~ 2) and 1e 0657-56 (m~ 3) using a multifluid model comprised of a thermal plasma, a nonthermalplasma, and a magnetic field. based on the published x-ray spectroscopic dataalone, we find that the fractional contribution of cosmic rays accelerated inthese shocks is lower than about 10% of the shock downstream pressure. currentobservations do not constrain the fractional contribution of nonthermalcomponents to the pressure of the undisturbed shock upstream. future x-rayobservations, however, have the potential to either detect particleacceleration in these shocks through its effect on the shock dynamics, or toplace a lower limit on the nonthermal pressure contributions in the undisturbedicm. we briefly discuss implications for models of particle acceleration incollisionless shocks and the estimates of galaxy cluster masses derived fromx-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations.

0905.0904	inhomogeneity in the supernova remnants as a natural explanation of the  pamela/atic observations	recent measurements of the positron/electron ratio in the cosmic ray (cr)flux exhibits an apparent anomaly, whereby this ratio increases between 10 and100 gev. in contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standardscenario, in which cr positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactionsbetween the primary cr protons and the interstellar medium (ism). the positronexcess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay ofweakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source ofpairs. the common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke newphysics or new astrophysical sources. however, this line of argumentationrelies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous cr sourcedistribution. inhomogeneity of cr sources on a scale of order a kpc, cannaturally explain this anomaly. if the nearest major cr source is about a kpcaway, then low energy electrons (~gev) can easily reach us. at higher energies(&gt; 10 gev), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-comptonbefore reaching the solar vicinity. pairs formed in the local vicinity throughthe proton/ism interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,thus increasing the positron/electron ratio. a natural origin of sourceinhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiralarms. assuming supernova remnants (snrs) as the sole primary source of crs, andtaking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, weconsistently predict the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 gev,while abiding to different constraints such as the observed electron spectrumand the crs cosmogenic age. an atic like spectral excess at ~600 gev can beexplained, in this picture, as the contribution of a few known nearby snrs.

0912.0948	detectability of oort cloud objects using kepler	the size distribution and total mass of objects in the oort cloud haveimportant implications to the theory of planets formation, including theproperties of, and the processes taking place in the early solar system. wediscuss the potential of space missions like kepler and corot, designed todiscover transiting exo-planets, to detect oort cloud, kuiper belt and mainbelt objects by occultations of background stars. relying on publisheddynamical estimates of the content of the oort cloud, we find that kepler'smain program is expected to detect between 0 and ~100 occultation events bydeca-kilometer-sized oort cloud objects. the occultations rate depends on themass of the oort cloud, the distance to its "inner edge", and the sizedistribution of its objects. in contrast, kepler is unlikely to findoccultations by kuiper belt or main belt asteroids, mainly due to the fact thatit is observing a high ecliptic latitude field. occultations by solar systemobjects will appear as a photometric deviation in a single measurement,implying that the information regarding the time scale and light-curve shape ofeach event is lost. we present statistical methods that have the potential toverify the authenticity of occultation events by solar system objects, toestimate the distance to the occulting population, and to constrain their sizedistribution. our results are useful for planning of future space-basedexo-planet searches in a way that will maximize the probability of detectingsolar system objects, without hampering the main science goals.

1004.2496	early supernovae light-curves following the shock-breakout	the first light from a supernova (sn) emerges once the sn shock breaks out ofthe stellar surface. the first light, typically a uv or x-ray flash, isfollowed by a broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiationthat leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. motivated by recent detection ofemission from very early stages of several sne, we revisit the theory of shockbreakout and the following emission. we derive analytic light curves, payingspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermalequilibrium. we then consider the breakout from several sne progenitors. wefind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, wolf-rayet stars (wrs)and possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiationis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,before the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early sphericalphase. therefore, during these phases we predict significantly highertemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. when thermalequilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and itstemporal evolution. our results are useful for interpretation of early sn lightcurves. some examples are: (i) red supergiant sne have an early bright peak inoptical and uv flux, less than an hour after breakout. it is followed by aminimum at the end of the planar phase (about 10 hr), before it peaks againonce the temperature drops to the observed frequency range. in contrast wrsshow only the latter peak in optical and uv. (ii) bright x-ray flares areexpected from all core-collapse sne types. (iii) the light curve and spectrumof the initial breakout pulse holds information on the explosion geometry andprogenitor wind opacity. its spectrum in compact progenitors shows a(non-thermal) power-law.

1005.1932	radio and x-ray observations of the type ic sn 2007gr reveal an  ordinary, non-relativistic explosion	we present extensive radio and x-ray observations of the nearby type ic sn2007gr in ngc 1058 obtained with the very large array and the chandra x-rayobservatory and spanning 5 to 150 days after explosion. through our detailedmodeling of these data, we estimate the properties of the blastwave and thecircumstellar environment. we find evidence for a freely-expanding andnon-relativistic explosion with an average blastwave velocity, v~0.2c, and atotal internal energy for the radio emitting material of e ~ 2 x 10^46 ergassuming equipartition of energy between electrons and magnetic fields(epsilon_e=epsilon_b=0.1). the temporal and spectral evolution of the radioemission points to a stellar wind-blown environment shaped by a steadyprogenitor mass loss rate of mdot ~ 6 x 10^-7 solar masses per year (windvelocity, v_w=10^3 km/s). these parameters are fully consistent with thoseinferred for other sne ibc and are in line with the expectations for anordinary, homologous sn explosion. our results are at odds with those of paragiet al. (2010) who recently reported evidence for a relativistic blastwave in sn2007gr based on their claim that the radio emission was resolved away in a lowsignal-to-noise very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) observation. here weshow that the exotic physical scenarios required to explain the claimedrelativistic velocity -- extreme departures from equipartition and/or a highlycollimated outflow -- are excluded by our detailed very large array radioobservations. moreover, we present an independent analysis of the vlbi data andpropose that a modest loss of phase coherence provides a more naturalexplanation for the apparent flux density loss which is evident on both shortand long baselines. we conclude that sn 2007gr is an ordinary type ibcsupernova.

1102.1020	radio remnants of compact binary mergers - the electromagnetic signal  that will follow the gravitational waves	the question "what is the observable electromagnetic (em) signature of acompact binary merger?" is an intriguing one with crucial consequences to thequest for gravitational waves (gw). compact binary mergers are prime sources ofgw, targeted by current and next generation detectors. numerical simulationshave demonstrated that these mergers eject energetic sub-relativistic (or evenrelativistic) outflows. this is certainly the case if the mergers produce shortgrbs, but even if not, significant outflows are expected. the interaction ofsuch outflows with the surround matter inevitably leads to a long lasting radiosignal. we calculate the expected signal from these outflows (our calculationsare also applicable to short grb orphan afterglows) and we discuss theirdetectability. we show that the optimal search for such signal should,conveniently, take place around 1.4 ghz. realistic estimates of the outflowparameters yield signals of a few hundred $\mu$jy, lasting a few weeks, fromsources at the detection horizon of advanced gw detectors. followup radioobservations, triggered by gw detection, could reveal the radio remnant evenunder unfavorable conditions. upcoming all sky surveys can detect a few dozen,and possibly even thousands, merger remnants at any give time, therebyproviding robust merger rate estimates even before the advanced gw detectorsbecome operational. in fact, the radio transient rt 19870422 fits well theoverall properties predicted by our model and we suggest that its most probableorigin is a compact binary merger radio remnant.

1104.5249	two-stream-like instability in dilute hot relativistic beams and  astrophysical relativistic shocks	relativistic collisionless shocks are believed to be efficient particleaccelerators. nonlinear outcome of the interaction of accelerated particlesthat run ahead of the shock, the so-called "precursor", with the unperturbedplasma of the shock upstream, is thought to facilitate additional accelerationof these particles and to possibly modify the hydrodynamic structure of theshock. we explore here the linear growth of kinetic modes appearing in theprecursor-upstream interaction in relativistic shocks propagating in non andweakly magnetized plasmas: electrostatic two-stream parallel mode andelectrostatic oblique modes. these modes are of particular interest becausethey are the fastest growing modes known in this type of system. using asimplified distribution function for a dilute ultra-relativistic beam that isrelativistically hot in its own rest frame, yet has momenta that are narrowlycollimated in the frame of the cold upstream plasma into which it propagates,we identify the fastest growing mode in the full $k$-space and calculate itsgrowth rate. we consider all types of plasma (pairs and ions-electrons) andbeam (charged and charge-neutral). we find that unstable electrostatic modesare present in any type of plasma and for any shock parameters. we further findthat two modes, one parallel ($k_\perp=0$) and the other one oblique ($k_\perp\sim k_\|$), are competing for dominance and that either one may dominate thegrowth rate in different regions of the phase space. the dominant mode isdetermined mostly by the perpendicular spread of the accelerated particlemomenta in the upstream frame, which reflects the shock lorentz factor. theparallel mode becomes more dominant in shocks with lower lorentz factors (i.e.,with larger momentum spreads). we briefly discuss possible implications of ourresults for external shocks in gamma-ray burst sources.

1106.2556	relativistic shock breakouts - a variety of gamma-ray flares: from low  luminosity gamma-ray bursts to type ia supernovae	a large variety of explosions result in mildly or ultra relativistic shockbreakouts. here we calculate the luminosity and spectrum that these breakoutsproduce. in order to do so we improve an analytic description of relativisticradiation mediated shocks and follow the system from the breakout itself,through the planar phase and into the spherical phase. we limit our calculationto cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planarphase. (i.e., the final gas lorentz factor &lt;~30). we find that sphericalrelativistic breakouts produce a flash of gamma-rays with energy, temperature,and duration that always satisfy a specific relation between them as well asproviding the breakout radius and lorentz factor. the breakout flare istypically followed, on longer time scales, by x-rays that carry a comparableenergy. we apply our model to a variety of explosions, including ia and .iasupernovae (sne), aic, energetic sne and gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we find thatall these events produce detectable gamma-ray signals, some of which may havealready been seen. some particular examples are: (i) relativistic shockbreakouts provide a natural explanation to the energy, temperature and timescales, as well as many other observed features, of all low luminosity grbs.(ii) nearby broad-line ib/c (like sn 2002ap) may produce a detectable gamma-raysignal. (iii) galactic ia sne produce detectable gamma-ray flares, if theirprogenitors are single degenerate. we conclude that relativistic shock breakoutis a generic process for the production of gamma-ray flares, which opens a newwindow for the study and detection of a variety of stellar explosions.

1107.1326	the propagation of relativistic jets in external media	relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems that containcompact objects. they transport large amounts of energy to large distances fromthe source, and their interaction with the ambient medium has a crucial effecton the evolution of the system. the propagation of the jet is characterized bythe formation of a shocked "head" at the front of the jet which dissipates thejet's energy and a cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates it.we present here a self consistent, analytic model that follows the evolution ofthe jet and its cocoon, and describes their interaction. we show that thecritical parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon system isthe dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy density and the rest-massenergy density of the ambient medium. this parameter, together with the jet'sinjection angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon ornot. the model is applicable to relativistic, unmagnetized, jets on all scalesand may be used to determine the conditions in agns jets as well as in grbs ormicroquasars. it shows that agn and microquasar jets are hydrodynamicallycollimated due to the interaction with the ambient medium, while grb jets canbe collimated only inside a star and become uncollimated once they breakout.

1107.1346	are low luminosity grbs generated by relativistic jets?	low luminosity gamma-ray bursts (ll-grbs) constitute a sub-class of gamma-raybursts (grbs) that plays a central role in the grb-supernova connection. whilell-grbs differ from typical long grbs (lgrbs) in many aspects, they also sharesome common features. therefore, the question whether the gamma-ray emission ofll-grbs and lgrbs has a common origin is of great interest. here we addressthis question by testing whether ll-grbs, like lgrbs according to the collapsarmodel, can be generated by relativistic jets that punch holes in the envelopesof their progenitor stars. the collapsar model predicts that the durations ofmost observed bursts will be comparable to, or longer than, the time it takesthe jets to breakout of the star. we calculate the jet breakout times ofll-grbs and compare them to the observed durations. we find that there is asignificant access of ll-grbs with durations that are much shorter than the jetbreakout time and that these are inconsistent with the collapsar model. weconclude that the processes that dominate the gamma-ray emission of ll-grbs andof lgrbs are most likely fundamentally different.

1111.2990	an observational imprint of the collapsar model of long gamma ray bursts	the collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the well knownassociation between long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and collapsing massive stars.a bipolar relativistic jet, launched at the core of a collapsing star, drillsits way through the stellar envelope and breaks out of the surface beforeproducing the observed gamma-rays. while a wealth of observations associategrbs with the death of massive stars, as yet there is no direct evidence forthe collapsar model itself. here we show that a distinct signature of thecollapsar model is the appearance of a plateau in the duration distribution ofthe prompt grb emission at times much shorter than the typical breakout time ofthe jet. this plateau is evident in the data of all three major satellites.these findings provide an evidence that directly supports the collapsar model.additionally, it suggests the existence of a large population of choked(failed) grbs and that the 2 s duration commonly used to separate collapsarsand non-collapasars is inconsistent with the duration distributions of {\itswift} and fermi grbs and only holds for batse grbs.

1201.5124	on particle acceleration rate in grb afterglows	it is well known that collisionless shocks are major sites of particleacceleration in the universe, but the details of the acceleration process arestill not well understood. the particle acceleration rate, which can shed lighton the acceleration process, is rarely measured in astrophysical environments.here we use observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows, which are weaklymagnetized relativistic collisionless shocks in ion-electron plasma, toconstrain the rate of particle acceleration in such shocks. we find, based onx-ray and gev afterglows, an acceleration rate that is most likely very fast,approaching the bohm limit, when the shock lorentz factor is in the range of10-100. in that case x-ray observations may be consistent with no amplificationof the magnetic field in the shock upstream region. we examine the x-rayafterglow of grb 060729, which is observed for 642 days showing a sharp decayin the flux starting about 400 days after the burst, when the shock lorentzfactor is about 5. we find that inability to accelerate x-ray emittingelectrons at late time provides a natural explanation for the sharp decay, andthat also in that case acceleration must be rather fast, and cannot be morethan a 100 times slower than the bohm limit. we conclude that particleacceleration is most likely fast in grb afterglows, at least as long as theblast wave is ultra-relativistic.

1202.3437	optical to x-rays supernovae light curves following shock breakout  through a thick wind	recent supernovae (sne) observations have motivated renewed interest in snshock breakouts from stars surrounded by thick winds. in such events theinteraction with the wind powers the observed luminosity, and predictionsinclude observable hard x-rays. wind breakouts on timescales of a day or longerare currently the most probable for detection. here we study the signal thatfollows such events. we start from the breakout of the radiation mediatedshock, finding that the breakout temperature can vary significantly from oneevent to another ($10^4 - 5 \times 10^6$ k) due to possible deviation fromthermal equilibrium. in general, events with longer breakout pulse duration,$t_{bo}$, are softer. we follow the observed radiation through the evolution ofthe collisionless shock which forms after the breakout of the radiationmediated shock. we restrict the study of the collisionless shock evolution tocases where the breakout itself is in thermal equilibrium, peaking inoptical/uv. in these cases the post-breakout emission contains two spectralcomponents - soft (optical/uv) and hard (x-rays and possibly soft$\gamma$-rays). right after the breakout pulse x-rays are strongly suppressed,and they carry only a small fraction of the total luminosity. the hardcomponent becomes harder and its luminosity rises quickly afterwards, gainingdominance at $\sim 10-50 \,t_{bo}$. the ratio of the peak optical/uv to thepeak x-ray luminosity depends mostly on the breakout time. in terms ofprospects for x-ray and soft gamma-ray detections, it is best to observe100-500 days after explosions with breakout timescales between a week and amonth.

1206.0700	the long, the short and the weak - the origin of grbs	the origin of gamma-ray bursts is one of the most interesting puzzles inrecent astronomy. during the last decade a consensus formed that long grbs(lgrbs) arise from the collapse of massive stars and that short grbs (sgrbs)have a different origin, most likely neutron star mergers. a key ingredient ofthe collapsar model that explains how the collapse of massive stars produces agrb is the emergence of a relativistic jet that penetrates the stellarenvelope. the condition that the emerging jet penetrates the envelope posesstrong constraints on the system. using these constraints we show that: (i) lowluminosity grbs (llgrbs), a sub population of grbs with a very low luminosities(and other peculiar properties: single peaked, smooth and soft) cannot beformed by collapsars. llgrbs must have a different origin (most likely a shockbreakout). (ii) on the other hand regular lgrbs must be formed by collapsars.(iii) while for batse the dividing duration between collapsars andnon-collapsar is indeed at $\sim 2$ sec, the dividing duration is different forother grbs detectors. in particular most swift bursts longer than 0.8 sec areof a collapsar origin. this last results requires a revision of manyconclusions concerning the origin of swift sgrbs which were based on thecommonly used 2 sec limit.

1210.0068	short vs long and collapsars vs. non-collapsar: a quantitative  classification of grbs	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are traditionally divided to long and short accordingto their durations (&gt;/&lt; 2 sec). it was generally believed that this reflects adifferent physical origin: collapsars (long) and non-collapsars (short). wehave recently shown that the duration distribution of collapsars is flat,namely independent of the duration, at short durations. using this model forthe distribution of collapsars we determine the duration distribution ofnon-collapsars and estimate the probability that a burst with a given duration(and hardness) is a collapsar or not. we find that this probability dependsstrongly on the spectral window of the observing detector. while the commonlyused limit of 2 sec is conservative and suitable for batse bursts, 40% ofswift's bursts shorter than 2 sec are collapsars and division &gt;/&lt;0.8 sec ismore suitable for swift. we find that the duration overlap of the twopopulations is very large. on the one hand there is a non-negligible fractionof non-collapsars longer than 10 sec, while on the other hand even burstsshorter than 0.5 sec in the swift sample have a non-negligible probability tobe collapsars. our results enable the construction of non-collapsar sampleswhile controlling the collapsar contamination. they also highlight that no firmconclusions can be drawn based on a single burst and they have numerousimplications concerning previous studies of non-collapsar properties that werebased on the current significantly contaminated swift samples of localizedshort grbs. specifically: (i) all known short bursts with z&gt;1 are most likelycollapsars, (ii) the only short burst with a clear jet break is most likely acollapsar, indicating our lack of knowledge concerning non-collapsar beaming(iii) the existence of non-collapsars with durations up to 10 sec impose newchallenges to non-collapsar models.

1210.3032	what can we learn from the rising lightcurves of radioactively-powered  supernovae?	the lightcurve of the explosion of a star with a radius &lt;10-100rsun ispowered mostly by radioactive decay. observationally such events are dominatedby hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as type i supernovae: whitedwarf thermonuclear explosions (type ia) and core collapses ofhydrogen-stripped massive stars (type ibc). transient surveys are finding sne iin increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to bestudied in unprecedented detail. motivated by these developments, we summarizethe physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observationscan be utilized to study these exploding stars. the early radioactive-poweredlightcurves probe the shallowest 56ni deposits. if the amount of 56ni mixingcan be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties ofthe explosive burning. in practice we find it is difficult to disentanglewhether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56ni heating near thesurface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56ni heating is deeper.in the latter case there is a "dark phase" between the moment of explosion andthe first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56ni. because of this,simply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56ni back in time is not a reliablemethod for estimating the explosion time. the best solution is to directlyidentify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout orshock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the risinglightcurve is known. since this is typically not available, we identify otherdiagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosionoccurred. as an example we apply these arguments to the sn ic ptf 10vgv. wedemonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity andtemperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,and 56ni mixing.

1211.6438	constraints on shallow 56ni from the early lightcurves of type ia  supernovae	ongoing transient surveys are presenting an unprecedented account of therising lightcurves of type ia supernovae (sne ia). this early emission probesthe shallowest layers of the exploding white dwarf, which can provideconstraints on the progenitor star and the properties of the explosive burning.we use semi-analytic models of radioactively-powered rising lightcurves toanalyze these observations. as we have summarized in previous work, the mainlimiting factor in determining the surface distribution of 56ni is the lack ofan unambiguously identified time of explosion, as would be provided bydetection of shock breakout or shock-heated cooling. without this the sn may inprinciple exhibit a "dark phase" for a few hours to days, where the onlyemission is from shock-heated cooling that is too dim to be detected. we showthat by assuming a theoretically-motivated time-dependent velocity evolution,the explosion time can be better constrained, albeit with potential systematicuncertainties. this technique is used to infer the surface 56ni distributionsof three recent sne ia that were caught especially early in their rise. in allthree we find fairly similar 56ni distributions. observations of sn 2011fe andsn 2012cg probe shallower depths than sn 2009ig, and in these two cases 56ni ispresent merely ~0.01msun from the wds' surfaces. the uncertainty in this resultis up to an order of magnitude given the difficulty of precisely constrainingthe explosion time. we also use our conclusions about the explosion times toreassess radius constraints for the progenitor of sn 2011fe, as well as discussthe roughly t^2 power law that is inferred for many observed risinglightcurves.

1301.6759	radius constraints and minimal equipartition energy of relativistically  moving synchrotron sources	a measurement of the synchrotron self-absorption flux and frequency providestight constraints on the physical size of the source and a robust lower limiton its energy. this lower limit is also a good estimate of the magnetic fieldand electrons' energy, if the two components are at equipartition. thiswell-known method was used for decades to study numerous astrophysical sourcesmoving at non-relativistic (newtonian) speeds. here we generalize the newtonianequipartition theory to sources moving at relativistic speeds including theeffect of deviation from spherical symmetry expected in such sources. like inthe newtonian case, minimization of the energy provides an excellent estimateof the emission radius and yields a useful lower limit on the energy. we findthat the application of the newtonian formalism to a relativistic source wouldyield a smaller emission radius, and would generally yield a larger lower limiton the energy (within the observed region). for sources where thesynchrotron-self-compton component can be identified, the minimization of thetotal energy is not necessary and we present an unambiguous solution for theparameters of the system.

1308.1727	recovering the observed b/c ratio in a dynamic spiral-armed cosmic ray  model	we develop a fully three dimensional numerical code describing the diffusionof cosmic rays in the milky way. it includes the nuclear spallation chain up tooxygen, and allows the study of various cosmic ray properties, such as the crage, grammage traversed, and the ratio between secondary and primary particles.this code enables us to explore a model in which a large fraction of the cosmicray acceleration takes place in the vicinity of galactic spiral arms and thatthese spiral arms are dynamic. we show that the effect of having dynamic spiralarms is to limit the age of cosmic rays at low energies. this is because at lowenergies the time since the last spiral arm passage governs the cosmic ray (cr)age, and not diffusion. using the model, the observed spectral dependence ofthe secondary to primary ratio is recovered without requiring any furtherassumptions such as a galactic wind, re-acceleration or various assumptions onthe diffusivity. in particular, we obtain a secondary to primary ratio whichincreases with energy below about 1 gev.

1309.3573	a wolf in sheepskin: extraordinary supernova 2012au veiled behind  ordinary radio emission	we present extensive radio and x-ray observations of sn\, 2012au, theenergetic radio luminous supernova of type ib that may be a link betweensubsets of hydrogen-poor superluminous and normal core-collapse supernovae. theobservations closely follow models of synchrotron emission from shock heatedcircum-burst medium that has a wind density profile ($\rho \propto r^{-2}$). weinfer a sub-relativistic velocity for the shock wave $v \approx 0.2\,c$ and aradius of $r \approx 1.4 \times 10^{16} \rm cm$ at 25 days after the estimateddate of explosion. for a constant wind velocity of 1000 km/s we determine theconstant mass loss rate of the progenitor to be $\dot{m} = 3.6 \times 10^{-6}\rm m_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, consistent with the estimates from x-ray observations.we estimate the total internal energy of the radio emitting material to be $e\approx 10^{47} \rm erg$, which is intermediate to sn\,1998bw and sn\,2002ap.evolution of the radio light curves of sn\,2012au is consistent withinteraction with a smoothly distributed circum-burst medium and absence ofstellar shells ejected from previous outbursts out to $r \approx 10^{17} \rmcm$ from the supernova site. based on this we conclude that the evolution ofthe sn\,2012au progenitor star was relatively quiet during the final yearspreceding explosion. we find that the bright radio emission from sn2012au wasnot dissimilar from other core collapse supernovae despite it's extraordinaryoptical properties. we speculate that it was the nature of the explosion thatled to the unusual demise of the sn2012au progenitor star.

1401.7013	supernovae with two peaks in the optical light curve and the signature  of progenitors with low-mass extended envelopes	early observations of supernova light curves are powerful tools for sheddinglight on the pre-explosion structures of their progenitors and their mass-losshistories just prior to explosion. some core-collapse supernovae that aredetected during the first days after the explosion prominently show two peaksin the optical bands, including the $r$ and $i$ bands, where the first peakappears to be powered by the cooling of shocked surface material and the secondpeak is clearly powered by radioactive decay. such light curves have beenexplored in detail theoretically for sn 1993j and 2011dh, where it was foundthat they may be explained by progenitors with extended, low-mass envelopes.here we generalize these results. we explore, first, whether any double-peakedlight curve of this type can be generated by a progenitor with a "standard"density profile, such as a red supergiant or a wolf-rayet star. we show that astandard progenitor (1) cannot produce a double-peaked light curve in the $r$and $i$ bands, and (2) cannot exhibit a fast drop in the bolometric luminosityas is seen after the first peak. we then explore the signature of a progenitorwith a compact core surrounded by extended, low-mass material. this may be ahydrostatic low-mass envelope or material ejected just prior to the explosion.we show that it naturally produces both of these features. we use this resultto provide simple formulae to estimate (1) the mass of the extended materialfrom the time of the first peak, (2) the extended material radius from theluminosity of the first peak, and (3) an upper limit on the core radius fromthe luminosity minimum between the two peaks.

1402.4477	spectrum and light curve of a supernova shock breakout through a thick  wolf-rayet wind	wolf-rayet stars are known to eject winds. thus, when a wolf-rayet starexplodes as a supernova, a fast, $&gt;30,000$ km/s, shock is expected to be driventhrough a wind. we study the signal expected from a fast supernova shockpropagating through an optically thick wind, and find that the electrons behindthe shock driven into the wind are cooled efficiently, by inverse compton oversoft photons that were deposited by the radiation mediated shock that crossedthe star. therefore, the bolometric luminosity is comparable to the kineticenergy flux through the shock, and the spectrum is found to be a power-law,which slope and frequency range depend on the number flux of soft photonsavailable for cooling. wolf-rayet supernovae that explode through a thick windhave a high flux of soft photons, producing a flat spectrum, $\nuf_{\nu}=const$, in the x-ray range $0.1\lesssim t\lesssim 50$ kev. as the shockexpands into an optically thin wind, the soft photons are no longer able tocool the shock that plows through the wind, and the bulk of the emission takesthe form of a standard core-collapse supernova (without a wind). however, asmall fraction of the soft photons is upscattered by the shocked wind andproduces a transient unique x-ray signature.

1403.3400	sn 2008d: a wolf-rayet explosion through a thick wind	supernova (sn) 2008d/xrt 080109 is considered to be the only direct detectionof a shock breakout from a regular sn to date. while a breakout interpretationwas favored by several papers, inconsistencies remain between the observationsand current sn shock breakout theory. most notably, the duration of theluminous x-ray pulse is considerably longer than expected for a sphericalbreakout through the surface of a type ibc sn progenitor, and the x-rayradiation features, mainly its flat spectrum and its luminosity evolution, areenigmatic. we apply a recently developed theoretical model for the observedradiation from a wolf-rayet sn exploding through a thick wind and show that itnaturally explains all the observed features of sn 2008d x-ray emission,including the energetics, the spectrum and the detailed luminosity evolution.we find that the inferred progenitor and sn parameters are typical for anexploding wolf-rayet. a comparison of the wind density found at the breakoutradius to the density at much larger radii, as inferred by late radioobservations, suggests an enhanced mass loss rate taking effect about ten daysor less prior to the sn explosion. this finding joins accumulating evidence fora possible late phase in the stellar evolution of massive stars, involvingvigorous mass loss a short time before the sn explosion.

1404.6313	recombination effects on supernovae light-curves	supernovae of type iip are marked by the long plateau seen in their opticallight curves. the plateau is believed to be the result of a recombination wavethat propagates through the outflowing massive hydrogen envelope. here, weanalytically investigate the transition from a fully ionized envelope to apartially recombined one and its effects on the sn light curve. the motivationis to establish the underlying processes which dominate the evolution at latetimes when recombination takes place in the envelope, yet early enough so that$^{56}$ni decay is a negligible source of energy. we assume a simple, yetadequate, hydrodynamic profile of the envelope and study the mechanisms whichdominate the energy emission and the observed temperature. we consider thediffusion of photons through the envelope while analyzing the ionizationfraction and the coupling between radiation and gas. we find that oncerecombination starts, the observed temperature decreases slowly in time.however, in a typical red supergiant (rsg) explosion, the recombination wavedoes not affect the bolometric luminosity immediately. only at later times, thecooling wave may reach layers that are deep enough to affect the luminosity. wefind that the plateau is not a generic result of a recombination process inexpanding gas. instead it depends on the density profile of the parts of theenvelope which undergo recombination. our results are useful to investigate thelight curves of rsg explosions. we show the resulting light curves of twoexamples of rsg explosions according to our model and discuss theircompatibility with observations. in addition, we improve the analyticalrelations between the plateau luminosity and plateau duration to the propertiesof the pre-explosion progenitor (arnett 1980; popov 1993).

0803.1803	the cluster-merger shock in 1e 0657-56	the merging galaxy cluster 1e 0657-56, known as the "bullet cluster," is oneof the hottest clusters known. the x-ray emitting plasma exhibitsbow-shock-like temperature and density jumps. the segregation of this plasmafrom the peaks of the mass distribution determined by gravitational lensing hasbeen interpreted as a direct proof of collisionless dark matter. if the highshock speed inferred from the shock jump conditions equals the relative speedof the merging cdm halos, however, this merger is predicted to be such a rareevent in a lcdm universe that observing it presents a possible conflict withthe lcdm model.  we examined this question using high resolution, 2d simulations of gasdynamics in cluster collisions to analyze the relative motion of the clusters,the bow shock, and the contact discontinuity, and relate these to the x-raydata for the bullet cluster. we find that the velocity of the fluid shock neednot equal the relative velocity of the cdm components. an illustrativesimulation finds that the present relative velocity of the cdm halos is 16%lower than that of the shock. while this conclusion is sensitive to thedetailed initial mass and gas density profiles of the colliding clusters, sucha decrease of the inferred halo relative velocity would significantly increasethe likelihood of finding 1e 0657-56 in a lcdm universe.

1407.4475	the afterglow of a relativistic shock breakout and low-luminosity grbs	the prompt emission of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (llgrbs) indicatesthat these events originate from a relativistic shock breakout. in this case wecan estimate, based on the properties of the prompt emission, the energydistribution of the ejecta. we develop a general formalism to estimate theafterglow produced by synchrotron emission from the forward shock resultingfrom the interaction of this ejecta with the circum-burst matter. we assesswhether this emission can produce the observed radio and x-ray afterglows ofthe available sample of 4 llgrbs. all 4 radio afterglows can be explainedwithin this model, providing further support for shock breakouts being theorigin of llgrbs. we find that in one of the llgrbs (grb 031203) the predictedx-ray emission, using the same parameters that fit the radio, can explain theobserved one. in another one (grb 980425) the observed x-rays can be explainedif we allow for a slight modification of the simplest model. for the last twocases (grbs 060218 and 100316d), we find that, as is the case for previousattempts to model these afterglows, the simplest model that fits the radioemission underpredicts the observed x-ray afterglows. using general arguments,we show that the most natural location of the x-ray source is, like the radiosource, within the ejecta-external medium interaction layer but that emissionis due to a different population of electrons or to a different emissionprocess.

1411.0681	the nature of ulx source m101 x-1: optically thick outflow from a  stellar mass black hole	the nature of ultra-luminous x-ray sources (ulxs) has long been plagued by anambiguity about whether the central compact objects are intermediate-mass(imbh, &gt;~ 10^3 m_sun) or stellar-mass (a few tens m_sun) black holes (bhs). thehigh luminosity (~ 10^39 erg/s) and super-soft spectrum (t ~ 0.1 kev) duringthe high state of the ulx source x-1 in the galaxy m101 suggest a largeemission radius (&gt;~ 10^9 cm), consistent with being an imbh accreting at asub-eddington rate. however, recent kinematic measurement of the binary orbitof this source and identification of the secondary as a wolf-rayet star suggesta stellar-mass bh primary with a super-eddington accretion. if that is thecase, a hot, optically thick outflow from the bh can account for the largeemission radius and the soft spectrum. by considering the interplay of photons'absorption and scattering opacities, we determine the radius and mass densityof the emission region of the outflow and constrain the outflow mass loss rate.the analysis presented here can be potentially applied to other ulxs withthermally dominated spectra, and to other super-eddington accreting sources.

1503.00441	a unified picture for low-luminosity and long gamma-ray bursts based on  the extended progenitor of llgrb 060218/sn 2006aj	the relation between long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) and low-luminosity grbs(llgrbs) is a long standing puzzle -- on the one hand their high energyemission properties are fundamentally different, implying a different gamma-raysource, yet both are associated with similar supernovae of the same peculiartype (broad-line ic), pointing at a similar progenitor and a similar explosionmechanism. here we analyze the multi-wavelength data of the particularlywell-observed sn 2006aj, associated with llgrb 060218, finding that itsprogenitor star is sheathed in an extended ($&gt;100r_\odot$), low-mass ($\sim0.01m_\odot$) envelope. this progenitor structure implies that the gamma-rayemission in this llgrb is generated by a mildly relativistic shock breakout. italso suggests a unified picture for llgrbs and lgrbs, where the key differenceis the existence of an extended low-mass envelope in llgrbs and its absence inlgrbs. the same engine, which launches a relativistic jet, can drive the twoexplosions, but, while in lgrbs the ultra-relativistic jet emerges from thebare progenitor star and produces the observed gamma-rays, in llgrbs theextended envelope smothers the jet and prevents the generation of a largegamma-ray luminosity. instead, the jet deposits all its energy in the envelope,driving a mildly relativistic shock that upon breakout produces a llgrb. inaddition for giving a unified view of the two phenomena, this model provides anatural explanation to many observed properties of llgrbs. it also implies thatllgrbs are a viable source of the observed extra-galactic diffuse neutrino fluxand that they are promising sources for future gravitational wave detectors.

0807.0012	gev emission from prompt and afterglow phases of gamma-ray bursts	we investigate the gev emission from gamma-ray bursts (grbs), using theresults from the energetic gamma ray experimental telescope (egret), and inview of the gamma-ray large area space telescope (glast). assuming that theconventional prompt and afterglow photons originate from synchrotron radiation,we compare an accompanying inverse-compton component with egret measurementsand upper limits on gev fluence, taking klein-nishina feedback into account. wefind that egret constraints are consistent with the theoretical framework ofthe synchrotron self-compton model for both prompt and afterglow phases, anddiscuss constraints on microphysical parameters in both phases. based on theinverse-compton model and using egret results, we predict that glast woulddetect grbs with gev photons at a rate &gt;~20 yr^{-1} from each of the prompt andafterglow phases. this rate applies to the high-energy tail of the promptsynchrotron emission and to the inverse-compton component of the afterglow.theory predicts that in a large fraction of the cases where synchrotron gevprompt emission would be detected by glast, inverse-compton photons should bedetected as well at high energies &gt;~10 gev. therefore glast will enable a moreprecise test of the high-energy emission mechanism. finally, we show that thecontribution of grbs to the flux of the extragalactic gamma-ray backgroundmeasured with egret is at least 0.01% and likely around 0.1%.

0807.4117	shock vorticity generation from accelerated ion streaming in the  precursor of ultrarelativistic gamma-ray burst external shocks	we investigate the interaction of nonthermal ions (protons and nuclei)accelerated in an ultrarelativistic blastwave with the pre-existing magneticfield of the medium into which the blastwave propagates. while particleacceleration processes such as diffusive shock acceleration can accelerate ionsand electrons, the accelerated electrons suffer larger radiative losses. undercertain conditions, the ions can attain higher energies and reach farther aheadof the shock than the electrons, and so the nonthermal particles can bepartially charge-separated. to compensate for the charge separation, theupstream plasma develops a return current, which, as it flows across themagnetic field, drives transverse acceleration of the upstream plasma and agrowth of density contrast in the shock upstream. if the density contrast isstrong by the time the fluid is shocked, vorticity is generated at the shocktransition. the resulting turbulence can amplify the post-shock magnetic fieldto the levels inferred from gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra and light curves.therefore, since the upstream inhomogeneities are induced by the ionsaccelerated in the shock, they are generic even if the blastwave propagatesinto a medium of uniform density. we speculate about the global structure ofthe shock precursor, and delineate several distinct physical regimes that areclassified by an increasing distance from the shock and, correspondingly, adecreasing density of nonthermal particles that reach that distance.

astro-ph;0204203	the detectability of orphan afterglows	the realization that grbs release a constant amount of energy implies thatthe post jet-break afterglow evolution would be largely universal. for a givenredshift all afterglows should be detected up to a fixed observer angle. weestimate the observed magnitude and the implied detectability of orphanafterglows. we show that for reasonable limiting magnitudes ($m_{lim}=25$)orphan afterglows would typically be detected from small ($\sim 10^\circ$)angles away from the grb jet axis. a detected orphan afterglow would generallycorrespond to a "near-miss" of the grb whose jet was pointing just slightlyaway from us. with our most optimistic parameters we expect that 15 orphanafterglows will be recorded in the sdss and 35 transients will be recorded in adedicated 2m class telescope operating full time for a year in an orphanafterglow search. the rate is smaller by a factor of 15 for our "canonical"parameters. we show that for a given facility an optimal survey should beshallower, covering larger area rather than deeper. the limiting magnitudeshould not be, however, lower than $\sim$ 23rd as in this case more transientsfrom on-axis grbs will be discovered than orphan afterglows. about 15% of thetransients could be discovered with a second exposure of the same area providedthat it follows after 3, 4 and 8 days for $m_{lim}=23$, 25 and 27.

astro-ph;0207400	on-axis orphan afterglows	in many grb inner engine models the highly relativistic grb jets are engulfedby slower moving matter. this could result in different beaming for the prompt$\gamma$-ray emission and for the lower energy afterglow. in this case weshould expect that some observer will see {\it on-axis orphan afterglows}:x-ray, optical and radio afterglows within the initial relativistic ejecta withno preceding grb; the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission is pointing elsewhere. weshow that the observations of the wfc on bepposax constrain with high certaintythe prompt x-ray beaming factor to be less than twice the prompt $\gamma$-raybeaming. the results of ariel 5 are consistent with this interpretation. therass from rotse and heao-1 constrain the x-ray beaming factor at 400 and 20minutes after the burst respectively to be comparable and certainly not muchlarger than the $\gamma$-ray beaming factor. there is no direct limit on theoptical beaming. however, we show that observations of several months withexisting hardware could result in a useful limit on the optical beaming factorof grb afterglows.

astro-ph;0210631	variability in grb afterglows and grb 021004	we present general analytic expressions for grb afterglow light curvesarising from a variable external density profile and/or a variable energy inthe blast wave. the former could arise from a clumpy ism or a variable stellarwind; the latter could arise from refreshed shocks or from an angular dependentjet structure (patchy shell). both scenarios would lead to a variable lightcurve. our formalism enables us to invert the observed light curve and obtainpossible density or energy profiles. the optical afterglow of grb 021004 wasdetected 537 seconds ab (after the burst) (fox et al. 2002). extensive followup observations revealed a significant temporal variability. we apply ourformalism to the r-band light curve of grb 021004 and we find that severalmodels provide a good fit to the data. we consider the patchy shell model with$p=2.2$ as the most likely explanation. according to this model our line ofsight was towards a "cold spot" that has lead to a relativity low $\gamma$-rayflux and an initially weak afterglow (while the x-ray afterglow flux after aday was above average). observations above the cooling frequency, $\nu_c$,could provide the best way to distinguish between our different models.

astro-ph;0303156	modeling fluctuations in the grb-afterglow light curves	the fluctuations observed in the light curves of some grb-afterglows (such asgrb 021004) provide a useful tool to probe the circum-burst density profile andto probe the variations in the energy of blast-wave with time. we present ageneral formalism that reduces the calculation of the observed light curve froma blandford-mackee blast-wave to the evaluation of a one dimensional integral.using this formalism we obtain a simple approximation to the general lightcurve that arises in more complex situations where the afterglow's energy orthe external density vary. the solution is valid for spherically symmetricprofiles and it takes a full consideration of the angular time delay effects.we present the light curves of several external density profiles anddemonstrate the effects of density variations on the light curve. we alsore-visit the afterglow of grb021004 and we find that the steep decay after thefirst bump ($\sim 4000sec$) cannot result from a spherically symmetric densityvariation or from the passage of the synchrotron frequency through the opticalband. this suggests that an angular structure is responsible to some of theobserved features in the light curve. this may be the first evidence that anangular structure is important in the early stages of the afterglow.

astro-ph;0304563	the variable light curve of grb 030329: the case for refreshed shocks	grb 030329 is unique in many aspects. it has a very low redshift for a grb,$z=0.1685$, and is therefore very bright and easy to monitor, making it themost well studied afterglow to date. it shows a supernova bump in the lightcurve, with a spectrum very similar to sn 1998bw, thus establishing with muchbetter confidence the connection between grbs and core collapse sne. there arealso two important physical characteristics that make this burst especiallyinteresting, aside from its remarkably low redshift. first, unlike most grbafterglows, the light curve of grb 030329 shows a very large variability a fewdays after the burst. these fluctuations show a roughly constact amplitude, anda constant duration $\delta t$, while $\delta t/t$ decreases with time $t$.second, its $\gamma$-ray energy output and x-ray luminosity at $10 $hr are afactor of $\sim 20$ and $\sim 30$, respectively, below the average value aroundwhich most grbs are narrowly clustered. we consider several interpretations forthe variability in the light curve, in the context of different physicalmechanisms, and find that the most likely cause is refreshed shocks, i.e. slowshells that are ejected from the source and catch up with the afterglow shockat late times. in grb 030329 this happens after the jet break, which implies anapproximately constant duration $\delta t$ of the bumps, in agreement with theobservations. this interpretation also explains the anomalously low initialenergy of this burst, as the total energy of the afterglow shock is increasedby a factor of $\sim 10$ due to the refreshed shocks, thus bringing the totalenergy output close to the average value for all grbs.

astro-ph;0307290	implications of the $\gamma$-ray polarization of grb 021206	we compare two possible scenarios for the producing of high level ofpolarization within the prompt emission of a grb: synchrotron emission from arelativistic jet with a uniform (in space and time) magnetic field andsynchrotron emission from a jet with a random magnetic field in the plane ofthe shock. somewhat surprisingly we find that both scenarios can produce acomparable level of polarization ($\sim 45-50$% for the uniform field and $\sim30-35$% for a random field). uniform time independent field most naturallyarises by expansion of the field from the compact object. it requires a$10^{12}$g field at the source and a transport of the field as $\proptor^{-1}$. it {\it does not} imply poynting flux domination of the energy of thewind. there is a serious difficulty however, within this scenario, accountingfor particle acceleration (which requires random magnetic fields) both forpoynting flux and non-poynting flux domination. significant polarization canalso arise from a random field provided that the observer is located within$1/\gamma$ orientation from a narrow ($\theta_j \sim 1/\gamma$) jet. while mostjets are wider, the jet of grb 021206 from which strong polarization wasrecently observed, was most likely very narrow. grb 021206 is among thestrongest bursts ever. adopting the energy-angle relation we find an estimatedangle of $&lt;1/40$rad or even smaller. thus, for this particular burst therequired geometry is not unusual. we conclude that the rhessi observationssuggest that the prompt emission results from synchrotron radiation. however,in view of the comparable levels of polarizations predicted by both the randomfield and the homogeneous field scenarios these observations are insufficientto rule out or confirm either one.

astro-ph;0311545	testing the predictions of the universal structured grb jet model	the two leading models for the structure of grb jets are the uniform jetmodel and the universal structured jet (usj) model. in the latter, all grb jetsare intrinsically identical and the energy per solid angle drops as the inversesquare of the angle from the jet axis. the simplicity of the usj model gives ita strong predictive power, including a specific prediction for the observed grbdistribution as a function of both the redshift $z$ and the viewing angle$\theta$. we show that the current sample of grbs with known $z$ and estimated$\theta$ does not agree with the predictions of the usj model. this can be bestseen for a relatively narrow range in $z$, in which the usj model predicts thatmost grbs should be near the upper end of the observed range in $\theta$, whilein the observed sample most grbs are near the lower end of that range. sincethe current sample is very inhomogeneous (i.e. involves many differentdetectors), it should be taken with care and cannot be used to rule out the usjmodel. nevertheless, this sample strongly disfavors the usj model. comparingthe prediction for the observed grb distribution both in $\theta$ and in $z$,with a larger and more homogeneous grb sample, like the one expected fromswift, would either clearly rule out the usj model, or alternatively, provide astrong support for it. the test presented here is general, and can be used totest any model that predicts both a luminosity function and a luminosity-anglerelation.

astro-ph;0403461	early afterglow emission from a reverse shock as a diagnostic tool for  grb outflows	the gamma-ray burst (grb) - afterglow transition is one of the mostinteresting and least studied grb phases. during this phase the relativisticejecta begins interacting with the surrounding matter. a strong short livedreverse shock propagates into the ejecta (provided that it is baryonic) whilethe forward shock begins to shape the surrounding matter into a blandford-mckeeprofile. we suggest a parametrization of the early afterglow light curve and wecalculate (analytically and numerically) the observed parameters that resultsfrom a reverse shock emission (in an interstellar medium [ism] environment). wepresent a new fingerprint of the reverse shock emission that is added to thewell known $t^{-2}$ optical decay. observation of this signature would indicatethat the reverse shock dominates the emission during the early afterglow. theexistence of a reverse shock will in turn imply that the relativistic ejectacontains a significant baryonic component. this signature would also imply thatthe surrounding medium is an ism. we further show that: (i) the reverse shockoptical flash depends strongly on initial conditions of the relativisticejecta. (ii) previous calculations have generally overestimated the strength ofthis optical flash. (iii) if the reverse shock dominates the optical flash thendetailed observations of the early afterglow light curve would possibly enableus to determine the initial physical conditions within the relativistic ejectaand specifically to estimate its lorentz factor and its width.

astro-ph;0406277	the apparent size of grb afterglows as a test of the fireball model	taylor et al. (2004) reported recently on the first direct measurement of theapparent size of a grb afterglow. here we confront these observations with thepredictions of the fireball model. we use a simple model to study numericallythe evolution of the fireball and determine its apparent size, starting at theearly spherical expansion phase through the jet break and into the newtonianregime. we perform these calculations on the background of a uniforminterstellar medium and a massive stellar wind environment. we find that thecalculated apparent size at the time of the measurements taken by taylor et al.depends only weakly on the chosen parameters (the jet opening angle, theenergy, and the external density profile). thus it is reassuring that the onlypossible outcome of the model, within the plausible range of parameters, agreesvery well with the data. these measurements therefore present us with a strongtest of possible grb models, which the fireball model passes successfully.

astro-ph;0412232	outliers to the isotropic energy - peak energy relation in grbs	the peak energy - isotropic energy (epei) relation is among the mostintriguing recent discoveries concerning grbs. it can have numerousimplications on our understanding of the emission mechanism of the bursts andon the application of grbs for cosmological studies. however, this relation wasverified only for a small sample of bursts with measured redshifts. we proposehere a test whether a burst with an unknown redshift can potentially satisfythe epei relation. applying this test to a large sample of batse bursts we findthat a significant fraction of those bursts cannot satisfy this relation. ourtest is sensitive only to dim and hard bursts and therefore this relation mightstill hold as an inequality (i.e. there are no intrinsically bright and softbursts). we conclude that the observed relation seen in the sample of burstswith a known redshift might be influenced by observational biases and from theinability to locate and well localize hard and weak bursts that have only asmall number of photons. in particular we point out that the threshold fordetection, localization and redshift measurement is essentially higher than thethreshold for detection alone. we predict that swift will detect some hard andweak bursts that would be outliers to the epei relation. however, we cannotquantify this prediction. we stress the importance of understanding thedetection-localization-redshift threshold for the coming swift detections.

astro-ph;0502052	pure and loaded fireballs in sgr giant flares	on december 27, 2004, a giant flare from sgr 1806$-$20 was detected on earth.its thermal spectrum and temperature suggest that the flare resulted from anenergy release of about $10^{47}$ erg/sec close to the surface of a neutronstar in the form of radiation and/or pairs. this plasma expanded under its ownpressure producing a fireball and the observed gamma-rays escaped once thefireball became optically thin. the giant flare was followed by a bright radioafterglow, with an observable extended size, implying an energetic relativisticoutflow. we revisit here the evolution of relativistic fireballs and wecalculate the lorentz factor and energy remaining in relativistic outflow oncethe radiation escapes. we show that pairs that arise naturally in a purepairs-radiation fireball do not carry enough energy to account for the observedafterglow. we consider various alternatives and we show that if therelativistic outflow that causes the afterglow is related directly to theprompt flare, then the initial fireball must be loaded by baryons or poyntingflux. while we focus on parameters applicable to the giant flare and the radioafterglow of sgr 1806$-$20 the calculations presented here might be alsoapplicable to grbs.

astro-ph;0502148	the distances of short-hard grbs and the sgr connection	we present a search for nearby (d&lt;100 mpc) galaxies in the error boxes of sixwell-localized short-hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs). none of the six error boxesreveals the presence of a plausible nearby host galaxy. this allows us to setlower limits on the distances and, hence, the isotropic-equivalent energy ofthese grbs. our lower limits are around $1 \times 10^{49}$ erg (at $2\sigma$confidence level); as a consequence, some of the short-hard grbs we examinewould have been detected by batse out to distances greater than 1 gpc andtherefore constitute a bona fide cosmological population. our search ispartially motivated by the december 27, 2004 hypergiant flare from sgr 1806-20,and the intriguing possibility that short-hard grbs are extragalactic events ofa similar nature. such events would be detectable with batse to a distance of\~50 mpc, and their detection rate should be comparable to the actual batsedetection rate of short-hard grbs. the failure of our search, by contrast,suggests that such flares constitute less than 15% of the short-hard grbs (&lt;40%at 95% confidence). we discuss possible resolutions of this discrepancy.

astro-ph;0507553	steady-state electrostatic layers from weibel instability in  relativistic collisionless shocks	it is generally accepted that magnetic fields generated in the nonlineardevelopment of the transverse weibel instability provide effectivecollisionality in unmagnetized collisionless shocks. recently, extensive twoand three dimensional simulations improved our understanding of the growth andsaturation of the instability in colliding plasma shells. however, thesteady-state structure of the shock wave transition layers remains poorlyunderstood. we use basic physical considerations and order-of-magnitudearguments to study the steady state structure in relativistic unmagnetizedcollisionless shocks in pair plasmas. the shock contains an electrostatic layerresulting from the formation of stationary, magnetically-focused currentfilaments. the filaments form where the cold upstream plasma and thecounterstreaming thermal plasma interpenetrate. the filaments are not entirelyneutral and strong electrostatic fields are present. most of the downstreamparticles cannot cross this layer into the upstream because they are trapped bythe electrostatic field. we identify the critical location in the shocktransition layer where the electromagnetic field ceases to be static. at thislocation, the degree of charge separation in the filaments reaches a maximumvalue, the current inside the filaments comes close to the alfv\'en limit, andthe phase space distribution function starts to isotropize. we argue that theradius of the current filaments upstream of the critical location is abouttwice the upstream plasma skin depth. finally, we show that some downstreamparticles cross the electrostatic layer and run ahead of the shock into thepreshock medium without causing instability. these particles may play animportant role in particle acceleration.

astro-ph;0508464	weibel filament decay and thermalization in collisionless shocks and  gamma-ray burst afterglows	models for the synchrotron emission of gamma-ray burst afterglows suggestthat the magnetic field is generated in the shock wave that forms asrelativistic ejecta plow through the circum-burst medium. transverse weibelinstability efficiently generates magnetic fields near equipartition with thepost-shock energy density. the detailed saturated state of the instability, asseen in particle-in-cell simulations, consists of magnetically self-pinchedcurrent filaments. the filaments are parallel to the direction of propagationof the shock and are about a plasma skin depth in radius, forming aquasi--two-dimensional structure. we use a rudimentary analytical model toargue that the weibel filaments are unstable to a kink-like mode, whichdestroys their quasi--two-dimensional structure. for wavelengths longer thanthan the skin depth, the instability grows at the rate equal to the speed oflight divided by the wavelength. we calculate the transport of collisionlesstest particles in the filaments experiencing the instability and show that theparticles diffuse in energy. this diffusion marks the beginning ofthermalization in the shock transition layer, and causes initial magnetic fielddecay as particles escape from the filaments. we discuss the implications ofthese results for the structure of the shock and the polarization of theafterglow.

astro-ph;0508629	a complete survey of the transient radio sky and implications for  gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and other relativistic explosions	we had previously reported on a survey for radio transients, used to set anupper limit on the number of orphan gamma-ray burst (grb) radio afterglows, andthus a lower limit on the typical grb beaming factor. here we report radio andoptical follow-up observations of these possible transients, achieving thefirst full characterization of the transient radio sky. we find that only twosource are likely to be real radio transients, an optically obscured radiosupernova (sn) in the nearby galaxy ngc 4216, and a source not associated witha bright host galaxy, which is too radio luminous to be a grb afterglow. wespeculate that this may be a flare from a peculiar active galactic nucleus, ora burst from an unusual galactic compact object. we place an upper limit of 65radio transients above 6 mjy over the entire sky at the 95% confidence level.the implications are as follows. first, we derive a limit on the typicalbeaming of grbs; we find f_b^{-1} &gt;~ 60, ~5 times higher than our earlierresults. second, we impose an upper limit on the rate of events that eject &gt;~10^{51} erg in unconfined relativistic ejecta, whether or not accompanied bydetectable emission in wavebands other than the radio. our estimated rate,&lt;=1000/y/gpc, is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the rate ofcore-collapse sne (and type ib/c events in particular), indicating that only aminority of such events eject significant amounts of relativistic material,which are required by fireball models of long-soft grbs. finally, we show thatfuture wider and/or deeper radio variability surveys are expected to detectnumerous orphan radio grb afterglows. our survey also illustrates the greatpotential of sensitive surveys with new instruments to revolutionize the studyof nearby sne (abridged).

astro-ph;0509891	the progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts from an extended sample  of events	the detection of the afterglow emission and host galaxies of short-hardgamma-ray bursts (shbs) is one of the most exciting recent astronomicaldiscoveries. indications that shb progenitors belong to old stellarpopulations, in contrast to those of the long-soft grbs, provide a strong clueabout their physical nature. definitive conclusions however are limited by thesmall number of shbs with known hosts. here, we present our investigation ofshbs previously localized by the interplanetary network (ipn) using new andarchival optical and x-ray observations. we show that we can likely identifythe host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasingthe sample of shbs with known hosts and/or distances. in particular, wedetermine that the bright shb 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy clusterabell 1892, making it probably the nearest shb currently known. we show thatthe brightest galaxy within the error box of shb 000607, at z=0.14, is mostlikely the host galaxy of this event. additionally, we rule out the existenceof galaxy overdensities (down to ~21mag) near the locations of two other shbs,and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. we combine our shb samplewith events discovered recently by the swift and hete-2 missions, andinvestigate the properties of the extended sample. comparison to sne ia showsthat the progenitors of shbs are typically older, implying a typical life timeof several gy. we also show that it is unlikely that there is a significantpopulation of progenitors with life time shorter than 1gy. this resultdisfavors the popular model of ns-ns mergers as the progenitors of shbs.

astro-ph;0511254	the local rate and the progenitor lifetimes of short-hard gamma-ray  bursts: synthesis and predictions for ligo	the recent discovery of the first four afterglows of short-hard gamma-raybursts (shbs), suggests that they typically result from long-lived progenitorsystems. the most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either doubleneutron star (dns) binaries or neutron star-black hole (ns-bh) systems. suchevents are strong sources of gravitational-waves (gws) and might be detected byground-based gw observatories. in this work we combine the census of shbobservations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluationof the compact binary model. we then explore the implications for gw detectionof these events. beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmictime, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions canreproduce the known shb redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak fluxdistribution of the large batse shb sample. we find that: (1) the typicalprogenitor lifetime is long. assuming lognormal lifetime distribution thetypical lifetime is &gt;4[1] gyr (2[3]\sigma c.l.). if the lifetime distributionis a power-law with index \eta then \eta&gt;-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \sigma c.l.). thisresult is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galacticdns population, suggesting that if shbs do result from dns mergers then theobserved galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) we find thatthe local rate of shbs is larger than 10gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by severalorders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) assuming thatshbs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the ligo and virgoevent rates are encouraging: the chance for detection by current facilities isnot negligible, while a coincident detection of gw and electromagneticradiation from an shb is guaranteed for next-generation observatories.

astro-ph;0512548	the cosmic ray precursor of relativistic collisionless shocks: a missing  link in gamma-ray burst afterglows	collisionless shocks are commonly argued to be the sites of cosmic ray (cr)acceleration. we study the influence of crs on weakly magnetized relativisticcollisionless shocks and apply our results to external shocks in gamma-rayburst (grb) afterglows. the common view is that the transverse weibelinstability (twi) generates a small-scale magnetic field that facilitatescollisional coupling and thermalization in the shock transition. the twi fieldis expected to decay rapidly, over a finite number of proton plasma skin depthsfrom the transition. however, the synchrotron emission in grb afterglowssuggests that a strong and persistent magnetic field is present in the plasmathat crosses the shock; the origin of this field is a key open question. herewe suggest that the common picture involving twi demands revision. namely, thecrs drive turbulence in the shock upstream on scales much larger than the skindepth. this turbulence generates a large-scale magnetic field that quenches twiand produces a magnetized shock. the new field efficiently confines crs andenhances the acceleration efficiency. the crs modify the shocks in grbafterglows at least while they remain relativistic. the origin of the magneticfield that gives rise to the synchrotron emission is plausibly in the cr-driventurbulence. we do not expect ultrahigh energy cosmic ray production in externalgrb shocks.

astro-ph;0606011	smooth light curves from a bumpy ride: relativistic blast wave  encounters a density jump	some grb afterglow light curves show significant variability, which oftenincludes episodes of rebrightening. this was attributed in several cases tolarge fluctuations in the external density. here we examine the effect of asharp increase in the external density on the light curve by considering, forthe first time, a full treatment of both the hydrodynamic evolution and theradiation in this scenario. to this end we develop a semi-analytic model forthe light curve and carry out several elaborate numerical simulations using a1d hydrodynamic code together with a synchrotron radiation code.two sphericallysymmetric cases are explored in detail: a density jump in a uniform externalmedium, and a wind termination shock. contrary to previous works, we find thateven a sharp (step function) and large (by a factor of $a&gt;&gt;1$) increase in theexternal density does not produce sharp features in the light curve, and cannotaccount for significant temporal variability. for a wind termination shock, thelight curve smoothly transitions between the asymptotic power-laws over aboutone decade in time, and there is no rebrightening in the optical or x-rays toserve as a clear observational signature. for a sharp jump in a uniform densitywe find that the maximal deviation $\delta\alpha_max$ of the temporal decayindex $\alpha$ from its asymptotic value, is bounded (e.g., $\delta\alpha_max&lt;0.4$ for $a=10$); $\delta\alpha_max$ slowly increases with $a$, converging to$\delta\alpha_{max} \approx 1$ at very large $a$ values. therefore, no opticalrebrightening is expected here as well. in the x-rays, while the asymptoticflux is unaffected by the density jump, the fluctuations in $\alpha$ are foundto be comparable to those in the optical. finally, we discuss the implicationsof our results for the origin of the fluctuations in several afterglows.

astro-ph;0701748	short-hard gamma-ray bursts	two types of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are observed: short duration hardspectrum grbs and long duration soft spectrum grbs. for many years long grbswere the focus of intense research while the lack of observational data limitedthe study of short-hard grbs (shbs). in 2005 a breakthrough occurred followingthe first detections of shb afterglows, longer wavelength emission that followsthe burst of gamma-rays. similarly to long grbs, afterglow detections led tothe identification of shb host galaxies and measurement of their redshifts.these observations established that shbs are cosmological relativistic sourcesthat, unlike long grbs, do not originate from the collapse of massive stars,and therefore constitute a distinct physical phenomenon. one viable model forshb origin is the coalescence of compact binary systems (double neutron starsor a neutron star and a black hole), in which case shbs are the electromagneticcounterparts of strong gravitational-wave sources. the theoretical andobservational study of shbs following the recent pivotal discoveries isreviewed, along with new theoretical results that are presented here for thefirst time.

astro-ph;0703199	the cluster-merger shock in 1e 0657-56: faster than the speeding bullet?	shock waves driven in the intergalactic medium during the merging of galaxyclusters have been observed in x-ray imaging and spectroscopy. fluid motionsinferred from the shock strength and morphology can be compared to the colddark matter (cdm) distribution inferred from gravitational lensing. a detailedreconstruction of the cdm kinematics, however, must take into account thenontrivial response of the fluid intracluster medium to the collisionless cdmmotions. we have carried out two-dimensional simulations of gas dynamics incluster collisions. we analyze the relative motion of the clusters, the bowshock wave, and the contact discontinuity and relate these to x-ray data. wefocus on the "bullet cluster," 1e 0657-56, a near head-on collision ofunequal-mass clusters, for which the gas density and temperature jumps acrossthe prominent bow shock imply a high shock velocity 4,700 km/s. the velocity ofthe fluid shock has been widely interpreted as the relative velocity of the cdmcomponents. this need not be the case, however. an illustrative simulationfinds that the present relative velocity of the cdm halos is 16% lower thanthat of the shock. while this conclusion is sensitive to the detailed initialmass and gas density profile of the colliding clusters, such a decrease of theinferred halo relative velocity would increase the likelihood of finding 1e0657-56 in a lambdacdm universe.
