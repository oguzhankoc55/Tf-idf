1101.3942	constraints on high-energy neutrino emission from sn 2008d	sn 2008d, a core collapse supernova at a distance of 27 mpc, wasserendipitously discovered by the swift satellite through an associated x-rayflash. core collapse supernovae have been observed in association with longgamma-ray bursts and x-ray flashes and a physical connection is widely assumed.this connection could imply that some core collapse supernovae possess mildlyrelativistic jets in which high-energy neutrinos are produced throughproton-proton collisions. the predicted neutrino spectra would be detectable bycherenkov neutrino detectors like icecube. a search for a neutrino signal intemporal and spatial correlation with the observed x-ray flash of sn 2008d wasconducted using data taken in 2007-2008 with 22 strings of the icecubedetector. events were selected based on a boosted decision tree classifiertrained with simulated signal and experimental background data. the classifierwas optimized to the position and a "soft jet" neutrino spectrum assumed for sn2008d. using three search windows placed around the x-ray peak, emission timescales from 100 - 10000 s were probed. no events passing the cuts were observedin agreement with the signal expectation of 0.13 events. upper limits on themuon neutrino flux from core collapse supernovae were derived for differentemission time scales and the principal model parameters were constrained.

1103.1216	background studies for acoustic neutrino detection at the south pole	the detection of acoustic signals from ultra-high energy neutrinointeractions is a promising method to measure the tiny flux of cosmogenicneutrinos expected on earth. the energy threshold for this process dependsstrongly on the absolute noise level in the target material. the south poleacoustic test setup (spats), deployed in the upper part of four boreholes ofthe icecube neutrino observatory, has monitored the noise in antarctic ice atthe geographic south pole for more than two years down to 500 m depth. thenoise is very stable and gaussian distributed. lacking an in-situ calibrationup to now, laboratory measurements have been used to estimate the absolutenoise level in the 10 to 50 khz frequency range to be smaller than 20 mpa.using a threshold trigger, sensors of the south pole acoustic test setupregistered acoustic pulse-like events in the icecube detector volume and itsvicinity. acoustic signals from refreezing icecube holes and from anthropogenicsources have been used to localize acoustic events. monte carlo simulations ofsound propagating from the established sources to the spats sensors haveallowed to check corresponding model expectations. an upper limit on theneutrino flux at energies $e_\nu &gt; 10^{11}$ gev is derived from acoustic datataken over eight months.

1104.0075	time-dependent searches for point sources of neutrinos with the  40-string and 22-string configurations of icecube	this paper presents searches for flaring sources of neutrinos using theicecube neutrino telescope. for the first time, a search is performed over theentire parameter space of energy, direction and time looking for neutrinoflares of 20 microseconds to a year duration from astrophysical sources amongthe atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds. searches which integrate overtime are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a largerbackground of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the timeconstraint. flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei,soft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrinoemitters. we used mainly data taken between april 5, 2008 and may 20, 2009 by apartially completed configuration of icecube with 40 strings. for the presentedsearches an unbinned maximum likelihood method is used with a time-dependentprior to test several different source hypotheses. an "untriggered" searchcovers any possible time-dependent emission from sources not correlated to anyother observation using other astrophysical messengers such as photons.moreover, a similar time scan is performed for a predefined catalogue ofsources that exhibit intense photon flares. searches triggered bymulti-wavelength information on flares from blazars and soft gamma-rayrepeaters are performed using the 40 string data and also the data taken by theprevious configuration of 22 strings in operation between may 31, 2007 andapril 5, 2008. flares for which extensive and continuous monitoring isavailable from fermi-lat and swift and flares detected by imaging cherenkovtelescopes with shorter time-scale monitoring are considered. the results fromall searches are compatible with a fluctuation of the background.

1108.0171	icecube sensitivity for low-energy neutrinos from nearby supernovae	this paper describes the response of the icecube neutrino telescope locatedat the geographic south pole to outbursts of mev neutrinos from the corecollapse of nearby massive stars. icecube was completed in december 2010forming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1cubic kilometer in the deep antarctic ice for particle induced photons. thetelescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 gev.owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates areparticularly low. hence icecube can also detect large numbers of mev neutrinosby observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the darknoise. with 2 ms timing resolution, icecube can detect subtle features in thetemporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. for a supernova at thegalactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-freemegaton-scale supernova search experiment. the sensitivity decreases to 20standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations atthe large magellanic cloud (50 kpc). icecube is sending triggers from potentialsupernovae to the supernova early warning system. the sensitivity to neutrinoproperties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as thepossibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electronneutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black holeas well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrateicecube's capability for supernova detection.

1208.3430	an improved method for measuring muon energy using the truncated mean of  de/dx	the measurement of muon energy is critical for many analyses in largecherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separatingextraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. muonenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss(de/dx) along the muon's path and relating the de/dx to the muon energy.because high-energy muons (e_mu &gt; 1 tev) lose energy randomly, the spread inde/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 inlog10(e_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the icecubedetector. in this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncatedmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. the muon track isdivided into separate segments with individual de/dx values. the elimination ofsegments with the highest de/dx results in an overall de/dx that is moreclosely correlated to the muon energy. this method results in an energyresolution of 0.22 in log10(e_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. thistechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially tolarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.

1308.5501	improvement in fast particle track reconstruction with robust statistics	the icecube project has transformed one cubic kilometer of deep naturalantarctic ice into a cherenkov detector. muon neutrinos are detected and theirdirection inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon trackinside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. reconstructing the muontrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering inthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muonsinside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. thismanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstructionproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover thetrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determinehow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. rather thansolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that areapplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment thedetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statisticaltechniques. these can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstructionand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. using the metric ofmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, weimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. we alsopresent improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: wecan accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.

1310.5477	probing the origin of cosmic-rays with extremely high energy neutrinos  using the icecube observatory	we have searched for extremely high energy neutrinos using data taken withthe icecube detector between may 2010 and may 2012. two neutrino inducedparticle shower events with energies around 1 pev were observed, as reportedpreviously. in this work, we investigate whether these events could originatefrom cosmogenic neutrinos produced in the interactions of ultra-high energycosmic-rays with ambient photons while propagating through intergalactic space.exploiting icecube's large exposure for extremely high energy neutrinos and thelack of observed events above 100 pev, we can rule out the corresponding modelsat more than 90% confidence level. the model independent quasi-differential 90%cl upper limit, which amounts to $e^2 \phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} = 1.2\times 10^{-7}$ gev cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1 eev, provides the moststringent constraint in the energy range from 10 pev to 10 eev. our observationdisfavors strong cosmological evolution of the highest energy cosmic raysources such as the fanaroff-riley type ii class of radio galaxies.

1311.7048	search for a diffuse flux of astrophysical muon neutrinos with the  icecube 59-string configuration	a search for high-energy neutrinos was performed using data collected by theicecube neutrino observatory from may 2009 to may 2010, when the array wasrunning in its 59-string configuration. the data sample was optimized tocontain muon neutrino induced events with a background contamination ofatmospheric muons of less than 1%. these data, which are dominated byatmospheric neutrinos, are analyzed with a global likelihood fit to search forpossible contributions of prompt atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos,neither of which have yet been identified. such signals are expected to followa harder energy spectrum than conventional atmospheric neutrinos. in addition,the zenith angle distribution differs for astrophysical and atmosphericsignals. a global fit of the reconstructed energies and directions of observedevents is performed, including possible neutrino flux contributions for anastrophysical signal and atmospheric backgrounds as well as systematicuncertainties of the experiment and theoretical predictions. the best fityields an astrophysical signal flux for $\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\mu $ of $e^2 \cdot\phi (e) = 0.25 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{gev} \textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{sr}^{-1}$, and a zero prompt component. although the sensitivity ofthis analysis for astrophysical neutrinos surpasses the waxman and bahcallupper bound, the experimental limit at 90% confidence level is a factor of 1.5above at a flux of $e^2 \cdot \phi (e) = 1.44 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{gev}\textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1} \textrm{sr}^{-1}$.

1312.0104	search for neutrino-induced particle showers with icecube-40	we report on the search for neutrino-induced particle-showers, so-calledcascades, in the icecube-40 detector. the data for this search was collectedbetween april 2008 and may 2009 when the first 40 icecube strings were deployedand operational. three complementary searches were performed, each optimizedfor different energy regimes. the analysis with the lowest energy threshold (2tev) targeted atmospheric neutrinos. a total of 67 events were found,consistent with the expectation of 41 atmospheric muons and 30 atmosphericneutrino events. the two other analyses targeted a harder, astrophysicalneutrino flux. the analysis with an intermediate threshold of 25 tev lead tothe observation of 14 cascade-like events, again consistent with the predictionof 3.0 atmospheric neutrino and 7.7 atmospheric muon events. we hence set anupper limit of $e^2 \phi_{lim} \leq 7.46\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{gev sr^{-1}s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$ (90% c.l.) on the diffuse flux from astrophysical neutrinos ofall neutrino flavors, applicable to the energy range 25 tev to 5 pev, assumingan $e_{\nu}^{-2}$ spectrum and a neutrino flavor ratio of 1:1:1 at the earth.the third analysis utilized a larger and optimized sample of atmospheric muonbackground simulation, leading to a higher energy threshold of 100 tev. threeevents were found over a background prediction of 0.04 atmospheric muon eventsand 0.21 events from the flux of conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrinos.including systematic errors this corresponds to a $2.7\sigma$ excess withrespect to the background-only hypothesis. our observation of neutrino eventcandidates above 100 tev complements icecube's recently observed evidence forhigh-energy astrophysical neutrinos.

1402.3460	search for non-relativistic magnetic monopoles with icecube	the icecube neutrino observatory is a large cherenkov detector instrumenting$1\,\mathrm{km}^3$ of antarctic ice. the detector can be used to search forsignatures of particle physics beyond the standard model. here, we describe thesearch for non-relativistic, magnetic monopoles as remnants of the gut (grandunified theory) era shortly after the big bang. these monopoles may catalyzethe decay of nucleons via the rubakov-callan effect with a cross sectionsuggested to be in the range of $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ to$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. in icecube, the cherenkov light from nucleon decaysalong the monopole trajectory would produce a characteristic hit pattern. thispaper presents the results of an analysis of first data taken from may 2011until may 2012 with a dedicated slow-particle trigger for deepcore, asubdetector of icecube. a second analysis provides better sensitivity for thebrightest non-relativistic monopoles using data taken from may 2009 until may2010. in both analyses no monopole signal was observed. for catalysis crosssections of $10^{-22}\,(10^{-24})\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ the flux of non-relativisticgut monopoles is constrained up to a level of $\phi_{90} \le10^{-18}\,(10^{-17})\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}}$ at a 90% confidence level,which is three orders of magnitude below the parker bound. the limits assume adominant decay of the proton into a positron and a neutral pion. these resultsimprove the current best experimental limits by one to two orders of magnitude,for a wide range of assumed speeds and catalysis cross sections.

1406.6868	multipole analysis of icecube data to search for dark matter accumulated  in the galactic halo	dark matter which is bound in the galactic halo might self-annihilate andproduce a flux of stable final state particles, e.g. high energy neutrinos.these neutrinos can be detected with icecube, a cubic-kilometer sized cherenkovdetector. given icecube's large field of view, a characteristic anisotropy ofthe additional neutrino flux is expected. in this paper we describe a multipolemethod to search for such a large-scale anisotropy in icecube data. this methoduses the expansion coefficients of a multipole expansion of neutrino arrivaldirections and incorporates signal-specific weights for each expansioncoefficient. we apply the technique to a high-purity muon neutrino sample fromthe northern hemisphere. the final result is compatible with thenull-hypothesis. as no signal was observed, we present limits on theself-annihilation cross-section averaged over the relative velocitydistribution $&lt;\sigma v&gt;$ down to $1.9\cdot10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter particle mass of$700\,\mathrm{gev}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{gev}$ and direct annihilation into$\nu\bar{\nu}$. the resulting exclusion limits come close to exclusion limitsfrom $\gamma$-ray experiments, that focus on the outer galactic halo, for highdark matter masses of a few tev and hard annihilation channels.

1408.0634	searches for small-scale anisotropies from neutrino point sources with  three years of icecube data	recently, icecube found evidence for a diffuse signal of astrophysicalneutrinos in an energy range of $60\,\mathrm{tev}$ to the $\mathrm{pev}$-scale.the origin of those events, being a key to understanding the origin of cosmicrays, is still an unsolved question. so far, analyses have not succeeded toresolve the diffuse signal into point-like sources. searches including amaximum-likelihood-ratio test, based on the reconstructed directions andenergies of the detected down- and up-going neutrino candidates, were alsoperformed on icecube data leading to the exclusion of bright point sources. inthis paper, we present two methods to search for faint neutrino point sourcesin three years of icecube data, taken between 2008 and 2011. the first methodis an autocorrelation test, applied separately to the northern and southernsky. the second method is a multipole analysis, which expands the measured datain the northern hemisphere into spherical harmonics and uses the resultingexpansion coefficients to separate signal from background. with both methods,the results are consistent with the background expectation with a slightly moresparse spatial distribution, corresponding to an underfluctuation. depending onthe assumed number of sources, the resulting upper limit on the flux per sourcein the northern hemisphere for an $e^{-2}$ energy spectrum ranges from $1.5\cdot 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s})$, in the case of oneassumed source, to $4 \cdot 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s})$, in the case of $3500$ assumed sources.

0705.1554	milagro constraints on very high energy emission from short duration  gamma-ray bursts	recent rapid localizations of short, hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) by theswift and hete satellites have led to the observation of the first afterglowsand the measurement of the first redshifts from this type of burst. detectionof &gt;100 gev counterparts would place powerful constraints on grb mechanisms.seventeen short duration (&lt; 5 s) grbs detected by satellites occurred withinthe field of view of the milagro gamma-ray observatory between 2000 january and2006 december. we have searched the milagro data for &gt;100 gev counterparts tothese grbs and find no significant emission correlated with these bursts. dueto the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by the extragalactic backgroundlight (ebl), detections are only expected for redshifts less than ~0.5. whilemost long duration grbs occur at redshifts higher than 0.5, the opposite isthought to be true of short grbs. lack of a detected vhe signal thus allowssetting meaningful fluence limits. one grb in the sample (050509b) has a likelyassociation with a galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, while another (051103) hasbeen tentatively linked to the nearby galaxy m81. fluence limits are correctedfor ebl absorption, either using the known measured redshift, or computing thecorresponding absorption for a redshift of 0.1 and 0.5, as well as for the caseof z=0.

1507.03991	a combined maximum-likelihood analysis of the high-energy astrophysical  neutrino flux measured with icecube	evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now beenfound in multiple searches with the icecube detector. the first solid evidencewas provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies$\gtrsim30$ tev and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. recentanalyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies andis also visible with throughgoing, $\nu_\mu$-induced tracks from the northernhemisphere. here, we combine the results from six different icecube searchesfor astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. the combinedevent sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-likeevents. the data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle andevent topology. assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and toconsist of equal flavors at earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrinoenergies between 25 tev and 2.8 pev is well described by an unbroken power lawwith best-fit spectral index $-2.50\pm0.09$ and a flux at 100 tev of$\left(6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1}\right)\cdot10^{-18}\,\mathrm{gev}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index $-2$ is disfavoredwith a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$ ($p=0.0066\%$) with respect to the bestfit. this significance is reduced to 2.1 $\sigma$ ($p=1.7\%$) if instead wecompare the best fit to a spectrum with index $-2$ that has an exponentialcut-off at high energies. allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate fromthe other two flavors, we find a $\nu_e$ fraction of $0.18\pm0.11$ at earth.the sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic ofneutron-decay dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6$\sigma$ ($p=0.014\%$).

0806.2293	the large scale cosmic-ray anisotropy as observed with milagro	results are presented of a harmonic analysis of the large scale cosmic-rayanisotropy as observed by the milagro observatory. we show a two-dimensionaldisplay of the sidereal anisotropy pro jections in right ascension generated bythe fitting of three harmonics to 18 separate declination bands. the milagroobservatory is a water cherenkov detector located in the jemez mountains nearlos alamos, new mexico. with a high duty cycle and large field-of-view, milagrois an excellent instrument for measuring this anisotropy with high sensitivityat tev energies. the analysis is conducted using a seven year data sampleconsisting of more than 95 billion events, the largest such data set inexistence. we observe an anisotropy with a magnitude around 0.1% for cosmicrays with a median energy of 6 tev. the dominant feature is a deficit region ofdepth (2.49 +/- 0.02 stat. +/- 0.09 sys.)x10^(-3) in the direction of thegalactic north pole centered at 189 degrees right ascension. we observe asteady increase in the magnitude of the signal over seven years.

astro-ph;0311389	limits on very high energy emission from gamma-ray bursts with the  milagro observatory	the milagro telescope monitors the northern sky for 100 gev to 100 tevtransient emission through continuous very high energy wide-field observations.the large effective area and ~100 gev energy threshold of milagro allow it todetect very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray burst emission with much highersensitivity than previous instruments and a fluence sensitivity at vhe energiescomparable to that of dedicated gamma-ray burst satellites at kev to mevenergies. even in the absence of a positive detection, vhe observations canplace important constraints on gamma-ray burst (grb) progenitor and emissionmodels. we present limits on the vhe flux of 40 s -- 3 h duration transientsnearby to earth, as well as sensitivity distributions which have been correctedfor gamma-ray absorption by extragalactic background light and cosmologicaleffects. the sensitivity distributions suggest that the typical intrinsic vhefluence of grbs is similar or weaker than the kev -- mev emission, and wedemonstrate how these sensitivity distributions may be used to placeobservational constraints on the absolute vhe luminosity of gamma-ray burstsfor any grb emission and progenitor model.

astro-ph;0503270	constraints on very high energy gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts	the milagro gamma-ray observatory employs a water cherenkov detector toobserve extensive air showers produced by high energy particles interacting inthe earth's atmosphere. milagro has a wide field of view and high duty cycle,monitoring the northern sky almost continuously in the 100 gev to 100 tevenergy range. milagro is, thus, uniquely capable of searching for veryhigh-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) during the prompt emissionphase. detection of &gt;100 gev counterparts would place powerful constraints ongrb mechanisms. twenty-five satellite-triggered grbs occurred within the fieldof view of milagro between january 2000 and december 2001. we have searched forcounterparts to these grbs and found no significant emission from any of theburst positions. due to the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by theextragalactic background light, detections are only expected to be possible forredshifts less than ~0.5. three of the grbs studied have measured redshifts.grb 010921 has a redshift low enough (0.45) to allow an upper limit on thefluence to place an observational constraint on potential grb models.

astro-ph;0611691	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the cygnus region of the galaxy	the diffuse gamma radiation arising from the interaction of cosmic rayparticles with matter and radiation in the galaxy is one of the few probesavailable to study the origin of the cosmic rays. milagro is a water cherenkovdetector that continuously views the entire overhead sky. the largefield-of-view combined with the long observation time makes milagro the mostsensitive instrument available for the study of large, low surface brightnesssources such as the diffuse gamma radiation arising from interactions of cosmicradiation with interstellar matter. in this paper we present spatial and fluxmeasurements of tev gamma-ray emission from the cygnus region. the tev imageshows at least one new source mgro j2019+37 as well as correlations with thematter density in the region as would be expected from cosmic-ray protoninteractions. however, the tev gamma-ray flux as measured at ~12 tev from thecygnus region (after excluding mgro j2019+37) exceeds that predicted from aconventional model of cosmic ray production and propagation. this observationindicates the existence of either hard-spectrum cosmic-ray sources and/or othersources of tev gamma rays in the region.

astro-ph;9906387	detection of 6 november 1997 ground level event by milagrito	solar energetic particles from the 6 november 1997 solar flare/cme(coronalmass ejection) with energies exceeding 10 gev have been detected by milagrito,a prototype of the milagro gamma ray observatory. while particle accelerationbeyond 1 gev at the sun is well established, few data exist for protons or ionsbeyond 10 gev. the milagro observatory, a ground based water cherenkov detectordesigned for observing very high energy gamma ray sources, can also be used tostudy the sun. milagrito, which operated for approximately one year in 1997/98,was sensitive to solar proton and neutron fluxes above ~5- 10 gev. milagritooperated in a scaler mode, which was primarily sensitive to muons, low energyphotons, and electrons, and the detector operated in a mode sensitive toshowers and high zenith angle muons. in its scaler mode, milagrito registered arate increase coincident with the 6 november 1997 ground level event observedby climax and other neutron monitors. a preliminary analysis suggests thepresence of &gt;10 gev particles.
