0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0902.1534	multi-wavelength study of x-ray luminous clusters at z ~ 0.3 i. star  formation activity of cluster galaxies	the current paradigm of cosmic formation and evolution of galaxy clustersforesees growth mostly through merging. galaxies in the infall region or in thecore of a cluster undergo transformations owing to different environmentalstresses. for two x-ray luminous clusters at redshift z ~ 0.3 with oppositex-ray morphologies, rxcj0014.3-3022 and rxcj2308.3-0211, we assess differencesin galaxy populations as a function of cluster topography. cluster large-scalestructure and substructure are determined from the combined photometry in theb, v, and r bands, and from multi-object optical spectroscopy at lowresolution. a spectral index analysis is performed, based on the [oii] andhdelta features, and the d4000 break, available for more than 100 membergalaxies per cluster. combination of spectral indices and fuv-optical coloursprovides a picture of the star formation history in galaxies. in spite of thepotential presence of a small fraction of galaxies with obscured star formationactivity, the average star-formation history of cluster members is found todepend on cluster-centric distance and on substructure. there is a sharpincrease in star formation activity along two well-defined filamentarystructures of the merging cluster rxcj0014.3-3022, out to its virial radius andbeyond, produced by luminous (l ~ l*) and sub-l* galaxies. conversely, theregular cool-core cluster rxcj2308.3-0211 mostly hosts galaxies which eitherpopulate the red sequence or are becoming passive. these results suggest theexistence of a correspondence between assembly state and overall age of thestellar populations of galaxies inside the virialized region and in thesurrounding large scale structure of massive clusters at z ~ 0.3.

0903.2297	cosmological studies with a large-area x-ray telescope	a moderate investment of observing time with the international x-rayobservatory to study high-redshift galaxy clusters detected in futurelarge-scale surveys, will provide cosmological measurements of fundamentalimportance. ixo observations, combined with lensing follow-up, will measure theperturbation growth factor from z=0-2 with an accuracy comparable to, orpossibly better than, that expected from observations of cosmic shear withjdem, and redshift-space distortions with euclid. the growth of structure dataderived from clusters will significantly improve our knowledge of the darkenergy equation of state and will aid in constraining non-gr models for cosmicacceleration. ixo observations of the largest, dynamically relaxed clusterswill provide a powerful, independent measurement of the cosmological expansionhistory using the apparent f_gas(z) trend. systematic and statistical errorsfrom this technique are competitive with snia and bao studies, making the testextremely useful for improving the accuracy and reliability of the geometriccosmological measurements planned for lsst and jdem. only by employing a rangeof powerful, independent approaches, including those discussed here, can robustanswers to puzzles as profound as the origin of cosmic acceleration beexpected.

0904.0448	stellar and total baryon mass fractions in groups and clusters since  redshift 1	we investigate if the discrepancy between estimates of the total baryon massfraction obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)and of galaxy groups/clusters persists when a large sample of groups isconsidered.  to this purpose, 91 candidate x-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 &lt; z&lt; 1 are selected from the cosmos 2 deg^2 survey, based only on their x-rayluminosity and extent. this sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with arobust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside r_500. thetotal sample of 118 groups and clusters with z &lt; 1 spans a range in m_500 of~10^13--10^15 m_sun. we find that the stellar mass fraction associated withgalaxies at r_500 decreases with increasing total mass as (m_500)^-0.37 \pm0.04, independent of redshift. estimating the total gas mass fraction from arecently derived, high quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction(f_500^stars+gas=f_500^stars+f_500^gas) is found to increase by ~ 25% whenm_500 increases from &lt;m&gt;=5 x 10^13 m_sun to &lt;m&gt; = 7 x 10^14 m_sun. afterconsideration of a plausible contribution due to intra--cluster light (11--22%of the total stellar mass), and gas depletion through the hierarchical assemblyprocess (10% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon massfraction are still lower than the latest cmb measure of the same quantity(wmap5), at a significance level of 3.3\sigma for groups of &lt;m&gt;=5 x10^13~m_sun. the discrepancy decreases towards higher total masses, such thatit is 1\sigma at &lt;m&gt;= 7 x 10^14~m_sun. we discuss this result in terms ofnon--gravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.

0907.5457	the reflex galaxy cluster survey. viii. spectroscopic observations and  optical atlas	we present the final data from the spectroscopic survey of the rosat-esoflux-limited x-ray (reflex) catalog of galaxy clusters. the reflex surveycovers 4.24 steradians (34% of the entire sky) below a declination of 2.5 degand at high galactic latitude (|b| &gt; 20 deg). the reflex catalog includes 447entries with a median redshift of 0.08 and is better than 90% complete to alimiting flux fx = 3x10^{-12} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} (0.1 to 2.4 kev), representingthe largest statistically homogeneous sample of clusters drawn from the rosatall-sky survey (rass) to date. here we describe the details of thespectroscopic observations carried out at the eso 1.5 m, 2.2 m, and 3.6 mtelescopes, as well as the data reduction and redshift measurement techniques.the spectra typically cover the wavelength range 3600-7500 a at a fwhmresolution of ~14 a, and the measured redshifts have a total rms error of ~100km s^{-1}. in total we present 1406 new galaxy redshifts in 192 clusters, mostof which previously did not have any redshift measured. finally, theluminosity/redshift distributions of the cluster sample and a comparison to theno-evolution expectations from the cluster x-ray luminosity function arepresented.

0909.3776	gas entropy in a representative sample of nearby x-ray galaxy clusters  (rexcess): relationship to gas mass fraction	(abridged) we examine the radial entropy distribution and its scaling using31 nearby galaxy clusters from the representative xmm-newton cluster structuresurvey (rexcess). the entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out tor_1000 in all systems and out to r_500 in 13 systems. compared to theoreticalexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependentexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower masssystems. at r_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligiblewithin the uncertainties. mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropyis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,becoming consistent with self-similar at r_500. the dispersion in scaledentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores anddynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of twoand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. parameterising the profileswith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropyk_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skeweddistribution. the outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; theirdistribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98. renormalising thedimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile f_gas(&lt; r),leads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fractionvariations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropyproperties. we discuss a tentative scenario to explain the behaviour of theentropy and gas mass fraction in the rexcess sample, in which extra heating andmerger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority ofthe population, and a smaller fraction of systems develops a cool core.

0910.1234	the universal galaxy cluster pressure profile from a representative  sample of nearby systems (rexcess) and the y_sz-m_500 relation	(abridged) we investigate the regularity of cluster pressure profiles withrexcess, a representative sample of 33 local clusters observed with xmm-newton.the sample spans a mass range of 10^14 m_sun &lt;m_500&lt;10^15 m_sun. we derive anaverage profile from observations scaled by mass and z according to thestandard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about the mean isremarkably low beyond 0.2r_500, but increases towards the centre. deviationsabout the mean are related to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state ofthe cluster. unrelaxed systems have systematically shallower profiles whilecooling core systems are more concentrated. the scaled profiles exhibit aresidual mass dependence with a slope of about 0.12; however, the departurefrom standard scaling decreases with radius and is consistent with zero atr_500. the scatter in the core and departure from self-similar mass scaling issmaller compared to that of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure isthe quantity least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics.comparison with several state of the art numerical simulations shows goodagreement outside the core. combining the observational data below r_500 withsimulation data above, we derive the universal pressure profile, that, in ananalytical form, defines the physical pressure profile of clusters as afunction of mass and z up to the cluster 'boundary'. using this profile and theobserved pressure profiles, we investigate the scaling properties of theintegrated compton parameter y, considering both the spherically integratedquantity and the cylindrically integrated quantity, directly related to thesunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect signal. we further derive the expectedy_sz-m_500 and y_sz-l_x relations for any aperture.

0911.2798	brightest cluster galaxies and core gas density in rexcess clusters	we investigate the relationship between brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) andtheir host clusters using a sample of nearby galaxy clusters from therepresentative xmm cluster structure survey (rexcess). the sample was imagedwith the southern observatory for astrophysical research (soar) in r band toinvestigate the mass of the old stellar population. using a metric radius of12h^-1 kpc, we found that the bcg luminosity depends weakly on overall clustermass as l_bcg \propto m_cl^0.18+-0.07, consistent with previous work. we foundthat 90% of the bcgs are located within 0.035 r_500 of the peak of the x-rayemission, including all of the cool core (cc) clusters. we also found anunexpected correlation between the bcg metric luminosity and the core gasdensity for non-cool core (non-cc) clusters, following a power law of n_e\propto l_bcg^2.7+-0.4 (where n_e is measured at 0.008 r_500). the correlationis not easily explained by star formation (which is weak in non-cc clusters) oroverall cluster mass (which is not correlated with core gas density). the trendpersists even when the bcg is not located near the peak of the x-ray emission,so proximity is not necessary. we suggest that, for non-cc clusters, thiscorrelation implies that the same process that sets the central entropy of thecluster gas also determines the central stellar density of the bcg, and thatthis underlying physical process is likely to be mergers.

0912.4667	substructure of the galaxy clusters in the rexcess sample: observed  statistics and comparison to numerical simulations	we study the substructure statistics of a representative sample of galaxyclusters by means of two currently popular substructure characterisationmethods, power ratios and centroid shifts. we use the 31 clusters from therexcess sample, compiled from the southern rosat all-sky cluster survey reflexwith a morphologically unbiased selection in x-ray luminosity and redshift, allof which have been reobserved with xmm-newton. we investigate the uncertaintiesof the substructure parameters and examine the dependence of the results onprojection effects, finding that the uncertainties of the parameters can bequite substantial. thus while the quantification of the dynamical state ofindividual clusters with these parameters should be treated with extremecaution, these substructure measures provide powerful statistical tools tocharacterise trends of properties in large cluster samples. the centre shiftparameter, w, is found to be more sensitive in general. for the rexcess sampleneither the occurence of substructure nor the presence of cool cores depends oncluster mass. there is a significant anti-correlation between the existence ofsubstantial substructure and cool cores. the simulated clusters show on averagelarger substructure parameters than the observed clusters, a trend that istraced to the fact that cool regions are more pronounced in the simulatedclusters, leading to stronger substructure measures in merging clusters andclusters with offset cores. moreover, the frequency of cool regions is higherin the simulations than in the observations, implying that the description ofthe physical processes shaping cluster formation in the simulations requiresfurther improvement.

1003.5334	feedback under the microscope ii: heating, gas uplift, and mixing in the  nearest cluster core	using a combination of deep 574ks chandra data, xmm-newton high-resolutionspectra, and optical halpha+nii images, we study the nature and spatialdistribution of the multiphase plasma in m87. our results provide directobservational evidence of `radio mode' agn feedback in action, stripping thecentral galaxy of its lowest entropy gas and preventing star-formation. thislow entropy gas was entrained with and uplifted by the buoyantly risingrelativistic plasma, forming long "arms". these arms are likely oriented within15-30 degrees of our line-of-sight. the mass of the uplifted gas in the arms iscomparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpccore, demonstrating that the agn has a profound effect on its immediatesurroundings. the coolest x-ray emitting gas in m87 has a temperature of ~0.5kev and is spatially coincident with halpha+nii nebulae, forming a multiphasemedium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments. weplace strong upper limits of 0.06 msun/yr on the amount of plasma coolingradiatively from 0.5 kev and show that a uniform, volume-averaged heatingmechanism could not be preventing the cool gas from further cooling. all of thebright halpha filaments appear in the downstream region of the &lt;3 myr old shockfront, at smaller radii than ~0.6'. we suggest that shocks induce shearingaround the filaments, thereby promoting mixing of the cold gas with the ambienthot icm via instabilities. by bringing hot thermal particles into contact withthe cool, line-emitting gas, mixing can supply the power and ionizing particlesneeded to explain the observed optical spectra. mixing of the coolest x-rayemitting plasma with the cold optical line emitting filamentary gas promotesefficient conduction between the two phases, allowing non-radiative coolingwhich could explain the lack of x-ray gas with temperatures under 0.5 kev.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

0708.3253	complex x-ray morphology of abell 3128: a distant cluster behind a  disturbed cluster	we present here the results of a detailed study of the x-ray properties ofthe cluster of galaxies abell 3128 (z=0.06), based on the analysis of deep (100ks) xmm-newton data. the most obvious feature of the x-ray morphology of a3128is the presence of two x-ray peaks separated by ~12'. by detecting theredshifted fe k line, we find that the northeast (ne) x-ray peak observedtoward a3128 is a distant luminous cluster of galaxies at redshift z=0.44. oursubsequent optical spectroscopic observation of a distant radio bright galaxyin the centre of the ne x-ray peak with the magellan telescope also revealed aredshift of z=0.44, confirming the association of the galaxy with the clusterseen in x-rays. we detect a gravitational arc around the galaxy. the propertiesof this galaxy indicate that it is the cd galaxy of the cluster in thebackground. the properties of the southwest x-ray peak suggest that it is thecore of a group merging with a3128 along our line of sight. based on 2d maps ofthermodynamic properties of the intra-cluster medium determined aftersubtracting a model for the background cluster, we conclude that an enhancedsurface brightness region at a distance of ~2.8' from the centre of the galaxydistribution is the centre of the gravitational potential of the cluster a3128.the unrelaxed nature of a3128 can be attributed to its location in the highdensity environment of the horologium-reticulum supercluster.

0709.4499	metal-rich multi-phase gas in m87: agn-driven metal transport,  magnetic-field supported multi-temperature gas, and constraints on  non-thermal emission observed with xmm-newton	we use deep (~120 ks) xmm-newton data of the m87 halo to analyze itsspatially resolved temperature structure and chemical composition. we focusparticularly on the regions of enhanced x-ray brightness associated with theinner radio lobes, which are known not to be described very well bysingle-temperature spectral models. compared to a simple two-temperature fit,we obtain a better and more physical description of the spectra using a modelthat involves a continuous range of temperatures in each spatial bin. the rangeof temperatures of the multiphase gas spans ~0.6-3.2 kev. such a multiphasestructure is only possible if thermal conduction is suppressed by magneticfields. in the multi-temperature regions, we find a correlation between theamount of gas cooler than the surrounding x-ray plasma and the metallicity, andconclude that the cool gas is more metal-rich than the ambient halo. weestimate the average fe abundance of the cool gas to ~2.2 solar. our resultsthus point toward the key role of the active galactic nucleus (agn) intransporting heavy elements into the intracluster medium. the abundance ratiosof o/si/s/fe in and outside the x-ray arms are similar, indicating that thedominant fraction of metals in the gas halo was uplifted by agn outburstsrelatively recently compared to the age of m87. our estimate for the mass ofthe cool gas is 5e8 m_sun, which probably stems from a mixture of icm, stellarmass loss, and type ia supernova products. ~30-110 myr are required to producethe observed metals in the cool gas. finally, we put upper limits on possiblenon-thermal x-ray emission from m87 and, combining it with the 90 cm radiomaps, we put lower limits of around ~0.5-1.0 mug on the magnetic fieldstrength.

1107.3986	two fossil groups of galaxies at z~0.4 in the cosmos: accelerated  stellar-mass build-up, different progenitors	we report on 2 fossil groups of galaxies at z=0.425 and 0.372 discovered inthe cosmic evolution survey (cosmos) area. selected as x-ray extended sources,they have total masses (m_200) of 1.9(+/-0.41)e13 and 9.5(+/-0.42)e13 m_sun,respectively, as obtained from a recent x-ray luminosity-mass scaling relation.the lower mass system appears isolated, whereas the other sits in a well-knownlarge-scale structure (lss) populated by 27 other x-ray emitting groups. theidentification as fossil is based on the i-band photometry of all the galaxieswith a photo-z consistent with that of the group at the 2-sigma confidencelevel and within a projected group-centric distance equal to 0.5r_200, andi_ab&lt;=22.5-mag limited spectroscopy. both fossil groups exhibit highstellar-to-total mass ratios compared to all the x-ray selected groups ofsimilar mass at 0.3&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 in the cosmos. at variance with the compositegalaxy stellar mass functions (gsmfs) of similarly massive systems, both fossilgroup gsmfs are dominated by passively evolving galaxies down to m^stars~1e10m_sun (according to the galaxy broad-band spectral energy distributions). therelative lack of star-forming galaxies with 1e10&lt;=m^stars&lt;=1e11 m_sun isconfirmed by the galaxy distribution in the b-r vs i color-magnitude diagram.hence, the 2 fossil groups appear as more mature than the coeval, similarlymassive groups. their overall star formation activity ended rapidly after anaccelerated build up of the total stellar mass; no significant infall ofgalaxies with m^stars&gt;=1e10 m_sun took place in the last 3 to 6 gyr. thissimilarity holds although the 2 fossil groups are embedded in two verydifferent density environments of the lss, which suggests that their galaxypopulations were shaped by processes that do not depend on the lss. however,their progenitors may do so. ...

1110.5875	x-ray surface brightness and gas density fluctuations in the coma  cluster	x-ray surface brightness fluctuations in the core ($650 \times 650$ kpc)region of the coma cluster observed with xmm-newton and chandra are analyzedusing a 2d power spectrum approach. the resulting 2d spectra are converted to3d power spectra of gas density fluctuations. our independent analyses of thexmm-newton and chandra observations are in excellent agreement and provide themost sensitive measurements of surface brightness and density fluctuations fora hot cluster. we find that the characteristic amplitude of the volume fillingdensity fluctuations relative to the smooth underlying density distributionvaries from 7-10% on scales of $\sim$500 kpc down to $\sim$5% at scales $\sim$30 kpc. on smaller spatial scales, projection effects smear the densityfluctuations by a large factor, precluding strong limits on the fluctuations in3d. on the largest scales probed (hundreds of kpc), the dominant contributionsto the observed fluctuations most likely arise from perturbations of thegravitational potential by the two most massive galaxies in coma, ngc4874 andngc4889, and the low entropy gas brought to the cluster by an infalling group.other plausible sources of x-ray surface brightness fluctuations are discussed,including turbulence, metal abundance variations, and unresolved sources.despite a variety of possible origins for density fluctuations, the gas in thecoma cluster core is remarkably homogeneous on scales from $\sim$ 500 to$\sim$30 kpc.

1111.0009	the x-ray luminous galaxy cluster population at 0.9&lt;z&lt;~1.6 as revealed  by the xmm-newton distant cluster project	we present the largest sample of spectroscopically confirmed x-ray luminoushigh-redshift galaxy clusters to date comprising 22 systems in the range0.9&lt;z&lt;\sim1.6 as part of the xmm-newton distant cluster project (xdcp). allsystems were initially selected as extended x-ray sources over 76.1 deg^2 ofnon-contiguous deep archival xmm-newton coverage. we test and calibrate themost promising two-band redshift estimation techniques based on the r-z and z-hcolors for efficient distant cluster identifications and find a good redshiftaccuracy performance of the z-h color out to at least z\sim1.5, while theredshift evolution of the r-z color leads to increasingly large uncertaintiesat z&gt;\sim0.9. we present first details of two newly identified clusters, xdcpj0338.5+0029 at z=0.916 and xdcp j0027.2+1714 at z=0.959, and investigate thexray properties of sparcs j003550-431224 at z=1.335, which shows evidence forongoing major merger activity along the line-of-sight. we provide x-rayproperties and luminosity-based total mass estimates for the full sample, whichhas a median system mass of m200\simeq2\times10^14m\odot. in contrast to localclusters, the z&gt;0.9 systems do mostly not harbor central dominant galaxiescoincident with the x-ray centroid position, but rather exhibit significant bcgoffsets from the x-ray center with a median value of about 50 kpc in projectionand a smaller median luminosity gap to the second-ranked galaxy of \sim0.3mag.we estimate a fraction of cluster-associated nvss 1.4ghz radio sources of about30%, preferentially located within 1' from the x-ray center. the galaxypopulations in z&gt;\sim1.5 cluster environments show first evidence for drasticchanges on the high-mass end of galaxies and signs for a gradual disappearanceof a well-defined cluster red-sequence as strong star formation activity isobserved in an increasing fraction of massive galaxies down to the densest coreregions.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

0711.4110	width of x-ray lines in cooling flows	the dissipation of turbulent gas motions is one of the likely mechanisms thathas been proposed to heat the intracluster medium (icm) in the cores ofclusters and groups of galaxies. we consider the impact of gas motions on thewidth of the most prominent x-ray emission lines. for heavy elements (likeiron) the expected linewidth is much larger than the width due to pure thermalbroadening and the contribution due to turbulent gas motions should be easilydetected with the new generation of x-ray micro-calorimeters, such as thespektr-rg calorimeter (sxc). for instance in the perseus cluster the turbulentvelocity required to balance radiative cooling (as derived by rebusco et al.2006), would imply a width of the 6.7 kev fe line of 10-20 ev, while the purethermal broadening is ~4 ev. the radial dependence of the linewidth issensitive to i) the radial dependence of the velocity amplitude and ii) the"directionality" of the stochastic motions (e.g. isotropic turbulence orpredominantly radial gas motions). if the width of several lines,characteristic for different gas temperatures, can be measured, then it shouldbe possible to probe both the "directionality" and the amplitude of the gasmotions. moreover a measurement of the width would put a lower limit on theamount of the kinetic energy available for dissipation, giving a constraint onthe icm models.

astro-ph;0008245	the rosat-eso flux limited x-ray (reflex) galaxy cluster survey ii: the  spatial correlation function	we report the results of the spatial two-point correlation function xi(r) forthe new x-ray galaxy cluster survey reflex, which comprises of 452 x-rayselected clusters (449 with redshifts) detected by the rosat satellite duringthe rosat all-sky-survey. the reflex cluster sample is flux limited to3x10^{-12} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the rosat energy band (0.1-2.4 kev) and spans3 decades in x-ray luminosity (10^{42} - 10^{45} h^{-2} erg s^{-1}), containinggalaxy groups and rich clusters out to a redshift z~0.3. covering a contiguousarea of 4.24 sr reflex is the largest x-ray cluster sample to date for whichspatial clustering has been analysed. correlation studies using clustersselected on the basis of their x-ray emission are particularly interesting asthey are largely free from the projection biases inherent to optical studies.for the entire flux-limited sample we find that the correlation length (thescale at which the correlation amplitude passes through unity) r_0~20h^{-1}mpc. for example, if a power-law fit is made to xi(r) over the range 4-40h^{-1} mpc then r_0=18.8+-0.9. an indication of the robustness of this resultcomes from the high degree of isotropy seen in the clustering pattern on scalesclose to the correlation length. on larger scales xi(r) deviates from apower-law, crossing zero at ~45h^{-1} mpc. from an examination of 5volume-limited cluster sub-samples we find no significant trend of r_0 withlimiting x-ray luminosity. a comparison with recent model predictions for theclustering properties of x-ray flux-limited samples, indicates that cold darkmatter models with the matter density omega_m=1 fail to produce sufficientclustering to account for the data, while omega_m~0.3 models provide anexcellent fit.

astro-ph;0010380	temperature map of the virgo cluster of galaxies observed with asca	the temperature distribution of the intracluster medium (icm) in the virgocluster of galaxies has been derived from extensive mapping observations withasca covering an area of 19 deg^2. in the spectral analysis, the inner regionwithin a radius of ~60' from m87 is characterized by an icm temperature of kt\~2.5 kev with little variation. on the other hand, the outer regions indicatesignificant variation of the temperature with an amplitude of about 1 kev. thetemperature map was produced from the hardness ratio (h.r.) values with aresolution of about 5'. besides the previously reported hot region with kt &gt; 4kev between m87 and m49, several hot regions with kt = 3-4 kev are detected inthe cluster outskirts. the auto-correlation function for the h.r. variationshows that the temperature variation is correlated within a size of about 300kpc, suggesting that gas blobs falling in the virgo cluster have a typical sizeof groups of galaxies. a correlation with the velocity dispersion of membergalaxies shows that only the north-west region indicates an unusually largebeta_spec value of 2-4. the upper limit for extended non-thermal emission inthe virgo cluster is obtained to be l_x ~9 x 10^41 ergs/s in the 2 - 10 kevband. we discuss that these features consistently indicate that the virgocluster is in a relatively early stage of the cluster evolution.

astro-ph;0109030	a systematic study of x-ray substructure of galaxy clusters detected in  the rosat all-sky survey	results of a systematic study of substructure in x-ray surface brightnessdistributions of a combined sample of 470 reflex+bcs clusters of galaxies arepresented. the fully automized morphology analysis is based on data of the 3rdprocessing of the rosat all-sky survey (rass-3). after correction for severalsystematic effects, $52\pm 7$ percent of the reflex+bcs clusters are found tobe substructured in metric apertures of 1 mpc radius ($h_0= 50 {\rm km} {\rms}^{-1} {\rm mpc}^{-1}$). future simulations will show statistically which massspectrum of major and minor mergers contributes to this number. anotherimportant result is the discovery of a substructure-density relation, analogousto the morphology-density relation for galaxies. here, clusters with asymmetricor multi-modal x-ray surface brightness distributions are locatedpreferentially in regions with higher cluster number densities. thesubstructure analyses techniques are used to compare the x-ray morphology of 53clusters with radio halos and relics, and 22 cooling flow clusters with thereflex+bcs reference sample. after careful equalization of the different`sensitivities' of the subsamples to substructure detection it is found thatthe halo and relic sample tends to show more often multi-modal and elongatedx-ray surface brightness distributions compared to the reflex+bcs referencesample. the cooling flow clusters show more often circular symmetric andunimodal distributions compared to the reflex+bcs and the halo/relic referencesamples. both findings further support the idea that radio halos and relics aretriggered by merger events, and that pre-existing cooling flows might bedisrupted by recent major mergers.

astro-ph;0110516	x-ray evidence for spectroscopic diversity of type ia supernovae: xmm  observation of the elemental abundance pattern in m87	we present the results of a detailed element abundance study of hot gas inm87, observed by xmm-newton. we choose two radial bins, 1'-3' and 8'-16'(8'-14' for emos; hereafter the central and the outer zones), where thetemperature is almost constant, to carry out the detailed abundancemeasurements of o, ne, mg, si, s, ar, ca, fe and ni using epic-pn (epn) and-mos (emos) data. first, we find that the element abundance pattern in thecentral compared to the outer zone in m87 is characterized by sn ia enrichmentof a high (roughly solar) ratio of si-group elements (si, s, ar, ca) to fe,implying that si burning in sn ia is highly incomplete. in nucleosynthesismodeling this is associated with either a lower density of thedeflagration-detonation transition and/or lower c/o and/or lower centralignition density and observationally detected as optically subluminous sne iain early-type galaxies. second, we find that sn ia enrichment has asystematically lower ratio of the si-group elements to fe by 0.2 dex in theouter zone associated with the icm of the virgo cluster. we find that such aratio and even lower values by another 0.1 dex are a characteristic of the icmin many clusters using observed si:s:fe ratios as found with asca. third, theni/fe ratio in the central zone of m87 is 1.5+/-0.3 solar (meteoritic), whilevalues around 3 times solar are reported for other clusters. in modeling of snia, this implies a reduced influence of fast deflagration sn ia models in thechemical enrichment of m87's ism. thus, to describe the sn ia metal enrichmentin clusters, both deflagration as well as delayed detonation scenarios arerequired, supporting a similar conclusion, derived from optical studies on sneia. abridged.

astro-ph;0201125	cooling flows as a calorimeter of agn mechanical power	the assumption that radiative cooling of gas in the centers of galaxyclusters is approximately balanced by energy input from a central supermassiveblack hole implies that the observed x-ray luminosity of the cooling flowregion sets a lower limit on agn mechanical power. the conversion efficiency ofagn mechanical power into gas heating is uncertain, but we argue that it can behigh even in the absence of strong shocks. these arguments inevitably lead tothe conclusion that the time averaged mechanical power of agns in cooling flowsis much higher than the presently observed bolometric luminosity of theseobjects.  the energy balance between cooling losses and agn mechanical power requiressome feedback mechanism. we consider a toy model in which the accretion rateonto a black hole is set by the classic bondi formula. application of thismodel to the best studied case of m87 suggests that accretion proceeds atapproximately the bondi rate down to a few gravitational radii with most of thepower (at the level of a few percent of the rest mass) carried away by anoutflow.

astro-ph;0206362	asca observations of groups at radii of low overdensity. implications  for the cosmic preheating	through a 3d-modeling of asca observations, we performed a spatially resolvedx-ray spectroscopic study, extending to radii exceeding 150 kpc, for a sampleof 9 groups of galaxies. combined with published rosat results, we concludethat these systems generally exhibit a strong temperature decline at outerradii. in our best case, ngc3268, this corresponds to a flattening of theentropy profile at a level of ~400 kev cm^2. this value is high compared bothto the observed entropy floor of ~100 kev cm^2 and to the expected value fromgravitational heating. we suggest that the observed entropy profile in mostgroups at densities exceeding 500 times the critical is purely driven bynon-gravitational heating processes. after comparison with a larger sample ofgroups and clusters, we conclude that there is a variation in the level ofnon-gravitational heating between ~100 kev cm^2 and ~400 kev cm^2 within everysystem. using models of cluster formation as a reference frame, we establishedthat the accreted gas reaches an entropy level of 400 kev cm^2 by redshift2.0-2.5, while such high entropies where not present at redshifts higher than2.8-3.5, favoring nearly instantaneous preheating. adopting galactic winds as asource of preheating, and scaling the released energy by the observed metalabundance, the variation in the preheating could be ascribed mostly tovariation in the typical overdensity of the energy injection, ~30 for anentropy floor (100 kev cm^2) and to ~5 for an entropy of 400 kev cm^2.

astro-ph;0309763	spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopy of cooling clusters of galaxies	we present spatially resolved x-ray spectra taken with the epic cameras ofxmm-newton of a sample of 17 cooling clusters and three non-cooling clustersfor comparison. the deprojected spectra are analyzed with a multi-temperaturemodel, independent of any a priori assumptions about the physics behind thecooling and heating mechanisms. all cooling clusters show a central decrementof the average temperature, most of them of a factor of ~2. at each radiuswithin the cooling region the gas is non-isothermal. the differential emissionmeasure distribution peaks near the maximum (ambient) temperature, and steeplydeclines towards lower temperatures, proportional to t^3, or alternatively acut-off at about a quarter to half of the maximum temperature. in general, wefind a poor correlation between radio flux of the central galaxy and thetemperature decrement of the cooling flow. this is interpreted as evidence thatexcept for a few cases heating by a central agn is not the most common cause ofweak cooling flows. we investigate the role of heat conduction by electrons andfind that the theoretically predicted conductivity rates are not high enough tobalance radiation losses. the differential emission measure distribution hasremarkable similarities with the predictions from coronal magnetic loop models.also the physical processes involved (radiative cooling, thermal conductionalong the loops, gravity) are similar for clusters loops and coronal loops. ifcoronal loop models apply to clusters, we find that a few hundred loops perscale height should be present. the typical loop sizes deduced from theobserved emission measure distribution are consistent with the characteristicmagnetic field sizes deduced from faraday rotation measurements.

astro-ph;0408304	spatial correlation function of x-ray selected agn	we present a detailed description of the first direct measurement of thespatial correlation function of x-ray selected agn. this result is based on anx-ray flux-limited sample of 219 agn discovered in the contiguous 80.7 deg^2region of the rosat north ecliptic pole (nep) survey. clustering is detected atthe 4 sigma level at comoving scales in the interval r = 5-60 h^-1 mpc. fittingthe data with a power law of slope gamma=1.8, we find a correlation length ofr_0 = 7.4 (+1.8, -1.9) h^-1 mpc (omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7). the medianredshift of the agn contributing to the signal is z_xi=0.22. this clusteringamplitude implies that x-ray selected agn are spatially distributed in a mannersimilar to that of optically selected agn. furthermore, the rosat nepdetermination establishes the local behavior of agn clustering, a regime whichis poorly sampled in general. combined with high-redshift measures from opticalstudies, the rosat nep results argue that the agn correlation strengthessentially does not evolve with redshift, at least out to z~2.2. in the localuniverse, x-ray selected agn appear to be unbiased relative to galaxies and theinferred x-ray bias parameter is near unity, b_x~1. hence x-ray selected agnclosely trace the underlying mass distribution. the rosat nep agn catalog,presented here, features complete optical identifications and spectroscopicredshifts. the median redshift, x-ray flux, and x-ray luminosity are z=0.41,f_x=1.1*10^-13 cgs, and l_x=9.2*10^43 h_70^-2 cgs (0.5-2.0 kev), respectively.unobscured, type 1 agn are the dominant constituents (90%) of this soft x-rayselected sample of agn.

astro-ph;0501141	impact of stochastic gas motions on galaxy cluster abundance profiles	the impact of stochastic gas motions on the metal distribution in clustercore is evaluated. peaked abundance profiles are a characteristic feature ofclusters with cool cores and abundance peaks are likely associated with thebrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) which dwell in cluster cores. the width ofthe abundance peaks is however significantly broader than the bcg lightdistribution, suggesting that some gas motions are transporting metalsoriginating from within the bcg. assuming that this process can be treated asdiffusive and using the brightest x-ray cluster a426 (perseus) as an example,we estimate that a diffusion coefficient of the order of $2 10^{29} {\rm cm^2s^{-1}}$ is needed to explain the width of the observed abundance profiles.much lower (higher) diffusion coefficients would result in too peaked (tooshallow) profiles. such diffusion could be produced by stochastic gas motionsand our analysis provides constraints on the product of their characteristicvelocity and their spatial coherence scale. we speculate that the activity ofthe supermassive black hole of the bcg is driving the stochastic gas motions incluster cores. when combined with the assumption that the dissipation of thesame motions is a key gas heating mechanism, one can estimate both the velocityand the spatial scale of such a diffusive processes.

astro-ph;0502322	further evidence for a merger in abell 2218 from an xmm-newton  observation	(abridged) the galaxy cluster abell 2218, at z=0.171, is well-known for thediscrepancy between mass estimates derived from x-ray and strong lensinganalyses. with the present xmm observation, we trace the gas density andtemperature profiles out to a radius of ~ 1400 h_70^-1 kpc (approximately thevirial radius of the cluster). the surface brightness profile is well fittedover three orders of magnitude with a beta model, with a core radius of 0.'95and \beta=0.63. the projected temperature profile declines steeply with radius(by ~50%), and is well described by a polytrope with parameters t_0=8.09 kevand \gamma=1.15. the temperature map shows a pronounced peak in the centralarcminute, with an increase of a factor of two (from ~5 to ~10 kev). the massprofile, calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry, isbest fitted with a king approximation to an isothermal sphere, implying a darkmatter distribution with a central core, in contrast with the cusped coresfound in more obviously relaxed clusters. the x-ray mass is two times less thanthe strong lensing mass at r ~ 80 h_50^-1 kpc, although the agreement betweenx-ray and weak lensing mass measurements at larger radius (r ~ 400 h_50^-1 kpc)is slightly better. while the x-ray total mass estimates can vary by 30%depending on the mass model, all measurements are lower than the correspondingtotal mass from optical measurements. given the x-ray results indicatingdisturbance of the intracluster gas, leading to a likely violation of theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, and the observed substructure in theoptical, suggesting a line-of-sight merger, it is unlikely that the differentmass estimates of this cluster can be reconciled, at least with standardmodelling assumptions.

astro-ph;0507073	supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies: switching from very  bright to very dim	relativistic outflows (mainly observed in the radio) are a characteristicfeature of both galactic stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes(smbhs). simultaneous radio and x-ray observations of galactic sources haveshown that the outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakensdramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifestingstructural changes in the accretion flow. it is reasonable to assume that smbhsfollow the same trend. for low luminosity smbhs in nearby elliptical galaxiesand clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play thecentral role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). if the outflow isquenched in smbhs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galacticsources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback ofrapidly accreting smbhs. we argue that elliptical galaxies and their centralengines should then evolve through two stages. early on, the central smbhrapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-eddington rate with highradiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. this stageterminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that itsfeedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency,is able to suppress gas cooling. after that the system switches to a stablestate corresponding to passively evolving ellipticals, when the accretion rateand radiative efficiency are very low, but the gas heating efficiency is highand energy input from the relativistic outflow keeps the gas hot.

astro-ph;9607027	the radio and x-ray properties of abell 2255	new radio and x-ray data are reported for the rich cluster abell 2255. thecluster radio emission is characterized by the presence of a diffuse halosource, located at the cluster center, and a more peripheral ridge of radioemission which could be a relic. in addition, 6 tailed radio sources and asmall double are found to be associated with cluster galaxies. at x-raywavelengths, the cluster shows elongated emission in the center, indicating anongoing cluster merger, with the axis in the east-west to southeast-northwestdirection. the overall cluster temperature is found from the rosat observationto be kt = 3.5 +- 1.5 kev, while the temperature determined from the einsteinmpc data was reported to be 7.3 kev. we interpret this difference as due to theexistence in the cluster of several coexisting temperature components. themerger process can provide energy to maintain the radio halo, but we stress theneed for tailed radio galaxies orbiting at the cluster center to provide thehalo relativistic electrons.

astro-ph;9705099	a dynamical study of optically selected distant clusters	we present a programme of spectroscopic observations of galaxies in a sampleof optically-selected clusters taken from the catalogue of couch et al (1991).previous rosat observations of these clusters have shown them to have lowerx-ray luminosities, given their optical richness, than might be expected on thebasis of local samples. in the present paper we extend this work by determiningvelocity dispersions of a subsample of the clusters. we confirm the dynamicalreality of all but one of the original sample, and find velocity dispersionscomparable with present-day clusters of equivalent comoving space density.thus, in the context of the $l_x-\sigma$ relation for present-day clusters,there is evidence for a higher velocity dispersion at fixed x-ray luminosity.  a key question is whether the high velocity dispersions are indicative of thegravitational potential. if they are, the x-ray luminosities measured in boweret al., 1994 (paper i), would then imply an implausibly low efficiency of x-raygeneration. alternatively, the discrepancy could be explained if the clusterswere systems of lower virial temperature, in which the apparent velocitydispersion is inflated by an infalling, unrelaxed halo. this might resulteither from an increase with redshift in the infall rate for clusters, or fromthe preferential selection of clusters embedded in filaments oriented along theline of sight. since clusters with similar properties can be found in localoptically selected catalogues, we suggest that the latter explanation is morelikely.

astro-ph;9802081	hydrodynamics and stability of galactic cooling flows	using numerical techniques we studied the global stability of cooling flowsin giant elliptical galaxies. as an initial equilibrium state we choose thehydrostatic gas recycling model (kritsuk 1996). non-equilibrium radiativecooling, stellar mass loss, heating by type ia supernovae, distributed massdeposition, and thermal conductivity are included. although the recycling modelreproduces the basic x-ray observables, it appears to be unstable with respectto the development of inflow or outflow. in spherically symmetry the inflowsare subject to a central cooling catastrophe, while the outflows saturate in aform of a subsonic galactic wind. two-dimensional axisymmetric random velocityperturbations of the equilibrium model trigger the onset of a coolingcatastrophe, which develops in an essentially non-spherical way. thesimulations show a patchy pattern of mass deposition and the formation ofhollow gas jets, which penetrate through the outflow down to the galaxy core.the x-ray observables of such a hybrid gas flow mimic those of the equilibriumrecycling model, but the gas temperature exhibits a central depression. themass deposition rate m_dot consists of two contributions of similar size: (i) ahydrostatic one resembling that of the equilibrium model, and (ii) a dynamicalone which is related to the jets and is more concentrated to the centre. for amodel galaxy, like ngc 4472, our 2d simulations predict m_dot = 2 m_sun/yrwithin the cooling radius for the advanced non-linear stage of the instability.we discuss the implications of these results to h_alpha nebulae and starformation in cooling flow galaxies and emphasize the need for high-resolution3d simulations.

astro-ph;9803092	discovery of x-ray emission rom the distant lensing cluster of galaxies  cl2236-04 at z = 0.552	x-ray emission from the distant lensing cluster cl2236-04 at $z$ = 0.552 wasdiscovered by asca and rosat/hri observations. if the spherical symmetric massdistribution model of the cluster is assumed, the lensing estimate of thecluster mass is a factor of two higher than that obtained from x-rayobservations as reported for many distant clusters. however, the elliptical andclumpy lens model proposed by kneib et al.(1993) is surprisingly consistentwith the x-ray observations assuming that the x-ray emitting hot gas isisothermal and in a hydrostatic equilibrium state. the existence of the coolingflow in the central region of the cluster is indicated by the short centralcooling time and the excess flux detected by rosat/hri compared to the ascaflux. however, it is shown that even if the axj2239-0429 has a cooling flow inthe central region, the temperature measured by asca which is the meanemission-weighted cluster temperature in this case, should not be cooler thanand different from the virial temperature of the cluster. therefore, weconclude that the effect of the clumpiness and non-zero ellipticity in the massdistribution of the cluster are essential to explain the observed feature ofthe giant luminous arc, and there is no discrepancy between strong lensing andx-ray estimation of the mass of the cluster in this cluster.

astro-ph;9811093	the enhancement and decrement of the sunyaev-zeldovich effect towards  the rosat cluster rxj0658-5557	we report simultaneous observations at 1.2 and 2 mm, with a double channelphotometer on the sest telescope, of the x-ray cluster rxj0658-5557 in searchfor the sunyaev-zel'dovich (s-z). the s-z data were analyzed using therelativistically correct expression for the comptonization parameter and wefind from the detected decrement (2.60 +/- 0.79) ~ 10^{-4}, which is consistentwith that computed using the x-ray (rosat and asca) observations. theuncertainty includes contributions due to statistical uncertainty in thedetection and systematics and calibration. the 1.2 {mm} channel data alonegives rise to a larger comptonization parameter and this result is discussed interms of contamination from foreground sources and/or dust in the cluster orfrom a possible systematic effect. we then make use of the combined analysis ofthe rosat and asca x-ray satellite observations to determine an isothermalmodel for the s-z surface brightness. since the cluster is asymmetrical andprobably in a merging process, models are only approximate. the associateduncertainty can, however, be estimated by exploring a set of alternativemodels. we then find as the global uncertainty on the comptonization parametera factor of 1.3. combining the s-z and the x-ray measurements, we determine avalue for the hubble constant. the 2 mm data are consistent with h_0(q_0 =1/2)= 53^{+38}_{-28} km/s mpc^{-1}, where the uncertainty is dominated by theuncertainty in models of the x-ray plasma halo.

astro-ph;9811464	morphology of the virgo cluster: gas versus galaxies	we draw a quantitative comparison of the distribution of the galaxies and theintra-cluster gas in the virgo cluster by extending the morphological analysisby binggeli et al. (1987) to the intra-cluster gas. we use the virgo clustercatalog in combination with data from the rosat all-sky survey. the galaxydistribution and the gas distribution are relatively similar. in both wavebandsthe irregular structure of virgo can be decomposed into three major subclusterscentred on m87, m49, and m86. a new statistical method of subclusterdecomposition is applied. radial galaxy and x-ray density profiles of the threesubclusters are fitted with beta-models, allowing analytic deprojection.comparison of these profiles reveals, that there is no general luminositysegregation. the gas density profile is steeper than the galaxy density profilein the inner part, while this trend is reversed in the outer part. a comparisonamong the subclusters shows the poorer the subcluster the steeper its radialprofile, i.e. the more compact it is, both in the optical and the x-rays. thesubcluster profiles for different hubble types confirm the well-known resultthat the distribution of the late-type galaxies is more extended than the earlytypes. differential and integrated mass density profiles of the differentcomponents in the m87 and m49 subclusters are presented. the total, gravitatingmass is inferred from the distribution of the x-ray gas. in the m87 subclusterthe gas mass is about three times the mass in galaxies, while it accounts onlyfor 8% to 14% of the total mass at 0.4 and 1 mpc, respectively. in the m49subcluster there is more mass in the galaxies than in the gas and thegas-to-total mass fraction is only 1%, which is unusually low for a cluster.the mass-to-light ratios show relatively constant values around 500msol/lsol.

0809.3784	galaxy cluster x-ray luminosity scaling relations from a representative  local sample (rexcess)	(abridged) we examine the x-ray luminosity scaling relations of 31 nearbygalaxy clusters from the representative xmm-newton cluster structure survey(rexcess). the objects are selected in x-ray luminosity only, optimallysampling the cluster luminosity function; temperatures range from 2 to 9 kevand there is no bias toward any particular morphological type. pertinent valuesare extracted in an aperture corresponding to r_500, estimated using the tightcorrelation between y_x and total mass. the data exhibit power law relationsbetween bolometric x-ray luminosity and temperature, y_x and total mass, allwith slopes that are significantly steeper than self-similar expectations. weexamine the causes for the steepening, finding that the primary driver appearsto be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. scatter about therelations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. the naturallogarithmic scatter about the raw x-ray luminosity-temperature relation isabout 70%, and about the x-ray luminosity-y_x relation it is 40%. cool core andmorphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual spacewith respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematicallyto the high luminosity side, the latter to the low luminosity side. exclusionof the central regions serves to reduce the scatter by more than 50%. using y_xas a mass proxy, we derive a malmquist bias corrected luminosity-mass relationand compare with previous determinations. our results indicate that luminositycan be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has importantimplications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to beundertaken with planck and erosita, and ultimately for the use of clusters forcosmological purposes.
