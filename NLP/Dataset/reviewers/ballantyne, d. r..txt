0904.0996	the contribution of active galactic nuclei to the microjansky radio  population	a x-ray background synthesis model is used to calculate the contribution ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) to the 1.4 ghz number counts between 100 njy and10 mjy. the number counts are broken down into contributions from radio-quietand radio-loud agns, obscured and unobscured agns, and for different ranges inredshift and 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity, l_x. compton-thick agns are included,but only to the level required to fit the peak of the x-ray background. thepredicted radio counts show that the microjy agn population will be dominatedby obscured, radio-quiet seyfert galaxies with log l_x &lt; 43, and spanning 0 &lt; z&lt;~ 3. however, depending on the exact relationship between the radio and x-rayluminosities in radio-quiet agns, additional radio flux due to star-formationwithin agn host galaxies may be necessary in order to match the observed agncounts at a flux density of ~50 microjy. the star-formation rates (sfr)required are modest, only ~3 msun per year, assuming a constant rate with z andl_x. a more observationally and theoretically motivated relationship, where thesfr \propto (1+z)^{1.76}(log l_x-40)^{3.5}, will also account for the observedcounts. the microjy agn population will provide a very clean sample to tracethe accretion and galactic star-formation histories of seyfert galaxies over asignificant fraction of cosmic time.

0906.0799	structure of the accretion flow in broad-line radio galaxies: the case  of 3c390.3	we present xmm and suzaku observations of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg)3c390.3. the fe ka line has a width fwhm ~ 8,800 km/s, consistent within afactor two with the width of the double-peaked h_alpha line, suggesting anorigin from the broad line region. the data show for the first time a weak,broad bump extending from 5 to 7 kev. when fitted with a gaussian, its centroidenergy is 6.6 kev in the source's rest-frame with fwhm of 43,000 km/s and ew of50 ev; its most likely interpretation is emission from he-like fe (fe xxv),suggesting the presence of an ionized medium in the inner regions of 3c390.3.the broad-band 0.5-100 kev continuum is well described by a single power lawwith photon index gamma=1.6 and cutoff energy 157 kev, plus cold reflectionwith strength r=0.5. in addition, ionized reflection is required to account forthe 6.6 kev bump in the broad-band continuum, yielding an ionization parameterxi ~ 2700 ergs cm s^-1; the inner radius of the ionized reflector isconstrained to be larger than 20 r_g, although this result depends on theassumed emissivity profile of the disk. if true, we argue that the lack ofbroad fe k emission from within 20 r_g indicates that the innermost regions ofthe disk in 3c390.3 are obscured and/or poorly illuminated. while the sed of3c390.3 is generally dominated by accretion-related continuum, during accretionlow states the jet can significantly contribute in the optical to x-ray bandsvia synchrotron self-compton emission.

0908.0716	short-term variability and psd analysis of the radio-loud agn 3c 390.3	we investigate the short-term variability properties and the power spectraldensity (psd) of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 390.3 using observationsmade by xmm, rxte, and suzaku on several occasions between october 2004 anddecember 2006. the main aim of this work is to derive model-independentconstraints on the origin of the x-ray emission and on the nature of thecentral engine in 3c 390.3. on timescales of the order of few hours, probed byuninterrupted xmm light curves, the flux of 3c 390.3 is consistent with beingconstant in all energy bands. on longer timescales, probed by the 2-day rxteand suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. the latterobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3c 390.3 isconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet seyfertgalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. the correlatedvariability between soft and hard x-rays, observed during the suzaku exposureand between the 2 xmm pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarioscharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10kev x-ray band. a detailed psd analysis carried out over five decades infrequency suggests the presence of a break at t_br~43 days at a 92% confidencelevel. this is the second tentative detection of a psd break in a radio-loud,non-jet dominated agn, after the blrg 3c120, and appears to be in generalagreement with the relation between t_br, m_bh, and l_bol, followed by seyfertgalaxies. our results indicate that the x-ray variability properties of 3c390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet agn, suggesting that thex-ray emission mechanism in 3c 390.3 is similar to that of nearby seyfertgalaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.

0908.1098	relativistic lines and reflection from the inner accretion disks around  neutron stars	a number of neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries have recently beendiscovered to show broad, asymmetric fe k emission lines in their x-rayspectra. these lines are generally thought to be the most prominent part of areflection spectrum, originating in the inner part of the accretion disk wherestrong relativistic effects can broaden emission lines. we present acomprehensive, systematic analysis of suzaku and xmm-newton spectra of 10neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries, all of which display broad fe k emissionlines. of the 10 sources, 4 are z sources, 4 are atolls and 2 are accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars (also atolls). the fe k lines are well fit by arelativistic line model for a schwarzschild metric, and imply a narrow range ofinner disk radii (6 - 15 gm/c^2) in most cases. this implies that the accretiondisk extends close to the neutron star surface over a range of luminosities.continuum modeling shows that for the majority of observations, a blackbodycomponent (plausibly associated with the boundary layer) dominates the x-rayemission from 8 - 20 kev. thus it appears likely that this spectral componentproduces the majority of the ionizing flux that illuminates the accretion disk.therefore, we also fit the spectra with a blurred reflection model, wherein ablackbody component illuminates the disk. this model fits well in most cases,supporting the idea that the boundary layer is illuminating a geometricallythin disk.

0910.3947	the distribution and cosmic density of relativistic iron lines in active  galactic nuclei	x-ray observations of several active galactic nuclei show prominent ironk-shell fluorescence lines that are sculpted due to special and generalrelativistic effects. these observations are important because they probe thespace-time geometry close to distant black holes. however, the intrinsicdistribution of fe line strengths in the cosmos has never been determined. thisuncertainty has contributed to the controversy surrounding the relativisticinterpretation of the emission feature. now, by making use of the latestmulti-wavelength data, we show theoretical predictions of the cosmic density ofrelativistic fe lines as a function of their equivalent width and line flux. weare able to show unequivocally that the most common relativistic iron lines inthe universe will be produced by neutral iron fluorescence in seyfert galaxiesand have equivalent widths &lt; 100 ev. thus, the handful of very intense linesthat have been discovered are just the bright end of a distribution of linestrengths. in addition to validating the current observations, the predicteddistributions can be used for planning future surveys of relativistic fe lines.finally, the predicted sky density of equivalent widths indicate that the x-raysource in agns can not, on average, lie on the axis of the black hole.

0910.4904	balancing the cosmic energy budget: the cosmic x-ray background, blazars  and the compton thick agn fraction	at energies ~&gt;2 kev, active galactic nuclei (agn) are the source of thecosmic x-ray background (cxb). for agn population synthesis models to replicatethe peak region of the cxb (~30 kev), a highly obscured and therefore nearlyinvisible class of agn, known as compton thick (ct) agn, must be assumed tocontribute nearly a third of the cxb. in order to constrain the ct fraction ofagn and the ct number density we consider several hard x-ray agn luminosityfunctions and the contribution of blazars to the cxb. following the unifiedscheme, the radio agn luminosity function is relativistically beamed to createa radio blazar luminosity function. an average blazar spectral energy densitymodel is created to transform radio luminosity to x-ray luminosity. we find theblazar contribution to the cxb to be 12% in the 0.5-2 kev band, 7.4% in the2-10 kev band, 8.9% in the 15-55 kev band, and 100% in the mev region. whenblazars are included in cxb synthesis models, ct agn are predicted to beroughly one-third of obscured agn, in contrast to the prediction of one half ifblazars are not considered. our model implies a bl lac x-ray duty cycle of~13%, consistent with the concept of intermittent jet activity in low powerradio galaxies.

0707.3142	the accretion geometry in radio-loud active galaxies	we review the latest attempts to determine the accretion geometry inradio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn). these objects, which comprise ~10-20%of the agn population, produce powerful collimated radio jets that can extendthousands of parsecs from the center of the host galaxy. recent multiwavelengthsurveys have shown that radio-loudness is more common in low-luminosity agnthan in higher luminosity seyfert galaxies or quasars. these low-luminosity agnhave small enough accretion rates that they are most likely accreting via ageometrically thick and radiatively inefficient accretion flow. in contrast,x-ray spectroscopic observations of three higher luminosity broad-line radiogalaxies (3c 120, 4c+74.26 and pg 1425+267) have found evidence for anuntruncated thin disk extending very close to the black hole. these tentativedetections indicate that, for this class of radio-loud agn, the accretiongeometry is very similar to their radio-quiet counterparts. these observationssuggest that there are three conditions to jet formation that must besatisfied: the presence of a rapidly spinning black hole, an accretion flowwith a large h/r ratio, and a favorable magnetic field geometry.

1005.0429	the integrated relativistic iron line from active galactic nuclei:  chasing the spin evolution of supermassive black holes	the spin of a supermassive black hole (smbh) is directly related to theradiative efficiency of accretion on to the hole, and therefore impacts theamount of fuel required for the black hole to reach a certain mass. thus, aknowledge of the smbh spin distribution and evolution is necessary to develop acomprehensive theory of the growth of smbhs and their impact on galaxyformation. currently, the only direct measurement of smbh spin is throughfitting the broad fe k line in agns. the evolution of spins could be determinedby fitting the broad line in the integrated spectra of agns over differentredshift intervals. the accuracy of these measurements will depend on theobserved integrated line strength. here, we present theoretical predictions ofthe integrated relativistic fe k line strength as a function of redshift andagn luminosity. the equivalent widths of the integrated lines are much lessthan 300 ev. searches for the integrated line will be easiest for unobscuredagns with 2-10 kev luminosities between 44 &lt; log l_{x} &lt;= 45. the totalintegrated line makes up less than 4% of the x-ray background, but its shape issensitive to the average smbh spin. by following these recommendations, futureinternational x-ray observatory surveys of broad fe k lines should be able todetermine the spin evolution of smbhs.

1008.2661	modelling the time dependence of the tev gamma-ray source at the  galactic centre	the physical mechanism behind the tev gamma-ray source observed at the centreof the galaxy is still unknown. one intriguing possibility is that theaccretion flow onto the central supermassive black hole is responsible foraccelerating protons to tev energies which then diffuse outward to interactwith molecular gas at distances of ~1 pc. here, we build on our earlierdetailed calculations of the proton transport to consider the time and energydependence of the tev signal following a burst of particle acceleration at sgra*. we find that, due to the strong energy dependence of the proton diffusion,any variability in the particle acceleration rate will only be visible in thetev signal after a delay of ~ 10 yrs, and only at energies &gt;~ 10 tev. if theaccelerator is long-lived it must have been running for at least 10^4 yrs andhave a hard proton injection spectrum of \alpha=0.7 (where dn/de_inj \proptoe^{-\alpha}) in order to produce the correct amount of high energy gamma-rayflux. this rapid diffusion of high energy protons also rules out thepossibility that the observed tev source is directly related to the period ofincreased activity of sgr a* that ended ~ 100 yrs ago. however, a good fit tothe observed h.e.s.s. data was found with \alpha=2.7 for the scenario of abrief (~few year long) burst of particle acceleration that occurred ~ 10 yrsago. if such bursts are common then they will keep the tev source energised andwill likely produce spectral variability at &gt;~ 10 tev on &lt;~ 5 yr timescales.this model also implies that particle acceleration may be an importantmechanism in reducing the radiative efficiency of weakly accreting black holes.

1104.1984	a correlation between the ionization state of the inner accretion disk  and the eddington ratio of active galactic nuclei	x-ray reflection features observed from the innermost regions of accretiondisks in active galactic nuclei (agns) allow important tests of accretiontheory. in recent years it has been possible to use the fe k line andreflection continuum to parametrize the ionization state of the irradiatedinner accretion disk. here, we collect 10 measurements of xi, the diskionization parameter, from 8 agns with strong evidence for reflection from theinner accretion disk and good black hole mass estimates. we find strongstatistical evidence (98.56% confidence) for a nearly linear correlationbetween xi and the agn eddington ratio. moreover, such a correlation ispredicted by a simple application of alpha-disk accretion theory, albeit with astronger dependence on the eddington ratio. the theory shows that there will beintrinsic scatter to any correlation as a result of different black hole spinsand radii of reflection. there are several possibilities to soften thepredicted dependence on the eddington ratio to allow a closer agreement withthe observed correlation, but the current data does not allow for an uniqueexplanation. the correlation can be used to estimate that mcg-6-30-15 shouldhave a highly ionized inner accretion disk, which would imply a black hole spinof ~0.8. additional measurements of xi from a larger sample of agns are neededto confirm the existence of this correlation, and will allow investigation ofthe accretion disk/corona interaction in the inner regions of accretion disks.

1105.0965	lifting the veil on obscured accretion: active galactic nuclei number  counts and survey strategies for imaging hard x-ray missions	finding and characterizing the population of active galactic nuclei (agns)that produces the x-ray background (xrb) is necessary to connect the history ofaccretion to observations of galaxy evolution at longer wavelengths. the year2012 will see the deployment of the first hard x-ray imaging telescope that,through deep extragalactic surveys, will be able to measure the agn populationat the energies where the xrb peaks (~20-30 kev). here, we present predictionsof agn number counts in three hard x-ray bandpasses: 6-10 kev, 10-30 kev and30-60 kev. separate predictions are presented for the number counts of comptonthick agns, the most heavily obscured active galaxies. the number counts arecalculated for five different models of the xrb that differ in the assumed hardx-ray luminosity function, the evolution of the compton thick agns, and theunderlying agn spectral model. the majority of the hard x-ray number countswill be compton thin agns, but there is a &gt;10x increase in the compton thicknumber counts from the 6-10 kev to the 10-30 kev band. the compton thickpopulation show enough variation that a hard x-ray number counts measurementwill constrain the models. the computed number counts are used to considervarious survey strategies for the nustar mission, assuming a total exposuretime of 6.2 ms. we find that multiple surveys will allow a measurement ofcompton thick evolution. the predictions presented here should be useful forall future imaging hard x-ray missions.

1110.0982	radio stacking reveals evidence for star formation in the host galaxies  of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei at z&lt;1	nuclear starbursts may contribute to the obscuration of active galacticnuclei (agns). the predicted star formation rates are modest, and, for theobscured agns that form the x-ray background at z &lt; 1, the associated faintradio emission lies just beyond the sensitivity limits of the deepest surveys.here, we search for this level of star formation by studying a sample of 359x-ray selected agns at z &lt; 1 from the cosmos field that are not detected bycurrent radio surveys. the agns are separated into bins based on redshift,x-ray luminosity, obscuration, and mid-infrared characteristics. an estimate ofthe agn contribution to the radio flux density is subtracted from each radioimage, and the images are then stacked to uncover any residual faint radio fluxdensity. all of the bins containing 24 micron-detected agns are detected with asignal-to-noise &gt;3sigma in the stacked radio images. in contrast, agns notdetected at 24 microns are not detected in the resulting stacked radio images.this result provides strong evidence that the stacked radio signals are likelyassociated with star formation. the estimated star formation rates derived fromthe radio stacks range from 3 solar masses per year to 29 solar masses peryear. although it is not possible to associate the radio emission with aspecific region of the host galaxies, these results are consistent with thepredictions of nuclear starburst disks in agn host galaxies.

1202.2311	ionized reflection spectra from accretion disks illuminated by x-ray  pulsars	x-ray reflection signatures are observed around multiple classes of accretingcompact objects. modelling these features yield important constraints on thephysics of accretion disks, motivating the development of x-ray reflectionmodels appropriate for a variety of systems and illumination conditions. here,constant density ionized x-ray reflection models are presented for a diskirradiated with a very hard power-law x-ray spectrum (\gamma &lt; 1) and avariable high-energy cutoff. these models are then applied to the suzaku dataof the accreting x-ray pulsar lmc x-4, where very good fits are obtained with ahighly ionized reflector responsible for both the broad fe k line and the softexcess. the ionized reflector shows strong evidence for significant dopplerbroadening and is redshifted by ~10^4 km/s. these features indicate that thereflecting material is associated with the complex dynamics occurring at theinner region of the magnetically-truncated accretion disk. thus, reflectionstudies of x-ray pulsar spectra may give important insights into the accretionphysics at the magnetospheric radius.

1301.7020	the star formation laws of eddington-limited star-forming disks	two important avenues into understanding the formation and evolution ofgalaxies are the kennicutt-schmidt (ks) and elmegreen-silk (es) laws. theserelations connect the surface densities of gas and star formation (\sigmagas\and \sigmastar, respectively) in a galaxy. to elucidate the ks and es laws fordisks where \sigmagas &gt;~ 10^4 msun pc-2}, we compute 132 eddington-limitedstar-forming disk models with radii spanning tens to hundreds of parsecs. thetheoretically expected slopes (approx. 1 for the ks law and approx. 0.5 for thees relation) are relatively robust to spatial averaging over the disks.however, the star formation laws exhibit a strong dependence on opacity thatseparates the models by the dust-to-gas ratio that may lead to the appearanceof a erroneously large slope. the total infrared luminosity (l_tir) andmultiple carbon monoxide (co) line intensities were computed for each model.while l_tir can yield an estimate of the average \sigmastar\ that is correct towithin a factor of 2, the velocity-integrated co line intensity is a poor proxyfor the average \sigmagas\ for these warm and dense disks, making the coconversion factor (\alpha_co) all but useless. thus, observationally derived ksand es laws at these values of \sigmagas\ that uses any transition of co willprovide a poor measurement of the underlying star formation relation. studiesof the star formation laws of eddington-limited disks will require a high-jtransition of a high density molecular tracer, as well as a sample of galaxieswith known metallicity estimates.

1403.4940	characterizing the evolving x-ray spectral features during a superburst  from 4u 1636-536	recent studies have shown that runaway thermonuclear burning of materialaccreted onto neutron stars, i.e. type i x-ray bursts, may affect the accretiondisk. we investigate this by performing a detailed time-resolved spectralanalysis of the superburst from 4u 1636-536 observed in 2001 with the rossix-ray timing explorer. superbursts are attributed to the thermonuclear burningof carbon, and are approximately 1000 times more energetic than the regularshort type i bursts. this allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,compared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. a feature is present in thesuperburst spectra around 6.4 kev that is well fit with an emission line and anabsorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretiondisk. the line and edge parameters evolve over time: the edge energy decreasesfrom 9.4 kev at the peak to 8.1 kev in the tail, and both features becomeweaker in the tail. this is only the second superburst for which this has beendetected, and shows that this behavior is present even without strong radiusexpansion. furthermore, we find the persistent flux to almost double during thesuperburst, and return to the pre-superburst level in the tail. the combinationof reflection features and increased persistent emission indicates that thesuperburst had a strong impact on the inner accretion disk, and it emphasizesthat x-ray bursts provide a unique probe of accretion physics.

1404.3561	the broad band spectral variability of mcg-6-30-15 observed by nustar  and xmm-newton	mcg-6-30-15, at a distance of 37 mpc (z=0.008), is the archetypical seyfert 1galaxy showing very broad fe k$\alpha$ emission. we present results from ajoint nustar and xmm-newton observational campaign that, for the first time,allows a sensitive, time-resolved spectral analysis from 0.35 kev up to 80 kev.the strong variability of the source is best explained in terms of intrinsicx-ray flux variations and in the context of the light bending model: theprimary, variable emission is reprocessed by the accretion disk, which producessecondary, less variable, reflected emission. the broad fe k$\alpha$ profileis, as usual for this source, well explained by relativistic effects occurringin the innermost regions of the accretion disk around a rapidly rotating blackhole. we also discuss the alternative model in which the broadening of the fek$\alpha$ is due to the complex nature of the circumnuclear absorbingstructure. even if this model cannot be ruled out, it is disfavored onstatistical grounds. we also detected an occultation event likely caused by blrclouds crossing the line of sight.

1404.5620	nustar and xmm-newton observations of ngc 1365: extreme absorption  variability and a constant inner accretion disk	we present a spectral analysis of four coordinated nustar+xmm-newtonobservations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. these exhibit an extreme level ofspectral variability, which is primarily due to variable line-of-sightabsorption, revealing relatively unobscured states in this source for the firsttime. despite the diverse range of absorption states, each of the observationsdisplays the same characteristic signatures of relativistic reflection from theinner accretion disk. through time-resolved spectroscopy we find that thestrength of the relativistic iron line and the compton reflection hump relativeto the intrinsic continuum are well correlated, as expected if they are twoaspects of the same broadband reflection spectrum. we apply self-consistentdisk reflection models to these time-resolved spectra in order to constrain theinner disk parameters, allowing for variable, partially covering absorption toaccount for the vastly different absorption states observed. each of the fourobservations is treated independently to test the consistency of the resultsobtained for the black hole spin and the disk inclination, which should notvary on observable timescales. we find both the spin and the inclinationdetermined from the reflection spectrum to be consistent, confirming ngc 1365hosts a rapidly rotating black hole; in all cases the dimensionless spinparameter is constrained to be a* &gt; 0.97 (at 90% statistical confidence orbetter).

1404.7486	the broad-band x-ray spectrum of ic 4329a from a joint nustar/suzaku  observation	we have obtained a deep, simultaneous observation of the bright, nearbyseyfert galaxy ic 4329a with suzaku and nustar. through a detailed spectralanalysis, we are able to robustly separate the continuum, absorption anddistant reflection components in the spectrum. the absorbing column is found tobe modest at $n_h = 6 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^2$, and does not introduce anysignificant curvature in the fe k band. we are able to place a strongconstraint on the presence of a broadened fe k{\alpha} line: $e =6.46^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ kev rest frame with ${\sigma} = 0.33^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ kevand $ew = 34^{+8}_{-7}$ ev, though we are not able to constrain any of theparameters of a relativistic reflection model. these results highlight therange in broad fe k{\alpha} line strengths observed in nearby, bright agn(roughly an order of magnitude), and imply a corresponding range in thephysical properties of the inner accretion disk in these sources. we have alsoupdated our previously reported measurement of the high-energy cutoff of thehard x-ray emission using both observatories rather than just nustar alone:$e_{cut} = 186 \pm 14$ kev. this high-energy cutoff acts as a proxy for thetemperature of the coronal electron plasma, enabling us to further separatethis parameter from the optical depth of the plasma and to update our resultsfor these parameters as well. we derive $kt = 50^{+6}_{-3}$ kev with ${\tau} =2.34^{+0.16}_{-0.11}$ using a spherical geometry, $kt = 61 \pm 1$ kev with${\tau} = 0.68 \pm 0.02$ for a slab geometry, with both having an equivalentgoodness-of-fit.

0705.1339	the luminous x-ray hotspot in 4c 74.26: synchrotron or inverse-compton  emission?	we report the discovery of an x-ray counterpart to the southern radio hotspotof the largest-known radio quasar 4c 74.26 (whose redshift is z=0.104). bothxmm-newton and chandra images reveal the same significant (10arcsec, i.e.19kpc) offset between the x-ray hotspot and the radio hotspot imaged withmerlin. the peak of the x-ray emission may be due to synchrotron orinverse-compton emission. if synchrotron emission, the hotspot represents thesite of particle acceleration and the offset arises from either the jetexhibiting scheuer's `dentist's drill' effect or a fast spine having lessmomentum than the sheath surrounding it, which creates the radio hotspot. ifthe emission arises from the inverse-compton process, it must beinverse-compton scattering of the cmb in a decelerating relativistic flow,implying that the jet is relativistic (gamma &gt;= 2) out to a distance of atleast 800kpc. our analysis, including optical data from the liverpooltelescope, rules out a background agn for the x-ray emission and confirms itsnature as a hotspot, making it the most x-ray luminous hotspot yet detected.

1407.1844	nustar unveils a compton-thick type 2 quasar in mrk 34	we present nustar 3-40 kev observations of the optically selected type 2quasar (qso2) sdss j1034+6001 or mrk 34. the high-quality hard x-ray spectrumand archival xmm-newton data can be fitted self-consistently with areflection-dominated continuum and strong fe kalpha fluorescence line withequivalent-width &gt;1 kev. prior x-ray spectral fitting below 10 kev showed thesource to be consistent with being obscured by compton-thin column densities ofgas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns frommultiwavelength data. nustar now enables a direct measurement of this column,and shows that nh lies in the compton-thick (ct) regime. the new data also showa high intrinsic 2-10 kev luminosity of l_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast toprevious low-energy x-ray measurements for which l_{2-10}&lt;~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.x-ray selection below 10 kev does not pick up this source as an intrinsicallyluminous obscured quasar). both the obscuring column and the intrinsic powerare about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-nustarx-ray spectral fitting. mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' ct qso2 and is thenearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local ctquasar ngc6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strongstar-formation. for typical x-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretionluminosity of mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infraredluminosity. x-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related tostar-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3kev, favoring photionization instead.

1408.5281	nustar reveals the comptonizing corona of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c  382	broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs) are active galactic nuclei that producepowerful, large-scale radio jets, but appear as seyfert 1 galaxies in theiroptical spectra. in the x-ray band, blrgs also appear like seyfert galaxies,but with flatter spectra and weaker reflection features. one explanation forthese properties is that the x-ray continuum is diluted by emission from thejet. here, we present two nustar observations of the blrg 3c 382 that showclear evidence that the continuum of this source is dominated by thermalcomptonization, as in seyfert 1 galaxies. the two observations were separatedby over a year and found 3c 382 in different states separated by a factor of1.7 in flux. the lower flux spectrum has a photon-index of$\gamma=1.68^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, while the photon-index of the higher fluxspectrum is $\gamma=1.78^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. thermal and anisotropiccomptonization models provide an excellent fit to both spectra and show thatthe coronal plasma cooled from $kt_e=330\pm 30$ kev in the low flux data to$231^{+50}_{-88}$ kev in the high flux observation. this cooling behavior istypical of comptonizing corona in seyfert galaxies and is distinct from thevariations observed in jet-dominated sources. in the high flux observation,simultaneous swift data are leveraged to obtain a broadband spectral energydistribution and indicates that the corona intercepts $\sim 10$% of the opticaland ultraviolet emitting accretion disk. 3c 382 exhibits very weak reflectionfeatures, with no detectable relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line, that may be bestexplained by an outflowing corona combined with an ionized inner accretiondisk.

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1410.5434	x-raying an accretion disk in realtime: the evolution of ionized  reflection during a superburst from 4u 1636-536	when a thermonuclear x-ray burst ignites on an accreting neutron star, theaccretion disk undergoes sudden strong x-ray illumination, which can drive arange of processes in the disk. observations of superbursts, with durations ofseveral hours, provide the best opportunity to study these processes and toprobe accretion physics. using detailed models of ionized reflection, weperform time resolved spectroscopy of the superburst observed from 4u 1636-536in 2001 with rxte. the spectra are consistent with a blackbody reflecting off aphotoionized accretion disk, with the ionization state dropping with time. theevolution of the reflection fraction indicates that the initial reflectionoccurs from a part of the disk at larger radius, subsequently transitioning toreflection from an inner region of the disk. even though this superburst didnot reach the eddington limit, we find that a strong local absorber developsduring the superburst. including this event, only two superbursts have beenobserved by an instrument with sufficient collecting area to allow for thisanalysis. it highlights the exciting opportunity for future x-ray observatoriesto investigate the processes in accretion disks when illuminated bysuperbursts.

1412.5978	coronal properties of the seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 determined  from hard x-ray spectroscopy with nustar	measurements of the high-energy cut-off in the coronal continuum of activegalactic nuclei have long been elusive for all but a small number of thebrightest examples. we present a direct measurement of the cut-off energy inthe nuclear continuum of the nearby seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 withunprecedented precision. the high sensitivity of nustar up to 79 kev allows usto clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum fromthat of its reflection component. using a simple phenomenological model for thehard x-ray spectrum, we constrain the cut-off energy to $116_{-5}^{+6}$ kevwith 90% confidence. testing for more complex models and nuisance parametersthat could potentially influence the measurement, we find that the cut-off isdetected robustly. we further use simple comptonized plasma models to provideindependent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons inthe corona and its optical depth. at the 90% confidence level, we find$kt_e=29\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=1.23\pm0.08$ assuming a slab (disk-like)geometry, and $kt_e=25\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=3.5\pm0.2$ assuming a sphericalgeometry. both geometries are found to fit the data equally well and their twoprincipal physical parameters are correlated in both cases. with the opticaldepth in the optically thick regime, the data are pushing the currentlyavailable theoretical models of the comptonized plasma to the limits of theirvalidity. since the spectral features and variability arising from the inneraccretion disk have been observed previously in mcg -05-23-016, the inferredhigh optical depth implies that a spherical or disk-like corona cannot behomogeneous.

1502.07353	determining the covering factor of compton-thick active galactic nuclei  with nustar	the covering factor of compton-thick obscuring material associated with thetorus in active galactic nuclei (agn) is at present best understood through thefraction of sources exhibiting compton-thick absorption along the line of sight($n_{h}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the x-ray band, which reveals theaverage covering factor. determining this compton-thick fraction is difficulthowever, due to the extreme obscuration. with its spectral coverage at hardx-rays ($&gt;$10 kev), nustar is sensitive to the agn covering factor sincecompton scattering of x-rays off optically thick material dominates at theseenergies. we present a spectral analysis of 10 agn observed with nustar wherethe obscuring medium is optically thick to compton scattering, so calledcompton-thick (ct) agn. we use the torus models of brightman &amp; nandra whichpredict the x-ray spectrum from reprocessing in a torus and include the torusopening angle as a free parameter and aim to determine the covering factor ofthe compton-thick gas in these sources individually. across the sample we findmild to heavy compton-thick columns, with $n_{h}$ measured from$10^{24}-10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a wide range of covering factors, whereindividual measurements range from 0.2-0.9. we find that the covering factor,$f_{c}$, is a strongly decreasing function of the intrinsic 2-10 kevluminosity, $l_{x}$, where $f_{c}=(-0.41\pm0.13)$log$_{10}$($l_{x}$/ergs$^{-1}$)$+18.31\pm5.33$, across more than two orders of magnitude in $l_{x}$(10$^{41.5}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). the covering factors measured here agreewell with the obscured fraction as a function of $l_{x}$ as determined bystudies of local agn with $l_{x}&gt;10^{42.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

1506.05120	nustar reveals extreme absorption in z &lt; 0.5 type 2 quasars	the intrinsic column density (nh) distribution of quasars is poorly known. atthe high obscuration end of the quasar population and for redshifts z&lt;1, thex-ray spectra can only be reliably characterized using broad-band measurementswhich extend to energies above 10 kev. using the hard x-ray observatory nustar,along with archival chandra and xmm-newton data, we study the broad-band x-rayspectra of nine optically selected (from the sdss), candidate compton-thick (nh&gt; 1.5e24 cm^-2) type 2 quasars (ctqso2s); five new nustar observations arereported herein, and four have been previously published. the candidate ctqso2slie at z&lt;0.5, have observed [oiii] luminosities in the range 8.4 &lt; log(l_[oiii]/l_solar) &lt; 9.6, and show evidence for extreme, compton-thickabsorption when indirect absorption diagnostics are considered. amongst thenine candidate ctqso2s, five are detected by nustar in the high energy (8-24kev) band: two are weakly detected at the ~ 3 sigma confidence level and threeare strongly detected with sufficient counts for spectral modeling (&gt;~ 90 netsource counts at 8-24 kev). for these nustar-detected sources direct (i.e.,x-ray spectral) constraints on the intrinsic agn properties are feasible, andwe measure column densities ~2.5-1600 times higher and intrinsic (unabsorbed)x-ray luminosities ~10-70 times higher than pre-nustar constraints from chandraand xmm-newton. assuming the nustar-detected type 2 quasars are representativeof other compton-thick candidates, we make a correction to the nh distributionfor optically selected type 2 quasars as measured by chandra and xmm-newton for39 objects. with this approach, we predict a compton-thick fraction of f_ct =36^{+14}_{-12} %, although higher fractions (up to 76%) are possible ifindirect absorption diagnostics are assumed to be reliable.

1508.06629	the imprint of carbon combustion on a superburst from the accreting  neutron star 4u 1636-536	superbursts are hours-long x-ray flares attributed to the thermonuclearrunaway burning of carbon-rich material in the envelope of accreting neutronstars. by studying the details of the x-ray light curve, properties of carboncombustion can be determined. in particular, we show that the shape of the riseof the light curve is set by the the slope of the temperature profile leftbehind by the carbon flame. we analyse rxte/pca observations of 4u 1636-536 andseparate the direct neutron star emission from evolving photoionized reflectionand persistent spectral components. this procedure results in the highestquality light curve ever produced for the superburst rise and peak, andinteresting behaviour is found in the tail. the rising light curve between 100and 1000 seconds is inconsistent with the idea that the fuel burned locally andinstantaneously everywhere, as assumed in some previous models. by fittingimproved cooling models, we measure for the first time the radial temperatureprofile of the superbursting layer. we find $d\ln t/d\ln p=1/4$. furthermore,20% of the fuel may be left unburned. this gives a new constraint on models ofcarbon burning and propagation in superbursts.

1508.06994	revealing the accretion disc corona in mrk 335 with multi-epoch x-ray  spectroscopy	active galactic nuclei host an accretion disc with an x-ray producing coronaaround a supermassive black hole. in bright sources, such as the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 335, reflection of the coronal emission off the accretion disc hasbeen observed. reflection produces spectral features such as an iron emissionline, which allow for properties of the inner accretion disc and the corona tobe constrained. we perform a multi-epoch spectral analysis of all xmm-newton,suzaku, and nustar observations of mrk 335, and we optimize our fittingprocedure to unveil correlations between the eddington ratio and the spectralparameters. we find that the disc's ionization parameter correlates stronglywith the eddington ratio: the inner disc is more strongly ionized at higherflux. the slope of the correlation is less steep than previously predicted.furthermore, the cut-off of the power-law spectrum increases in energy with theeddington ratio, whereas the reflection fraction exhibits a decrease. weinterpret this behaviour as geometrical changes of the corona as a function ofthe accretion rate. below ~10% of the eddington limit, the compact andoptically thick corona is located close to the inner disc, whereas at higheraccretion rates the corona is likely optically thin and extends verticallyfurther away from the disc surface. furthermore, we find a soft excess thatconsists of two components. in addition to a contribution from reflection inlow ionization states, a second component is present that traces the overallflux.

1509.03322	nustar observations of the compton-thick active galactic nucleus and  ultraluminous x-ray source candidate in ngc 5643	we present two nustar observations of the local seyfert 2 active galacticnucleus (agn) and an ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) candidate in ngc 5643.together with archival data from chandra, xmm-newton and swift-bat, we performa high-quality broadband spectral analysis of the agn over two decades inenergy ($\sim$0.5-100 kev). previous x-ray observations suggested that the agnis obscured by a compton-thick (ct) column of obscuring gas along ourline-of-sight. however, the lack of high-quality $\gtrsim$ 10 kev observations,together with the presence of a nearby x-ray luminous source, ngc 5643 x-1, hadleft significant uncertainties in the characterization of the nuclear spectrum.nustar now enables the agn and ngc 5643 x-1 to be separately resolved above 10kev for the first time and allows a direct measurement of the absorbing columndensity toward the nucleus. the new data show that the nucleus is indeedobscured by a ct column of $n_{\rm{h}}$ $\gtrsim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$cm$^{-2}$. the range of 2-10 kev absorption-corrected luminosity inferred fromthe best fitting models is $l_{2-10,\rm{int}} =$ (0.8-1.7) $\times$ 10$^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with that predicted from multiwavelength intrinsicluminosity indicators. we also study the nustar data for ngc 5643 x-1, and showthat it exhibits evidence for a spectral cut-off at energy, $e$ $\sim$ 10 kev,similar to that seen in other ulxs observed by nustar. along with the evidencefor significant x-ray luminosity variations in the 3-8 kev band from 2003-2014,our results further strengthen the ulx classification of ngc 5643 x-1.

0806.2863	obscuring active galactic nuclei with nuclear starburst disks	we assess the potential of nuclear starburst disks to obscure theseyfert-like agn that dominate the hard x-ray background at z~1. over 1200starburst disk models, based on the theory developed by thompson et al., arecalculated for five input parameters: the black hole mass, the radial size ofthe starburst disk, the dust-to-gas ratio, the efficiency of angular momentumtransport in the disk, and the gas fraction at the outer disk radius. we findthat a large dust-to-gas ratio, a relatively small starburst disk, asignificant gas mass fraction, and efficient angular momentum transport are allimportant to produce a starburst disk that can potentially obscure an agn. thetypical maximum star-formation rate in the disks is ~10 solar masses per year.assuming no mass-loss due to outflows, the starburst disks feed gas onto theblack hole at rates sufficient to produce hard x-ray luminosities of10^{43}-10^{44} erg s^{-1}. the starburst disks themselves should be detectableat mid-infrared and radio wavelengths; at z=0.8, the predicted fluxes are ~1mjy at 24microns and ~10-30 microjy at 1.4ghz. thus, we predict a largefraction of radio/x-ray matches in future deep radio surveys. the starburstdisks should be easily distinguished from agn in future 100microns surveys byherschel with expected fluxes of ~5 mjy. any agn-obscuring starbursts will beassociated with hot dust, independent of agn heating, resulting in observablesignatures for separating galactic and nuclear star-formation. finally, becauseof the competition between gas and star-formation, nuclear starbursts will beassociated with lower-luminosity agn. thus, this phenomenon is a naturalexplanation for the observed decrease in the fraction of obscured agn withluminosity.

astro-ph;0002047	the primordial helium abundance: towards understanding and removing the  cosmic scatter in the dy/dz relation	we present results from photoionization models of low-metallicity hiiregions. these nebulae form the basis for measuring the primordial heliumabundance. our models show that the helium ionization correction factor (icf)can be non-negligible for nebulae excited by stars with effective temperatureslarger than 40,000 k. furthermore, we find that when the effective temperaturerises to above 45,000 k, the icf can be significantly negative. this result isindependent of the choice of stellar atmosphere. however, if an hii region hasan [o iii] 5007/[o i] 6300 ratio greater than 300, then our models show that,regardless of its metallicity, it will have a negligibly small icf. a similar,but metallicity dependent, result was found using the [o iii] 5007/h$\beta$ratio. these two results can be used as selection criteria to remove nebulaewith potentially non-negligible icfs. using our metallicity independentcriterion on the data of izotov &amp; thuan (1998) results in a 20% reduction ofthe rms scatter about the best fit $y-z$ line. a fit to the selected dataresults in a slight increase of the value of the primordial helium abundance.

astro-ph;0011360	evidence for ionised accretion discs in five narrow-line seyfert 1  galaxies	(abridged) we present the results of fitting asca spectra of six narrow-lineseyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies with the ionised reflection models of ross &amp; fabian(1993). we find that five of the galaxies (tons 180, pks 0558-504, ark 564, mrk335 and pg 1244+026) are well fit by the ionised disc model, and these areoften better fits than the alternative models considered. the sixth galaxy, ngc4051, has additional spectral complexity that cannot be well described by asimple ionised disc model or any of the other alternative models. all six ofthe nls1s we considered show evidence for a broad fe kalpha line, but none ofthe line centroids are consistent with emission from highly ionised fe. this ismost likely due to the line being redshifted because of relativistic effects.we note that sources with larger ionisation parameters tend to have larger fekalpha ews. we interpret this as evidence that ionised fe features are makingtheir presence felt in the spectra. since most of our sources have steepspectra, highly ionised features are predicted even by the new variable densityreflection models. the one source we analyse with a photon index less than twohas the lowest ionisation parameter in our sample. we conclude that our resultis the strongest evidence yet that nls1 might have ionised accretion discs.this result gives further weight to the hypothesis that these objects containrapidly accreting black holes.

astro-ph;0102040	x-ray reflection by photoionized accretion discs	we present the results of reflection calculations that treat the relevantphysics with a minimum of assumptions. the temperature and ionization structureof the top five thomson depths of an illuminated disc are calculated while alsodemanding that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium. in agreement withnayakshin, kazanas &amp; kallman, we find that there is a rapid transition from hotto cold material in the illuminated layer. however, the transition is usuallynot sharp so that often we find a small but finite region in thomson depthwhere there is a stable temperature zone at t \sim 2 x 10^{6} k due tophotoelectric heating from recombining ions. as a result, the reflectionspectra often exhibit strong features from partially-ionized material,including helium-like fe k lines and edges. we find that due to the highlyionized features in the spectra these models have difficulty correctlyparameterizing the new reflection spectra. there is evidence for a spurious$r-\gamma$ correlation in the asca energy range, where $r$ is the reflectionfraction for a power-law continuum of index $\gamma$, confirming the suggestionof done &amp; nayakshin that at least part of the r-gamma correlation reported byzdziarski, lubinski &amp; smith for seyfert galaxies and x-ray binaries might bedue to ionization effects. although many of the reflection spectra show strongionized features, these are not typically observed in most seyfert and quasarx-ray spectra.

astro-ph;0104342	relativistic ionized accretion disc models of mcg--6-30-15	we present results from fitting ionized accretion disc models to three longasca observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15. all three datasets canbe fit by a model consisting of ionized reflection from the inner region of theaccretion disc (with twice solar fe abundance) and a separate disklinecomponent from farther out on the the disc. the diskline is required to fit theheight of the observed fe k line profile. however, we show that a much simplermodel of reflection from a very weakly ionized constant density disc also fitsthe data. in this case only a single cold fe k line at 6.4 kev is required tofit the observed line. the ionized disc models predict that o viii k, c vi k,fe xvii l, and fe xviii l lines will appear in the soft x-ray region of thereflection spectrum, but are greatly blurred due to compton scattering. theequivalent width (ew) of o viii k is estimated to be about 10 ev and seems tobe as strong as the blend of the fe l lines. this result creates difficulty forthe claim of a strong relativistic o viii line in the xmm-newton gratingspectrum of mcg--6-30-15, although we can not strictly rule it out sincemcg--6-30-15 was in an anomalously low state during that observation. we findthat increasing the o abundance or breaking the continuum below 2 kev will notsignificantly strengthen the line. the second fe k line component in theionized disc model may arise from neutral reflection from a flared disc, orfrom a second illumination event. the data cannot distinguish between the twocases, and we conclude that single zone ionized disc models have difficultyfitting these hard x-ray data of mcg--6-30-15.

astro-ph;0110367	xmm-newton discovery of a sharp spectral feature at ~7 kev in the  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h 0707-495	we report the first detection of a sharp spectral feature in a narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy. using xmm-newton we have observed 1h0707-495 and find a dropin flux by a factor of more than 2 at a rest-frame energy of ~7 kev without anydetectable narrow fe k alpha line emission. the energy of this feature suggestsa connection with the neutral iron k photoelectric edge, but the lack of anyobvious absorption in the spectrum at lower energies makes the interpretationchallenging. we explore two alternative explanations for this unusual spectralfeature: (i) partial covering absorption by clouds of neutral material and (ii)ionised disc reflection with lines and edges from different ionisation stagesof iron blurred together by relativistic effects. we note that both modelsrequire an iron overabundance to explain the depth of the feature. the x-raylight curve shows strong and rapid variability, changing by a factor of fourduring the observation. the source displays modest spectral variability whichis uncorrelated with flux.

astro-ph;0112179	fe k\alpha emission from photoionized slabs: the impact of the iron  abundance	iron k\alpha emission from photoionized and optically thick material isobserved in a variety of astrophysical environments including x-ray binaries,active galactic nuclei, and possibly gamma-ray bursts. this paper presentscalculations showing how the equivalent width (ew) of the fe k line depends onthe iron abundance of the illuminated gas and its ionization state -- twovariables subject to significant cosmic scatter. reflection spectra from aconstant density slab which is illuminated with a power-law spectrum withphoton-index \gamma are computed using the code of ross &amp; fabian. when the fe kew is measured from the reflection spectra alone, we find that it can reachvalues greater than 6 kev if the fe abundance is about 10 times solar and theilluminated gas is neutral. ews of about 1 kev are obtained when the gas isionized. in contrast, when the ew is measured from the incident+reflectedspectrum, the largest ews are ~800 kev and are found when the gas is ionized.when \gamma is increased, the fe k line generally weakens, but significantemission can persist to larger ionization parameters. the iron abundance hasits greatest impact on the ew when it is less than 5 times solar. when theabundance is further increased, the line strengthens only marginally.therefore, we conclude that fe k lines with ews much greater than 800 ev areunlikely to be produced by gas with a supersolar fe abundance. these resultsshould be useful in interpreting fe k emission whenever it arises fromoptically thick fluorescence.

astro-ph;0201403	on the hard x-ray spectra of radio-loud active galaxies	over the last few years x-ray observations of broad-line radio galaxies(blrgs) by asca, rxte and bepposax have shown that these objects seem toexhibit weaker x-ray reflection features (such as the iron k\alpha line) thanradio-quiet seyferts. this has lead to speculation that the optically-thickaccretion disc in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) may be truncated toan optically-thin flow in the inner regions of the source. here, we proposethat the weak reflection features are a result of reprocessing in an ionizedaccretion disc. this would alleviate the need for a change in accretiongeometry in these sources. calculations of reflection spectra from an ionizeddisc for situations expected in radio-loud agn (high accretion rate,moderate-to-high black hole mass) predict weak reprocessing features. this ideawas tested by fitting the asca spectrum of the bright blrg 3c 120 with theconstant density ionized disc models of ross &amp; fabian. a good fit was foundwith an ionization parameter of \xi ~4000 erg cm s^{-1} and the reflectionfraction fixed at unity. if observations of blrgs by xmm-newton show evidencefor ionized reflection then this would support the idea that a high accretionrate is likely required to launch powerful radio jets.

astro-ph;0201420	the response of the fe k\alpha line to changes in the x-ray illumination  of accretion discs	x-ray reflection spectra from photoionized accretion discs in active galaxiesare presented for a wide range of illumination conditions. the energy,equivalent width (ew) and flux of the fe k line are shown to depend strongly onthe ratio of illuminating flux to disc flux, fx/fdisc, the photon index of theirradiating power-law, \gamma, and the incidence angle of the radiation, i.when fx/fdisc \leq 2 a neutral fe k line is prominent for all but the largestvalues of \gamma. at higher illuminating fluxes a he-like fe k line at 6.7 kevdominates the line complex. with a high-energy cutoff of 100 kev, the thermalionization instability seems to suppress the ionized fe k line when \gamma \leq1.6. the fe k line flux correlates with fx/fdisc, but the dependence weakens asiron becomes fully ionized. the ew is roughly constant when fx/fdisc is low anda neutral line dominates, but then declines as the line progresses throughhigher ionization stages. there is a strong positive correlation between the fek ew and \gamma when the line energy is at 6.7 kev, and a slight negative onewhen it is at 6.4 kev. this is a potential observational diagnostic of theionization state of the disc. observations of the broad fe k line which takeinto account any narrow component would be able to test these predictions.ionized fe k lines at 6.7 kev are predicted to be common in a simple magneticflare geometry. a model which includes multiple ionization gradients on thedisc is postulated to reconcile the results with observations.

astro-ph;0202148	soft x-ray emission lines from photoionized accretion discs: constraints  on their strength and width	we consider the properties of soft x-ray emission lines in the reprocessedemission from a photoionized accretion disc. observations of these lines willbe important in determining the ionization state and metallicity of theinnermost regions of active galaxies. calculations of reflection from aconstant-density disc with an ionization parameter between 250 and 1000 ergcm/s show that emission from o viii ly\alpha will dominate the soft x-rayemission spectrum. there is also significant emission from c vi, n vii, o vii,as well as fe xvii--xix. as the ionization parameter is increased these linesbecome weaker and are broadened by compton scattering. significantly increasingthe o abundance primarily strengthens the o vii line, making it as large orlarger than the o viii line. the nitrogen and carbon lines are quite weak withequivalent widths (ews) &lt;30 ev, even with an increase in the n abundance. ahydrostatic ionized disc model has a more realistic density structure and showsa similar spectrum, but with the lines weaker and broader. this is a result ofthe hot ionized skin at the surface of the disc. we apply these results to thecontroversial claim of soft x-ray relativistic lines in the xmm-newton spectrumof mcg--6-30-15. we are unable to find a situation where o viii has therequired ew without substantial emission from o vii. furthermore, comptonscattering results in the blue wing of the o viii line to be much broader thanthe &lt;&lt; 10 ev drop observed in the data. we conclude that soft x-ray accretiondisc lines will, in general, be weak and broad features and are unlikely toproduce sharp edges in the data.

astro-ph;0202297	how the x-ray spectrum of a narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy may be  reflection dominated	a model for the inner regions of accretion flows is presented where, due todisc instabilities, cold and dense material is clumped into deep sheets orrings. surrounding these density enhancements is hot, tenuous gas where coronaldissipation processes occur. we expect this situation to be most relevant whenthe accretion rate is close to eddington and the disc is radiation-pressuredominated, and so may apply to narrow-line seyfert~1 (nls1) galaxies. in thisscenario, the hard x-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so thedetected x-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of thesheets. a simple comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indicescharacteristic of nls1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closelysurrounding the hard x-ray source. we test this model by fitting the xmm-newtonspectrum of the nls1 1h 0707-495 between 0.5 and 11 kev with reflectiondominated ionized disc models. a very good fit is found with three differentreflectors each subject to the same \gamma=2.35 power-law. an ironoverabundance is still required to fit the sharp drop in the spectrum at around7 kev. we note that even a small corrugation of the accretion disc may resultin \gamma &gt; 2 and a strong reflection component in the observed spectrum.therefore, this model may also explain the strength and the variabilitycharacteristics of the mcg-6-30-15 fe k line. the idea needs to be tested withfurther broadband xmm-newton observations of nls1s.

astro-ph;0302288	a two-component ionized reflection model of mcg--6-30-15	ionized reflection has often been considered as the explanation for theunusual fe k variability observed in mcg--6-30-15. in this paper, we test thismodel using a 325 ks observation of mcg--6-30-15 by xmm-newton and bepposax.the data are fit between 2.5 and 80 kev with the constant density models ofross &amp; fabian. the best fit ionized reflection model requires the fe k line tobe split into two reprocessing events: one from the inner disc to build up thered wing, and the other from the outer accretion disc to fit the blue horn. theimplied geometry is a disc which becomes strongly warped or flared at largeradii. a good fit was obtained with a solar abundance of iron and a reflectionfraction (r) of unity for the inner reflector. the combination of the tworeflection spectra can appear to have r&gt;2 as required by the bepposax data. theinner reflector has an ionization parameter \log \xi =3.8, but the outer one isneutral with an inner radius ~70 gravitational radii (r_g), corresponding to alight crossing time of about an hour for a 10^7 msun black hole. applying thismodel to time-resolved spectra shows that the inner reflector becomes moreionized as the source brightens. this reduces the strength of the red wing athigh flux states. the x-ray source is constrained to arise from a narrowannulus at ~5 r_g, with only 6 per cent of the 2-10 kev flux due to the outerreprocessor. this amount of localized energy generation is extremely difficultto produce without resorting to other energy sources such as the black holespin. in fact, all the fe k models fit to xmm-newton spectra of mcg--6-30-15require a large increase in energy production at the inner edge of theaccretion disc.

astro-ph;0304218	the contribution of particle impact to the production of fe k emission  from accreting black holes	the iron k line is perhaps the most important spectral diagnostic availablein the study of accreting black holes. the line is thought to result from thereprocessing of external x-rays by the surface of the accretion disk. however,as is observed in the solar corona, illumination by energetic particles mayalso produce line emission. in principle, such a process may be uncorrelatedwith the observed x-rays and could explain some of the unexpected variabilitybehavior of the fe line. this paper compares predictions of iron k fluxgenerated by impacting electrons and protons to that from photoionization.non-thermal power-laws of electrons are considered as well as thermaldistributions of electrons and virialized protons. the electrons are thought tooriginate in a magnetically dominated accretion disk corona, while the protonsare considered in the context of a two phase (hot/cold) accretion scenario. ineach case, the fe k flux from particle impact is found to be &lt; 1% of thatproduced by photoionization by a hard x-ray power-law (normalized to the sameenergy flux as the particles). thus, the electrons or protons must strike thedisk with 100--10,000 times more energy flux than radiation for particle impactto be a significant producer of fe k flux. this situation is difficult toreconcile with the observations of hard x-ray spectra, or the proposed particleacceleration mechanisms in the accretion disk corona. truncated accretion flowsmust be externally illuminated by hard x-rays in order to produce the fe line,as proton impact is very inefficient in generating line emission. in contrastto the sun, our conclusion is that, with the possible exception for localizedregions around magnetic footpoints, particle impact will not be an importantcontributor to the x-ray emission in accreting black holes.

astro-ph;0308028	on the location and composition of the dust in the mcg-6-30-15 warm  absorber	hubble space telescope images of mcg-6-30-15 show a dust lane crossing thegalaxy just below the nucleus. in this paper, we argue that this dust lane isresponsible for the observed reddening of the nuclear emission and the fe iedge hinted at in the chandra spectrum of mcg-6-30-15. we further suggest thatthe gas within the dust lane can comprise much of the low ionization component(i.e., the one contributing the o vii edge) of the observed warm absorber.moreover, placing the warm absorbing material at such distances (hundreds ofpc) can account for the small outflow velocities of the low ionizationabsorption lines as well as the constancy of the o viii edge. photoionizationmodels of a dusty interstellar gas cloud (with a column appropriate for thereddening toward mcg-6-30-15) using a toy seyfert 1 spectral energydistribution show that it is possible to obtain a significant o vii edge(\tau~0.2) if the material is ~150 pc from the ionizing source. formcg-6-30-15, such a distance is consistent with the observed dust lane. thecurrent data on mcg-6-30-15 is unable to constrain the dust composition withinthe warm absorber. astronomical silicate is a viable candidate, but there areindications of a very low o abundance in the dust, which is inconsistent with asilicate origin. if true, this may indicate that there were repeated cycles ofgrain destruction and growth from shocks in the interstellar medium ofmcg-6-30-15. pure iron grains are an unlikely dust constituent due to the limiton their abundance in the galaxy, yet they cannot be ruled out. the high columndensities inferred from the highly ionized zone of the warm absorber impliesthat this gas is dust-free.

astro-ph;0311390	x-ray reflection from inhomogeneous accretion disks: i. toy models and  photon bubbles	numerical simulations of the interiors of radiation dominated accretion disksshow that significant density inhomogeneities can be generated in the gas.here, we present the first results of our study on x-ray reflection spectrafrom such heterogeneous density structures. we consider two cases: first, weproduce a number of toy models where a sharp increase or decrease in density ofvariable width is placed at different depths in a uniform slab. comparing theresulting reflection spectra to those from an unaltered slab shows that theinhomogeneity can affect the emission features, in particular the fe k and oviii lyalpha lines. the magnitude of any differences depends on both theparameters of the density change and the ionizing power of the illuminatingradiation, but the inhomogeneity is required to be within ~2 thomson depths ofthe surface to cause an effect. however, only relatively small variations indensity (on the order of a few) are necessary for significant changes in thereflection features to be possible. our second test was to compute reflectionspectra from the density structure predicted by a simulation of the non-linearoutcome of the photon bubble instability. the resulting spectra also exhibiteddifferences from the constant density models, caused primarily by a strong 6.7kev iron line. nevertheless, constant density models can provide a good fit tosimulated spectra, albeit with a low reflection fraction, between 2 and 10 kev.below 2 kev, differences in the predicted soft x-ray line emission result invery poor fits with a constant density ionized disk model. the results indicatethat density inhomogeneities may further complicate the relationship betweenthe fe k equivalent width and the x-ray continuum.

astro-ph;0401154	the evolution of the accretion disk around 4u 1820-30 during a  superburst	accretion from a disk onto a collapsed, relativistic star -- a neutron staror black hole -- is the mechanism widely believed to be responsible for theemission from compact x-ray binaries. because of the extreme spatial resolutionrequired, it is not yet possible to directly observe the evolution or dynamicsof the inner parts of the accretion disk where general relativistic effects aredominant. here, we use the bright x-ray emission from a superburst on thesurface of the neutron star 4u 1820-30 as a spotlight to illuminate the disksurface. the x-rays cause iron atoms in the disk to fluoresce, allowing adetermination of the ionization state, covering factor and inner radius of thedisk over the course of the burst. the time-resolved spectral fitting showsthat the inner region of the disk is disrupted by the burst, possibly beingheated into a thicker, more tenuous flow, before recovering its previous formin ~1000 s. this marks the first instance that the evolution of the innerregions of an accretion disk has been observed in real-time.

astro-ph;0402603	reflection spectra from an accretion disc illuminated by a neutron star  x-ray burst	recent time-resolved x-ray spectra of a neutron star undergoing a superburstrevealed an fe k line and edge consistent with reprocessing from thesurrounding accretion disc. here, we present models of x-ray reflection from aconstant density slab illuminated by a blackbody, the spectrum emitted by aneutron star burst. the calculations predict a prominent fe k line and a richsoft x-ray line spectrum which is superimposed on a strong free-free continuum.the lines slowly vanish as the ionization parameter of the slab is increased,but the free-free continuum remains dominant at energiesless than 1 kev. thereflection spectrum has a quasi-blackbody shape only at energies greater than 3kev. if the incident blackbody is added to the reflection spectrum, the fe kequivalent width varies between 100 and 300 ev depending on the ionizationparameter and the temperature, kt, of the blackbody. the equivalent width iscorrelated with kt, and therefore we predict a strong fe k line when an x-rayburst is at its brightest (if iron is not too ionized or the reflectionamplitude too small). extending the study of reflection features in the spectraof superbursts to lower energies would provide further constraints on theaccretion flow. if the fe k line or other features are relativisticallybroadened then they can determine the system inclination angle (which leads tothe neutron star mass), and, if the mass is known, a lower-limit to themass/radius ratio of the star.

astro-ph;0402660	an xmm-newton observation of ark 120: the x-ray spectrum of a `bare'  seyfert 1 nucleus	we report on a long (100 ks) xmm-newton observation of the bright seyfert 1galaxy arakelian 120. the source previously showed no signs of intrinsicreddening in its infrared-ultraviolet continuum and previous observations hadshown no evidence for ionized absorption in either the ultraviolet or x-raybands. the new xmm-newton rgs data place tight limits on the presence of anionized x-ray absorber and confirm that the x-ray spectrum of ark 120 isessentially unmodified by intervening matter. thus ark 120 can be considered a`bare' seyfert 1 nucleus. this observation therefore offers a clean view of thex-ray spectrum of a `normal' seyfert galaxy free from absorption effects. thespectrum shows a doppler broadened iron emission line (fwhm ~ 3*10^4 km/s) anda smooth, continuous soft excess which appears to peak at an energy ~0.5 kev.this adds weight to the claim that genuine soft excesses (i.e. those due to areal steepening of the underlying continuum below ~2 kev) are ubiquitous inseyfert 1 spectra. however, the detailed shape of the excess could not bereproduced by any of the simple models tested (power-laws, blackbodies,comptonised blackbodies, accretion disc reflection). this observation thereforedemonstrates both the need to understand the soft excess (as a significantcontributor to the luminosity of most seyfert 1s) and the inability of theexisting, simple models to explain it.

astro-ph;0407453	the xmm-newton view of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c 120	we present the results of a 127 ks xmm-newton observation of the broad-lineradio galaxy 3c 120 performed simultaneously with rxte. the time-averagedspectrum is seyfert-like, with a reflection amplitude r ~ 0.5, and a neutral fek line with equivalent width ~53 ev. the line is slightly broadened with afwhm$\approx 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. this is consistent with arising from anaccretion disc radius of $\ga 75$ $gm/c^2$ at an inclination angle of ~10degrees, consistent with the limit of &lt; 14 degree derived from the radio jets.at low energies the spectrum requires excess absorption above the galacticvalue and a soft excess which is best fit with a bremsstrahlung model(kt=0.3-0.4 kev). the total luminosity in the bremsstrahlung component is justunder half of the total hard x-ray luminosity. weak o vii and o viii edges aredetected with high precision, suggesting the presence of a warm absorbercomponent. a two-component ionized disc model, with a very highly ionizedreflector presumably arising from very close to the black hole, is only a smallimprovement over a truncated disc model. the strength of the soft x-rayemission features produced by the distant neutral reflector are overpredictedin our solar abundance model, implying that the heavy metal abundance in 3c 120is subsolar. the total count-rate declined by 20 per cent over the course ofthe long observation, while small-scale rapid variability was present at thelevel of a few percent. a possible increase in the fe k line flux, significantat the 90 per cent level, was identified at ~80 ks in the observation. thetotal unabsorbed luminosity of 3c 120 implies that it is accreting close to itseddington rate, consistent with a model of an ionized thick disc. a connectionbetween accretion disc thickness and radio jet production is discussed.

astro-ph;0410237	x-ray reflection from inhomogeneous accretion disks: ii. emission line  variability and implications for reverberation mapping	one of the principal scientific objectives of the upcoming constellation-xmission is to attempt to map the inner regions of accretion disks around blackholes in seyfert galaxies by reverberation mapping of the fe k fluorescenceline. this area of the disk is likely radiation pressure dominated and subjectto various dynamical instabilities. here, we show that density inhomogeneitiesin the disk atmosphere resulting from the photon bubble instability (pbi) cancause rapid changes in the x-ray reflection features, even when theilluminating flux is constant. using a simulation of the development of thepbi, we find that, for the disk parameters chosen, the fe k and o viii ly\alphalines vary on timescales as short as a few hundredths of an orbital time. inresponse to the changes in accretion disk structure, the fe k equivalent width(ew) shows variations as large as ~100 ev. the magnitude and direction(positive or negative) of the changes depends on the ionization state of theatmosphere. the largest changes are found when the disk is moderately ionized.the o viii ew varies by tens of ev, as well as exhibiting plenty of rapid,low-amplitude changes. this effect provides a natural explanation for someobserved instances of short timescale fe k variability which was uncorrelatedwith the continuum (e.g., mrk 841). new predictions for fe k reverberationmapping should be made which include the effects of this accretion disk drivenline variability and a variable ionization state. reflection spectra averagedover the evolution of the instability are well fit by constant density modelsin the 2-10 kev region.

astro-ph;0502461	evidence for an untruncated accretion disk in the broad-line radio  galaxy 4c+74.26	we present evidence for a broad, ionized fe k line in the xmm-newton spectrumof the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 4c+74.26. this is the first indicationthat the innermost regions of the accretion flow in blrgs contain thin,radiatively efficient disks. analysis of the 35 ks xmm-newton observation findsa broad line with an inner radius close to the innermost stable circular orbitfor a maximally spinning black hole. the outer radius of the relativistic lineis also found to be within 10 gravitational radii. the fe k line profile givesan inclination angle of ~40 degrees, consistent with the radio limit. there aretwo narrow components to the fe k complex: one at 6.4 kev from neutral fe, andone at 6.2 kev. these may form the blue and red horns of a diskline fromfarther out on the disk, but a longer observation is required to confirm thishypothesis. we discuss the implications of this observation for models of jetproduction, and suggest that blrgs and radio-loud quasars will have larger thanaverage black hole masses, thus resulting in thicker accretion flows close tothe black hole.

astro-ph;0502463	on the dynamics of suddenly heated accretion disks around neutron stars	type i x-ray bursts and superbursts on neutron stars release sudden andintense radiation fields into their surroundings. here, we consider thepossible effects of these powerful explosions on the structure of the accretiondisk. the goal is to account for the apparent evolution of the innermostregions of the accretion disk around 4u 1820-30 during a superburst. threedifferent processes are considered in detail: radiatively or thermally drivenoutflows, inflow due to poynting-robertson drag, and a structural change to thedisk by x-ray heating. radiatively driven winds with large column densities canbe launched from the inner disk, but only for l/l_{edd} &gt;~ 1, which is expectedto be obtained only at the onset of the burst. furthermore, the predicted massoutflow rate is less than the accretion rate in 4u 1820-30. estimates of thepoynting-robertson or radiative drag timescale shows that it is a veryefficient means of removing angular momentum from the gas. however, theanalytical results are likely only applicable at the innermost edge of thedisk. x-ray heating gives a change in the disk scale height that is correlatedwith the blackbody temperature, as seen in the evolution during the 4u 1820-30superburst. if this change in the scale height can alter the surface density,then the viscous time (with \alpha ~ 0.03-0.2) is the closest match to the 4u1820-30 results. we expect, however, that all three processes are likelyongoing when an accretion disk is subject to a sudden heating event.ultimately, a numerical simulation of a disk around a bursting neutron star isrequired to determine the exact response of the disk. magnetic truncation ofthe accretion flow is also considered and applied to the 4u 1820-30 x-rayreflection results.

astro-ph;0509356	connecting galaxy evolution, star formation and the x-ray background	as a result of deep hard x-ray observations by chandra and xmm-newton asignificant fraction of the cosmic x-ray background (cxrb) has been resolvedinto individual sources. these objects are almost all active galactic nuclei(agn) and optical followup observations find that they are mostly obscured type2 agn, have seyfert-like x-ray luminosities (i.e., l_x ~ 10^{43-44} ergss^{-1}), and peak in redshift at z~0.7. since this redshift is similar to thepeak in the cosmic star-formation rate, this paper proposes that the obscuringmaterial required for agn unification is regulated by star-formation within thehost galaxy. we test this idea by computing cxrb synthesis models with a ratioof type 2/type 1 agn that is a function of both z and 2-10 kev x-rayluminosity, l_x. the evolutionary models are constrained by parameterizing theobserved type 1 agn fractions from the recent work by barger et al. theparameterization which simultaneously best accounts for barger's data, the cxrbspectrum and the x-ray number counts has a local, low-l_x type 2/type 1 ratioof 4, and predicts a type 2 agn fraction which evolves as (1+z)^{0.3}. modelswith no redshift evolution yielded much poorer fits to the barger type 1 agnfractions. this particular evolution predicts a type 2/type 1 ratio of 1-2 forlog l_x &gt; 44, and thus the deep x-ray surveys are missing about half theobscured agn with these luminosities. these objects are likely to be comptonthick. overall, these calculations show that the current data strongly supportsa change to the agn unification scenario where the obscuration is connectedwith star formation in the host galaxy rather than a molecular torus alone. theevolution of the obscuration implies a close relationship between starformation and agn fueling, most likely due to minor mergers or interactions.

astro-ph;0605747	fe emission and ionized excess absorption in the luminous quasar 3c109  with xmm-newton	we report results from an xmm-newton observation of the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c109 (z=0.3056). confirming previous results, an fe emission line isdetected, possibly comprising a broad component. however, the data cannotdistinguish between an untruncated accretion disc and a case in which theinnermost 20-30 gravitational radii are missing. in fact, a partial-coveringplus narrow fe line scenario is not ruled out statistically. however, theabsorber would have to comprise hundreds/thousands very compact clouds close tothe x-ray source, which seems rather extreme a requirement. the 2-10 kevintrinsic luminosity of 3c109 is of the order of 2-3x10^45 erg/s which,combined with a recent black hole mass estimate of ~2x10^8 m_sun, implies aneddington ratio greater than unity. if partial covering is excluded, theobserved reflection fraction (of the order of unity), steep photon index(1.86), and fe line equivalent width (about 100 ev) all suggest to exclude thatthe x-ray continuum is strongly beamed, indicating that the large eddingtonratio is associated with a radiatively efficient accretion process. we alsoconfirm previous findings on the detection of low energy absorption in excessof the galactic value. the better quality of the xmm-newton data enables us toattribute the excess absorption to slightly ionized gas in the line of sight,located at the redshift of 3c109.

astro-ph;0609002	does the agn unified model evolve with redshift? utilizing the x-ray  background to predict the mid-infrared emission of agn	deep x-ray surveys by chandra and xmm-newton have resolved about 80% of the2-10 kev cosmic extragalactic x-ray background (cxrb) into point sources, themajority of which are obscured agn. the obscuration might be connected toprocesses within the host galaxy, possibly the star-formation rate. here, weuse the results of cxrb synthesis calculations as input to detailed cloudysimulations in order to predict the evolution of agn properties at severalmid-ir wavelengths. computations were performed for three different evolutionsof the agn type 2/type 1 ratio between z=0 and 1: where the ratio increased as(1+z)^{0.9}, as (1+z)^{0.3} and one with no redshift evolution. models werecalculated with the inner radius of the absorbing gas and dust at 1 pc or at 10pc. comparing the results of the calculations to combined x-ray and spitzerdata of agn shows that the predicted spectral energy distributions are a gooddescription of average agns found in the deep surveys. the existing dataindicates that the mid-ir emission from an average agn is best described bymodels where the attenuating material is ~10 pc from the central engine. wepresent the expected spitzer cumulative number count distributions and theevolution of the total agn (type 1 + type 2) luminosity function (lf) betweenz=0 and 1 at rest-frame 8 microns and 30 microns for the three evolutionaryscenarios. the mid-ir agn lf will be an excellent tool to measure the evolutionof the covering factor of the gas and dust from z~0 to 1.

astro-ph;0701709	a possible link between the galactic center hess source and sgr a*	recently, hess and other air cerenkov telescopes have detected a source oftev gamma-rays coincident with the galactic center. it is not yet clear whetherthe gamma-rays are produced via leptonic or hadronic processes, so it isimportant to consider possible acceleration sites for the charged particleswhich produce the gamma-rays. one exciting possibility for the origin of theseparticles is the central black hole, sgr a*, where the turbulent magneticfields close to the event horizon can accelerate protons to tev energies. usinga realistic model of the density distribution in a 6 pc x 6 pc x 6pc cube atthe galactic center, we here calculate the trajectories followed by these tevprotons as they gyrate through the turbulent medium surrounding sgr a*.diffusing out from the black hole, the protons produce tev gamma-rays via pi^0decay following a collision with a proton in the surrounding medium. afterfollowing over 222,000 such trajectories, we find that the circumnuclear ringaround sgr a* can reproduce the observed 0.1-100 tev hess spectrum and flux ifthe protons are injected into this medium with an effective power-law index of0.75, significantly harder than the observed photon index of 2.25. the totalenergy in the steady-state 1-40 tev proton population surrounding sgr a* isinferred to be approx 5x10^{45} ergs. only 31% of the emitted 1-100 tev protonsencounter the circumnuclear torus, leaving a large flux of protons that diffuseoutward to contribute to the galactic ridge emission observed by hess on scalesof &gt;~ 1 degree.

astro-ph;0701775	on the contribution of agn to the cosmic background radiation	we present the results of calculations of the cosmic agn background spectrumfrom 3 kev (4\times 10^{-4} microns) to 1000 microns. these computations makeuse of the measured x-ray luminosity function and its evolution, as well asfits from synthesis models of the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) to predict theagn contribution to the cosmic infrared background (cirb) for different modelsof the location and distribution of the absorbing material. by comparing ourresults to observational constraints we conclude that the current deep spitzersurveys can account for the entire agn contribution to the cirb at 24 microns,but these agn are almost all compton-thin. in fact, the calculations show thatcompton-thick agn are a small fraction of the cirb for \lambda &lt; 100 microns.for this reason, the most efficient method of identifying the compton-thick agnpopulation is through hard x-ray imaging at energies &gt;~ 40 kev. selection ofagn based on their rest-frame near-ir colors will miss low luminosity type 2agn due to contamination from the host galaxy. finally, the agn that dominatethe cxb must have star formation rates &lt; 100 m_{sun} yr^{-1}, consistent withthem having similar properties as the sources which dominate the cirb at z ~1.including the estimated re-radiated emission from star formation, agn and theirhost galaxies may contribute ~30% of the cirb at 70 microns, dropping to ~10%at 24 microns and ~1% at 1-10 microns.
