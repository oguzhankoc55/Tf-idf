0906.0712	iac-pop: finding the star formation history of resolved galaxies	iac-pop is a code designed to solve the star formation history (sfh) of acomplex stellar population system, like a galaxy, from the analysis of thecolor-magnitude diagram (cmd). it uses a genetic algorithm to minimize a chi2merit function comparing the star distributions in the observed cmd and the cmdof a synthetic stellar population. a parametrization of the cmds is used, whichis the main input of the code. in fact, the code can be applied to any problemin which a similar parametrization of an experimental set of data and modelscan be made. the method internal consistency and robustness against severalerror sources, including observational effects, data sampling and stellarevolution library differences, are tested. it is found that the best stabilityof the solution and the best way to estimate errors is obtained by several runsof iac-pop with varying the input data parametrization. the routine minniac isused to control this process. iac-pop is offered for free use and can bedownloaded from the site http://iac-star.iac.es/iac-pop. the routine minniac isalso offered under request, but support can not be provided for its use. theonly requirement for the use of iac-pop and minniac is referencing this paperand crediting as indicated in the site.

0909.1256	on the extended structure of the phoenix dwarf galaxy	we present the star formation history (sfh) and its variations withgalactocentric distance for the local group dwarf galaxy of phoenix.color-magnitude diagram was obtained from wfpc2@hst reaching the oldest mainsequence turnoffs. the iac-star and iac-pop codes and the minniac suite havebeen used to obtain the star formation rate as a function of time, metallicity,and radius. we find that phoenix has had ongoing but gradually decreasing starformation over nearly a hubble time. the highest level of star formationoccurred from the formation of the galaxy till 10.5 gyr ago, when 50% of thetotal star formation had already taken place. from that moment, star formationcontinues at a significant level until 6 gyr ago, and at a very low level tillthe present time. the chemical enrichment law shows a trend of slowlyincreasing metallicity as a function of time till 8--6 gyr ago, when z startsto increase steeply to the current value.  young stars are found in the inner region of the galaxy only, butintermediate-age and old stars can be found at all galactocentric distances.this study shows that star formation started at all galactocentric distances inphoenix at an early epoch. our results are compatible with a scenario in whichthe star formation region envelope slowly shrinks as time goes on, possibly asa natural result of pressure support reduction as gas supply diminishes. as aconsequence, star formation stopped first in outer regions and the scale-lengthof the stellar mass density distribution decreased with time. no traces of atrue, old halo are apparent in phoenix either in its stellar age distributionor in the stellar mass density distribution, at least out to 0.5 kpc (about 2.5scale-lengths) from the center.

0704.1668	a new search for planet transits in ngc 6791	context. searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study theeffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.  aims. considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster ngc 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique.  methods. a ten-night observational campaign was performed using thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (3.6m), the san pedro m\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the loiano telescope (1.5m). to increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  results. should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in ngc 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by bruntt et al. (2003). theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  conclusions. possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. more extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in ngc 6791.

1002.4300	the acs lcid project. iii. the star formation history of the cetus dsph  galaxy: a post-reionization fossil	we use deep hst/acs observations to calculate the star formation history(sfh) of the cetus dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. our photometry reaches belowthe oldest main sequence turn-offs, which allows us to estimate the age andduration of the main episode of star formation in cetus. this is wellapproximated by a single episode that peaked roughly 12+/-0.5 gyr ago andlasted no longer than about 1.9+/-0.5 gyr (fwhm). our solution also suggeststhat essentially no stars formed in cetus during the past 8 gyrs. this makescetus' sfh comparable to that of the oldest milky way dsphs. given the currentisolation of cetus in the outer fringes of the local group, this implies thatcetus is a clear outlier in the morphology-galactocentric distance relationthat holds for the majority of milky way dwarf satellites. our results alsoshow that cetus continued forming stars through z ~ 1, long after the universewas reionized, and that there is no clear signature of the epoch ofreionization in cetus' sfh. we discuss briefly the implications of theseresults for dwarf galaxy evolution models. finally, we present a comprehensiveaccount of the data reduction and analysis strategy adopted for all galaxiestargeted by the lcid (local cosmology from isolated dwarfs) project. we employtwo different photometry codes (daophot/allframe and dolphot), three differentsfh reconstruction codes (iac-pop/minniac, match, cole), and two stellarevolution libraries (basti and padova/girardi), allowing for a detailedassessment of the modeling and observational uncertainties.

1006.2472	the acs lcid project iv: detection of the rgb bump in isolated galaxies  of the local group	we report the detection and analysis of the red giant branch luminosityfunction bump in a sample of isolated dwarf galaxies in the local group. wehave designed a new analysis approach comparing the observed color-magnitudediagrams with theoretical best-fit color-magnitude diagrams derived fromprecise estimates of the star formation histories of each galaxy. this analysisis based on studying the difference between the v-magnitude of the rgb bump andthe horizontal branch at the level of the rr lyrae instability strip(delta_vhbb) and we discuss here a technique for reliably measuring thisquantity in complex stellar systems. by using this approach, we find that thedifference between the observed and predicted values of delta_vhbb is +0.13 +/-0.14 mag. this is smaller, by about a factor of two, than the well-knowndiscrepancy between theory and observation at low metallicity commonly derivedfor galactic globular clusters. this result is confirmed by a comparisonbetween the adopted theoretical framework and empirical estimates of thedelta_vhbb parameter for both a large database of galactic globular clustersand for four other dsph galaxies for which this estimate is available in theliterature. we also investigate the strength of the red giant branch bumpfeature (r_bump), and find very good agreement between the observed andtheoretically predicted r_bump values. this agreement supports the reliabilityof the evolutionary lifetimes predicted by theoretical models of the evolutionof low-mass stars.

1106.3418	metallicities, age--metallicity relationships, and kinematics of red  giant branch stars in the outer disk of the large magellanic cloud	the outer disk of the lmc is studied in order to unveil clues about itsformation and evolution. complementing our previous studies in innermost fields(3&lt;r&lt;7 kpc), we obtained deep color magnitude diagrams in 6 fields with radiusfrom 5.2 to 9.2 kpc. the comparison with isochrones shows that while the oldestpopulation is approximately coeval in all fields, the age of the youngestpopulations increases with increasing radius. low-resolution spectroscopy inthe infrared caii triplet region has been obtained for about 150 stars near thetip red giant branch in the same fields. radial velocities and stellarmetallicities have been obtained from these spectra. the metallicitydistribution of each field has been analyzed together with those previouslystudied. the metal content of the most metal-poor objects, which are also theoldest according to the derived age-metallicity relationships, is similar inall fields independently of the radius. however, while the metallicity of themost metal-rich objects measured, which are the youngest ones, remains constantin the inner 6 kpc, it decreases with increasing radius from there off. thesame is true for the mean metallicity. according to the derived age-metallicityrelationships, which are consistent with being the same in all fields, thisresult may be interpreted as an outside-in formation scheme in opposition withthe inside-out scenario predicted by lcdm cosmology for a galaxy like the lmc.the analysis of the radial velocities of our sample of giants shows that theyfollow a rotational cold disk kinematics. the velocity dispersion increases asmetallicity decreases indicating that the most metal-poor/oldest objects aredistributed in a thicker disk than the most metal-rich/youngest ones inagreement with the findings in other disks such as that of the milky way. theydo not seem to be part of a hot halo, if one exists in the lmc.

1108.2391	luminosity and mass functions of the three main sequences of the  globular cluster ngc 2808	high-precision hst photometry has recently revealed that the globular cluster(gc) ngc 2808 hosts a triple main sequence (ms) corresponding to three stellarpopulations with different helium abundances. we carried out photometry onacs/wfc hst images of ngc 2808 with the main purpose of measuring theluminosity function (lf) of stars in the three different mss, and the binaryfraction in the cluster. we used isochrones to transform the observed lfs intomass functions (mfs). we estimated that the fraction of binary systems in ngc2808 is f_bin ~0.05, and find that the three mss have very similar lfs. theslopes of the corresponding mfs are alpha=-1.2+/-0.3 for the red ms, alpha=-0.9+/-0.3 for the middle ms, and alpha = -0.9+/-0.4 for the blue one, thesame, to within the errors. there is marginal evidence of a mf flattening formasses m&lt;~0.6 m_sun for the the reddest (primordial) ms. these resultsrepresent the first direct measurement of the present day mf and lf in distinctstellar populations of a gc, and provide constraints on models of the formationand evolution of multiple generations of stars in these objects.

1109.0900	multiple stellar populations in 47 tucanae	we use hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based imaging to study themultiple populations of 47 tuc, combining high-precision photometry withcalculations of synthetic spectra. using filters covering a wide range ofwavelengths, our hst photometry splits the main sequence (ms) into twobranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant andred-giant regions (sgb, rgb), and on the horizontal branch (hb). we calculatetheoretical stellar atmospheres for ms stars, assuming different chemicalcomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the hstfilters with our observed colors. we find that we can match the complex ofobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance andanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but withdepleted c and o. we confirm that models of rgb and red hb stars with that pairof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. we suggest that thedifferent strengths of molecular bands of oh, cn, ch and nh, falling indifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the twopopulations. near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitudediagram (cmd) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of thestars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirtsof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. thus thesecond, he/n-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes themajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. we present evidencethat the cmd of 47 tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the twopopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the msup to the rgb, and thence to the hb. a third population is visible only in thesgb, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

1109.6875	the acs lcid project vii: the blue stragglers population in the isolated  dsph galaxies cetus and tucana	we present the first investigation of the blue straggler star (bss)population in two isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the local group, cetusand tucana. deep hst/acs photometry allowed us to identify samples of 940 and1214 candidates, respectively. the analysis of the star formation histories ofthe two galaxies suggests that both host a population of bsss. specifically, ifthe bss candidates are interpreted as young main sequence stars, they do notconform to their galaxy's age-metallicity relationship. the analysis of theluminosity function and the radial distributions support this conclusion, andsuggest a non-collisional mechanism for the bss formation, from the evolutionof primordial binaries. this scenario is also supported by the results of newdynamical simulations presented here. both galaxies coincide with therelationship between the bss frequency and the absolute visual magnitude mvfound by momany et al (2007). if this relationship is confirmed by largersample, then it could be a valuable tool to discriminate between the presenceof bsss and galaxies hosting truly young populations.

1111.0552	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. xii. photometric binaries  along the main-sequence	the fraction of binary stars is an important ingredient to interpret globularcluster dynamical evolution and their stellar population. we investigate theproperties of main-sequence binaries measured in a uniform photometric sampleof 59 galactic globular clusters that were observed by hst wfc/acs as a part ofthe globular cluster treasury project. we measured the fraction of binaries andthe distribution of mass-ratio as a function of radial location within thecluster, from the central core to beyond the half-mass radius. we studied theradial distribution of binary stars, and the distribution of stellar massratios. we investigated monovariate relations between the fraction of binariesand the main parameters of their host clusters. we found that in nearly all theclusters, the total fraction of binaries is significantly smaller than thefraction of binaries in the field, with a few exceptions only. binary stars aresignificantly more centrally concentrated than single ms stars in most of theclusters studied in this paper. the distribution of the mass ratio is generallyflat (for mass-ratio parameter q&gt;0.5). we found a significant anti-correlationbetween the binary fraction in a cluster and its absolute luminosity (mass).some, less significant correlation with the collisional parameter, the centralstellar density, and the central velocity dispersion are present. there is nostatistically significant relation between the binary fraction and othercluster parameters. we confirm the correlation between the binary fraction andthe fraction of blue stragglers in the cluster.

1201.2821	variable stars in the cetus dsph galaxy: population gradients and  connections with the star formation history	we investigate the variable star content of the isolated, local group, dwarfspheroidal galaxy (dsph) cetus. multi-epoch, wide-field images collected withthe vlt/vimos camera allowed us to detect 638 variable stars (630 rr lyraestars and 8 anomalous cepheids), 475 of which are new detections. we present afull catalogue of periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes. motivated by therecent discovery that the pulsational properties of the rr lyrae stars in thetucana dsph revealed the presence of a metallicity gradient within the oldest(&gt;10 gyr old) stellar populations, we investigated the possibility of ananalogous effect in cetus. we found that, despite the obvious radial gradientin the horizontal branch (hb) and red giant branch (rgb) morphologies, bothbecoming bluer on average for increasing distance from the center of cetus, theproperties of the rr lyrae stars are homogeneous within the investigated area(out to r~15'), with no significant evidence of a radial gradient. we discussthis in connection with the star formation history (sfh) previously derived forthe two galaxies. the observed differences between these two systems show thateven systems this small show a variety of early evolutionary histories. thesedifferences could be due to different merger or accretion histories.

1202.2825	the double sub-giant branch of ngc 6656 (m22): a chemical  characterization	we present an abundance analysis of 101 subgiant branch (sgb) stars in theglobular cluster m22. using low resolution flames/giraffe spectra we havedetermined abundances of the neutron-capture strontium and barium and the lightelement carbon. with these data we explore relationships between the observedsgb photometric split in this cluster and two stellar groups characterized bydifferent contents of iron, slow neutron-capture process (s-process) elements,and the alpha element calcium, that we previously discovered in m22's red-giantstars. we show that the sgb stars correlate in chemical composition andcolor-magnitude diagram position: the stars with higher metallicity andrelative s-process abundances define a fainter sgb, while stars with lowermetallicity and s-process content reside on a relatively brighter sgb. thisresult has implications for the relative ages of the two stellar groups of m22.in particular, it is inconsistent with a large spread in ages of the two sgbs.by accounting for the chemical content of the two stellar groups, isochronefitting of the double sgb suggests that their ages are not different by morethan 300 myr.

1206.5529	the infrared eye of the wide-field camera 3 on the hubble space  telescope reveals multiple main sequences of very low-mass stars in ngc 2808	we use images taken with the infrared channel of the wide field camera 3 onthe hubble space telescope (hst) to study the multiple main sequences (mss) ofngc 2808. below the turn off, the red, the middle, and the blue ms, previouslydetected from visual-band photometry, are visible over an interval of about 3.5f160w magnitudes. the three mss merge together at the level of the ms bend. atfainter magnitudes, the ms again splits into two components containing ~65% and~35% of stars, with the most-populated ms being the bluest one. theoreticalisochrones suggest that the latter is connected to the red ms discovered in theoptical color-magnitude diagram (cmd), and hence corresponds to the firststellar generation, having primordial helium and enhanced carbon and oxygenabundances. the less-populated ms in the faint part of the near-ir cmd ishelium-rich and poor in carbon and oxygen, and it can be associated with themiddle and the blue ms of the optical cmd. the finding that the photometricsignature of abundance anticorrelation are also present in fully convective msstars reinforces the inference that they have a primordial origin.

1208.1873	hubble space telescope reveals multiple sub-giant branch in eight  globular clusters	in the last few years many globular clusters (gcs) have revealed complexcolor-magnitude diagrams, with the presence of multiple main sequences (mss),broaden or multiple sub-giant branches (sgbs) and ms turn offs, and broad orsplit red giant branches (rgbs). after a careful correction for differentialreddening, high accuracy photometry with the hubble space telescope presentedin this paper reveals a broadened or even split sgb in five additional milkyway gcs: ngc 362, ngc 5286, ngc 6656, ngc 6715, and ngc 7089. in addition, weconfirm (with new and archival hst data) the presence of a split sgb in 47tuc,ngc 1851, and ngc 6388. the fraction of faint sgb stars with respect to theentire sgb population varies from one cluster to another and ranges from$\sim$0.03 for ngc 362 to ~0.50 for ngc 6715. the average magnitude differencebetween the bright sgb and the faint sgb is almost the same at differentwavelengths. this peculiarity is consistent with the presence of two groups ofstars with either an age difference of about 1-2 gyrs, or a significantdifference in their overall c+n+o content.

1303.5187	the sumo project i. a survey of multiple populations in globular  clusters	we present a general overview and the first results of the sumo project (asurvey of multiple populations in globular clusters). the objective of thissurvey is the study of multiple stellar populations in the largest sample ofglobular clusters homogeneously analysed to date. to this aim we obtained highsignal-to-noise (s/n&gt;50) photometry for main sequence stars with mass down to~0.5 m_sun in a large sample of clusters using both archival and proprietary u,b, v, and i data from ground-based telescopes. in this paper, we focus on theoccurrence of multiple stellar populations in twenty three clusters. we havedefined a new photometric index cubi= (u-b)-(b-i), that turns out to be veryeffective for identifying multiple sequences along the red giant branch (rgb).we found that in the v-cubi diagram all clusters presented in this paper showbroadened or multimodal rgbs, with the presence of two or more components. wefound a direct connection with the chemical properties of different sequences,that display different abundances of light elements (o, na, c, n, and al). thecubi index is also a powerful tool to identify distinct sequences of starsalong the horizontal branch and, for the first time in the case of ngc104 (47tuc), along the asymptotic giant branch. our results demonstrate that i) thepresence of more than two stellar populations is a common feature amongglobular clusters, as already highlighted in previous work; ii) multiplesequences with different chemical contents can be easily identified by usingstandard johnson photometry obtained with ground-based facilities; iii) in thestudy of gc multiple stellar populations the cubi index is alternative tospectroscopy, and has the advantage of larger statistics.

1312.2272	on the kinematic separation of field and cluster stars across the bulge  globular ngc 6528	we present deep and precise multi-band photometry of the galactic bulgeglobular cluster ngc6528. the current dataset includes optical andnear-infrared images collected with acs/wfc, wfc3/uvis, and wfc3/ir on boardthe hubble space telescope. the images cover a time interval of almost tenyears and we have been able to carry out a proper-motion separation betweencluster and field stars. we performed a detailed comparison in the m_f814w,m_f606w - m_f814w color-magnitude diagram with two empirical calibratorsobserved in the same bands. we found that ngc6528 is coeval with and moremetal-rich than 47tuc. moreover, it appears older and more metal-poor than thesuper-metal-rich open cluster ngc6791. the current evidence is supported byseveral diagnostics (red horizontal branch, red giant branch bump, shape of thesub-giant branch, slope of the main sequence) that are minimally affected byuncertainties in reddening and distance. we fit the optical observations withtheoretical isochrones based on a scaled-solar chemical mixture and found anage of 11 +- 1 gyr and an iron abundance slightly above solar ([fe/h = +0.20).the iron abundance and the old cluster age further support the recentspectroscopic findings suggesting a rapid chemical enrichment of the galacticbulge.

1312.2584	spatially resolved lmc star formation history: i. outside in evolution  of the outer lmc disk	we study the evolution of three fields in the outer lmc disk rgc=3.5-6.2 kpc.their star formation history indicates a stellar populations gradient such thatyounger stellar populations are more centrally concentrated. we identify twomain star forming epochs, separated by a period of lower activity between ~7and ~4 gyr ago. their relative importance varies from a similar amount of starsformed in the two epochs in the innermost field, to only 40% of the starsformed in the more recent epoch in the outermost field. the young star formingepoch continues to the present time in the innermost field, but lasted onlytill ~0.8 and 1.3 gyr ago at rgc=5.5 degrees and 7.1 degrees, respectively.this gradient is correlated with the measured hi column density and implies anoutside-in quenching of the star formation, possibly related to a variation ofthe size of the hi disk. this could either result from gas depletion due tostar formation or ram-pressure stripping, or from to the compression of the gasdisk as ram-pressure from the milky way halo acted on the lmc interstellarmedium. the latter two situations may have occurred when the lmc firstapproached the milky way.

1312.4169	global and non-global parameters of horizontal branch morphology of  globular clusters	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gcs) is mainlydetermined by metallicity. however, the fact that gcs with almost the samemetallicity exhibit different hb morphologies demonstrates that at least onemore parameter is needed to explain the hb morphology. it has been suggestedthat one of these should be a global parameter that varies from gc to gc, andthe other a non-global parameter that varies within the gc. in this study weprovide empirical evidence corroborating this idea. we used the photometriccatalogs obtained with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) of the hubblespace telescope (hst) and analyse the cmds of 74 gcs. the hb morphology of oursample of gcs has been investigated on the basis of the two new parameters l1and l2 that measure the distance between the rgb and the coolest part of thehb, and the color extension of the hb, respectively. we find that l1 correlateswith both metallicity and age, whereas l2 most strongly correlates with themass of the hosting gc. the range of helium abundance among the stars in a gc,characterised by delta y and associated with the presence of multiple stellarpopulations, has been estimated in a few gcs to date. in these gcs we find aclose relationship among delta y, gc mass, and l2. we conclude that age andmetallicity are the main global parameters while the range of helium abundancewithin a gc is the main non-global parameter defining the hb morphology ofgalactic gcs.

1411.5043	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. ii. the seven stellar populations of ngc7089 (m2)	we present high-precision multi-band photometry for the globular cluster (gc)m2. we combine the analysis of the photometric data obtained from the hubblespace telescope uv legacy survey of galactic gcs go-13297, with chemicalabundances by yong et al.(2014), and compare the photometry with models inorder to analyze the multiple stellar sequences we identified in thecolor-magnitude diagram (cmd). we find three main stellar components, composedof metal-poor, metal-intermediate, and metal-rich stars (hereafter referred toas population a, b, and c, respectively). the components a and b include starswith different $s$-process element abundances. they host six sub-populationswith different light-element abundances, and exhibit an internal variation inhelium up to delta y~0.07 dex. in contrast with m22, another clustercharacterized by the presence of populations with different metallicities, m2contains a third stellar component, c, which shows neither evidence forsub-populations nor an internal spread in light-elements. population c does notexhibit the typical photometric signatures that are associated with abundancevariations of light elements produced by hydrogen burning at hot temperatures.we compare m2 with other gcs with intrinsic heavy-element variations andconclude that m2 resembles m22, but it includes an additional stellar componentthat makes it more similar to the central region of the sagittarius galaxy,which hosts a gc (m54) and the nucleus of the sagittarius galaxy itself.

1502.07438	iron and s-elements abundance variations in ngc5286: comparison with  anomalous globular clusters and milky way satellites	we present a high resolution spectroscopic analysis of 62 red giants in themilky way globular cluster ngc5286. we have determined abundances ofrepresentative light proton-capture, alpha, fe-peak and neutron-capture elementgroups, and combined them with photometry of multiple sequences observed alongthe colour-magnitude diagram. our principal results are: (i) a broad, bimodaldistribution in s-process element abundance ratios, with two main groups, thes-poor and s-rich groups; (ii) substantial star-to-star fe variations, with thes-rich stars having higher fe, e.g. &lt;[fe/h]&gt;_s-rich - &lt;[fe/h]&gt;_s-poor ~0.2~dex; and (iii) the presence of o-na-al (anti-)correlations in both stellargroups. we have defined a new photometric index, c_{bvi}=(b-v)-(v-i), tomaximise the separation in the colour-magnitude diagram between the two stellargroups with different fe and s-element content, and this index is notsignificantly affected by variations in light elements (such as the o-naanticorrelation). the variations in the overall metallicity present in ngc5286add this object to the class of "anomalous" gcs. furthermore, the chemicalabundance pattern of ngc5286 resembles that observed in some of the anomalousgcs, e.g. m22, ngc1851, m2, and the more extreme omega centauri, that also showinternal variations in s-elements, and in light elements within stars withdifferent fe and s-elements content. in view of the common variations ins-elements, we propose the term s-fe-anomalous gcs to describe this sub-classof objects. the similarities in chemical abundance ratios between these objectsstrongly suggest similar formation and evolution histories, possibly associatedwith an origin in tidally disrupted dwarf satellites.

1504.03252	multiple stellar populations in magellanic cloud clusters. iii. the  first evidence of an extended main sequence turn-off in a young cluster:  ngc1856	recent studies have shown that the extended main-sequence turn off (emsto) isa common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the magellanic clouds(mcs). the most simple explanation is that these stellar systems harbormultiple generations of stars with an age difference of a few hundred myrs.  however, while an emsto has been detected in a large number of clusters withages between ~1-2 gyrs, several studies of young clusters in both mcs and innearby galaxies do not find any evidence for a prolonged star-formationhistory, i.e. for multiple stellar generations. these results have suggestedalternative interpretation of the emstos observed in intermediate-age starclusters. the emsto could be due to stellar rotation mimicking an age spread orto interacting binaries. in these scenarios, intermediate-age mc clusters wouldbe simple stellar populations, in close analogy with younger clusters.  here we provide the first evidence for an emsto in a young stellar cluster.we exploit multi-band hubble space telescope photometry to study the ~300-myrold star cluster ngc1856 in the large magellanic cloud and detected a broadenedmsto that is consistent with a prolonged star-formation which had a duration ofabout 150 myrs. below the turn-off, the ms of ngc1856 is split into a red andblue component, hosting 33+/-5% and 67+/-5% of the total number of ms stars,respectively. we discuss these findings in the context ofmultiple-stellar-generation, stellar-rotation, and interacting-binaryhypotheses.

1507.08350	the acs lcid project: on the origin of dwarf galaxy types: a  manifestation of the halo assembly bias?	we discuss how knowledge of the whole evolutionary history of dwarf galaxies,including details on the early star formation events, can provide insight onthe origin of the different dwarf galaxy types. we suggest that these types maybe imprinted by the early conditions of formation rather than being only theresult of a recent morphological transformation driven by environmentaleffects. we present precise star formation histories of a sample of local groupdwarf galaxies, derived from colour-magnitude diagrams reaching the oldestmain-sequence turnoffs. we argue that these galaxies can be assigned to twobasic types: fast dwarfs that started their evolution with a dominant and shortstar formation event, and slow dwarfs that formed a small fraction of theirstars early and have continued forming stars until the present time (oralmost). these two different evolutionary paths do not map directly onto thepresent-day morphology (dwarf spheroidal vs dwarf irregular). slow and fastdwarfs also differ in their inferred past location relative to the milky wayand/or m31, which hints that slow dwarfs were generally assembled in lowerdensity environments than fast dwarfs. we propose that the distinction betweena fast and slow dwarf galaxy reflects primarily the characteristic density ofthe environment where they form. at a later stage, interaction with a largehost galaxy may play a role in the final gas removal and ultimate terminationof star formation.

1509.02414	recovering star formation histories: integrated-light analyses vs  stellar colour-magnitude diagrams	accurate star formation histories (sfhs) of galaxies are fundamental forunderstanding the build-up of their stellar content. however, the most accuratesfhs - those obtained from colour-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of resolved starsreaching the oldest main sequence turnoffs (omsto) - are presently limited to afew systems in the local group. it is therefore crucial to determine thereliability and range of applicability of sfhs derived from integrated lightspectroscopy, as this affects our understanding of unresolved galaxies from lowto high redshift.  to evaluate the reliability of current full spectral fitting techniques inderiving sfhs from integrated light spectroscopy by comparing sfhs fromintegrated spectra to those obtained from deep cmds of resolved stars.  we have obtained a high signal--to--noise (s/n $\sim$ 36.3 per \aa)integrated spectrum of a field in the bar of the large magellanic cloud (lmc)using efosc2 at the 3.6 meter telescope at la silla observatory. for this samefield, resolved stellar data reaching the omsto are available. we have comparedthe star formation rate (sfr) as a function of time and the age-metallicityrelation (amr) obtained from the integrated spectrum using {\tt steckmap}, andthe cmd using the iac-star/minniac/iac-pop set of routines. for the sake ofcompleteness we also use and discuss other synthesis codes ({\tt starlight} and{\tt ulyss}) to derive the sfr and amr from the integrated lmc spectrum.  we find very good agreement (average differences $\sim$ 4.1 $\%$) between thesfr(t) and the amr obtained using {\tt steckmap} on the integrated lightspectrum, and the cmd analysis. {\tt steckmap} minimizes the impact of theage-metallicity degeneracy and has the advantage of preferring smooth solutionsto recover complex sfhs by means of a penalized $\chi^2$.

astro-ph;0001468	the spatial and age distribution of stellar populations in ddo 190	the spatial distribution of stellar populations, the star formation history,and other properties of the dirr galaxy ddo 190 have been analyzed usingcolor--magnitude diagrams (cmds) of about 3900 resolved stars and the ha fluxesof hii regions. from the mean color index of the red giant branch, a meanmetallicity [fe/h]=-2.0 is obtained. the i magnitude of the trgb has been usedto estimate the distance. ddo 190 is 2.9+/-0.2 mpc from the milky way, 2.1 mpcfrom the m 94 group (cnv-i), 2.4 mpc from the m 81 group and 2.9 mpc from thebarycenter of the local group, all indicating that it is an isolated, fieldgalaxy. the surface-brightness distribution of the galaxy is well fitted byellipses of ellipticity e=1-a/b=0.1 and p.a.=82deg. the radial star densitydistribution follows an exponential law of scale length a=43."4, correspondingto 611 pc. the holmberg semi-major axis to mu_b=26.5 is estimated to ber^b_(26.5)=3.'0. stellar populations of different ages in ddo 190 show strongspatial decoupling, the oldest population appearing much more extended than theyoungest. stars younger than 0.1 gyr occupy only the central 40'' (0.55 kpc);stars younger than a few (~4) gyr extend out to ~80'' (125 kpc), and for largergalactocentric distances only older stars seem to be present. this behavior isfound in all the dirr galaxies for which spatially extended studies have beenperformed and could be related with the kinematical history of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0101456	a tidal extension in the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we report the detection of main-sequence and blue horizontal-branch stars ofthe ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy beyond its tidal radius, indicating theexistence of a possible tidal extension in this satellite of the milky way.this tidal extension could spread out well beyond the area covered in oursurvey (r&gt;80 arcmin),as suggested by the presence of a ``break'' to a shallowerslope observed in its density profile. the v-band surface brightness for thispossible tidal extension range from 29.8 to 31.5 mag arcsec^-2. the areacovered in our survey (~1.65 deg^2) is not enough to discriminate if thisextra-tidalpopulation is part of a tidal tail or an extended halo around thegalaxy.  the existence of this tidal extension in ursa minor indicates that thissatellite is currently undergoing a tidal disruption process by the milky way.we discuss the possibility of a tidal origin for the high mass-to-light ratioobserved in this galaxy on the basis on our result and recent theoreticalsimulations of the tidal disruption of dwarf satellites in the galactic halo.

astro-ph;0108159	the star formation history and the morphological evolution of the draco  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	the photometric and morphological properties, as well as the star formationhistory, of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy are analyzed on the basis of widefield, ccd photometry of the resolved stars covering about 1deg^2. nometallicity gradient is detected. the star surface density distribution can befitted by a single exponential law of scale-length a=5'.0+/-0'.1. the centralsurface magnitude is mu_v=24.4+/-0.5 and the core radius r_c=7'.5+/- 0.'3(equivalent to r_c=175+/-7 pc). within errors, the same scale-lengths are foundfor the density profiles along the semi-major axis and the semi-minor axis(re-scaled to semi-major axis units, using the ellipticity of the galaxy) ofdraco. there are hence no evidences of a tidal-tail associated to draco. thetidal radius of the galaxy is found to be r_t~42' (~1 kpc). the possibilitythat the large mass-to-light relation in draco could be accounted for by aconvenient spatial orientation is rejected, which implies that other mechanisms(e.g., dark matter) are required.  the stellar population of draco is mainly old. although some intermediate-agepopulation is present in draco, most of the star formation (up to 90%) tookplace before ~10 gyr ago. no significant star formation activity is detected inthe last ~2 gyr. two methods ("partial model" and "subgiant") have been used toinvestigate the star formation history of draco.

astro-ph;0112209	globular cluster systems in elliptical galaxies of coma	globular cluster systems of 17 elliptical galaxies have been studied in thecoma cluster of galaxies. surface-brightness fluctuations have been used todetermine total populations of globular clusters and specific frequency (s_n)has been evaluated for each individual galaxy. enormous differences in s_nbetween similar galaxies are found. in particular, s_n results vary by an orderof magnitude from galaxy to galaxy. extreme cases are the following: a) at thelower end of the range, ngc 4673 has s_n = 1.0 +/- 0.4, a surprising value foran elliptical galaxy, but typical for spiral and irregular galaxies; b) at theupper extreme, mcg +5 -31 -063 has s_n = 13.0 +/- 4.2 and ic 4051 s_n = 12.7+/- 3.2, and are more likely to belong to supergiant cd galaxies than to"normal" elliptical galaxies. furthermore, ngc 4874, the central supergiant cdgalaxy of the coma cluster, also exhibits a relatively high specific frequency(s_n = 9.0 +/- 2.2). the other galaxies studied have s_n in the range [2, 7],the mean value being s_n = 5.1. no single scenario seems to account for theobserved specific frequencies, so the history of each galaxy must be deducedindividually by suitably combining the different models (in situ, mergers, andaccretions). the possibility that coma is formed by several subgroups is alsoconsidered. if only the galaxies of the main subgroup defined by gurzadyan &amp;mazure (2001) are used, a trend in s_n arises in the sense of s_n being biggerin higher density regions. this result needs further confirmation.

astro-ph;0203300	the star formation history and the spatial distribution of stellar  populations in the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	as a part of a project devoted to the study of the ursa minor dsph, the starformation history of the galaxy is presented in this paper. the analysis useswide field photometry, encompassing about 1deg x 1deg (the total covered areabeing 0.75 deg^2), which samples the galaxy out to its tidal radius. derivationof the sfh has been performed using the synthetic partial model technique.  the resulting sfh shows that ursa minor hosts a predominantly old stellarpopulation, with virtually all the stars formed earlier than 10 gyr ago and 90%of them formed earlier than 13 gyr ago. nevertheless, ursa minorcolor-magnitude diagram shows several stars above the main, old turn-offforming a blue-plume (bp). if these stars were genuine, main-sequence stars,ursa minor would have maintained a low star formation rate extending up to 2gyr ago. however, several indications (relative amount and spatial distributionof bp stars and difficulty to retain processed gas) play against thispossibility. in such context, the most reliable hypothesis is that bp stars areblue-stragglers originating in the old population, ursa minor hence remainingthe only milky way dsph satellite to host a pure old stellar population. amarginally significant age gradient is detected, in the sense that stars inouter regions are slightly younger, in average.  the distance of ursa minor, has been calculated using the magnitude of thehorizontal-branch and a calibration based on hipparcos data of main sequencesub-dwarfs. we estimated a distance d=76+/-4 kpc, which is slightly larger thanprevious estimates. from the rgb color, we estimate a metallicity[fe/h]=-1.9+/-0.2, in agreement with a previous spectroscopic determination. nometallicity gradients have been detected across the galaxy.

astro-ph;0211561	intergalactic globular clusters and the faint end of the galaxy number  counts in a1656 (coma)	the existence of an intergalactic globular cluster population in the comacluster of galaxies has been tested using surface-brightness fluctuations. themain result is that the intergalactic globular cluster surface density ($n_{\rmigc}$) does not correlate with the distance to the center of coma and hencewith the environment. furthermore, comparing these results with different comamass-distribution model predictions, it is suggested that $n_{\rm igc}$ must infact be zero all over coma. on the other hand, the results for $n_{\rm igc}$and the faint end of the galaxy number counts (beyond $m_r=23.5$) areconnected. so $n_{\rm igc}=0$ settles the slope of this function, which turnsout to be $\gamma=0.36\pm0.01$ down to $m_r=26.5$.  the fact that $n_{\rm igc}=0$ all over coma suggests that globular clusterswere formed only, or almost only, from protogalactic clouds. none, or perhapsvery few, could have formed in isolated regions. it also seems inappropriate toadvocate a relationship between intergalactic globular clusters and dark matterdistributions, although it is true that the relationship could still exist butnot be strong enough to have been detected. finally, since our conclusion isthat intergalactic globular clusters do not exist in coma, accretion ofintergalactic globular clusters might not be significant in galaxy formationand evolutionary processes in the coma galaxies.

astro-ph;0308009	tracing out the northern tidal stream of the sagittarius dwarf  spheoridal galaxy	the main aim of this paper is to report two new detections of tidal debris inthe northern stream of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy located at 45 arcdeg and 55arcdeg from the center of galaxy. our observational approach is based on deepcolor-magnitude diagrams, that provides accurate distances, surface brightnessand the properties of stellar population of the studied region of this tidalstream. the derived distances for these tidal debris wraps are 45 kpc and 54kpc respectively.we also confirm these detections with numerical simulations ofthe sagittarius dwarf plus the milky way. the model reproduces the presentposition and velocity of the sagittarius main body and presents a long tidalstream formed by tidal interaction with the milky way potential. this model isalso in good agreement with the available observations of the sagittarius tidalstream. we also present a method for estimating the shape of the milky way halopotential using numerical simulations. from our simulations we obtain anoblateness of the milky way dark halo potential of 0.85, using the currentdatabase of distances and radial velocities of the sagittarius tidal stream.the color-magnitude diagram of the apocenter of sagittarius shows that thisregion of the stream shares the complex star formation history observed in themain body of the galaxy. we present the first evidence for a gradient in thestellar population along the stream, possibly correlated with its differentpericenter passages.

astro-ph;0702118	the stellar structures around disk galaxies	we present a brief summary of our current results on the stellar distributionand population gradients of the resolved stars in the surroundings of ~50nearby disk galaxies, observed with space- (hubble &amp; spitzer) and ground-basedtelescopes (subaru, vlt, bta, palomar, cfht &amp; int). we examine the radial(in-plane) and vertical (extraplanar) distributions of resolved stars as afunction of stellar age and metallicity by tracking changes in thecolor-magnitude diagram of face-on and edge-on galaxies. our data show, thatthe scale length and height of a stellar population increases with age, withthe oldest detected stellar populations identified at a large galactocentricradius or extraplanar height, out to typically a few kpc. in the most massiveof the studied galaxies there is evidence for a break in number density andcolor gradients of evolved stars, which plausibly correspond to the thick diskand halo components of the galaxies. the ratio of intermediate-age to old starsin the outermost fields correlate with the gas fraction, while relative sizesof the thick-to-thin disks anticorrelate with galactic circular velocity.

astro-ph;0702646	leo a: a late-blooming survivor of the epoch of reionization in the  local group	as part of a major program to use isolated local group dwarf galaxies asnear-field probes of cosmology, we have obtained deep images of the dwarfirregular galaxy leo a with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope. from these images we have constructed a color-magnitudediagram (cmd) reaching apparent [absolute] magnitudes of (m475, m814) &gt; (29.0[+4.4], 27.9 [+3.4]), the deepest ever achieved for any irregular galaxy beyondthe magellanic clouds. we derive the star-formation rate (sfr) as a function oftime over the entire history of the galaxy. we find that over 90% of all thestar formation that ever occurred in leo a happened more recently than 8 gyrago. the cmd shows only a very small amount of star formation in the first fewbillion years after the big bang; a possible burst at the oldest ages cannot beclaimed with high confidence. the peak sfr occurred ~1.5-4 gyr ago, at a level5-10 times the current value. our modelling indicates that leo a hasexperienced very little metallicity evolution; the mean inferred metallicity isconsistent with measurements of the present-day gas-phase oxygen abundance. wecannot exclude a scenario in which all of the ancient star formation occurredprior to the end of the era of reionization, but it seems unlikely that thelack of star formation prior to ~8 gyr ago was due to early loss or exhaustionof the in situ gas reservoir.

astro-ph;9704013	luminous red stars in local group dwarf elliptical galaxies: an  intermediate-age population?	in this paper, we show that the optically bright stars above the tip of thefirst red giant branch (trgb) in the color magnitude (cm) diagrams of nearbydwarf elliptical (de) galaxies, commonly interpreted as indication of theexistence of an intermediate-age population, may, in certain circumstances, bean artifact of observational effects on a pure old population system. for thispurpose, model cm diagrams have been computed simulating the observationaleffects that can be found in different regions of a local group de galaxy. thestarting synthetic cm diagram represents a pure old system, with star formationextending only from 15 to 12 gyr ago. based on those model diagrams, we analyzethe conclusions that a hypothetical ground-based observer might reachconcerning the presence of a population of stars above the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb) that could be interpreted as an intermediate-age population, byusing two age indicators extensively employed in the literature: i) thebolometric magnitude at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase, andii) the ratio of agb to red giant branch (rgb) stars present in the cm diagram.our analysis shows that, if observational effects are overlooked, applicationof both methods would result in finding a fictitious intermediate-agepopulation in the inner regions of the galaxy, where crowding is more severe.

astro-ph;9704159	the star formation history of the pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy	the star formation history (sfh) of the pegasus dir, a likely local groupmember at 0.95 mpc from the milky way, is investigated. we characterize the sfhby two basic functions: the star formation rate, psi(t), and the chemicalenrichment law, z(t). it has been derived by comparing the color-magnitudediagram of the resolved stars in pegasus, with a total of 189 model diagramsproduced with different psi(t) and z(t) laws.  star formation began in pegasus about 15 gyr ago and was larger, on average,during the first half than during the second half of the galaxy's life. duringthe most recent epoch, the star formation seems to be produced in a burstingmode. this may have been the case for the whole life of the galaxy, althoughthe resolution in time towards older epochs is not good enough to actuallydetect it. as for the chemical enrichment law, the best way to account for theobserved metallicity of the galaxy (zf=0.002(+0.002/-0.001) is that it suffereda prompt initial chemical enrichment. this would be the case if infall wasimportant and points to a picture in which the galaxy began forming stars andenriching its interstellar medium in an early phase of collapse.  pegasus and ngc 6822 are the only dirs for which the kind of analysispresented here has been done. the fact that both galaxies show an important oldto intermediate-age stellar population indicates that the baade's sheetobserved in most dir, may in fact be the signature of an important populationof old stars and suggest that dir actually are old objects populated by largenumbers of old stars. the percentage of dark matter in pegasus turns out to be92%.

astro-ph;9705005	the stellar content and the star formation history of the local group  dwarf galaxy lgs 3	the star formation history (sfh) and the properties of the dwarf galaxy lgs3are analyzed using color-magnitude (cm) diagrams plotted from vri photometry of736 stars. the distance to the galaxy is estimated through the position of thetip or the red giant branch. two acceptable results have been obtained:0.77+/-0.07 mpc and 0.96+/-0.07 mpc, although the first value is favored bycomplementary considerations on the stellar content of the galaxy. both valuesmake lgs3 a possible satellite of m31 or of m33. the sfh is investigated foreach of the two adopted distances comparing the observed cm diagrams with modelcm diagrams computed for different star formation rates (psi(t)) and chemicalenrichment laws (z(t)).  the results are compatible with lgs3 having been forming stars since an earlyepoch, 15-12 gyr ago, at an almost constant rate if distance is 0.77 mpc or atan exponentially decreasing rate if distance is 0.96 mpc. according to ourmodels, the current metallicity would range from z~0.0007 to z~0.002. otherresults are the current psi(t): (0.55+/-0.04)x10^(-10) mo yr^(-1) pc^(-2) or(0.47+/-0.07)x10^(-10) mo yr^(-1) pc^(-2), depending of the distance, and itsaverage for the entire life of the galaxy, &lt;psi&gt;=(1.4+/-0.1)x10^(-10) moyr^(-1) pc^(-2). at the present psi(t), the probability of lgs3 having an hiiregion is 0.2, which is compatible with the fact that no hii regions have beenfound in the galaxy. its fraction of gas relative to the mass intervening inthe chemical evolution is about 0.40 and its percentage of dark matter (thatwhich cannot be explained as stellar remnants or by extrapolation of the usedimf to low masses) is 95%. the results for psi(t) and z(t) for d=0.77 mpc arecompatible with a moderate outflow of well mixed material (lambda=3), but large

astro-ph;9705006	model color-magnitude diagrams for hubble space telescope observations  of local group dwarf galaxies	in this paper, we discuss a method to conduct a quantitative study of thestar formation history (sfh) of local group (lg) galaxies using (hst) data.this method has proven to be successful in the analysis of the sfh of the samekind of galaxies using ground-based observations. it is based on the comparisonof observed cmds with a set of model cmds. the latter are computed assumingdifferent evolutionary scenarios, and include a detailed simulation ofobservational effects. hst cmds are ~3 mags deeper than typical ground-basedcmds, allowing the observation, for all lg galaxies, of a part of the cmd thatup till now had remained accessible only for the very nearest galaxies. a veryimportant feature that will become accessible is the hb+red-clump. thedistribution of stars along this structure is quite sensitive to age andmetallicity and should provide a very important improvement in the timeresolution of the sfh for stars older than ~2-3 gyr. we show and discuss fourmodel cmds which would be comparable with cmds from deep hst observations.these model cmds represent the following evolutionary scenarios correspondingto a wide range of dwarf galaxy sub-types from di to de: a) a constant sfr from15gyr ago to the present time; b) as a), but with the sfr stopped 0.5 gyr ago;c) a constant sfr in the age range 10-9gyr and d) as c) but in the age range15-12 gyr. in all four cases a range of metallicity from z=0.0001 to z=0.004has been assumed. the present analysis is just a first qualitative approach towhat one may expect to find in the cmds of lg galaxies. however a complete setof model cmds must be computed to analize the data for each galaxy, using thecrowding effects derived for that particular galaxy.

astro-ph;9803134	the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851: its dynamical and evolutionary  properties	we have completely mapped the globular cluster ngc 1851 with vi ccdphotometry, obtaining a cmd for ca. 20500 stars. from the apparent luminosityof the hb we derive a distance modulus (m-m)o=15.44+/-0.20. the presence of 7"supra-hb" stars is confirmed. six of them are identified as evolveddescendants from hb progenitors. synthetic hr diagrams demonstrate that theproblem of the hb morphology could be solved by assuming a bimodal efficiencyof the mass loss along the rgb. we find evidence that the radial distributionof the blue hb stars is different from that of the red hb and sgb stars. thefirst measurement of the mean absolute i magnitude for 22 known rr lyrvariables (&lt;m(i)&gt;=0.12+/-0.20 at [fe/h]=-1.28), is given. we found 7 new rr lyrcandidates (6 ab type and 1 c type), lowering the ratio n(c)/n(ab) to 0.38.  from a sample of 25 globular clusters (including ngc 1851) a new calibrationfor dv(bump,hb) as a function of metallicity is derived, and we find someevidence for an age-metallicity relation among gcs. we identify 13 bluestraggler stars, which do not show any sign of variability. the blue stragglersare less concentrated than the sgb stars with similar magnitudes for r&gt;80".finally, a radial dependence of the lf, a sign of mass segregation, is found.transforming the lf into a mass function and correcting for mass segregation bymeans of multi-mass king-michie models, we find a global mf exponentx(0)=0.2+/-0.3.

astro-ph;9811122	hst observations of the local group dwarf galaxy leo i	we present deep hst f555w (v) and f814w (i) observations of a central fieldin the local group dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy leo i. the resultingcolor-magnitude diagram (cmd) reaches i \simeq 26 and reveals the oldest ~10-15gyr old turnoffs. nevertheless, a horizontal branch is not obvious in the cmd.given the low metallicity of the galaxy, this likely indicates that the firstsubstantial star formation in the galaxy may have been somehow delayed in leo iin comparison with the other dsph satellites of the milky way. the subgiantregion is well and uniformly populated from the oldest turnoffs up to the 1 gyrold turnoff, indicating that star formation has proceeded in a continuous way,with possible variations in intensity but no big gaps between successivebursts, over the galaxy's lifetime. the structure of the red-clump of corehe-burning stars is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-agepopulation inferred from the main sequence and the subgiant region. in spite ofthe lack of gas in leo i, the cmd clearly shows star formation continuing until1 gyr ago and possibly until a few hundred myrs ago in the central part of thegalaxy.

astro-ph;9905309	the stellar content of the local group dwarf galaxy phoenix	we present new deep $vi$ ground-based photometry of the local group dwarfgalaxy phoenix. our results confirm that this galaxy is mainly dominated by redstars, with some blue plume stars indicating recent (100 myr old) starformation in the central part of the galaxy. we have performed an analysis ofthe structural parameters of phoenix based on an eso/src scanned plate, inorder to search for differentiated component. the results were then used toobtain the color-magnitude diagrams for three different regions of phoenix inorder to study the variation of the properties of its stellar population. theyoung population located in the central component of phoenix shows a clearasymmetry in its distribution, that could indicate a propagation of starformation across the central component. the hi cloud found at 6 arcminsouthwest by young &amp; lo (1997) could have been involved in this process.  we also find the presence of a substantial intermediate-age population in thecentral region of phoenix that would be less abundant or absent in its outerregions. this result is also consistent with the gradient found in the numberof horizontal branch stars, whose frequency relative to red giant branch starsincreases towards the outer part of the galaxy. these results, together withthose of our morphological study, suggest the existence of an old, metal-poorpopulation with a spheroidal distribution surrounding the younger innercomponent of phoenix. this two-component structure may resemble the halo-diskstructure observed in spirals, although more data, in particular on kinematics,are necessary to confirm this.

astro-ph;9907049	the star formation history of the local group dwarf elliptical galaxy  ngc 185: ii. gradients in the stellar population	the star formation history of the de ngc 185, together with its spatialvariations, has been investigated using new ground-based $h_\alpha$ and $bvi$photometry, and synthetic color--magnitude diagrams (cmds). we find that thebulk of the stars were formed in ngc 185 at an early epoch of its evolution.after that, the star formation proceeded at a low rate until the recent past,the age of the most recent traces of star formation activity detected in thegalaxy being some 100 myr.  the star formation rate, $\psi(t)$ for old and intermediate ages shows agradient in the sense of taking smaller values for higher galactocentric radii.moreover, recent star formation is detected in the central  $150 \times 90$ pc$^2$ only, where the youngest, 100 myr old population isfound. the luminous blue {\it stars} discovered by baade (1951) in the centerof ngc 185 are discussed using new ccd images in $b$ and baade's originalphotographic plates, reaching the conclusion that most of them are in fact starclusters. a consistent picture arises in which the gas observed in the centralregion of ngc 185 would have an internal origin. the rate at which evolvedstars return gas to the ism is enough to seed the recent star formationobserved in the center of the galaxy and the sn rate is probably low enough toallow the galaxy to retain the gas not used in the new stellar generations.

astro-ph;9907394	galactic globular cluster relative ages	based on a new large, homogeneous photometric database of 35 galacticglobular clusters (ggcs), a set of distance and reddening independent relativeage indicators has been measured. the observed d(v-i)_2.5 and d(v)(hb-to) vs.metallicity relations have been compared with the relations predicted by tworecent updated libraries of isochrones. using these models and two independentmethods, we have found that self-consistent relative ages can be estimated forour ggc sample. based on the relative age vs. metallicity distribution, weconclude that: (a) there is no evidence of an age spread for clusters with[fe/h]&lt;-1.2, all the clusters of our sample in this range being old and coeval;(b) for the intermediate metallicity group (-1.2&lt;=[fe/h]&lt;-0.9) there is a clearevidence of age dispersion, with clusters up to ~25% younger than the oldermembers; and (c) the clusters within the metal rich group ([fe/h]&gt;=-0.9) seemto be coeval within the uncertainties (except pal12), but younger (~17%) thanthe bulk of the galactic globulars. the latter result is totally modeldependent. from the distribution of the ggc ages with the galactocentricdistance, we can present a possible scenario for the milky way formation: thegc formation process started at the same zero age throughout the halo, at leastout to ~20 kpc from the galactic center. according to the present stellarevolution models, the metal-rich globulars are formed at a later time (~ 17%lower age). and finally, significantly younger halo ggcs are found at anyr(gc)&gt;8 kpc. for these, a possible scenario associated with mergers of dwarfgalaxies to the milky way is suggested.
