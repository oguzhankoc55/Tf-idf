0901.1237	star formation history in the smc: the case of ngc602	deep hst/acs photometry of the young cluster ngc 602, located in the remotelow density "wing" of the small magellanic cloud, reveals numerous pre-mainsequence stars as well as young stars on the main sequence. the resolvedstellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation historyinto recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, suchas the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binaryfraction. to better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present anew set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase withmetallicity appropriate for the small magellanic cloud (z = 0.004). we use astellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range ofstellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formationhistory in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitudediagrams. the derived present day mass function for ngc 602 is consistent withthat resulting from the synthetic diagrams. the star formation rate in theregion has increased with time on a scale of tens of myr, reaching $0.3-0.7\times 10^{-3} m_\odot yr^{-1}$ in the last 2.5 myr, comparable to what isfound in galactic ob associations. star formation is most complete in the maincluster but continues at moderate levels in the gas-rich periphery of thenebula.

0901.2096	physical conditions in the ionized gas of 30 doradus	we present a mid-infrared spectroscopic data cube of the central part of 30doradus, observed with spitzer's irs and mips/sed mode. aromatic dust emissionfeatures and emission lines from molecular and atomic hydrogen are detected butnot particularly strong. the dominant spectral features are emission lines frommoderately ionized species of argon, neon, and sulphur, which are used todetermine the physical conditions in the ionized gas. the ionized gasexcitation shows strong variations on parsec scales, some of which canplausibly be associated with individual hot stars. we fit the ionic linestrengths with photoionization and shock models, and find that photoionizationdominates in the region. the ionization parameter u traces the rim of thecentral bubble, as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization, and atleast one quiescent clump. the hardness of the ionizing radiation field t_radreveals several "hot spots" that are either the result of individual very hotstars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through thesurrounding neutral cloud. consistent with other measurements of giantmolecular hydrogen regions, log(u) ranges between -3 and -0.75, and t_radbetween 30000 and 85000k.

0903.1123	the global gas and dust budget of the large magellanic cloud: agb stars  and supernovae, and the impact on the ism evolution	we report on an analysis of the gas and dust budget in the the interstellarmedium (ism) of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). recent observations from thespitzer space telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess ofasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the lmc. this is the first time we canquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from agb stars over a completegalaxy, fully based on observations. the integrated mass-loss rate over allintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich agb candidates in the lmc is8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. this numbercould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich starsare included. this is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,considering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass starswhere formed, and the initial mass functions. agb stars are one of the mostimportant gas sources in the lmc, with supernovae (sne), which produces about2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. at the moment, the star formation rate exceedsthe gas feedback from agb stars and sne in the lmc, and the current starformation depends on gas already present in the ism. this suggests that as thegas in the ism is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline inthe lmc, unless gas is supplied externally. our estimates suggest `a missingdust-mass problem' in the lmc, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: theaccumulated dust mass from agb stars and possibly sne over the dust life time(400--800 myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ism. another dustsource is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.

0905.1328	spitzer sage infrared photometry of massive stars in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the large magellanic cloud,with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometriccatalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring theirinfrared properties. the photometric catalog consists of stars with infraredcounterparts in the spitzer sage survey database, for which we present uniformphotometry from 0.3-24 microns in the ubvijhks+irac+mips24 bands. the resultinginfrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant b[e], redsupergiant and luminous blue variable (lbv) stars are among the brightestinfrared point sources in the large magellanic cloud, due to their intrinsicbrightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. we detect infrared excessesdue to free-free emission among ~900 ob stars, which correlate with luminosityclass. we confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant b[e] stars, findingthe shape of their spectral energy distributions (seds) to be very similar, incontrast to the variety of sed shapes among the spectrally variable lbvs. thesimilar luminosities of b[e] supergiants (log l/lo&gt;=4) and the rare, dustyprogenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. sn 2008s and ngc 300ot), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests acommon origin for them. we find the infrared colors for wolf-rayet stars to beindependent of spectral type and their seds to be flatter than what modelspredict. the results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap forinterpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxiesat infrared wavelengths.

0910.5624	chemical depletion in the large magellanic cloud: rv tauri stars and the  photospheric feedback from their dusty discs	aims: by studying the photospheric abundances of 4 rv tauri stars in the lmc,we test whether the depletion pattern of refractory elements, seen in similargalactic sources, is also common for extragalactic sources. since thisdepletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc,we investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. methods: adetailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution uvesoptical spectra. to study the circumstellar environment we use photometric datato construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine thegeometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution spitzer-irsinfrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. results: our results showthat, also in the lmc, the photospheres of rv tauri stars are commonly affectedby the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength fromsource to source. from our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, wefind that this process, as in the galaxy, appears closely related to thepresence of a stable keplerian disc. the newly studied extragalactic objectshave similar observational characteristics as galactic post-agb binariessurrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of abinary system. one source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for adisc source, but still has evidence for depletion. we speculate this couldpoint to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seenaround young stellar objects.

0911.0532	ice chemistry in embedded young stellar objects in the large magellanic  cloud	we present spectroscopic observations of a sample of 15 embedded youngstellar objects (ysos) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). these observationswere obtained with the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) as part of thesage-spec legacy program. we analyze the two prominent ice bands in the irsspectral range: the bending mode of co_2 ice at 15.2 micron and the ice bandbetween 5 and 7 micron that includes contributions from the bending mode ofwater ice at 6 micron amongst other ice species. the 5-7 micron band isdifficult to identify in our lmc sample due to the conspicuous presence of pahemission superimposed onto the ice spectra. we identify water ice in thespectra of two sources; the spectrum of one of those sources also exhibits the6.8 micron ice feature attributed to ammonium and methanol. we model the co_2band in detail, using the combination of laboratory ice profiles available inthe literature. we find that a significant fraction (&gt; 50%) of co_2 ice islocked in a water-rich component, consistent with what is observed for galacticsources. the majority of the sources in the lmc also require a pure-co_2contribution to the ice profile, evidence of thermal processing. there is asuggestion that co_2 production might be enhanced in the lmc, but the size ofthe available sample precludes firmer conclusions. we place our results in thecontext of the star formation environment in the lmc.

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

0911.5626	evidence of grain growth in the disk of the bipolar proto-planetary  nebula m 1--92	we investigate the dust size and dust shell structure of the bipolarproto-planetary nebula m 1--92 by means of radiative transfer modeling. ourmodels consists of a disk and bipolar lobes that are surrounded by an agbshell, each component having different dust characteristics. the upper limit ofthe grain size $a_\mathrm{max}$ in the lobes is estimated to be $0.5 \mu$m fromthe polarization value in the bipolar lobe. the $a_\mathrm{max}$ value of thedisk is constrained with the disk mass (0.2 $m_{\sun}$), which was estimatedfrom a previous co emission line observation. we find a good model with$a_\mathrm{max}=1000.0 \mu$m, which provides an approximated disk mass of 0.15$m_{\sun}$. even taking into account uncertainties such as the gas-to-dust massratio, a significantly larger dust of $a_\mathrm{max}&gt;100.0 \mu$m, comparing tothe dust in the lobe, is expected.  we also estimated the disk inner radius, the disk outer radius, and theenvelope mass to be 30 $r_\star$(=9 au), 4500 au, and 4 $m_{\sun}$,respectively, where $v_\mathrm{exp}$ is the expansion velocity. if the dustexisting in the lobes in large separations from the central star undergoeslittle dust processing, the dust sizes preserves the ones in the dustformation. submicron-sized grains are found in many objects besides m 1--92,suggesting that the size does not depend much on the object properties, such asinitial mass of the central star and chemical composition of the stellarsystem. on the other hand, the grain sizes in the disk do. evidence of largegrains has been reported in many bipolar ppns, including m 1--92. this resultsuggests that disks play an important role in grain growth.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1005.2787	dust in the bright supernova remnant n49 in the lmc	we investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (snr) n49 inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) as observed with the herschel spaceobservatory. n49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecularcloud along its eastern edge. we have used pacs and spire to measure the far irflux densities of the entire snr and of a bright region on the eastern edge ofthe snr where the snr shock is encountering the molecular cloud. using thesefluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate thedust mass associated with n49 to be about 10 msun. the bulk of the dust in oursimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 k, similar to that ofnearby molecular clouds. unfortunately, as a result of the limited angularresolution of herschel at the wavelengths sampled with spire, the uncertaintiesare fairly large. assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with thesnr is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the snrarises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significantx-ray emission. the total amount of warm 50-60 k dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 msun,depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicategrains. this provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust inn49.

1010.3134	statistical study of dust properties in lmc molecular clouds	the objective of this paper is to construct a catalog providing the dustproperties and the star formation efficiency (sfe) of the molecular clouds inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc). we use the infrared (ir) data obtained withthe spitzer telescope as part of the ``surveying the agents of a galaxy'sevolution'' (sage) legacy survey as well as the iras data. we also work withextinction (av) maps of the lmc. a total of 272 molecular clouds have beendetected in the lmc in a previous molecular survey, accounting for 230 giantmolecular clouds and 42 smaller clouds. we perform correlations between the iremission/extinction, and atomic and molecular gas tracers. we compare theatomic gas that surrounds the molecular cloud with the molecular gas in thecloud. using a dust emission model, we derive the physical properties of dustin and outside the clouds: equilibrium temperature, emissivity and extinction.we also determine the luminosity of the interstellar radiation fieldintercepted by the cloud, and the total ir luminosity. statistically, we do notfind any significant difference in the dust properties between the atomic andthe molecular phases. in particular we do not find evidence for a systematicdecrease of the dust temperature in the molecular phase, with respect to thesurrounding, presumably atomic gas. this is probably because giant molecularclouds are the sites of star formation, which heat the dust, while the smallestclouds are unresolved. the ratio between the ir luminosity and the cloud mass(ldust/mgas) does not seem to correlate with mgas. the highest value of theratio we derived is 18.1 lsol/msol in the 30 doradus region, which is known tobe the most prominent star formation region of the lmc, while the most likelyvalue is 0.5 and is representative of quiescent clouds. we provide aprescription to associate the various stages of star formation with itsldust/mgas.

1011.2786	ice chemistry in massive young stellar objects: the role of metallicity	we present the comparison of the three most important ice constituents(water, co and co2) in the envelopes of massive young stellar objects (ysos),in environments of different metallicities: the galaxy, the large magellaniccloud (lmc) and, for the first time, the small magellanic cloud (smc). wepresent observations of water, co and co2 ice in 4 smc and 3 lmc ysos (obtainedwith spitzer-irs and vlt/isaac). while water and co2 ice are detected in allmagellanic ysos, co ice is not detected in the smc objects. both co and co2 iceabundances are enhanced in the lmc when compared to high-luminosity galacticysos. based on the fact that both species appear to be enhanced in a consistentway, this effect is unlikely to be the result of enhanced co2 production inhotter yso envelopes as previously thought. instead we propose that thisresults from a reduced water column density in the envelopes of lmc ysos, adirect consequence of both the stronger uv radiation field and the reduceddust-to-gas ratio at lower metallicity. in the smc the environmental conditionsare harsher, and we observe a reduction in co2 column density. furthermore, thelow gas-phase co density and higher dust temperature in yso envelopes in thesmc seem to inhibit co freeze-out. the scenario we propose can be tested withfurther observations.

1103.2170	dust emission from evolved and unevolved hii regions in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a study of the dust properties of 12 classical and superbubble hiiregions in the large magellanic cloud. we use infrared photometry from spitzer(8, 24, 70, and 160 \mum bands), obtained as part of the surveying the agentsof a galaxy's evolution (sage) program, along with archival spectroscopicclassifications of the ionizing stars to examine the role of stellar sources ondust heating and processing. our infrared observations show surprisingly littlecorrelation between the emission properties of the dust and the effectivetemperatures or bolometric magnitudes of stars in the hii regions, suggestingthat the hii region evolutionary timescale is not on the order of the dustprocessing timescale. we find that the infrared emission of superbubbles andclassical hii regions shows little differentiation between the two classes,despite the significant differences in age and morphology. we do detect acorrelation of the 24 \mum emission from hot dust with the ratio of 70 to 160\mum flux. this correlation can be modeled as a trend in the temperature of aminority hot dust component, while a majority of the dust remains significantlycooler.

1105.2492	the spitzer discovery of a galaxy with infrared emission solely due to  agn activity	we present a galaxy (sage1cj053634.78-722658.5) at a redshift of 0.14 ofwhich the ir is entirely dominated by emission associated with the agn. wepresent the 5-37 um spitzer/irs spectrum and broad wavelength sed ofsage1cj053634, an ir point-source detected by spitzer/sage (meixner et al2006). the source was observed in the sage-spec program (kemper et al., 2010)and was included to determine the nature of sources with deviant ir colours.the spectrum shows a redshifted (z=0.14+-0.005) silicate emission feature withan exceptionally high feature-to-continuum ratio and weak polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) bands. we compare the source with models of emission fromdusty tori around agns from nenkova et al. (2008). we present a diagnosticdiagram that will help to identify similar sources based on spitzer/mips andherschel/pacs photometry. the sed of sage1cj053634 is peculiar because it lacksfar-ir emission and a clear stellar counterpart. we find that the sed and their spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pcaround an accreting black hole. there is no need to invoke emission from thehost galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although apossible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the sed analysis.the hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaksat 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thinemission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. the weak pahemission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formationtemplates strongly over-predict the measured far-ir flux levels. the sed ofsage1cj053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the moredistant universe. the conspicuous absence of host-galaxy ir emission placeslimits on the far-ir emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

1106.0537	evidence for pre-existing dust in the bright type iin sn 2010jl	sn 2010jl was an extremely bright, type iin sne which showed a significant irexcess no later than 90 days after explosion. we have obtained spitzer 3.6 and4.5 \mum and jhk observations of sn 2010jl \sim90 days post explosion. littleto no reddening in the host galaxy indicated that the circumstellar materiallost from the progenitor must lie in a torus inclined out of the plane of thesky. the likely cause of the high mid-ir flux is the reprocessing of theinitial flash of the sn by pre-existing circumstellar dust. using a 3d montecarlo radiative transfer code, we have estimated that between 0.03-0.35 msun ofdust exists in a circumstellar torus around the sn located 6 \times 10 ^17 cmaway from the sn and inclined between 60-80\cdot to the plane of the sky. onday 90, we are only seeing the illumination of approximately 5% of this torus,and expect to see an elevated ir flux from this material up until day \sim 450.it is likely this dust was created in an lbv-like mass loss event of more than3 msun, which is large but consistent with other lbv progenitors such as {\eta}carinae.

0710.0558	the stellar mass distribution in the giant star forming region ngc 346	deep f555w and f814w hubble space telescope acs images are the basis for astudy of the present day mass function (pdmf) of ngc346, the largest activestar forming region in the small magellanic cloud (smc). we find a pdmf slopeof gamma=-1.43+/-0.18 in the mass range 0.8-60 mo, in excellent agreement withthe salpeter initial mass function (imf) in the solar neighborhood. caveats onthe conversion of the pdmf to the imf are discussed. the pdmf slope changes, asa function of the radial distance from the center of the ngc 346 star cluster,indicating a segregation of the most massive stars. this segregation is likelyprimordial considering the young age (~3 myr) of ngc346, and its clumpystructure which suggests that the cluster has likely not had sufficient time torelax. comparing our results for ngc346 with those derived for other starclusters in the smc and the milky way (mw), we conclude that, while the starformation process might depend on the local cloud conditions, the imf does notseem to be affected by general environmental effects such as galaxy type,metallicity, and dust content.

1110.1260	non-standard grain properties, dark gas reservoir, and extended  submillimeter excess, probed by herschel in the large magellanic cloud	aims: in this paper, we perform detailed modelling of the spitzer andherschel observations of the lmc, in order to: (i) systematically study theuncertainties and biases affecting dust mass estimates; and to (ii) explore thepeculiar ism properties of the lmc.  methods: to achieve these goals, we have modelled the spatially resolved sedswith two alternate grain compositions, to study the impact of differentsubmillimetre opacities on the dust mass. we have rigorously propagated theobservational errors (noise and calibration) through the entire fittingprocess, in order to derive consistent parameter uncertainties.  results: first, we show that using the integrated sed leads tounderestimating the dust mass by ~50 % compared to the value obtained withsufficient spatial resolution, for the region we studied. this might be thecase, in general, for unresolved galaxies. second, we show that milky way typegrains produce higher gas-to-dust mass ratios than what seems possibleaccording to the element abundances in the lmc. a spatial analysis shows thatthis dilemma is the result of an exceptional property: the grains of the lmchave on average a larger intrinsic submm opacity (emissivity index beta~1.7 andopacity kappa_abs(160 microns)=1.6 m2/kg) than those of the galaxy. by studyingthe spatial distribution of the gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are able toconstrain the fraction of unseen gas mass between ~10, and ~100 % and show thatit is not sufficient to explain the gas-to-dust mass ratio obtained with milkyway type grains. finally, we confirm the detection of a 500 microns extendedemission excess with an average relative amplitude of ~15 %, varying up to 40%. this excess anticorrelates well with the dust mass surface density. althoughwe do not know the origin of this excess, we show that it is unlikely theresult of very cold dust, or cmb fluctuations.

1110.3166	the effects of dust on the optical and infrared evolution of sn 2004et	we present an analysis of multi-epoch observations of the type ii-p supernovasn 2004et. new and archival optical spectra of sn 2004et are used to study theevolution of the halpha and [o i] 6300a line profiles between days 259 and 646.mid-infrared imaging was carried out between 2004 to 2010. we include spitzer`warm' mission photometry at 3.6 and 4.5um obtained on days 1779, 1931 and2151, along with ground-based and hst optical and near-infrared observationsobtained between days 79 and 1803. multi-wavelength light curves are presented,as well as optical-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) for multipleepochs. starting from about day 300, the optical light curves provide evidencefor an increasing amount of circumstellar extinction attributable to newlyformed dust, with the additional extinction reaching 0.8-1.5 magnitudes in thev-band by day 690. the overall seds were fitted with multiple blackbodycomponents, in order to investigate the luminosity evolution of the supernova,and then with monte carlo radiative transfer models using smooth or clumpy dustdistributions, in order to estimate how much new dust condensed in the ejecta.the luminosity evolution was consistent with the decay of 56co in the ejecta upuntil about day 690, after which an additional emission source is required, inagreement with the findings of kotak et al. (2009). clumped dust densitydistributions consisting of 20% amorphous carbons and 80% silicates by masswere able to match the observed optical and infrared seds, with dust massesthat increased from 8x10^{-5} msun on day 300 to 1.5x10^{-3} msun on day 690,still significantly lower than the values needed for core collapse supernovaeto make a significant contribution to the dust enrichment of galaxies.

1201.5384	the dust budget of the smc: are agb stars the primary dust source at low  metallicity?	we estimate the total dust input from the cool evolved stars in the smallmagellanic cloud (smc), using the 8 micron excess emission as a proxy for thedust-production rate. we find that asymptotic giant branch (agb) and redsupergiant (rsg) stars produce (8.6-9.5) x 10^7 solar masses per year of dust,depending on the fraction of far-infrared sources that belong to the evolvedstar population (with 10%-50% uncertainty in individual dust-production rates).rsgs contribute the least (&lt;4%), while carbon-rich agb stars (especially theso-called "extreme" agb stars) account for 87%-89% of the total dust input fromcool evolved stars. we also estimate the dust input from hot stars andsupernovae (sne), and find that if sne produce 10^-3 solar masses of dust each,then the total sn dust input and agb input are roughly equivalent. we considerseveral scenarios of sne dust production and destruction and find that theinterstellar medium (ism) dust can be accounted for solely by stellar sourcesif all sne produce dust in the quantities seen around the dustiest examples andif most sne explode in dense regions where much of the ism dust is shieldedfrom the shocks. we find that agb stars contribute only 2.1% of the ism dust.without a net positive contribution from sne to the dust budget, this suggeststhat dust must grow in the ism or be formed by another unknown mechanism.

1205.0280	the mass-loss return from evolved stars to the large magellanic cloud  vi: luminosities and mass-loss rates on population scales	we present results from the first application of the grid of red supergiantand asymptotic giant branch models (grams) model grid to the entire evolvedstellar population of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). grams is a pre-computedgrid of 80,843 radiative transfer (rt) models of evolved stars andcircumstellar dust shells composed of either silicate or carbonaceous dust. wefit grams models to ~30,000 asymptotic giant branch (agb) and red supergiant(rsg) stars in the lmc, using 12 bands of photometry from the optical to themid-infrared. our published dataset consists of thousands of evolved stars withindividually determined evolutionary parameters such as luminosity andmass-loss rate. the grams grid has a greater than 80% accuracy ratediscriminating between oxygen- and carbon-rich chemistry. the global dustinjection rate to the interstellar medium (ism) of the lmc from rsgs and agbstars is on the order of 1.5x10^(-5) solar masses/yr, equivalent to a totalmass injection rate (including the gas) into the ism of ~5x10^(-3) solarmasses/yr. carbon stars inject two and a half times as much dust into the ismas do o-rich agb stars, but the same amount of mass. we determine a bolometriccorrection factor for c-rich agb stars in the k band as a function of j - kcolor, bc(k) = -0.40(j-k)^2 + 1.83(j-k) + 1.29. we determine several ir colorproxies for the dust mass-loss rate (mlr) from c-rich agb stars, such as log(mlr) = (-18.90)/((k-[8.0])+3.37)-5.93. we find that a larger fraction of agbstars exhibiting the `long-secondary period' phenomenon are o-rich than starsdominated by radial pulsations, and agb stars without detectable mass-loss donot appear on either the first-overtone or fundamental-mode pulsationsequences.

1205.5517	optical and infrared analysis of type ii sn 2006bc	we present nebular phase optical imaging and spectroscopy and near/mid-irimaging of the type ii sn 2006bc. observations reveal the central wavelength ofthe symmetric h$\alpha$ line profile to be red-shifted with respect to the hostgalaxy h$\alpha$ emission by day 325. such an phenomenon has been argued toresult from an asymmetric explosion in the iron-peak elements resulting in alarger mass of $^{56}$ni and higher excitation of hydrogen on the far side ofthe sn explosion. we also observe a gradual blue-shifting of this h$\alpha$peak which is indicative of dust formation in the ejecta. although showing anormal peak brightness, v $\sim$ -17.2, for a core-collapse sn, 2006bc fades by$\sim$6 mag during the first 400 days suggesting either a relatively low$^{56}$ni yield, an increase in extinction due to new dust, or both. a shortduration flattening of the light curve is observed from day 416 to day 541suggesting an optical light echo. based on the narrow time window of this echo,we discuss implications on the location and geometry of the reflecting ism.with our radiative transfer models, we find an upper limit of 2 x 10$^{-3}$m$_{\odot}$ of dust around sn 2006bc. in the event that all of this dust wereformed during the sn explosion, this quantity of dust is still several ordersof magnitude lower than that needed to explain the large quantities of dustobserved in the early universe.

(2011), wherethe reduced shielding in metal-poor environments depletes the h2o columndensity in the outer regions of the yso envelopes. no co ice is detectedtowards the smc sources. emission due to pure-rotational 0-0 transitions of h2is detected towards the majority of smc sources, allowing us to estimaterotational temperatures and column densities. all but one source arespectroscopically confirmed as smc ysos. of the 33 ysos identified in the smc,30 sources populate different stages of massive stellar evolution. theremaining three sources are classified as intermediate-mass ysos with a thickdusty disc and a tenuous envelope still present. we propose one of the sourcesis a d-type symbiotic system, based on the presence of raman, h and he emissionlines in the optical spectrum, and silicate emission in the irs-spectrum. thiswould be the first dust-rich symbiotic system identified in the smc.

(2011) modellingtechnique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of thestar formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of pahs or thedust mass surface density of the region. we observe that the pah fractionstrongly decreases in the hii regions. this decrease coincides with peaks inthe mean radiation field intensity map. the dust surface densities follow thefir distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 msolar (2.8 times lessthan when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. we find anon-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud n159 south (showing nomassive sf). we also investigate the drivers of the herschel/pacs and spiresubmm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) andthe xco conversion factor in the region n159. we finally model individualregions to analyse variations in the sed shape across the complex and the 870umemission in more details. no measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems tobe detected in these regions.

0801.4612	hst snapshot survey of post-agb objects	the results from a hubble space telescope (hst) snapshot survey of post-agbobjects are shown. the aim of the survey is to complement existing hst imagesof ppn and to connect various types of nebulosities with physical and chemicalproperties of their central stars. nebulosities are detected in 15 of 33sources. images and photometric and geometric measurements are presented. forsources with nebulosities we see a morphological bifurcation into two groups,duplex and sole, as previous studies have found. we find further support to theprevious results suggesting that this dichotomy is caused by a difference inoptical thickness of the dust shell. the remaining 18 sources are classified asstellar post-agb objects, because our observations indicate a lack ofnebulosity. we show that some stellar sources may in fact be duplex or solebased on their infrared colors. the cause of the differences among the groupsare investigated. we discuss some evidence suggesting that high progenitor-massagb stars tend to become duplex post-agb objects. intermediate progenitor-massagb stars tend to be sole post-agb objects. most of the stellar sourcesprobably have low mass progenitors and do not seem to develop nebulositiesduring the post-agb phase and therefore do not become planetary nebulae.

1407.8452	the mass-loss return from evolved stars to the large magellanic cloud  iv: construction and validation of a grid of models for oxygen-rich agb  stars, red supergiants, and extreme agb stars	to measure the mass loss from dusty oxygen-rich (o-rich) evolved stars in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc), we have constructed a grid of models ofspherically-symmetric dust shells around stars with constant mass-loss ratesusing 2dust. these models will constitute the o-rich model part of the "grid ofred supergiant and asymptotic giant branch star models" (grams). this modelgrid explores 4 parameters - stellar effective temperature from 2100 k - 4700k; luminosity from 10^3-10^6 l_sun; dust shell inner radii of 3, 7, 11, and 15r_star; and 10.0 micron optical depth from 10^-4 to 26. from an initial grid of~1200 2dust models, we create a larger grid of ~69,000 models by scaling tocover the luminosity range required by the data. these models are offered tothe public on a website. the matching in color-magnitude diagrams andcolor-color diagrams to observed o-rich asymptotic giant branch (agb) and redsupergiant (rsg) candidate stars from the sage and sage-spec lmc samples and asmall sample of oh/ir stars is generally very good. the extreme agb starcandidates from sage are more consistent with carbon-rich (c-rich) than o-richdust composition. our model grid suggests lower limits to the mid-infraredcolors of the dustiest agb stars for which the chemistry could be o-rich.finally, the fitting of grams models to seds of sources fit by other studiesprovides additional verification of our grid and anticipates future, moreexpansive efforts.

1409.3015	dust composition and mass-loss return from the luminous blue variable  r71 in the lmc	we present an analysis of mid-and far-infrared (ir) spectrum and spectralenergy distribution (sed) of the lbv r71 in the lmc.this work aims tounderstand the overall contribution of high-mass lbvs to the total dust-massbudget of the interstellar medium (ism) of the lmc and compare this with thecontribution from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. as a casestudy, we analyze the sed of r71. we compiled all the available photometric andspectroscopic observational fluxes from various telescopes for a widewavelength range (0.36 -- 250\,$\mu$m). we determined the dust composition fromthe spectroscopic data, and derived the ejected dust mass, dust mass-loss rate,and other dust shell properties by modeling the sed of r71. we noted ninespectral features in the dust shell of r71 by analyzing spitzer spectroscopicdata. among these, we identified three new crystalline silicate features. wecomputed our model spectrum by using 3d radiative transfer code mcmax. ourmodel calculation shows that dust is dominated by amorphous silicates, withsome crystalline silicates, metallic iron, and a very tiny amount of polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (pah) molecules. the presence of both silicates and pahsindicates that the dust has a mixed chemistry. we derived a dust mass of 0.01m$_\odot$, from which we arrive at a total ejected mass of $\approx$ 5m$_\odot$. this implies a time-averaged dust mass-loss rate of2.5$\times$10$^{-6}$ m$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ with an explosion about 4000 yearsago. we assume that the other five confirmed dusty lbvs in the lmc loose massat a similar rate, and estimate the total contribution to the mass budget ofthe lmc to be $\approx$ 10$^{-5}$ m$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$, which is comparable tothe contribution by all the agb stars in the lmc. based on our analysis on r71,we speculate that lbvs as a class may be an important dust source in the ism ofthe lmc.

1411.7381	a stubbornly large mass of cold dust in the ejecta of supernova 1987a	we present new herschel photometric and spectroscopic observations ofsupernova 1987a, carried out in 2012. our dedicated photometric measurementsprovide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 microncompared to previous observations in 2010. our herschel spectra show only weakco line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [o i] line flux,eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previouslyestimated dust mass. the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) iswell fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. the newly measured 70 micronflux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a singletemperature. the far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 msun ofamorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosyntheticmass prediction for carbon. the observation of sio molecules at early and latephases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the sedwith a combination of 0.3 msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 msun of silicates,totalling 0.8 msun of dust. our analysis thus supports the presence of a largedust reservoir in the ejecta of sn 1987a. the inferred dust mass suggests thatsupernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, fromlocal to high-redshift galaxies.

1412.0695	an infrared census of dust in nearby galaxies with spitzer (dustings),  ii. discovery of metal-poor dusty agb stars	the dustings survey (dust in nearby galaxies with spitzer) is a 3.6 and 4.5micron imaging survey of 50 nearby dwarf galaxies designed to identifydust-producing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massive stars. using twoepochs, spaced approximately six months apart, we identify a total of 526 dustyvariable agb stars (sometimes called "extreme" or x-agb stars; [3.6]-[4.5]&gt;0.1mag). of these, 111 are in galaxies with [fe/h] &lt; -1.5 and 12 are in galaxieswith [fe/h] &lt; -2.0, making them the most metal-poor dust-producing agb starsknown. we compare these identifications to those in the literature and findthat most are newly discovered large-amplitude variables, with the exception ofapproximately 30 stars in ngc 185 and ngc 147, one star in ic 1613, and onestar in phoenix. the chemical abundances of the x-agb variables are unknown,but the low metallicities suggest that they are more likely to be carbon-richthan oxygen-rich and comparisons with existing optical and near-ir photometryconfirms that 70 of the x-agb variables are confirmed or likely carbon stars.we see an increase in the pulsation amplitude with increased dust production,supporting previous studies suggesting that dust production and pulsation arelinked. we find no strong evidence linking dust production with metallicity,indicating that dust can form in very metal-poor environments.

1501.03634	star-formation rates from young-star counts and the structure of the ism  across the ngc346/n66 complex in the smc	the rate at which interstellar gas is converted into stars, and itsdependence on environment, is one of the pillars on which our understanding ofthe visible universe is build. we present a comparison of the surface densityof young stars (sigma_*) and dust surface density (sigma_d) across ngc346 (n66)in 115 independent pixels of 6x6 pc^2. we find a correlation between sigma_*and sigma_d with a considerable scatter. a power law fit to the data yields asteep relation with an exponent of 2.6+-0.2. we convert sigma_d to gas surfacedensity (sigma_g) and sigma_* to star formation rate (sfr) surface densities(sigma_sfr), using simple assumptions for the gas-to-dust mass ratio and theduration of star formation. the derived total sfr (4+-1 10^-3 m_sun/yr) isconsistent with sfr estimated from the ha emission integrated over the hanebula. on small scales the sigma_sfr derived using ha systematicallyunderestimates the count-based sigma_sfr, by up to a factor of 10. this is dueto ionizing photons escaping the area, where the stars are counted. we findthat individual 36 pc^2 pixels fall systematically above integrateddisc-galaxies in the schmidt-kennicutt diagram by on average a factor of ~7.the ngc346 average sfr over a larger area (90 pc radius) lies closer to therelation but remains high by a factor of ~3. the fraction of the total mass(gas plus young stars) locked in young stars is systematically high (~10 percent) within the central 15 pc and systematically lower outside (2 per cent),which we interpret as variations in star formation efficiency. the inner 15 pcis dominated by young stars belonging to a centrally condensed cluster, whilethe outer parts are dominated by a dispersed population. therefore, theobserved trend could reflect a change of star formation efficiency betweenclustered and non-clustered star-formation.
