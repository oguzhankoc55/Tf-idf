0903.3566	age and distance for the old open cluster ngc188 from the eclipsing  binary member v12	we present time-series radial-velocity and photometric observations of asolar-type double-lined eclipsing binary star (v12) near the turnoff in the oldopen cluster ngc188. we use these data to determine the spectroscopic orbit andthe photometric elements for v12. from our analysis we determine accuratemasses (mp=1.103+-0.007msun, ms=1.081+-0.007msun) and radii (r=1.424+-0.019rsun, rs=1.373+-0.019rsun) for the primary (p) and secondary (s)binary components. we adopt a reddening of e_(b-v)=0.087 for ngc188, and derivecomponent effective temperatures of 5900+-100k and 5875+-100k, respectively,for the primary and secondary stars. from their absolute dimensions, the twocomponents of v12 yield identical distance moduli of vo-mv=11.24+-0.09,corresponding to 1770+-75pc. we determine an age of 6.2+-0.2gyr for v12 andngc188, from a comparison with theoretical isochrones in the mass-radiusdiagram. this age is independent of distance, reddening, and color-temperaturetransformations. we use isochrones from victoria-regina (vrss) and yonsei-yale(y2) with [fe/h]=-0.1 and [fe/h]=0.0. from the solar metallicity isochrones, anage of 6.4gyr provides the best fit to the binary components for both sets ofmodels. for the isochrones with [fe/h]=-0.1, ages of 6.0gyr and 5.9gyr providethe best fits for the vrss and y2 models, respectively. we use the distance andage estimates for v12, together with best estimates for the metallicity andreddening of ngc188, to investigate the locations of the corresponding vrss andy2 isochrones relative to cluster members in the color-magnitude diagram.plausible changes in model metallicity and distance to better match theisochrones to the cluster sequences, result in a range of ages for ngc188 thatis more than 3 times that resulting from our analysis of v12.

0906.2876	signatures of intrinsic li depletion and li-na anti-correlation in the  metal-poor globular cluster ngc6397	to alleviate the discrepancy between the prediction of the primordial lithiumabundance in the universe and the abundances observed in pop ii dwarfs andsubgiant stars, it has been suggested that the stars observable today haveundergone photospheric depletion of li. to constrain the nature of suchdepletion, we conduct a homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars inthe metal-poor globular cluster ngc6397, covering well all evolutionary phasesfrom below the main sequence turn-off to high up the red giant branch. non-lteli abundances or abundance upper limits are obtained for all stars, and for asize-able sub-set of the targets also na abundances are obtained. the sodiumabundances are used to distinguish stars formed out of pristine material fromstars formed out of material affected by pollution from a previous generationof more massive stars. the dwarfs, turn-off, and early subgiant stars form athin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant branch by thelithium dilution caused by the first dredge-up. a second steep abundance dropis seen at the red giant branch bump. the turn-off stars are more lithium-poor,by up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants that have not yet undergone dredge-up. inaddition, hotter dwarfs are slightly more lithium-poor than cooler dwarfs,which may be a signature of the so-called li dip in the cluster, commonly seenamong popi stars. a considerably large spread in na abundance confirms thatngc6397 has suffered from intra-cluster pollution in its infancy and a limitednumber of na-enhanced and li-deficient stars strongly contribute to form asignificant anti-correlation between the abundances of na and li. the inferredli abundances are compared to predictions from stellar structure modelsincluding atomic diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone.

0707.1019	stroemgren photometry of galactic globular clusters. i. new calibrations  of the metallicity index	we present a new calibration of the stroemgren metallicity index m1 using redgiant (rg) stars in 4 globular clusters (gcs:m92,m13,ngc1851,47tuc) withmetallicity ranging from [fe/h]=-2.2 to -0.7, marginally affected by reddening(e(b-v)&lt;0.04) and with accurate u,v,b,y photometry.the main difference betweenthe new metallicity-index-color (mic) relations and similar relations availablein the literature is that we adopted the u-y/v-y colors instead of theb-y.these colors present a stronger sensitivity to effective temperature, andthe mic relations show a linear slope. the difference between photometricestimates and spectroscopic measurements for rgs in m71,ngc288,ngc362,ngc6397,and ngc6752 is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sigma=0.11dex). we also apply the mic relationsto 85 field rgs with metallicity raning from [fe/h]=-2.4 to -0.5 and accuratereddening estimates. we find that the difference between photometric estimatesand spectroscopic measurements is-0.14+/-0.01dex (sig=0.17dex). we also providetwo sets of mic relations based on evolutionary models that have beentransformed into the observational plane by adopting either semi-empirical ortheoretical color-temperature relations. we apply the semi-empirical relationsto the 9 gcs and find that the difference between photometric and spectroscopicmetallicities is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sig=0.10dex).a similar agreement is found forthe sample of field rgs, with a difference of -0.09+/-0.03dex (sig=0.19dex).thedifference between metallicity estimates based on theoretical relations andspectroscopic measurements is -0.11+/-0.03dex (sig=0.14dex) for the 9 ggcs and-0.24+/-0.03dex (sig=0.15dex) for the field rgs. current evidence indicatesthat new mic relations provide metallicities with an intrinsic accuracy betterthan 0.2dex.

1003.0052	a multi-site campaign to measure solar-like oscillations in procyon. ii.  mode frequencies	we have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations inthe f5 star procyon. the data consist of high-precision velocities that weobtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. a new method foradjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the powerspectrum. stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram revealstwo clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angulardegree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). we interpret a strong, narrowpeak at 446 muhz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixedcharacter. we show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and theirseparations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. in particular,variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in thesound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. we list frequenciesfor 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a rangecomparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints fortheoretical models. a preliminary comparison with published models shows thatthe offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes isvery different for procyon than for the sun and other cool stars. we find themean lifetime of the modes in procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which issignificantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the sun.

0709.0639	atomic diffusion and mixing in old stars i. vlt/flames-uves observations  of stars in ngc 6397	we present a homogeneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 18 starsalong the evolutionary sequence of the metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397([fe/h] = -2), from the main-sequence turnoff point to red giants below thebump. the spectroscopic stellar parameters, in particular stellar-parameterdifferences between groups of stars, are in good agreement with broad-band andstroemgren photometry calibrated on the infrared-flux method. the spectroscopicabundance analysis reveals, for the first time, systematic trends of ironabundance with evolutionary stage. iron is found to be 31% less abundant in theturnoff-point stars than in the red giants. an abundance difference in lithiumis seen between the turnoff-point and warm subgiant stars. the impact ofpotential systematic errors on these abundance trends (stellar parameters, thehydrostatic and lte approximations) is quantitatively evaluated and found notto alter our conclusions significantly. trends for various elements (li, mg,ca, ti and fe) are compared with stellar-structure models including the effectsof atomic diffusion and radiative acceleration. such models are found todescribe the observed element-specific trends well, if extra (turbulent) mixingjust below the convection zone is introduced. it is concluded that atomicdiffusion and turbulent mixing are largely responsible for the sub-primordialstellar lithium abundances of warm halo stars. other consequences of atomicdiffusion in old metal-poor stars are also discussed.

1107.0490	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: constraints from red giants in  open clusters observed by kepler	scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellarproperties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physicsthat underpins stellar pulsation. the common notion that all stars in an opencluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precisionthan what is usually achievable for single stars. this makes clusters ideal forexploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillationsand the global stellar properties. we have analyzed data obtained with nasa'skepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant starslocated in either of the three open clusters, ngc 6791, ngc 6819, and ngc 6811.by fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relationsthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that thedata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio aspreviously assumed. as a result we provide a new improved empirical relationwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. this relation turns out to alsowork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. in addition, themeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previouslyunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in ngc 6791 and ngc 6819, pointingto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into theformation history of open clusters.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.4071	age and helium content of the open cluster ngc 6791 from multiple  eclipsing binary members. ii. age dependencies and new insights	models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by measuringaccurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. multiplebinary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these oldstellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. in the firstpaper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsingbinaries in the old open cluster ngc6791 sets tighter constraints on theproperties of stellar models than has previously been possible, therebypotentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. herewe add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison todetermine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employingas many observational constraints as possible. we improve our photometry andcorrect empirically for differential reddening effects. we then perform anextensive comparison of the cmds and eclipsing binary measurements to victoriaand dsep isochrones to estimate cluster parameters. we also reanalyse aspectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [fe/h] constraints. we find a bestestimate of the age of ~8.3 gyr while demonstrating that remaining ageuncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the cno abundances. the heliummass fraction is well constrained at y = 0.30 \pm 0.01 resulting in dy/dz ~ 1.4assuming that such a relation exists. during the analysis we firmly identifyblue straggler stars, including the star 2-17, and find indications for thepresence of their evolved counterparts. our analysis supports the rgb mass-lossfound from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass ofstars on the lower rgb, 1.15\pm0.02msun. this will be an important consistencycheck for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars.

1211.2052	cyanogen in ngc 1851 rgb and agb stars: quadrimodal distributions	the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851 has raised much interest since hstphotometry revealed that it hosts a double subgiant branch. here we report onour homogeneous study into the cyanogen (cn) bandstrengths in the rgbpopulation (17 stars) and agb population (21 stars) using aaomega/2df spectrawith r $\sim 3000$. we discover that ngc 1851 hosts a quadrimodal distributionof cn bandstrengths in its rgb and agb populations. this result supports themerger formation scenario proposed for this cluster, such that the cnquadrimodality could be explained by the superposition of two `normal' bimodalpopulations. a small sample overlap with an abundance catalogue allowed us totentatively explore the relationship between our cn populations and a range ofelemental abundances. we found a striking correlation between cn and [o/na]. wealso found that the four cn peaks may be paired -- the two cn-weakerpopulations being associated with low ba and the two cn-stronger populationswith high ba. if true then s-process abundances would be a good diagnostic fordisentangling the two original clusters in the merger scenario. moreobservations are needed to confirm the quadrimodality, and also therelationship between the subpopulations. we also report cn results for ngc 288as a comparison. our relatively large samples of agb stars show that bothclusters have a bias towards cn-weak agb populations.

1302.2393	the asymptotic giant branches of gcs: selective entry only	the handful of available observations of agb stars in galactic globularclusters suggest that the gc agb populations are dominated by cyanogen-weakstars. this contrasts strongly with the distributions in the rgb (and other)populations, which generally show a 50:50 bimodality in cn band strength. if itis true that the agb populations show very different distributions then itpresents a serious problem for low mass stellar evolution theory, since such asurface abundance change going from the rgb to agb is not predicted by stellarmodels. however this is only a tentative conclusion, since it is based on verysmall agb sample sizes. to test whether this problem really exists we havecarried out an observational campaign specifically targeting agb stars in gcs.we have obtained medium resolution spectra for about 250 agb stars across 9galactic gcs using the multi-object spectrograph on the aat (2df/aaomega). wepresent some of the preliminary findings of the study for the second parametertrio of gcs: ngc 288, ngc 362 and ngc 1851. the results indeed show that thereis a deficiency of stars with strong cn bands on the agb. to confirm that thisphenomenon is robust and not just confined to cn band strengths and theirvagaries, we have made observations using flames/vlt to measure elementalabundances for ngc 6752.we present some initial results from this study also.our sodium abundance results show conclusively that only a subset of stars ingcs experience the agb phase of evolution. this is the first direct, concreteconfirmation of the phenomenon.

1303.1184	a giant planet beyond the snow line in microlensing event  ogle-2011-blg-0251	we present the analysis of the gravitational microlensing eventogle-2011-blg-0251. this anomalous event was observed by several survey andfollow-up collaborations conducting microlensing observations towards thegalactic bulge. based on detailed modelling of the observed light curve, wefind that the lens is composed of two masses with a mass ratio q=1.9 x 10^-3.thanks to our detection of higher-order effects on the light curve due to theearth's orbital motion and the finite size of source, we are able to measurethe mass and distance to the lens unambiguously. we find that the lens is madeup of a planet of mass 0.53 +- 0.21,m_jup orbiting an m dwarf host star with amass of 0.26 +- 0.11 m_sun. the planetary system is located at a distance of2.57 +- 0.61 kpc towards the galactic centre. the projected separation of theplanet from its host star is d=1.408 +- 0.019, in units of the einstein radius,which corresponds to 2.72 +- 0.75 au in physical units. we also identified acompetitive model with similar planet and host star masses, but with a smallerorbital radius of 1.50 +- 0.50 au. the planet is therefore located beyond thesnow line of its host star, which we estimate to be around 1-1.5 au.

1303.5187	the sumo project i. a survey of multiple populations in globular  clusters	we present a general overview and the first results of the sumo project (asurvey of multiple populations in globular clusters). the objective of thissurvey is the study of multiple stellar populations in the largest sample ofglobular clusters homogeneously analysed to date. to this aim we obtained highsignal-to-noise (s/n&gt;50) photometry for main sequence stars with mass down to~0.5 m_sun in a large sample of clusters using both archival and proprietary u,b, v, and i data from ground-based telescopes. in this paper, we focus on theoccurrence of multiple stellar populations in twenty three clusters. we havedefined a new photometric index cubi= (u-b)-(b-i), that turns out to be veryeffective for identifying multiple sequences along the red giant branch (rgb).we found that in the v-cubi diagram all clusters presented in this paper showbroadened or multimodal rgbs, with the presence of two or more components. wefound a direct connection with the chemical properties of different sequences,that display different abundances of light elements (o, na, c, n, and al). thecubi index is also a powerful tool to identify distinct sequences of starsalong the horizontal branch and, for the first time in the case of ngc104 (47tuc), along the asymptotic giant branch. our results demonstrate that i) thepresence of more than two stellar populations is a common feature amongglobular clusters, as already highlighted in previous work; ii) multiplesequences with different chemical contents can be easily identified by usingstandard johnson photometry obtained with ground-based facilities; iii) in thestudy of gc multiple stellar populations the cubi index is alternative tospectroscopy, and has the advantage of larger statistics.

(correctedaccording to bonifacio et al.) interstellar dust maps. differential reddeningacross the face of the cluster, which we find to be present at the level ofdelta e(b-v) ~ 0.17 mag, is taken into account in our analysis. we measureseveral metallicity indicators based on the position of the red giant branch(rgb) in the cluster cmd. these give a metallicity of [fe/h] = -1.38 +/- 0.07in the zinn &amp; west scale and [fe/h] = -1.28 +/- 0.08 in the new carretta et al.(uves) scale. we also provide measurements of other important photometricparameters for this cluster, including the position of the rgb luminosityfunction "bump" and the horizontal branch (hb) morphology. we compare the ngc6402 ridgeline with the one for ngc 5904 (m5) derived by sandquist et al., andfind evidence that ngc 6402 and m5 have approximately the same age, to withinthe uncertainties -- although the possibility that m14 may be slighlty oldercannot be ruled out.

1307.7589	searching for solar-like oscillations in the delta scuti star rho puppis	despite the shallow convective envelopes of delta scuti pulsators, solar-likeoscillations are theoretically predicted to be excited in those stars as well.to search for such stochastic oscillations we organised a spectroscopicmulti-site campaign for the bright, metal-rich delta sct star rho puppis. weobtained a total of 2763 high-resolution spectra using four telescopes. wediscuss the reduction and analysis with the iodine cell technique, developedfor searching for low-amplitude radial velocity variations, in the presence ofhigh-amplitude variability. furthermore, we have determined the angulardiameter of rho puppis to be 1.68 \pm 0.03 mas, translating into a radius of3.52 \pm 0.07rsun. using this value, the frequency of maximum power of possiblesolar-like oscillations, is expected at ~43 \pm 2 c/d (498 \pm 23 muhz). thedominant delta scuti-type pulsation mode of rho puppis is known to be theradial fundamental mode which allows us to determine the mean density of thestar, and therefore an expected large frequency separation of 2.73 c/d (31.6muhz). we conclude that 1) the radial velocity amplitudes of the delta scutipulsations are different for different spectral lines; 2) we can excludesolar-like oscillations to be present in rho puppis with an amplitude perradial mode larger than 0.5 m/s.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

1310.2845	benefits of multiple sites for asteroseismic detections	while kepler has pushed the science of asteroseismology to limitsunimaginable a decade ago, the need for asteroseismic studies of individualobjects remains. this is primarily due to the limitations of single-colourintensity variations, which are much less sensitive to certain asteroseismicsignals. the best way to obtain the necessary data is via very high resolutionground-based spectrography. such observations measure the perceivedradial-velocity shifts that arise due to stellar oscillations, which exhibit amuch better signal-to-noise ratio than those for intensity observations. song,a proposed network of 1m telescopes with spectrographs that can reachr=110,000, was designed with this need in mind. with one node undercommissioning in tenerife and another under construction in china, an analysisof the scientific benefits of constructing additional nodes for the network iswarranted. by convolving models of asteroseismic observables (mean densities,small separations) with the anticipated window functions for different nodeconfigurations, we explore the impact of the number of nodes in the songnetwork on the anticipated results, across the areas of the hr diagram wheresolar-like oscillations are found. we find that although time series from twosong nodes, or in some cases even one node, will allow us to detectoscillations, the full song network, providing full temporal coverage, isneeded for obtaining the science goals of song, including analysis of modes ofspherical harmonic degree l=3.

0802.1782	spb stars in the open smc cluster ngc 371	pulsation in beta cep and spb stars are driven by the kappa mechanism whichdepends critically on the metallicity. it has therefore been suggested thatbeta cep and spb stars should be rare in the magellanic clouds which have lowermetallicities than the solar neighborhood. to test this prediction we haveobserved the open smc cluster ngc 371 for 12 nights in order to search for betacep and spb stars. surprisingly, we find 29 short-period b-type variables inthe upper part of the main sequence, many of which are probably spb stars. thisresult indicates that pulsation is still driven by the kappa mechanism even inlow metallicity environments. all the identified variables have periods longerthan the fundamental radial period which means that they cannot be beta cepstars. within an amplitude detection limit of 5 mmag no stars in the top of thehr-diagram show variability with periods shorter than the fundamental radialperiod. so if beta cep stars are present in the cluster they oscillate withamplitudes below 5 mmag, which is significantly lower than the mean amplitudeof beta cep stars in the galaxy. we see evidence that multimode pulsation ismore common in the upper part of the main sequence than in the lower. we havealso identified 5 eclipsing binaries and 3 periodic pulsating be stars in thecluster field.

astro-ph;0204332	the lithium content of the globular cluster ngc 6397	we make use of high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of 12turn-off stars in the metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397 to measure itslithium content. we conclude that they all have the same lithium abundancea(li) = 2.34 with a standard deviation of 0.056 dex. we use this result,together with monte carlo simulations, to estimate that the maximum allowedintrinsic scatter is of the order of 0.035 dex. this is a new stringentconstraint to be fulfilled by stellar models which predict li depletion. weargue that although a mild depletion of 0.1 -- 0.2 dex, as predicted by recentmodels, cannot be ruled out, there is no compelling reason for it. this fact,together with the good agreement with the li abundance observed in field stars,supports the primordial origin of lithium in metal-poor stars. taking the abovevalue as the primordial lithium abundance implies a cosmic baryonic densitywhich is either omega_b h^2 = 0.016 +/- 0.004 or omega_b h^2 = 0.005^{+0.0026}_{-0.0006}, from the predictions of standard big bangnucleosynthesis. the high baryonic density solution is in agreement with recentresults on the primordial abundance of deuterium and 3he and on the estimatesderived from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background.

astro-ph;0304475	hot hb stars in globular clusters - physical parameters and consequences  for theory. vi. the second parameter pair m 3 and m 13	we present the results of spectroscopic analyses of hot horizontal branch(hb) stars in m 13 and m 3, which form a famous ``second parameter'' pair. fromthe spectra and stroemgren photometry we derived -- for the first time in m 13-- atmospheric parameters (effective temperature and surface gravity). forstars with stroemgren temperatures between 10,000 and 12,000 k we foundexcellent agreement between the atmospheric parameters derived from stroemgrenphotometry and those derived from balmer line profile fits. however, for coolerstars there is a disagreement in the parameters derived by the two methods, forwhich we have no satisfactory explanation. stars hotter than 12,000 k showevidence for helium depletion and iron enrichment, both in m 3 and m 13.accounting for the iron enrichment substantially improves the agreement withcanonical evolutionary models, although the derived gravities and masses arestill somewhat too low. this remaining discrepancy may be an indication thatscaled-solar metal-rich model atmospheres do not adequately represent thehighly non-solar abundance ratios found in blue hb stars affected by diffusion.we discuss the effects of an enhancement in the envelope helium abundance onthe atmospheric parameters of the blue hb stars, as might be caused by deepmixing on the red giant branch or primordial pollution from an earliergeneration of intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars.

astro-ph;0311278	heavy elements abundances in turn-off stars and early subgiants in ngc  6752	high resolution spectra (r &gt; 40 000) for 9 main sequence turn-off stars and 9subgiants in the globular cluster ngc 6752 were acquired with uves on thevlt-kueyen (ut2). these data have been used to determine the abundances of someheavy elements (strontium, yttrium, barium and europium). this paper presentsfor the first time accurate results for heavy elements in this globularcluster. we did not find any systematic effect between the abundances found inturn-off stars, subgiants, and giants. we obtain the following mean abundancesfor these elements in our sample (turn-off stars and subgiants): [sr/fe] = 0.06+/- 0.16, [y/fe] = -0.01 +/- 0.12, [ba/fe] = 0.18 +/- 0.11, and [eu/fe] = 0.41+/- 0.09. the dispersion in the abundance ratios of the different elements islow and can be totally explained by uncertainties in their derivation. theseratios are in agreement with the values found in field halo stars with the samemetallicity. we did not observe any correlation between the [n-capture/fe]ratios and the star-to-star variations of the o and na abundances. the [ba/eu]and [sr/ba] ratios show clearly that this globular cluster has also beenuniformly enriched by r- and s-process synthesis.

astro-ph;0311458	empirically constrained color-temperature relations. ii. uvby	(abriged) a new grid of theoretical color indices for the stromgren uvbyphotometric system has been derived from marcs model atmospheres and ssgsynthetic spectra for cool dwarf and giant stars. at warmer temperatures thisgrid has been supplemented with the synthetic uvby colors from recent kuruczatmospheric models without overshooting. our transformations appear toreproduce the observed colors of extremely metal-poor turnoff and giant stars(i.e., [fe/h]&lt;-2). due to a number of assumptions made in the synthetic colorcalculations, however, our color-temperature relations for cool stars fail toprovide a suitable match to the uvby photometry of both cluster and field starshaving [fe/h]&gt;-2. to overcome this problem, the theoretical indices atintermediate and high metallicities have been corrected using a set of colorcalibrations based on field stars having accurate irfm temperature estimatesand spectroscopic [fe/h] values. encouragingly, isochrones that employ thetransformations derived in this study are able to reproduce the observed cmds(involving u-v, v-b, and b-y colors) for a number of open and globular clusters(including m92, m67, the hyades, and 47tuc) rather well. moreover, ourinterpretations of such data are very similar, if not identical, with thosegiven by vandenberg &amp; clem (2003, aj, 126, 778) from a consideration of bv(ri)cobservations for the same clusters. in the present investigation, we have alsoanalyzed the observed stromgren photometry for the classic population iisubdwarfs, compared our "final" (b-y)-teff relationship with those derivedempirically in a number of recent studies, and examined in some detail thedependence of the m1 index on [fe/h].

astro-ph;0402240	on the afterglow of the x-ray flash of july 23 2003: photometric  evidence for an off-axis gamma-ray burst with an associated supernova?	we present optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of the x-rayflash (xrf) of july 23 2003. our observations in the r-band cover the temporalrange from 4.2 h to 64 days after the high energy event. we also present theresults of multicolor imaging extending to the k-band on three epochs. thelightcurve of the r-band afterglow the first week after the burst is similar tothe lightcurve for long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a brokenpower-law with a late time slope of alpha=-2.0 (f_nu propto t^alpha).furthermore, the spectral energy distribution (sed) has a power-law (f_nupropto nu^beta) shape with slope beta=-1.0. however, the decay slope at t&lt;1 dayis shallow, consistent with zero. this is in qualitative agreement with theprediction that xrfs are off-axis classical grbs. after the first week there isa strong bump in the lightcurve, which peaks at around 16 days. the sed afterthe peak becomes significantly redder. we discuss the possible interpretationsof this bump, and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likelyexplanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of thesed. finally, we present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglowand in the bump phase. a firm upper limit of z=2.3 is placed on the redshift ofxrf030723 from the lack of ly-alpha forest lines in the spectrum of theafterglow. the lack of significant absorption and emission lines in either ofthe two spectra excludes a spectroscopic redshift determination.

0809.0317	atomic diffusion and mixing in old stars ii. observations of stars in  the globular cluster ngc 6397 with vlt/flames-giraffe	evolutionary trends in the surface abundances of heavier elements haverecently been identified in the globular cluster ngc 6397 ([fe/h]=-2),indicating the operation of atomic diffusion in these stars. such trendsconstitute important constraints for the extent to which diffusion modifies theinternal structure and surface abundances of solar-type, metal-poor stars. weperform an independent check of the reality and size of abundance variationswithin this metal-poor globular cluster. observational data covering a largestellar sample, located between the cluster turn-off point and the base of thered giant branch, are homogeneously analysed. the spectroscopic data wereobtained with the medium-high resolution spectrograph flames/giraffe onvlt-ut2. we derive independent effective-temperature scales from profilefitting of balmer lines and by applying colour-temperature calibrations tostr\"omgren uvby and broad-band bvi photometry. an automated spectral analysiscode is used together with a grid of marcs model atmospheres to derive stellarsurface abundances of mg, ca, ti, and fe. we identify systematically higheriron abundances for more evolved stars. the turn-off point stars are found tohave 0.13dex lower surface abundances of iron compared to the coolest, mostevolved stars in our sample. there is a strong indication of a similar trend inmagnesium, whereas calcium and titanium abundances are more homogeneous. withinreasonable error limits, the obtained abundance trends are in agreement withthe predictions of stellar structure models including diffusive processes(sedimentation, levitation), if additional turbulent mixing below the outerconvection zone is included.

astro-ph;0608201	a probable stellar solution to the cosmological lithium discrepancy	the measurement of the cosmic microwave background has strongly constrainedthe cosmological parameters of the universe. when the measured density ofbaryons (ordinary matter) is combined with standard big bang nucleosynthesiscalculations, the amounts of hydrogen, helium and lithium produced shortlyafter the big bang can be predicted with unprecedented precision. the predictedprimordial lithium abundance is a factor of two to three higher than the valuemeasured in the atmospheres of old stars. with estimated errors of 10 to 25%,this cosmological lithium discrepancy seriously challenges our understanding ofstellar physics, big bang nucleosynthesis or both. certain modifications tonucleosynthesis have been proposed, but found experimentally not to be viable.diffusion theory, however, predicts atmospheric abundances of stars to varywith time, which offers a possible explanation of the discrepancy. here wereport spectroscopic observations of stars in the metalpoor globular clusterngc 6397 that reveal trends of atmospheric abundance with evolutionary stagefor various elements. these element-specific trends are reproduced bystellar-evolution models with diffusion and turbulent mixing. we thus concludethat diffusion is predominantly responsible for the low apparent stellarlithium abundance in the atmospheres of old stars by transporting the lithiumdeep into the star.

astro-ph;0703111	oscillating blue stragglers, gamma doradus stars and eclipsing binaries  in the open cluster ngc2506	this is the first step in a project to combine studies of eclipsing binariesand oscillating stars to probe the interior of blue stragglers (bs). this mayimply a way to discriminate observationally between different birth mechanismsof bs stars. we study the open cluster ngc2506 which contains oscillating bsstars and detached eclipsing binaries for which accurate parameters can bederived. this will tightly constrain the cluster isochrone and provide anabsolute mass, radius and luminosity-scale for the cluster stars along with thecluster age, metallicity and distance. the present work focuses on obtainingthe light curves of the binaries and determine their orbital periods, onobtaining power spectra of the oscillating bs stars to select targets forfollow-up studies, and on searching for gamma doradus type variables which arealso expected to be present in the cluster. with a two-colour, dual-sitephotometric campaign we obtained 3120 ccd-images of ngc2506 spread over fourmonths. we analysed the bi time-series of the oscillating stars and usedsimulations to derive statistical uncertainties of the resulting frequencies,amplitudes and phases. a preliminary mode-identification was performed usingfrequency ratios for the oscillating bs stars, and amplitude ratios and phasedifferences for a population of newly detected gamma doradus stars. wequadrupled the number of known variables in ngc2506 by discovering 3 newoscillating bs stars, 15 gamma doradus stars and four new eclipsing binaries.the orbital periods of 2 known, detached eclipsing binaries were derived. wediscovered a bs star with both p-mode and g-mode variability and we confrontedour gamma doradus observations with state-of-the-art seismic models, but foundsignificant discrepancy between theory and observations.

astro-ph;9903120	hot horizontal-branch stars: the ubiquitous nature of the "jump" in  stromgren u, low gravities, and the role of radiative levitation of metals	a "jump" in the bhb distribution in the v, u-y cmd was recently detected inthe gc m13. it is morphologically best characterized as a discontinuity in u,u-y, with stars in the range 11,500&lt;teff(k)&lt;20,000 deviating systematicallyfrom (in the sense of appearing brighter and/or hotter than) canonical zahbs.we present u, y photometry of 14 gcs obtained with 3 different telescopes(danish, not, hst) and demonstrate that the u-jump is present in every gc whosehb extends beyond 11,500k, irrespective of [fe/h], mixing history on the rgb,and other gc parameters. we suggest that the u-jump is a ubiquitous feature,intrinsic to all hb stars hotter than 11,500k. we draw a parallel between theubiquitous nature of the u-jump and the problem of low measured gravities amongbhb stars. we note that the "logg-jump" occurs over the same temperature rangeas the u-jump, and that it occurs in every metal-poor gc for which gravitieshave been determined--irrespective of [fe/h], mixing history on the rgb, or anyother gc parameters. furthermore, the u-jump and the logg-jump are connected ona star-by-star basis. the two are likely different manifestations of the samephysical phenomenon. we present a framework which may simultaneously accountfor the u-jump and the logg-jump. reviewing spectroscopic data for severalfield bhb stars, as well as two bhb stars in the gc ngc 6752, we find evidencethat radiative levitation of heavy elements takes place at teff&gt;11,500 k,dramatically enhancing their abundances in the atmospheres of bhb stars in the"critical" temperature region. model atmospheres taking diffusion effects intoaccount are badly needed, and will likely lead to better overall agreementbetween canonical evolutionary theory and observations for bhb stars.

0809.4661	massive b-type pulsators in low-metallicity environments	massive b type pulsators such as beta cep and slowly pulsating b (spb) starspulsate due to layers of increased opacity caused by partial ionization. theincreased opacity blocks the energy flux to the surface of the stars whichcauses the layers to rise and the opacity to drop. this cyclical behavior makesthe star act as a heat engine and the star will thus pulsate. for beta cep andspb stars the increased opacity is believed to be caused by partial ionizationof iron and these stars should therefore contain non-insignificant quantitiesof the metal. a good test of this theory is to search for beta cep and spbstars in low-metallicity environments. if no stars are found the theory issupported, but on the other hand if a substantial number of beta cep and spbstars are found in these environments then the theory is not supported and asolutions needed. with a growing number of identified beta cep and spb stars inthe low-metallicity magellanic clouds we seem to be left with the second case.we will in this context discuss recent findings of beta cep and spb stars inthe magellanic clouds and some possible solutions to the discrepancy betweenthese observations and the theory. we also describe an ambitious project thatwe have initiated on the small magellanic cloud open cluster ngc 371 which willhelp to evaluate these solutions.

0810.2407	a new standard: age and distance for the open cluster ngc 6791 from the  eclipsing binary member v20	the detached eclipsing binary v20 in the old, metal--rich open cluster ngc6791 is studied in order to determine highly accurate masses and radii of itscomponents. this allows the cluster age to be established with high precision,using isochrones in the mass-radius diagram. we employ high-resolution uvesspectroscopy of v20 to determine the spectroscopic orbit and time-series v, iphotometry to obtain the photometric elements. the masses and radii of the v20components are found to be1.074+/-0.008msun and 1.399+/-0.016rsun (primary) and0.827+/-0.004msun and 0.768+/-0.006rsun (secondary). the primary is locatedalmost exactly at the hottest point along the cluster isochrone, and thesecondary is a ~7 times fainter main--sequence star. we determine an apparentcluster distance-modulus of (m-m)_v = 13.46+/-0.10 (average of primary andsecondary). the cluster age is obtained from comparisons with theoreticalisochrones in the mass--radius diagram. using the isochrones fromvictoria--regina with [fe/h] =+0.37 we find 7.7+/-0.5gyr, whereas theyonsei-yale (y2) isochrones lead to 8.2+/-0.5gyr, and basti isochrones to9.0+/-0.5gyr. in a mass-radius diagram, the 7.7gyr vrss and 9.0gyr bastiisochrones overlap nearly perfectly despite the age-difference. this modeldependence, which is significantly larger than the precision determined frommass, radius, and abundance uncertainties, prevents a definitiveage-determination of the cluster. by observing a suitable number of detachedeclipsing binaries in several open clusters it should be possible to calibratethe age--scale and provide firm constraints which stellar models mustreproduce.
