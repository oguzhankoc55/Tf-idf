0903.3415	galaxy zoo: a sample of blue early-type galaxies at low redshift	we report the discovery of a population of nearby, blue early-type galaxieswith high star formation rates (0.5 &lt; sfr &lt; 50 msun/yr). they are identified bytheir visual morphology as provided by galaxy zoo for sdss dr6 and their u-rcolour. we select a volume-limited sample in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt;0.05, corresponding to luminosities of approximately l* and above, and with u-rcolours significantly bluer than the red sequence. we confirm the early-typemorphology of the objects in this sample and investigate their environmentaldependence and star formation properties. blue early-type galaxies tend to livein lower-density environments than `normal' red sequence early-types and makeup 5.7 +/-0.4% of the low-redshift early-type galaxy population. we find thatsuch blue early-type galaxies are virtually absent at high velocity dispersionsabove 200 km/s. our analysis uses emission line diganostic diagrams and we findthat ~25% of them are actively starforming, while another ~25% host both starformation and an agn. another ~12% are agn. the remaining 38% show no strongemission lines. when present and uncontaminated by an agn contribution, thestar formation is generally intense. we consider star formation rates derivedfrom halpha, u-band and infrared luminosities, and radial colour profiles, andconclude that the star formation is spatially extended. of those objects thatare not currently undergoing star formation must have ceased doing so recentlyin order to account for their blue optical colours. the gas phase metallicityof the actively starforming blue early-types galaxies is supersolar in allcases. we discuss the place of these objects in the context of galaxyformation. a catalogue of all 204 blue early-type galaxies in our sample,including star formation rates and emission line classification, is provided.

0906.0994	galaxy zoo: a correlation between coherence of galaxy spin chirality and  star formation efficiency	we report on the finding of a correlation between galaxies' past starformation activity and the degree to which neighbouring galaxies rotation axesare aligned. this is obtained by cross-correlating star formation histories,derived with moped, and spin direction (chirality), as determined by the galaxyzoo project, for a sample of sdss galaxies. our findings suggest that spiralgalaxies which formed the majority of their stars early (z &gt; 2) tend to displaycoherent rotation over scales of ~10 mpc/h. the correlation is weaker forgalaxies with significant recent star formation. we find evidence for thisalignment at more than the 5-sigma level, but no correlation with other galaxystellar properties. this finding can be explained within the context ofhierarchical tidal-torque theory if the sdss galaxies harboring the majority ofthe old stellar population where formed in the past, in the same filament andat about the same time. galaxies with significant recent star formation insteadare in the field, thus influenced by the general tidal field that will alignthem in random directions or had a recent merger which would promote starformation, but deviate the spin direction.

0906.5304	galaxy zoo : 'hanny's voorwerp', a quasar light echo?	we report the discovery of an unusual object near the spiral galaxy ic 2497,discovered by visual inspection of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) as partof the galaxy zoo project. the object, known as hanny's voorwerp, is bright inthe sdss g band due to unusually strong oiii 4959-5007 emission lines. wepresent the results of the first targeted observations of the object in theoptical, uv and x-ray, which show that the object contains highly ionized gas.although the line ratios are similar to extended emission-line regions nearluminous agn, the source of this ionization is not apparent. the emission-lineproperties, and lack of x-ray emission from ic 2497, suggest either a highlyobscured agn with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of theobject but not the galaxy's own circumnuclear gas, or, as we argue, the firstdetection of a quasar light echo. in this case, either the luminosity of thecentral source has decreased dramatically or else the obscuration in the systemhas increased within 10^5 years. this object may thus represent the firstdirect probe of quasar history on these timescales.

0907.4155	galaxy zoo green peas: discovery of a class of compact extremely  star-forming galaxies	we investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as"green peas", first noted by volunteers in the galaxy zoo project because oftheir peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in sdss imaging.their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [o iii]5007 a, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to ~1000 a. we discuss awell-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are stronglystar forming, although there are some agn interlopers including 8 newlydiscovered narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies. the star-forming peas are low massgalaxies (m~10^8.5 - 10^10 m_sun) with high star formation rates (~10m_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[o/h] + 12 ~ 8.7) and low reddening (e(b-v) &lt;0.25) and they reside in low density environments. they have some of thehighest specific star formation rates (up to ~10^{-8} yr^{-1}) seen in thelocal universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds ofmyrs. the few star-forming peas with hst imaging appear to have several clumpsof bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that mayindicate recent or ongoing mergers. the peas are similar in size, mass,luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies. they are alsosimilar to high redshift uv-luminous galaxies, e.g., lyman-break galaxies andlyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which tostudy the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshiftgalaxies. studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essentialto understanding the build up of stellar mass in the universe.

0908.2033	galaxy zoo: reproducing galaxy morphologies via machine learning	we present morphological classifications obtained using machine learning forobjects in sdss dr6 that have been classified by galaxy zoo into three classes,namely early types, spirals and point sources/artifacts. an artificial neuralnetwork is trained on a subset of objects classified by the human eye and wetest whether the machine learning algorithm can reproduce the humanclassifications for the rest of the sample. we find that the success of theneural network in matching the human classifications depends crucially on theset of input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. the coloursand parameters associated with profile-fitting are reasonable in separating theobjects into three classes. however, these results are considerably improvedwhen adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. theadaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguishbetween early type galaxies and the point sources/artifacts. using a set oftwelve parameters, the neural network is able to reproduce the humanclassifications to better than 90% for all three morphological classes. we findthat using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade ourresults given our particular choice of the input parameters to the network. weconclude that it is promising to use machine- learning algorithms to performmorphological classification for the next generation of wide-field imagingsurveys and that the galaxy zoo catalogue provides an invaluable training setfor such purposes.

0910.0015	hierarchical models of high redshift galaxies with thermally pulsing  asymptotic giant branch stars: comparison with observations	in a recent paper we presented the first semi-analytic model of galaxyformation in which the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase ofstellar evolution has been fully implemented. here we address the comparisonwith observations, and show how the tp-agb recipe affects the performance ofthe model in reproducing the colours and near-ir luminosities of high-redshiftgalaxies. we find that the semi-analytic model with the tp-agb better matchesthe colour-magnitude and colour-colour relations at z ~ 2, both fornearly-passive and for star-forming galaxies. the model with tp-agb producesstar-forming galaxies with red v-k colours, thus revising the uniqueinterpretation of high-redshift red objects as 'red &amp; dead'. we also show thatwithout the tp-agb the semi-analytic model fails at reproducing the observedcolours, a situation that cannot be corrected by dust reddening. we alsoexplore the effect of nebular emission on the predicted colour-magnituderelation of star-forming galaxies, to conclude that it does not play asignificant role in reddening their colours, at least in the range ofstar-formation rates covered by the model. finally, the rest-frame k-bandluminosity function at z ~ 2.5 is more luminous by almost 1 magnitude. thisindicates that the agn feedback recipe that is adopted to regulate thehigh-mass end of the luminosity function should be sophisticated to take theeffect of the stellar populations into account at high redshifts.

0912.0259	environment and self-regulation in galaxy formation	the environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxiesconsiderably best visible through the well-known morphology-densityrelationship. in this paper we study the effect of environment on the evolutionof early-type galaxies by analysing the stellar population properties of 3,360galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the sdss in theredshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.06. we find that the distribution of ages is bimodalwith a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ~2.5gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. this is analogue to 'redsequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containingboth early and late type galaxies. the fraction of the young, rejuvenatedgalaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasingenvironmental density up to about 45 per cent. the rejuvenated galaxies havelower alpha/fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoingstar formation through their emission line spectra. all objects that host agnin their centres without star formation are part of the red sequencepopulation. we confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results thatluminosity weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha/fe element ratios of the redsequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass.most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive toenvironmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. we infer thatearly-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billionyears ago around z~0.2. a self-regulated formation phase without environmentaldependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which theenvironment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy interactions.

1001.1744	galaxy zoo: dust in spirals	we investigate the effect of dust on spiral galaxies by measuring theinclination-dependence of optical colours for 24,276 well-resolved sdssgalaxies visually classified in galaxy zoo. we find clear trends of reddeningwith inclination which imply a total extinction from face-on to edge-on of 0.7,0.6, 0.5 and 0.4 magnitudes for the ugri passbands. we split the sample into"bulgy" (early-type) and "disky" (late-type) spirals using the sdss fracdev (orf_dev) parameter and show that the average face-on colour of "bulgy" spirals isredder than the average edge-on colour of "disky" spirals. this shows that theobserved optical colour of a spiral galaxy is determined almost equally by thespiral type (via the bulge-disk ratio and stellar populations), and reddeningdue to dust. we find that both luminosity and spiral type affect the totalamount of extinction, with "disky" spirals at m_r ~ -21.5 mags having the mostreddening. this decrease of reddening for the most luminous spirals has notbeen observed before and may be related to their lower levels of recent starformation. we compare our results with the latest dust attenuation models oftuffs et al. we find that the model reproduces the observed trends reasonablywell but overpredicts the amount of u-band attenuation in edge-on galaxies. weend by discussing the effects of dust on large galaxy surveys and emphasizethat these effects will become important as we push to higher precisionmeasurements of galaxy properties and their clustering.

1001.3141	galaxy zoo: the fundamentally different co-evolution of supermassive  black holes and their early- and late-type host galaxies	we use data from the sloan digital sky survey and visual classifications ofmorphology from the galaxy zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearbyuniverse (z &lt; 0.05) and to break down the agn host galaxy population by color,stellar mass and morphology. we find that black hole growth at luminositiesl_oiii &gt;1e40 erg/s in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different.agn host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses(1e10-1e11 msun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram andtheir central black holes have median masses around 1e6.5 msun. however, bycomparing early- and late-type agn host galaxies to their non-activecounterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it ispreferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that aregrowing, while late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive}blackholes that are growing. the duty cycle of agn in early-type galaxies isstrongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1e10 msun) of thered sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloudprogenitors. the duty cycle of agn in late-type galaxies on the other handpeaks in massive (1e11 msun) green and red late-types which generally do nothave a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. at high eddingtonratios (l/l_edd &gt; 0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of agnare the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. finally, the milky waylikely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the agn dutycycle of late-type galaxies is highest. we discuss the implications of theseresults for our understanding of the role of agn in the evolution of galaxies

1003.0449	galaxy zoo: bars in disk galaxies	we present first results from galaxy zoo 2, the second phase of the highlysuccessful galaxy zoo project (www.galaxyzoo.org). using a volume-limitedsample of 13665 disk galaxies (0.01&lt; z &lt; 0.06 and m_r&lt;-19.38), we study thefraction of galaxies with bars as a function of global galaxy properties likecolour, luminosity and bulge prominence. overall, 29.4+/-0.5% of galaxies inour sample have a bar, in excellent agreement with previous visually classifiedsamples of galaxies (although this overall fraction is lower than measured byautomated bar-finding methods). we see a clear increase in the bar fractionwith redder (g-r) colours, decreased luminosity and in galaxies with moreprominent bulges, to the extent that over half of the red, bulge-dominated,disk galaxies in our sample possess a bar. we see evidence for a colourbi-modality for our sample of disk galaxies, with a "red sequence" that is bothbulge and bar-dominated, and a "blue cloud" which has little, or no, evidencefor a (classical) bulge or bar. these results are consistent with similartrends for barred galaxies seen recently both locally and at higher redshift,and with early studies using the rc3. we discuss these results in the contextof internal (secular) galaxy evolution scenarios and the possible links to theformation of bars and bulges in disk galaxies.

1003.4018	the role of mergers in early-type galaxy evolution and black hole growth	models of galaxy formation invoke the major merger of gas-rich progenitorgalaxies as the trigger for significant phases of black hole growth and theassociated feedback that suppresses star formation to create red spheroidalremnants. however, the observational evidence for the connection betweenmergers and active galactic nucleus (agn) phases is not clear. we analyze asample of low-mass early-type galaxies known to be in the process of migratingfrom the blue cloud to the red sequence via an agn phase in the green valley.using deeper imaging from sdss stripe 82, we show that the fraction of objectswith major morphological disturbances is high during the early starburst phase,but declines rapidly to the background level seen in quiescent early-typegalaxies by the time of substantial agn radiation several hundred myr after thestarburst. this observation empirically links the agn activity in low-redshiftearly-type galaxies to a significant merger event in the recent past. the largetime delay between the merger-driven starburst and the peak of agn activityallows for the merger features to decay to the background and hence may explainthe weak link between merger features and agn activity in the literature.

1003.5214	empirical calibrations of optical absorption line indices based on the  stellar library miles	stellar population models of absorption line indices are an important toolfor the analysis of stellar population spectra. they are most accuratelymodelled through empirical calibrations of absorption line indices with thestellar parameters effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity, theso-called fitting functions. here we present new empirical fitting functionsfor the 25 optical lick absorption line indices based on the new stellarlibrary miles. the major improvements with respect to the lick/ids library arethe better sampling of stellar parameter space, a generally higher signal-to-noise, and a careful flux calibration. in fact we find that errors onindividual index measurements in miles are considerably smaller than inlick/ids. instead we find the rms of the residuals between the final fittingfunctions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters. weprovide fitting functions for both lick/ids and miles spectral resolutions, andcompare our results with other fitting functions in the literature. a fortran90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellarpopulation models. we further calculate the offsets in index measurementsbetween the lick/ids system to a flux calibrated system. for this purpose weuse the three libraries miles, elodie, and stelib. we find that offsets arenegligible in some cases, most notably for the widely used indices hbeta, mgb,fe5270, and fe5335. in a number of cases, however, the difference between fluxcalibrated library and lick/ids is significant with the offsets depending onindex strengths. interestingly, there is no general agreement between the threelibraries for a large number of indices, which hampers the derivation of auniversal offset between the lick/ids and flux calibrated systems.

1006.0229	the hierarchical build-up of the tully-fisher relation	we use the semi-analytic model galics to predict the tully-fisher relation inthe b, i and for the first time, in the k band, and its evolution withredshift, up to z~1. we refined the determination of the disk galaxies rotationvelocity, with a dynamical recipe for the rotation curve, rather than a simpleconversion from the total mass to maximum velocity. the new recipe takes intoaccount the disk shape factor, and the angular momentum transfer occurringduring secular evolution leading to the formation of bulges. this producesmodel rotation velocities that are lower by ~20-25% for the majority of thespirals. we implemented stellar population models with a complete treatment ofthe tp-agb, which leads to a revision of the mass-to-light ratio in thenear-ir. i/k band luminosities increase by ~0.3/0.5 mags at redshift z=0 and by~0.5/1 mags at z=3. with these two new recipes in place, the comparison betweenthe predicted tully-fisher relation with a series of datasets in the opticaland near-ir, at redshifts between 0 and 1, is used as a diagnostics of theassembly and evolution of spiral galaxies in the model. at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2 the matchbetween the new model and data is remarkably good, especially for later-typespirals (sb/sc). at z=0 the new model shows a net improvement in comparisonwith its original version of 2003, and in accord with recent observations inthe k band, the model tully-fisher also shows a morphological differentiation.however, in all bands the z=0 model tully-fisher is too bright. we argue thatthis behaviour is caused by inadequate star formation histories in the modelgalaxies at low redshifts. the star-formation rate declines too slowly, due tocontinuous gas infall that is not efficiently suppressed. an analysis of themodel disk scale lengths, at odds with observations, hints to some missingphysics in the modeling of disk formation inside dark matter halos.

1010.4569	flux-calibrated stellar population models of lick absorption-line  indices with variable element abundance ratios	we present new stellar population models of lick absorption-line indices withvariable element abundance ratios. the models are based on our new calibrationsof absorption-line indices with stellar parameters derived from the milesstellar library. the key novelty compared to our previous models is that theyare now available at the higher spectral resolution of miles (~2.7a fwhm) andflux-calibrated, hence not tied anymore to the lick/ids system. this isessential for the interpretation of galaxy spectra where calibration stars arenot available, such as large galaxy redshift surveys or other high-redshiftobservations. we note that the miles resolution appears to be comparable tosdss resolution, so that our models can be applied to sdss data without anycorrections for instrumental spectral resolution. for the first time we providerandom errors for the model predictions based on the uncertainties in thecalibration functions and the underlying stellar parameter estimates. we showthat random errors are small except at the edges of the parameter space(high/low metallicities and young ages &lt;1 gyr) where the stellar library isunder-sampled. we calibrate the base model for the parameters age, metallicityand alpha/fe ratio with galactic globular cluster and galaxy gradient data. wediscuss two model flavours with different input stellar evolutionary tracksfrom the frascati and padova groups. the new model release now includesabundance variations of the elements c, n, mg, na, si, ca, ti, cr, and fe. theindividual elements that are best accessible with these models and the standardset of lick absorption features are c, n, mg, ca, ti, and fe. the model data isavailable at www.icg.port.ac.uk/~thomasd.

1010.4570	chemical abundance ratios of galactic globular clusters from modelling  integrated light spectroscopy	we use our new, flux-calibrated stellar population model of absorption-lineindices to derive ages, metallicities, and various element abundance ratiosfrom integrated light spectroscopy of galactic globular clusters. the agesagree well with the literature and are all consistent with the age of theuniverse. there is a considerable scatter, though, and we obtain systematicallylarger ages than cmd determinations mostly for metal-rich globular clusters.the metallicities agree well with literature values on the zinn &amp; west scale,if we adopt iron abundance [fe/h] for those clusters whose ages agree with thecmd ages. it turns out that the derivation of individual element abundanceratios is not reliable at [fe/h]&lt;-1 dex, while the [alpha/fe] ratio is robustat all metallicities. we find general enhancement of light and alpha elements,as expected, with significant variations for some elements. the elements o andmg follow the same general enhancement with almost identical distributions of[o/fe] and [mg/fe]. we obtain slightly lower [c/fe] and very high [n/fe]ratios, instead. this chemical anomaly, commonly attributed to self-enrichment,is well known in globular clusters from individual stellar spectroscopy. it isthe first time that this pattern is obtained also from the integrated light.the alpha elements follow a pattern such that the heavier elements ca and tiare less enhanced. more specifically, the [ca/fe] and [ti/fe] ratios are lowerthan [o/fe] and [mg/fe] by about 0.2 dex. this trend is also seen in recentdeterminations of element abundances in globular cluster and field stars of themilky way. this suggests that type ia supernovae contribute significantly tothe enrichment of the heavier alpha elements as predicted by nucleosynthesiscalculations and galactic chemical evolution models.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.5099	and the winner is: galaxy mass	the environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxiesconsiderably best visible through the well-known morphology-densityrelationship. we study the effect of environment on the evolution of early-typegalaxies for a sample of 3,360 galaxies morphologically selected by visualinspection from the sdss in the redshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.06, and analyseluminosity-weighted age, metallicity, and alpha/fe ratio as function ofenvironment and galaxy mass. we find that on average 10 per cent of early-typegalaxies are rejuvenated through minor recent star formation. this fractionincreases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing environmentaldensity. however, the bulk of the population obeys a well-defined scaling ofage, metallicity, and alpha/fe ratio with galaxy mass that is independent ofenvironment. our results contribute to the growing evidence in the recentliterature that galaxy mass is the major driver of galaxy formation. even themorphology-density relationship may actually be mass-driven, as the consequenceof an environment dependent characteristic galaxy mass coupled with the factthat late-type galaxy morphologies are more prevalent in low-mass galaxies.

0709.3015	observational evidence for agn feedback in early-type galaxies	a major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is theinclusion of so-called agn feedback. the energy input from an active centralmassive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxiesat later epochs. a major problem is that this process is poorly understood, andcompelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. insearch for signatures of agn feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 from the sdss database.key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterionthrough visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased againstrecent star formation and nuclear activity. the objects with emission (~20 percent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in thecolour-mass diagram. star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, whileearly-types with agn are located considerably closer to and almost on the redsequence. star formation-agn composites are found right between these twoextremes. we further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novelmethod that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-uv to near-ir andstellar absorption indices. we find that in those objects deviating from thered sequence star formation occurred several 100 myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. we identify an evolutionary sequence fromstar formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. this transition processlasts about 1 gyr, and the peak agn phase occurs roughly half a gyr after thestarburst. the most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressedby nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.

1104.5394	galaxy zoo: bar lengths in nearby disk galaxies	we present an analysis of bar length measurements of 3150 local galaxies in avolume limited sample of low redshift (z &lt; 0.06) disk galaxies. barred galaxieswere initially selected from the galaxy zoo 2 project, and the lengths andwidths of the bars were manually drawn by members of the galaxy zoo communityusing a google maps interface. bars were measured independently by differentobservers, multiple times per galaxy (&gt;=3), and we find that observers wereable to reproduce their own bar lengths to 3% and each others' to better than20%. we find a "color bimodality" in our disk galaxy population with barlength, i.e., longer bars inhabit redder disk galaxies and the bars themselvesare redder, and that the bluest galaxies host the smallest galactic bars (&lt; 5kpc/h). we also find that bar and disk colors are clearly correlated, and forgalaxies with small bars, the disk is, on average, redder than the bar colors,while for longer bars the bar then itself is redder, on average, than the disk.we further find that galaxies with a prominent bulge are more likely to hostlonger bars than those without bulges. we categorise our galaxy populations byhow the bar and/or ring are connected to the spiral arms. we find that galaxieswhose bars are directly connected to the spiral arms are preferentially bluerand that these galaxies host typically shorter bars. within the scatter, wefind that stronger bars are found in galaxies which host a ring (and only aring). the bar length and width measurements used herein are made publiclyavailable for others to use (http://data.galaxyzoo.org).

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1106.3331	the morphology of galaxies in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic  survey	we study the morphology of luminous and massive galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.7targeted in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) using publiclyavailable hubble space telescope imaging from cosmos. our sample (240 objects)provides a unique opportunity to check the visual morphology of these galaxieswhich were targeted based solely on stellar population modelling. we find thatthe majority (74+/-6%) possess an early-type morphology (elliptical or s0),while the remainder have a late-type morphology. this is as expected from thegoals of the boss target selection which aimed to predominantly select slowlyevolving galaxies, for use as cosmological probes, while still obtaining a fairfraction of actively star forming galaxies for galaxy evolution studies. weshow that a colour cut of (g-i)&gt;2.35 selects a sub-sample of boss galaxies with90% early-type morphology - more comparable to the earlier luminous red galaxy(lrg) samples of sdss-i/ii. the remaining 10% of galaxies above this cut have alate-type morphology and may be analogous to the "passive spirals" found atlower redshift. we find that 23+/-4% of the early-type galaxies are unresolvedmultiple systems in the sdss imaging. we estimate that at least 50% of theseare real associations (not projection effects) and may represent a significant"dry merger" fraction. we study the sdss pipeline sizes of boss galaxies whichwe find to be systematically larger (by 40%) than those measured from hstimages, and provide a statistical correction for the difference. these detailsof the boss galaxies will help users of the data fine-tune their selectioncriteria, dependent on their science applications. for example, the main goalof boss is to measure the cosmic distance scale and expansion rate of theuniverse to percent-level precision - a point where systematic effects due tothe details of target selection may become important.

1108.0635	galaxy and mass assembly: stellar mass estimates	this paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically-derived stellarmass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z &lt; 0.65) galaxies in the galaxy andmass assembly (gama) spectroscopic redshift survey. these masses, as well asthe full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public aspart of gama data release 2. although the gama database does include nirphotometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fitsis significantly poorer when these nir data are included. further, for a largefraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from theoptical-plus-nir photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred fromthe optical data alone. this may indicate problems in our stellar populationlibrary, or nir data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for futureversions of the catalogue. for now, we have chosen to base our stellar massestimates on optical photometry only. in light of our decision to ignore theavailable nir data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained basedon optical data alone. we use generic properties of stellar populationsynthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle avery good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, m*/li. further, we use theobserved relation between restframe (g-i) and m*/li for real gama galaxies toargue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves,(g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate m*/li to an accuracy of &lt; ~0.1dex. this 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-m*/li relation offers a simple andtransparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimaldata, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their resultsto z &lt; ~0.4 measurements from gama.

1112.0322	chemical element ratios of sdss early-type galaxies	we discuss chemical enrichments of ~4000 sdss early-type galaxies using astracers the element abundance ratios [c/fe], [n/fe], [o/fe], [mg/fe], [ca/fe]and [ti/fe]. we utilise the stellar population models of absorption lineindices from thomas, maraston &amp; johansson (2011) which are based on the milesstellar library. we confirm previous results of increasing age, [z/h] and[o/fe] ratios (most often represented by [{\alpha}/fe] in the literature) withvelocity dispersion. we further derive identical correlations with velocitydispersion for the abundance ratios [o/fe], [mg/fe] and [c/fe], implying thatc/mg and c/o are close to solar values. this sets a lower limit on theformation time-scales and star-burst components of early-type galaxies to ~0.4gyr, which is the lifetime of a 3msun star, since the full c enrichment must bereached. [n/fe] correlates with velocity dispersion, but offset to lower valuesand with a steeper slope compared to the other element ratios. we do not findany environmental dependencies for the abundances of c and n, contrary toprevious reports in the literature. [fe/h] does not correlate with velocitydispersion over the entire parameter range covered, but for fixed age we find asteep trend for the [fe/h]-{\sigma} relation. this trend is weaker than theanalogous for total metallicity (which also shows steeper trends at fixed age)owing to the lower fe contribution from sn ia for more massive early-typegalaxies. we find [ca/fe] ratios that are close to solar values over the entirevelocity dispersion range covered. tentative, due to large scatter, the resultsfor [ti/fe] indicate that ti follows the trends of ca. this implies asignificant contribution from sn ia to the enrichment of heavy{\alpha}-elements and puts strong constraints on supernova nucleosynthesis andmodels of galactic chemical evolution.

1202.6241	the progenitors of present-day massive red galaxies up to z ~ 0.7 -  finding passive galaxies using sdss-i/ii and sdss-iii	we present a comprehensive study of 250,000 galaxies targeted by the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) up to z ~ 0.7 with the specific goal ofidentifying and characterising a population of galaxies that has evolvedwithout significant merging. we compute a likelihood that each boss galaxy is aprogenitor of the luminous red galaxies (lrgs) sample, targeted by sdss-i/ii upz ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of lrgs and their inferred star-formationhistories, metallicity histories and dust content. we determine merger rates,luminosity growth rates and the evolution of the large-scale clustering betweenthe two surveys, and we investigate the effect of using different stellarpopulation synthesis models in our conclusions. we demonstrate that our sampleis slowly evolving (of the order of 2 +/- 1.5% per gyr by merging). ourconclusions refer to the bright and massive end of the galaxy population, withmi0.55 &lt; -22, and m* &gt; 1e11.2 msolar, corresponding roughly to 95% and 40% ofthe lrgs and boss galaxy populations, respectively. our analysis further showsthat any possible excess of flux in boss galaxies, when compared to lrgs, frompotentially unresolved targets at z ~ 0.55 must be less than 1% in ther0.55-band (approximately equivalent to the g-band in the rest-frame ofgalaxies at z=0.55). when weighting the boss galaxies based on the predictedproperties of the lrgs, and restricting the analysis to the reddest bossgalaxies, we find an evolution of the large-scale clustering that is consistentwith dynamical passive evolution, assuming a standard cosmology. we concludethat our likelihoods give a weighted sample that is as clean and as close topassive evolution (in dynamical terms, i.e. no or negligible merging) aspossible, and that is optimal for cosmological studies.

1203.6641	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: measurements of the growth of structure and expansion  rate at z=0.57 from anisotropic clustering	we analyze the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) datarelease 9 (dr9) sample, which consists of 264,283 galaxies in the redshiftrange 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 spanning 3,275 square degrees. both peculiar velocitiesand errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ("alcock-paczynskieffect") generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientationwith respect to the line-of-sight. together with the sharp baryon acousticoscillation (bao) standard ruler, our measurements of the broadband shape ofthe monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain thecomoving angular diameter distance (2190 +/- 61 mpc) to z=0.57, the hubbleexpansion rate at z=0.57 (92.4 +/- 4.5 km/s/mpc), and the growth rate ofstructure at that same redshift (d sigma8/d ln a = 0.43 +/- 0.069). ouranalysis provides the best current direct determination of both da and h ingalaxy clustering data using this technique. if we further assume a lcdmexpansion history, our growth constraint tightens to d sigma8/d ln a = 0.415+/- 0.034. in combination with the cosmic microwave background, ourmeasurements of da, h, and growth all separately require dark energy at z &gt;0.57, and when combined imply \omega_{\lambda} = 0.74 +/- 0.016, independent ofthe universe's evolution at z&lt;0.57. in our companion paper (samushia et al.prep), we explore further cosmological implications of these observations.

1206.3797	the history and environment of a faded quasar: hubble space telescope  observations of hanny's voorwerp and ic 2497	we present hubble space telescope imaging and spectroscopy for the extendedhigh-ionization cloud known as hanny's voorwerp, near the spiral galaxy ic2497. wfc3 images show complex dust absorption near the nucleus of ic 2497.stis spectra show a type 2 seyfert agn of rather low luminosity. the ionizationparameter log u = -3.5 is in accord with its weak x-ray emission. we find nohigh-ionization gas near the nucleus, adding to evidence that the agn iscurrently at low radiative output (perhaps now dominated by kinetic energy).the nucleus is accompanied by an expanding ring of ionized gas 500 pc inprojected diameter on the side opposite hanny's voorwerp, with doppler offset300 km/s from the nucleus (kinematic age &lt; 7 x10^5 years). [o iii] and h-alpha+ [n ii] images show fine structure in hanny's voorwerp, with limb-brightenedsections and small areas where h-alpha is strong. we identify these as regionsionized by recent star formation, in contrast to the agn ionization of theentire cloud. these candidate "normal" h ii regions contain blue continuumobjects, whose colors are consistent with young stellar populations; theyappear only in a 2-kpc region toward ic 2497 in projection. theionization-sensitive ratio [o iii]/h-alpha shows no discernible pattern nearthe prominent "hole" in the ionized gas. the independence of ionization andsurface brightness suggests that substantial spatial structure remainsunresolved, to such an extent that the surface brightness sample the number ofdenser filaments rather than the characteristic density in emission regions.these results fit with our picture of an ionization echo from an agn whoseionizing luminosity has dropped by a factor &gt; 100 (and possibly much more)within the last 1-2 x 10^5 years; we suggest a sequence of events and discussimplications of such rapid fluctuations for agn demographics.

1207.4321	investigating emission line galaxy surveys with the sloan digital sky  survey telescope	the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in the power spectrum ofgalaxies provides a standard ruler to probe the accelerated expansion of theuniverse. the current surveys covering a comoving volume sufficient to unveilthe bao scale are limited to redshift $z \lesssim 0.7$. in this paper, we studyseveral galaxy selection schemes aiming at building an emission-line-galaxy(elg) sample in the redshift range $0.6&lt;z&lt;1.7$, that would be suitable forfuture bao studies using the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)spectrograph on the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) telescope. we explore twodifferent colour selections using both the sdss and the canada france hawaitelescope legacy survey (cfht-ls) photometry in the u, g, r, and i bands andevaluate their performance selecting luminous elg. from about 2,000 elg, weidentified a selection scheme that has a 75 percent redshift measurementefficiency. this result confirms the feasibility of massive elg surveys usingthe boss spectrograph on the sdss telescope for a bao detection at redshift$z\sim1$, in particular the proposed eboss experiment, which plans to use thesdss telescope to combine the use of the bao ruler with redshift spacedistortions using emission line galaxies and quasars in the redshift$0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2$.

1207.6114	stellar masses of sdss-iii boss galaxies at z~0.5 and constraints to  galaxy formation models	we calculate stellar masses for massive luminous galaxies at redshift 0.2-0.7using the first two years of data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energydistributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies areused to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. accurateboss spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. we find that thedistribution of stellar masses in boss is narrow (delta log m~0.5 dex) andpeaks at about logm ~ 11.3 (for a kroupa initial stellar mass function), andthat the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, inagreement with the intended boss target selection. the galaxy masses probed byboss extend over ~10^{12} m, providing unprecedented measurements of thehigh-mass end of the galaxy mass function. we find that the galaxy numberdensity above ~ 2.5 10^{11} m agrees with previous determinations. we perform acomparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the bosstarget selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. the abundanceof massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the boss data, butthe models lack galaxies at the massive end. moreover, no evolution withredshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance ofmassive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. additionally, bossdata display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in thelocal universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. on the otherhand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span anarrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. we argue that thelack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly dueto metallicity, which is too low in the models.

1209.1204	the evolution of brightest cluster galaxies in a hierarchical universe	we investigate the evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) fromredshift z~1.6 to z~0. we use the semi-analytic model of croton et al. (2006)with a new spectro-photometric model based on the maraston (2005) stellarpopulations and a new recipe for the dust extinction. we compare the modelpredictions of the k-band luminosity evolution and the j-k, v-i and i-k colourevolution with a series of datasets, including collins et al. (nature, 2009)who argued that semi-analytic models based on the millennium simulation cannotreproduce the red colours and high luminosity of bcgs at z&gt;1. we show insteadthat the model is well in range of the observed luminosity and correctlyreproduces the colour evolution of bcgs in the whole redshift range up toz~1.6. we argue that the success of the semi-analytic model is in large partdue to the implementation of a more sophisticated spectro-photometric model. ananalysis of the model bcgs shows an increase in mass by a factor ~2 since z~1,and star formation activity down to low redshifts. while the consensusregarding bcgs is that they are passively evolving, we argue that thisconclusion is affected by the degeneracy between star formation history andstellar population models used in sed-fitting, and by the inefficacy oftoy-models of passive evolution to capture the complexity of real galaxies,expecially those with rich merger histories like bcgs. following this argument,we also show that in the semi-analytic model the bcgs show a realistic mix ofstellar populations, and that these stellar populations are mostly old. inaddition, the age-redshift relation of the model bcgs follows that of theuniverse, meaning that given their merger history and star formation history,the ageing of bcgs is always dominated by the ageing of their stellarpopulations. in a lambdacdm universe, we define such evolution as "passive inthe hierarchical sense".

1211.1386	sne ia host galaxy properties from sloan digital sky survey-ii  spectroscopy	we study the stellar populations of sne ia host galaxies using sdss-iispectroscopy. we focus on the relationships of sne ia properties with stellarvelocity dispersion and the stellar population parameters age, metallicity andelement abundance ratios derived by fitting absorption line indices to stellarpopulation models. we concentrate on a sub-sample of 84 sne ia from the sdss-iisupernova survey. in agreement with previous findings, we find that salt2stretch factor values show the strongest dependence on stellar population age.hence, sne ia peak-luminosity is closely related to the age of the stellarprogenitor systems, where more luminous sne ia appear in younger stellarpopulations. we find no statistically significant trends in the hubble residualwith any of the stellar population parameters studied, including age andmetallicity contrary to the literature, as well as with stellar velocitydispersion. moreover, we find that the method of stellar mass derivation isaffecting the hubble residual-mass relationship when lower number statisticsare used. we extend the sample to also include sne ia with available sdss hostgalaxy photometry only. for this larger sample (247 objects) the reportedhubble residual-mass relation is strongly dependent on the stellar mass rangestudied and behaves as a step function. in the high mass regime, probed by ourhost spectroscopy sample, the relation between hubble residual and stellar massis flat. below a stellar mass of ~2x10^10 msun, i.e. close to the evolutionarytransition mass of low-redshift galaxies reported in the literature, the trendchanges dramatically such that lower mass galaxies possess lower luminosity sneia after light-curve corrections. this non-linear behaviour of the hubbleresidual-mass relationship should be accounted for when using stellar mass as afurther parameter for minimising the hubble residuals.

1211.3741	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: weighing the neutrino mass using the galaxy power  spectrum of the cmass sample	we measure the sum of the neutrino particle masses using thethree-dimensional galaxy power spectrum of the sdss-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9 (dr9) cmass galaxy sample. combinedwith the cosmic microwave background (cmb), supernova (sn) and additionalbaryonic acoustic oscillation (bao) data, we find upper 95 percent confidencelimits of the neutrino mass $\sigma m_{\nu}&lt;0.340$ ev within a flat$\lambda$cdm background, and $\sigma m_{\nu}&lt;0.821$ ev, assuming a more generalbackground cosmological model. the number of neutrino species is measured to be$n_{\rm eff}=4.308\pm0.794$ and $n_{\rm eff}=4.032^{+0.870}_{-0.894}$ for thesetwo cases respectively. we study and quantify the effect of several factors onthe neutrino measurements, including the galaxy power spectrum bias model, theeffect of redshift-space distortion, the cutoff scale of the power spectrum,and the choice of additional data. the impact of neutrinos with unknown masseson other cosmological parameter measurements is investigated. the fractionalmatter density and the hubble parameter are measured to be$\omega_m=0.2796\pm0.0097$, $h_0=69.72^{+0.90}_{-0.91}$ km/s/mpc (flat$\lambda$cdm) and $\omega_m=0.2798^{+0.0132}_{-0.0136}$,$h_0=73.78^{+3.16}_{-3.17}$ km/s/mpc (more general background model). based ona chevallier-polarski-linder (cpl) parametrisation of the equation-of-state $w$of dark energy, we find that $w=-1$ is consistent with observations, evenallowing for neutrinos. similarly, the curvature \omega_k and the running ofthe spectral index $\alpha_s$ are both consistent with zero. thetensor-to-scaler ratio is constrained down to $r&lt;0.198$ (95 percent cl, flat$\lambda$ cdm) and $r&lt;0.440$ (95 percent cl, more general background model).

1212.1211	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: luminosity and color dependence and redshift evolution	we measure the luminosity and color dependence and the redshift evolution ofgalaxy clustering in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey ninth data release. we focus on the projected two-pointcorrelation function (2pcf) of subsets of its cmass sample, which includesabout 260,000 galaxies over ~3,300 sq. deg in the redshift range 0.43&lt;z&lt;0.7. tominimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-definedluminosity and color subsamples by carefully accounting for the cmass galaxyselection cuts. the 2pcf of the whole cmass sample, if approximated by apower-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\pm0.06mpc/h and an index of\gamma=1.85\pm0.01. clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are foundfor the projected 2pcf in all redshift bins, with more luminous and reddergalaxies generally exhibiting stronger clustering and steeper 2pcf. the colordependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within the red sequence,consistent with the behavior of sdss-ii main sample galaxies at lowerredshifts. at a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution ofthe projected 2pcfs with redshift is detected for red sequence galaxies. wealso construct galaxy samples of fixed number density at different redshifts,using redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. the clustering of these galaxiesin the cmass redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted bypassive evolution. our measurements of the luminosity and color dependence andredshift evolution of galaxy clustering will allow for detailed modeling of therelation between galaxies and dark matter halos and new constraints on galaxyformation and evolution.

1303.3551	the different star-formation histories of blue and red spiral and  elliptical galaxies	[abridged] we study the spectral properties of intermediate mass galaxies asa function of colour and morphology. we use galaxy zoo to define threemorphological classes of galaxies, namely early-types (ellipticals), late-type(disk-dominated) face-on spirals and early-type (bulge-dominated) face-onspirals. we classify these galaxies as blue or red according to their sdss g-rcolour and use the spectral fitting code vespa to calculate time-resolvedstar-formation histories, metallicity and total starlight dust extinction fromtheir sdss fibre spectra. we find that red late-type spirals show lessstar-formation in the last 500 myr than blue late-type spirals by up to afactor of three, but share similar star-formation histories at earlier times.this decline in recent star-formation explains their redder colour: theirchemical and dust content are the same. we postulate that red late-type spiralsare recent descendants of blue late-type spirals, with their star-formationcurtailed in the last 500 myrs. the red late-type spirals are however stillforming stars approximately 17 times faster than red ellipticals over the sameperiod. red early-type spirals lie between red late-type spirals and redellipticals in terms of recent-to-intermediate star-formation and dust content.therefore, it is plausible that these galaxies represent an evolutionary linkbetween these two populations. they are more likely to evolve directly into redellipticals than red late-type spirals. blue ellipticals show similarstar-formation histories as blue spirals (regardless of type), except they haveformed less stars in the last 100 myrs. however, blue ellipticals havedifferent dust content, which peaks at lower extinction values than all spiralgalaxies.

1303.4302	the sdss-iii baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey: constraints on  the integrated sachs wolfe effect	in the context of the study of the integrated sachs wolfe effect (isw), weconstruct a template of the projected density distribution up to $z\simeq 0.7$by using the luminous galaxies (lgs) from the sloan digital sky survey dr8. weuse a photo-z catalogue trained with more than a hundred thousand galaxies fromboss in the sdss dr8 imaging area. we consider two different lg samples whoseselection matches that of sdss-iii/boss: the lowz sample ($z\in [0.15,0.5]$)and the cmass sample ($z\in[0.4,0.7]$). when building the lg density maps weuse the information from star density, survey footprint, seeing conditions, skyemission, dust extinction and airmass to explore the impact of these artifactson the two lg samples. in agreement with previous studies, we find that thecmass sample is particularly sensitive to galactic stars, which dominate thecontribution to the auto-angular power spectrum below $\ell=7$. other potentialsystematics affect mostly the low multipole range ($\ell\in[2,7]$), but leavefluctuations on smaller scales practically unchanged. the resulting powerspectra in the multipole range $\ell\in[2,100]$ for the lowz, cmass andlowz+cmass samples are compatible with linear $\lambda$cdm expectations andconstant bias values of $b=1.98 \pm 0.11$, $2.08\pm0.14$ and $1.88\pm 0.11$,respectively, with no traces of non-gaussianity: $f_{\rm nl}^{\rm local}=59\pm75$ at 95% confidence level for the full lowz+cmass sample in the range$\ell\in[4,100]$. after cross-correlating wmap-9yr data with the lowz+cmass lgdensity field, the isw signal is detected at the level of 1.62--1.69$\,\sigma$.while this result is in close agreement with predictions from monte carlosimulations in the concordance $\lambda$cdm model, it cannot rule out by itselfan einstein-de sitter scenario, and has a moderately low signal compared toprevious studies conducted on subsets of this lg sample.

1303.4396	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: cosmological constraints from the full shape of the  clustering wedges	we explore the cosmological implications of the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s)and xi_para(s), of the cmass data release 9 (dr9) sample of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). these clustering wedges are defined byaveraging the full two-dimensional correlation function, xi(mu,s), over theranges 0&lt;mu&lt;0.5 and 0.5&lt;mu&lt;1, respectively. these measurements allow us toconstrain the parameter combinations d_a(z)/r_s(z_d)=9.03 +- 0.21 andcz/(r_s(z_d)h(z)) = 12.14 +- 0.43 at the mean redsfhit of the sample, z=0.57.we combine the information from the clustering wedges with recent measurementsof cmb, bao and type ia supernovae to obtain constraints on the cosmologicalparameters of the standard lcdm model and a number of potential extensions. theinformation encoded in the clustering wedges is most useful when the darkenergy equation of state is allowed to deviate from its standard lcdm value.the combination of all datasets shows no evidence of a deviation from aconstant dark energy equation of state, in which case we find w_de = -1.013 +-0.064, in complete agreement with a cosmological constant. we explore potentialdeviations from general relativity by constraining the growth rate f(z)=d lnd(a)/ d ln a, in which case the combination of the cmass clustering wedges withcmb data implies f(z=0.57)=0.719 +- 0.094, in accordance with the predictionsof gr. our results clearly illustrate the additional constraining power ofanisotropic clustering measurements with respect to that of angle-averagedquantities.

1502.07040	p-manga: gradients in recent star formation histories as diagnostics for  galaxy growth and death	we present an analysis of the data produced by the manga prototype run(p-manga), aiming to test how the radial gradients in recent star formationhistories, as indicated by the 4000aa-break (d4000), hdelta absorption(ew(hd_a)) and halpha emission (ew(ha)) indices, can be useful forunderstanding disk growth and star formation cessation in local galaxies. weclassify 12 galaxies observed on two p-manga plates as either centrallyquiescent (cq) or centrally star-forming (csf), according to whether d4000measured in the central spaxel of each datacube exceeds 1.6. for each galaxy wegenerate both 2d maps and radial profiles of d4000, ew(hd_a) and ew(ha). wefind that csf galaxies generally show very weak or no radial variation in thesediagnostics. in contrast, cq galaxies present significant radial gradients, inthe sense that d4000 decreases, while both ew(hd_a) and ew(ha) increase fromthe galactic center outward. the outer regions of the galaxies show greaterscatter on diagrams relating the three parameters than their central parts. inparticular, the clear separation between centrally-measured quiescent andstar-forming galaxies in these diagnostic planes is largely filled in by theouter parts of galaxies whose global colors place them in the green valley,supporting the idea that the green valley represents a transition betweenblue-cloud and red-sequence phases, at least in our small sample. these resultsare consistent with a picture in which the cessation of star formationpropagates from the center of a galaxy outwards as it moves to the redsequence.

1503.01124	p-manga: full spectral fitting and stellar population maps from  prototype observations	manga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory) is a 6-yearsdss-iv survey that will obtain resolved spectroscopy from 3600 $\aa$ to 10300$\aa$ for a representative sample of over 10,000 nearby galaxies. in thispaper, we derive spatially resolved stellar population properties and radialgradients by performing full spectral fitting of observed galaxy spectra fromp-manga, a prototype of the manga instrument. these data include spectra foreighteen galaxies, covering a large range of morphological type. we derive age,metallicity, dust and stellar mass maps, and their radial gradients, using highspectral-resolution stellar population models, and assess the impact of varyingthe stellar library input to the models. we introduce a method to determinedust extinction which is able to give smooth stellar mass maps even in cases ofhigh and spatially non-uniform dust attenuation.  with the spectral fitting we produce detailed maps of stellar populationproperties which allow us to identify galactic features among this diversesample such as spiral structure, smooth radial profiles with little azimuthalstructure in spheroidal galaxies, and spatially distinct galaxy sub-components.in agreement with the literature, we find the gradients for galaxies identifiedas early-type to be on average flat in age, and negative (- 0.15 dex / r$_e$ )in metallicity, whereas the gradients for late-type galaxies are on averagenegative in age (- 0.39 dex / r$_e$ ) and flat in metallicity. we demonstratehow different levels of data quality change the precision with which radialgradients can be measured. we show how this analysis, extended to the largenumbers of manga galaxies, will have the potential to shed light on galaxystructure and evolution.

0804.4483	galaxy zoo : morphologies derived from visual inspection of galaxies  from the sloan digital sky survey	in order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies onemust first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massivesystems: spirals and early-type systems. this paper introduces a project,galaxy zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly onemillion galaxies, extracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). thisachievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visuallyinspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. the project has obtainedmore than 40,000,000 individual classifications made by ~100,000 participants.we discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how theclassifications were performed and processed. we find that galaxy zoo resultsare consistent with those for subsets of sdss galaxies classified byprofessional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provides a robustmorphological catalogue. obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspectionavoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such ascolour, concentration or structual parameters. in addition, this catalogue canbe used to directly compare sdss morphologies with older data sets. thecolour--magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and weillustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colouralone as a proxy for morphology.

1505.01171	measuring galaxy environments in large scale photometric surveys	the properties of galaxies in the local universe have been shown to dependupon their environment. future large scale photometric surveys such as des andeuclid will be vital to gain insight into the evolution of galaxy propertiesand the role of environment. large samples come at the cost of redshiftprecision and this affects the measurement of environment. we study this bymeasuring environments using sdss spectroscopic and photometric redshifts andalso simulated photometric redshifts with a range of uncertainties. we considerthe nth nearest neighbour and fixed aperture methods and evaluate the impact ofthe aperture parameters and the redshift uncertainty. we find that photometricenvironments have a smaller dynamic range than spectroscopic measurementsbecause uncertain redshifts scatter galaxies from dense environments into lessdense environments. at the expected redshift uncertainty of des, 0.1, there isspearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.4 between the measurements using theoptimal parameters. we examine the galaxy red fraction as a function of massand environment using photometric redshifts and find that the bivariatedependence is still present in the sdss photometric measurements. we show thatphotometric samples with a redshift uncertainty of 0.1 must be approximately6-16 times larger than spectroscopic samples to detect environment correlationswith equivalent fractional errors.

0805.2612	galaxy zoo: the dependence of morphology and colour on environment	we analyse the relationships between galaxy morphology, colour, environmentand stellar mass using data for over 100,000 objects from galaxy zoo, thelargest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled. weconclusively show that colour and morphology fractions are very differentfunctions of environment. both are sensitive to stellar mass; however, at fixedstellar mass, while colour is also highly sensitive to environment, morphologydisplays much weaker environmental trends. only a small part of both relationscan be attributed to variation in the stellar mass function with environment.galaxies with high stellar masses are mostly red, in all environments andirrespective of their morphology. low stellar-mass galaxies are mostly blue inlow-density environments, but mostly red in high-density environments, againirrespective of their morphology. the colour-density relation is primarilydriven by variations in colour fractions at fixed morphology, in particular thefraction of spiral galaxies that have red colours, and especially at lowstellar masses. we demonstrate that our red spirals primarily include galaxieswith true spiral morphology. we clearly show there is an environmentaldependence for colour beyond that for morphology. before using the galaxy zoomorphologies to produce the above results, we first quantify a luminosity-,size- and redshift-dependent classification bias that affects this dataset, andprobably most other studies of galaxy population morphology. a correction forthis bias is derived and applied to produce a sample of galaxies with reliablemorphological type likelihoods, on which we base our analysis.

1507.04752	the stripe 82 massive galaxy project ii: stellar mass completeness of  spectroscopic galaxy samples from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) has collected spectra forover one million galaxies at $0.15&lt;z&lt;0.7$ over a volume of 15.3 gpc$^3$ (9,376deg$^2$) -- providing us an opportunity to study the most massive galaxypopulations with vanishing sample variance. however, boss samples are selectedvia complex color cuts that are optimized for cosmology studies, not galaxyscience. in this paper, we supplement boss samples with photometric redshiftsfrom the stripe 82 massive galaxy catalog and measure the total galaxy stellarmass function (smf) at $z\sim0.3$ and $z\sim0.55$. with the total smf in hand,we characterize the stellar mass completeness of boss samples. thehigh-redshift cmass ("constant mass") sample is significantly impacted by massincompleteness and is 80% complete at $\log_{10}(m_*/m_{\odot}) &gt;11.6$ only inthe narrow redshift range $z=[0.51,0.61]$. the low redshift lowz sample is 80%complete at $\log_{10}(m_*/m_{\odot}) &gt;11.6$ for $z=[0.15,0.43]$. to constructmass complete samples at lower masses, spectroscopic samples need to besignificantly supplemented by photometric redshifts. this work will enablefuture studies to better utilize the boss samples for galaxy-formation science.

1509.01276	the stripe 82 massive galaxy project i: catalog construction	the stripe 82 massive galaxy catalog (s82-mgc) is the largest-volume stellarmass-limited sample of galaxies beyond z~1 constructed to date. spanning 139.4deg2, the s82-mgc includes a mass-limited sample of 41,770 galaxies with logmstar &gt; 11.2 to z~0.7, sampling a volume of 0.3 gpc3, roughly equivalent to thevolume of the sloan digital sky survey-i/ii (sdss-i/ii) z &lt; 0.15 main sample.the catalog is built on three pillars of survey data: the sdss stripe 82 coaddphotometry which reaches r-band magnitudes of 23.5 ab, yjhk photometry atdepths of 20th magnitude (ab) from the uk infrared deep sky survey (ukidss)large area survey, and over 70,000 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts fromsdss-i/ii and the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). we describethe catalog construction and verification, the production of 9-band matchedaperture photometry, tests of existing and newly estimated photometricredshifts required to supplement spectroscopic redshifts for 55% of the logmstar &gt; 11.2 sample, and geometric masking. we provide near-ir based stellarmass estimates and compare these to previous estimates. all catalog productsare made publicly available. the s82-mgc not only addresses previousstatistical limitations in high-mass galaxy evolution studies but beginstackling inherent data challenges in the coming era of wide-field imagingsurveys.

1509.04000	old age and super-solar metallicity in a massive z~1.4 early-type galaxy  from vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy	we present the first estimate of age, stellar metallicity and chemicalabundance ratios, for an individual early-type galaxy at high-redshift (z =1.426) in the cosmos field. our analysis is based on observations obtained withthe x-shooter instrument at the vlt, which cover the visual and near infraredspectrum at high (r &gt;5000) spectral resolution. we measure the values ofseveral spectral absorptions tracing chemical species, in particular magnesiumand iron, besides determining the age-sensitive d4000 break. we compare themeasured indices to stellar population models, finding good agreement. we findthat our target is an old (t &gt; 3 gyr), high-metallicity ([z/h] &gt; 0.5) galaxywhich formed its stars at z_{form} &gt; 5 within a short time scale ~0.1 gyr, astestified by the strong [\alpha/fe] ratio ( &gt; 0.4), and has passively evolvedin the first &gt; 3-4 gyr of its life. we have verified that this result is robustagainst the choice and number of fitted spectral features, and stellarpopulation model. the result of an old age and high-metallicity has importantimplications for galaxy formation and evolution confirming an early and rapidformation of the most massive galaxies in the universe.

astro-ph;0004145	strong balmer lines in old stellar populations: no need for young ages  in ellipticals?	comparing models of simple stellar populations (ssp) with observed linestrengths generally provides a tool to break the age-metallicity degeneracy inelliptical galaxies. due to the wide range of balmer line strengths observed,ellipticals have been interpreted to exhibit an appreciable scatter in age. inthis paper, we analyze composite stellar population models with a simple mix ofan old metal-rich and an old metal-poor component. we show that these modelssimultaneously produce strong balmer lines and strong metallic lines withoutinvoking a young population. the key to this result is that our models arebased on ssps that better match the steep increase of hbeta in metal-poorglobular clusters than models in the literature. hence, the scatter of hbetaobserved in cluster and luminous field elliptical galaxies can be explained bya spread in the metallicity of old stellar populations. we check our model withrespect to the so-called g-dwarf problem in ellipticals. for a galaxy subsamplecovering a large range in uv-v colors we demonstrate that the addition of anold metal-poor subcomponent does not invalidate other observational constraintslike colors and the flux in the mid-uv.

astro-ph;0202166	the epochs of early-type galaxy formation in clusters and in the field	we compute new population synthesis models of lick absorption line indiceswith variable alpha/fe ratios and use them to derive average ages,metallicities, and alpha/fe element enhancements for a sample of 126 field andcluster early-type galaxies. calibrating the models on galactic globularclusters, we show that any population synthesis model being based on stellarlibraries of the milky way is intrinsically biased towards super-solar alpha/feratios at metallicities below solar. we correct for this bias, so that themodels presented here reflect constant alpha/fe ratios at all metallicities.the use of such unbiased models is essential for studies of stellar systemswith sub-solar metallicities like (extragalactic) globular clusters or dwarfgalaxies.  for the galaxy sample investigated here, we find a clear correlation betweenalpha/fe and velocity dispersion. zero-point, slope, and scatter of thiscorrelation turn out to be independent of the environment. additionally, thealpha/fe ratios and mean ages of elliptical galaxies are well correlated, i.e.galaxies with high alpha/fe ratios have also high average ages. this stronglyreinforces the view that the alpha/fe element enhancement in ellipticals isproduced by short star formation timescales rather than by a flattening of theinitial mass function. the more massive the galaxy, the shorter is its starformation timescale, and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of starformation, independent of the environmental density. we show that this findingis incompatible with the predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation models,in which star formation is tightly linked to the assembly history of darkmatter halos.

astro-ph;0209250	stellar population models of lick indices with variable element  abundance ratios	we provide the whole set of lick indices from cn1 to tio2 of simple stellarpopulation models with, for the first time, variable element abundance ratios,[alpha/fe]=0.0, 0.3, 0.5, [alpha/ca]=-0.1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, and [alpha/n]=-0.5,0.0. the models cover ages between 1 and 15 gyr, metallicities between 1/200and 3.5 solar. our models are free from the intrinsic alpha/fe bias that wasimposed by the milky way template stars up to now, hence they reflectwell-defined alpha/fe ratios at all metallicities. the models are calibratedwith milky way globular clusters for which metallicities and alpha/fe ratiosare known from independent spectroscopy of individual stars. the metallicitiesthat we derive from the lick indices mgb and fe5270 are in excellent agreementwith the metallicity scale by zinn &amp; west (1984), and we show that the latterprovides total metallicity rather than iron abundance. we can reproduce therelatively strong cn-absorption features cn1 and cn2 of galactic globularclusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor three. anenhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with theindices mg1 and c24668. the calcium sensitive index ca4227 of globular clustersis well matched by our models with [ca/fe]= 0.3, including the metal-rich bulgeclusters ngc 6528 and ngc 6553. from our alpha/fe enhanced models we infer thatthe index [mgfe] defined by gonzalez (1993) is quite independent of alpha/fe,but still slightly decreases with increasing alpha/fe. we define a slightmodification of this index that is completely independent of alpha/fe andserves best as a tracer of total metallicity. searching for blue indices thatgive similar information as mgb and fe, we find that cn1 and fe4383 may be bestsuited to estimate alpha/fe ratios of objects at redshifts z~1.

astro-ph;0209340	the puzzlingly small caii triplet absorption in elliptical galaxies	we measure the central values (within re/8) of the caii triplet line indicescat* and cat and the paschen index pat at 8600 aa for a 93%-complete sample of75 nearby early-type galaxies with bt&lt;12 and vgal&lt;2490 km/s. we find that thevalues of cat* are constant to within 5% over the range of central velocitydispersions 100&lt;sigma&lt;340 km/s, while the pat (and cat) values are mildlyanti-correlated with sigma. using simple and composite stellar populationmodels, we show that: a) the measured cat* and cat are lower than expected fromsimple stellar population models (ssps) with salpeter initial mass functions(imfs) and with metallicities and ages derived from optical lick (fe, mg andhbeta) indices. uncertainties in the calibration, the fitting functions and thessp modeling taken separately cannot explain the discrepancy. on the average,the observed pat values are within the range allowed by the models and thelarge uncertainties in the fitting functions. b) the steepening of the imf atlow masses required to lower the cat* and cat indices to the observed values isincompatible with the measured feh index at 9916 aa and the dynamicalmass-to-light ratios of ellipticals. c) composite stellar populations with alow-metallicity component reduce the disagreement, but rather artificialmetallicity distributions are needed. another explanation may be that calciumis indeed underabundant in ellipticals.

astro-ph;0302063	the impact of alpha/fe enhanced stellar evolutionary tracks on the ages  of elliptical galaxies	we complement our study of alpha/fe enhanced stellar population models oflick absorption indices (thomas et al. 2003) by comparing two sets of alpha/feenhanced models. in both models the impact on lick indices due to alpha/feenhancement is accounted for through a modification of the stellar absorptionline-strengths using the response functions of tripicco &amp; bell (1995). one setof models, however, uses solar-scaled, the other alpha/fe enhanced stellarevolutionary tracks. since the alpha/fe enhanced tracks are hotter than thesolar-scaled ones (salasnich et al. 2000), the correspondent stellar populationmodels have slightly weaker metallic indices (i.e. mgb, &lt;fe&gt; etc.) and strongerbalmer line indices (hbeta) (maraston et al 2003). here we explorequantitatively the impact of this effect on the alpha/fe ratios, metallicitiesand ages that are derived for elliptical galaxies. we find that the modestdecrease of the metallic indices mgb and &lt;fe&gt; balance each other, such thatfully consistent alpha/fe ratios are derived for stellar systems using alpha/feenhanced models with either solar-scaled or alpha/fe enhanced stellar tracks.the decrease of the metallic indices and the increase of hbeta conspire in away that also consistent metallicities are obtained. the derived ages, instead,are significantly different. the inclusion of alpha/fe enhanced stellar tracksleads to the derivation of ages as high as 30 gyr for elliptical galaxies. forthe same objects, ages not older than 15 gyr are obtained, if alpha/fe enhancedmodels using solar-scaled tracks are adopted. this may indicate that currentstellar evolutionary models overestimate the bluing of stellar evolutionarytracks due to alpha/fe enhanced chemical mixtures at super-solar metallicities.

astro-ph;0303615	new clues on the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxies	we use our new stellar population models, which include effects from variableelement abundance ratios, to model the ca4227 absorption line indices ofearly-type galaxies (trager et al.), and to derive calcium element abundances.we find that calcium, although being an alpha-element, is depressed withrespect to the other alpha-elements by up to a factor 2. this confirmsquantitatively earlier speculations that early-type galaxies are calciumunderabundant. we find a clear correlation between alpha/ca ratio and centralvelocity dispersion, which implies that more massive galaxies are more calciumunderabundant. interestingly this correlation extends down to the dwarfspheroidal galaxies of the local group for which alpha/ca ratios have beenmeasured from high-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars (shetrone etal.). the increase of the calcium underabundance with galaxy mass balances thehigher total metallicities of more massive galaxies, so that calcium abundancein early-type galaxies is fairly constant and in particular does not increasewith increasing galaxy mass. this result may be the key to understand why thecaii triplet absorption of early-type galaxies at 8600 a is constant to within5 per cent over a large range of velocity dispersions (saglia et al.; cenarroet al.). the origin of the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxiesremains yet to be understood. we argue that formation timescales aredisfavoured to produce calcium underabundance, and that the option ofmetallicity dependent supernova yields may be the most promising track tofollow.

astro-ph;0404511	higher-order balmer line indices in alpha/fe-enhanced stellar population  models	we have computed the higher-order balmer absorption line indices hgamma andhdelta (worthey &amp; ottaviani 1997) for stellar population models with variableelement ratios. the response of these indices to abundance ratio variations istaken from detailed line formation and model atmosphere calculations. we findthat hgamma and hdelta, unlike hbeta, are very sensitive to alpha/fe ratiochanges at super-solar metallicities. both line indices increase significantlywith increasing alpha/fe ratio. this effect cannot be neglected when these lineindices are used to derive the ages of metal-rich, unresolved stellarpopulations like early-type galaxies. we re-analyze the elliptical galaxysample of kuntschner (2000), and show that consistent age estimates from hbetaand hgamma are obtained, only if the effect of alpha/fe enhancement on hgammais taken into account in the models. this result rectifies a problem currentlypresent in the literature, namely that hgamma and hdelta have up to now led tosignificantly younger ages for early-type galaxies than hbeta. our workparticularly impacts on the interpretation of intermediate to high-redshiftdata, for which only the higher-order balmer lines are accessibleobservationally.

astro-ph;0505453	vlt spectroscopy of globular cluster systems, ii. spectroscopic ages,  metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios of globular clusters in early-type  galaxies	an analysis of ages, metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios of globular clustersystems in early-type galaxies is presented, based on lick index measurementssummarized in puzia et al. (2004, paper i of this series). in the light ofcalibration and measurement uncertainties, age-metallicity degeneracy, and therelative dynamic range of lick indices, as well as systematics introduced byabundance ratio variations (in particular variations of [alpha/fe] ratios), wefind that the most reliable age indicator for our dataset is a combination ofthe lick balmer-line indices hgammaa, hbeta, and hdeltaa. [mgfe]' is used as aspectroscopic metallicity indicator which is least affected by [alpha/fe]variations. we introduce an interpolation routine to simultaneously deriveages, metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios from diagnostic grids constructedfrom lick indices. from a comparison of high-quality data with ssp modelpredictions, we find that ~2/3 of the globular clusters in early-type galaxiesare older than 10 gyr, up to 1/3 have ages in the range ~5-10 gyr, and only afew cluster are younger than ~5 gyr. our sample of globular clusters coversmetallicities from [z/h] = -1.3 up to ~0.5 dex. we find that metal-richglobular clusters show on average a smaller mean age and a larger age scatterthan their metal-poor counterparts. [alpha/fe] diagnostic plots show thatglobular cluster systems in early-type galaxies have super-solar alpha/feabundance ratios with a mean [alpha/fe] = 0.47+/-0.06 dex and a dispersion ofabout 0.3 dex. we find evidence for a correlation between [alpha/fe] andmetallicity, in the sense that more metal-rich clusters exhibit loweralpha-element enhancements.

astro-ph;0512415	rejuvenation of spiral bulges	we seek to understand whether the stellar populations of galactic bulges showfingerprints of secular evolution triggered by the presence of the disc. forthis purpose we re-analyse the sample of proctor and sansom, deriving stellarpopulation ages and element abundances from absorption line indices. we obtainvery consistent constraints on ages from the three balmer indices hbeta,hgamma, and hdelta, in good agreement with those of proctor and sansom based ona completely different method. like other studies in the literature, we findthat bulges have relatively low luminosity weighted ages, the lowest agederived for the smallest bulges being 1.3 gyr. hence bulges are not generallyold but actually rejuvenated systems. we discuss evidence that this might betrue also for the bulge of the milky way. we show that the smallest bulges,being the youngest with the lowest alpha/fe ratios, must have experienced starformation events involving 10-30 per cent of their total mass in the past 1-2gyr. no significant correlations of the stellar population parameters withhubble type are found instead. we show that the relationships with sigmacoincide perfectly with those of early-type galaxies. hence, bulges aretypically seen younger, metal-poorer and less alpha/fe enhanced than early-typegalaxies, only because of their smaller masses. at a given velocity dispersion,bulges and elliptical galaxies are indistinguishable as far as their stellarpopulations are concerned. these results favour an inside-out formationscenario and indicate that the discs in spiral galaxies of hubble types sbc andearlier cannot have a significant influence on the evolution of the stellarpopulations in the bulge component. the phenomenon of pseudobulge formationmust be restricted to spirals of types later than sbc.

0809.1096	destruction of molecular gas reservoirs in early-type galaxies by active  galactic nucleus feedback	residual star formation at late times in early-type galaxies and theirprogenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red,passively evolving systems we see today. likewise, residual or newly accretedreservoirs of molecular gas that are fuelling star formation must be destroyed.this suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonlyattributed to agn feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelledduring a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. however,direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of thismolecular gas and an agn phase has been missing so far. we present newmm-wavelength observations from the iram 30m telescope of a sample of lowredshift sdss early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process ofquenching of late-time star formation. our observations show that thedisappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 myr with theonset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to starformation alone. since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerfulquasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity agn episodes aresufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. this`suppression mode' of agn feedback is very different from the `truncation mode'linked to powerful quasar activity during early phases of galaxy formation.

0809.1867	modeling the color evolution of luminous red galaxies - improvements  with empirical stellar spectra	predicting the colors of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) has been a long-standing problem. the g,r,i colors of lrgsare inconsistent with stellar population models over the redshift range0.1&lt;z&lt;0.7. the g-r colors in the models are on average redder than the datawhile the r-i colors in the models are bluer towards low redshift. beyondredshift 0.4, the predicted r-i color becomes instead too red, while thepredicted g-r agrees with the data. we provide a solution to this problem,through a combination of new astrophysics and a fundamental change to thestellar population modeling. we find that the use of the empirical library ofpickles (1998) instead of theoretical spectra modifies the predicted colorsexactly in the way suggested by the data. the reason is a lower flux in theempirical libraries, with respect to the theoretical ones, in the wavelengthrange 5500-6500 aa. the discrepancy increases with decreasing effectivetemperature independently of gravity. this result has general implications fora variety of studies from globular clusters to high-redshift galaxies. theastrophysical part of our solution regards the composition of the stellarpopulations of these massive luminous red galaxies. we find that on top of theprevious effect one needs to consider a model in which ~3% of the stellar massis in old metal-poor stars. other solutions such as substantial blue horizontalbranch at high metallicity or young stellar populations can be ruled out by thedata. our new model provides a better fit to the g-r and r-i colors of lrgs andgives new insight into the formation histories of these most massive galaxies.our model will also improve the k- and evolutionary corrections for lrgs whichare critical for fully exploiting present and future galaxy surveys.

astro-ph;9906088	the uncertainties in the synthetic indices for stellar populations	the study of line strengths in the spectra of early-type galaxies has provento be a powerful tool for investigating the age and the metallicity of thesesystems. when computing models for spectrophotometric narrow-band indices,index calibrations as functions of the relevant stellar parameters (e.g.temperature, gravity and metal content) are used. thus synthetic indices dependupon these calibrations (called fitting functions), as well as on the stellarevolution ingredients adopted. all these inputs suffer from uncertainties,which impact on the derived value for the indices. in this paper we addressthis problem quantitatively. we compute synthetic mg2, fe5270, fe5335 and hbetaindices for simple stellar populations (ssp) of various ages and metallicities,under different prescriptions for the fitting functions. this allows us toestimate the impact of the uncertainties in the fitting functions. by comparingour models to those of other authors computed with the same fitting functions,we estimate the uncertainty associated to the use of different stellarevolution prescriptions. it is found that the modelling of the horizontalbranch impacts particularly on &lt;fe&gt; and hbeta. in the range of parametersexplored, the uncertainties introduced by the use of different fittingfunctions can be appreciably larger than the error affecting the observationaldata. this typically occurs at high z for the metallic line strengths, at low zfor the hbeta index.

0811.3970	galaxy zoo: disentangling the environmental dependence of morphology and  colour	we analyze the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour withtwo-point clustering statistics, using data from the galaxy zoo, the largestsample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled, extracted from thesloan digital sky survey. we present two-point correlation functions of spiraland early-type galaxies, and we quantify the correlation between morphology andenvironment with marked correlation functions. these yield clear and preciseenvironmental trends across a wide range of scales, analogous to similarmeasurements with galaxy colours, indicating that the galaxy zooclassifications themselves are very precise. we measure morphology markedcorrelation functions at fixed colour and find that they are relatively weak,with the only residual correlation being that of red galaxies at small scales,indicating a morphology gradient within haloes for red galaxies. at fixedmorphology, we find that the environmental dependence of colour remains strong,and these correlations remain for fixed morphology \textit{and} luminosity. animplication of this is that much of the morphology--density relation is due tothe relation between colour and density. our results also have implications forgalaxy evolution: the morphological transformation of galaxies is usuallyaccompanied by a colour transformation, but not necessarily vice versa. aspiral galaxy may move onto the red sequence of the colour-magnitude diagramwithout quickly becoming an early-type. we analyze the significant populationof red spiral galaxies, and present evidence that they tend to be located inmoderately dense environments and are often satellite galaxies in the outskirtsof haloes. finally, we combine our results to argue that central and satellitegalaxies tend to follow different evolutionary paths.

0812.1225	the impact of tp-agb stars on hierarchical galaxy formation models	the spectro-photometric properties of galaxies in galaxy formation models areobtained by combining the predicted history of star formation and massaccretion with the physics of stellar evolution through stellar populationmodels. in the recent literature, significant differences have emergedregarding the implementation of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branchphase of stellar evolution. the emission in the tp-agb phase dominates thebolometric and near-ir spectrum of intermediate-age (~1 gyr) stellarpopulations, hence it is crucial for the correct modeling of the galaxyluminosities and colours. in this paper for the first time, we incorporate afull prescription of the tp-agb phase in a semi-analytic model of galaxyformation. we find that the inclusion of the tp-agb in the model spectradramatically alters the predicted colour-magnitude relation and its evolutionwith redshift. when the tp-agb phase is active, the rest-frame v-k galaxycolours are redder by almost 2 magnitudes in the redshift range z~2-3 and by 1magnitude at z~1. very red colours are produced in disk galaxies, so that thev-k colour distributions of disk and spheroids are virtually undistinguishableat low redshifts. we also find that the galaxy k-band emission is more than 1magnitude higher in the range z~1-3. this may alleviate the difficulties met bythe hierarchical clustering scenario in predicting the red galaxy population athigh redshifts. the comparison between simulations and observations have to berevisited in the light of our results.
