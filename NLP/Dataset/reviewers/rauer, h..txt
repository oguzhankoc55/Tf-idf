0903.1829	noise properties of the corot data: a planet-finding perspective	in this short paper, we study the photometric precision of stellar lightcurves obtained by the corot satellite in its planet finding channel, with aparticular emphasis on the timescales characteristic of planetary transits.together with other articles in the same issue of this journal, it forms anattempt to provide the building blocks for a statistical interpretation of thecorot planet and eclipsing binary catch to date.  after pre-processing the light curves so as to minimise long-term variationsand outliers, we measure the scatter of the light curves in the first threecorot runs lasting more than 1 month, using an iterative non-linear filter toisolate signal on the timescales of interest. the bevhaiour of the noise on 2htimescales is well-described a power-law with index 0.25 in r-magnitude,ranging from 0.1mmag at r=11.5 to 1mmag at r=16, which is close to thepre-launch specification, though still a factor 2-3 above the photon noise dueto residual jitter noise and hot pixel events. there is evidence for a slightdegradation of the performance over time. we find clear evidence for enhancedvariability on hours timescales (at the level of 0.5 mmag) in stars identifiedas likely giants from their r-magnitude and b-v colour, which representapproximately 60 and 20% of the observed population in the direction of aquilaand monoceros respectively. on the other hand, median correlated noise levelsover 2h for dwarf stars are extremely low, reaching 0.05mmag at the bright end.

0907.1653	the secondary eclipse of corot-1b	the transiting planet corot-1b is thought to belong to the pm-class ofplanets, in which the thermal emission dominates in the optical wavelengths. wepresent a detection of its secondary eclipse in the corot white channel data,whose response function goes from ~400 to ~1000 nm. we used two differentfiltering approaches, and several methods to evaluate the significance of adetection of the secondary eclipse. we detect a secondary eclipse centeredwithin 20 min at the expected times for a circular orbit, with a depth of0.016+/-0.006%. the center of the eclipse is translated in a 1-sigma upperlimit to the planet's eccentricity of ecosomega&lt;0.014. under the assumption ofa zero bond albedo and blackbody emission from the planet, it corresponds to at_{corot}=2330 +120-140 k. we provide the equilibrium temperatures of theplanet as a function of the amount of reflected light. if the planet is inthermal equilibrium with the incident flux from the star, our results imply aninefficient transport mechanism of the flux from the day to the night sides.

0909.3397	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission: vii. the  "hot-jupiter"-type planet corot-5b	aims. the corot space mission continues to photometrically monitor about 12000 stars in its field-of-view for a series of target fields to search fortransiting extrasolar planets ever since 2007. deep transit signals can bedetected quickly in the "alarm-mode" in parallel to the ongoing target fieldmonitoring. corot's first planets have been detected in this mode. methods. thecorot raw lightcurves are filtered for orbital residuals, outliers, andlow-frequency stellar signals. the phase folded lightcurve is used to fit thetransit signal and derive the main planetary parameters. radial velocityfollow-up observations were initiated to secure the detection and to derive theplanet mass. results. we report the detection of corot-5b, detected duringobservations of the lra01 field, the first long-duration field in the galacticanticenter direction. corot-5b is a "hot jupiter-type" planet with a radius of1.388(+0.046, -0.047) r_jup, a mass of 0.467(+0.047, -0.024) m_jup, andtherefore, a mean density of 0.217(+0.031, -0.025) g cm-3. the planet orbits anf9v star of 14.0 mag in 4.0378962 +/- 0.0000019 days at an orbital distance of0.04947(+0.00026,  -0.00029) au.

0909.4797	identification of variable stars in corot's first main observing field  (lrc1)	the corot space mission will monitor several target fields for up to 150 daysto perform asteroseismology and to search for extrasolar planets by photometrictransits. variable stars in the target fields are important objects foradditional scientific studies but can also disturb the search for planetarytransits. a variability characterization of the target fields prior to corotobservations is therefore important for two reasons: to find interestingvariable stars to monitor further and to make an analysis of the impact of thevariable stars on detecting extrasolar planet transits with corot. the berlinexoplanet search telescope (best) is a small wide-angle telescope dedicated tohigh-precision photometry. it has observed a 9 square degree field of viewcentered at (alpha, delta)=(19h00m00.0s, +00deg01'55.2") (j2000.0) over 98nights to search for variable stars in the surroundings of the first long-runtarget field (lrc1) of the corot space mission. in this data set we identified92 periodic variable stars, 86 of which are new discoveries and 6 of which areknown from the general catalogue of variable stars (gcvs). for five of the gcvsstars, variability could not be confirmed. forty-three of the 92 detectedperiodic variable stars are identified as eclipsing binaries. we have evaluatedthe completeness of our survey for eclipsing binaries by comparing it to theexpected fraction of eclipsing binaries based on hipparcos observations. fromthis evaluation we show that the best data set presented here has acompleteness of 20%-30% for periods longer than 1 day and is complete relativeto hipparcos for short-period binaries.

0911.3585	transit timing analysis of corot-1b	corot, the pioneer space-based transit search, steadily provides thousands ofhigh-precision light curves with continuous time sampling over periods of up to5 months. the transits of a planet perturbed by an additional object are notstrictly periodic. by studying the transit timing variations (ttvs), additionalobjects can be detected in the system.  a transit timing analysis of corot-1b is carried out to constrain theexistence of additional planets in the system.  we used data obtained by an improved version of the corot data pipeline(version 2.0). individual transits were fitted to determine the mid-transittimes, and we analyzed the derived $o-c$ diagram. n-body integrations were usedto place limits on secondary planets.  no periodic timing variations with a period shorter than the observationalwindow (55 days) are found. the presence of an earth-mass trojan is not likely.a planet of mass greater than $\sim 1$ earth mass can be ruled out by thepresent data if the object is in a 2:1 (exterior) mean motion resonance withcorot-1b. considering initially circular orbits: (i) super-earths (less than 10earth-masses) are excluded for periods less than about 3.5 days, (ii)saturn-like planets can be ruled out for periods less than about 5 days, (iii)jupiter-like planets should have a minimum orbital period of about 6.5 days.

0911.5087	the thermal emission of the young and massive planet corot-2b at 4.5 and  8 microns	we report measurements of the thermal emission of the young and massiveplanet corot-2b at 4.5 and 8 microns with the spitzer infrared array camera(irac). our measured occultation depths are 0.510 +- 0.042 % and 0.41 +- 0.11 %at 4.5 and 8 microns, respectively. in addition to the corot opticalmeasurements, these planet/star flux ratios indicate a poor heat distributionto the night side of the planet and are in better agreement with an atmospherefree of temperature inversion layer. still, the presence of such an inversionis not definitely ruled out by the observations and a larger wavelengthcoverage is required to remove the current ambiguity. our global analysis ofcorot, spitzer and ground-based data confirms the large mass and size of theplanet with slightly revised values (mp = 3.47 +- 0.22 mjup, rp = 1.466 +-0.044 rjup). we find a small but significant offset in the timing of theoccultation when compared to a purely circular orbital solution, leading to ecos(omega) = -0.00291 +- 0.00063 where e is the orbital eccentricity and omegais the argument of periastron. constraining the age of the system to be at mostof a few hundreds of myr and assuming that the non-zero orbital eccentricity isnot due to a third undetected body, we model the coupled orbital-tidalevolution of the system with various tidal q values, core sizes and initialorbital parameters. for log(q_s') = 5 - 6, our modelling is able to explain thelarge radius of corot-2b if log(q_p') &lt;= 5.5 through a transient tidalcircularization and corresponding planet tidal heating event. under this model,the planet will reach its roche limit within 20 myr at most.

(2010). however, our model calculations imply that alsoatmospheres that are not co2-dominated (i.e., 5% vmr instead of 95% vmr) couldresult in habitable conditions for gl 581 d.

1102.0867	potential biosignatures in super-earth atmospheres	atmospheric temperature and mixing ratio profiles of terrestrial planets varywith the spectral energy flux distribution for different types of m-dwarf starsand the planetary gravity. we investigate the resulting effects on the spectralappearance of molecular absorption bands, that are relevant as indicators forpotential planetary habitability during primary and secondary eclipse fortransiting terrestrial planets with earth-like biomass emissions. atmosphericprofiles are computed using a plane-parallel, 1d climate model coupled with achemistry model. we then calculate simulated spectra using a line-by-lineradiative transfer model. we find that emission spectra during secondaryeclipse show increasing absorption of methane, water and ozone for planetsorbiting quiet m0-m3 dwarfs and the active m-type star ad leo compared to solartype central stars. however, for planets orbiting very cool and quiet m dwarfs(m4 to m7), increasing temperatures in the mid-atmosphere lead to reducedabsorption signals, making the detection of molecules more difficult in suchscenarios. transmission spectra during primary eclipse show strong absorptionfeatures of ch4, n2o and h2o for planets orbiting quiet m0-m7 stars and ad leo.the n2o absorption of an earth-sized planet orbiting a quiet m7 star can evenbe as strong as the co2 signal. however, ozone absorption decreases for planetsorbiting such cool central stars due to chemical effects in the atmosphere. toinvestigate the effect on the spectroscopic detection of absorption bands withpotential future satellite missions, we compute signal-to-noise-ratios (snr)for a james webb space telescope (jwst)-like aperture telescope.

1104.3756	atmospheric studies of habitability in the gliese 581 system	the m-type star gliese 581 is orbited by at least one terrestrial planetcandidate in the habitable zone, i.e. gl 581 d. orbital simulations have shownthat additional planets inside the habitable zone of gl 581 would bedynamically stable. recently, two further planet candidates have been claimed,one of them in the habitable zone.  in view of the ongoing search for planets around m stars which is expected toresult in numerous detections of potentially habitable super-earths, we takethe gl 581 system as an example to investigate such planets. in contrast toprevious studies of habitability in the gl 581 system, we use a consistentatmospheric model to assess surface conditions and habitability. furthermore,we perform detailed atmospheric simulations for a much larger subset ofpotential planetary and atmospheric scenarios than previously considered.  a 1d radiative-convective atmosphere model is used to calculate temperatureand pressure profiles of model atmospheres, which we assumed to be composed ofmolecular nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. in these calculations, keyparameters such as surface pressure and co2 concentration as well as orbitaldistance and planetary mass are varied.  results imply that surface temperatures above freezing could be obtained,independent of the here considered atmospheric scenarios, at an orbitaldistance of 0.117 au. for an orbital distance of 0.146 au, co2 concentrationsas low as 10 times the present earth's value are sufficient to warm the surfaceabove the freezing point of water. at 0.175 au, only scenarios with co2concentrations of 5% and 95% were found to be habitable. hence, an additionalsuper-earth planet in the gl 581 system in the previously determined dynamicalstability range would be considered a potentially habitable planet.

1105.1271	physical state of the deep interior of the corot-7b exoplanet	the present study takes the corot-7b exoplanet as an analogue for massiveterrestrial planets to investigate conditions, under which intrinsic magneticfields could be sustained in liquid cores. we examine the effect ofdepth-dependent transport parameters (e.g., activation volume of mantle rock)on a planet's thermal structure and the related heat flux across the coremantle boundary. for terrestrial planets more massive than the earth, ourcalculations suggest that a substantial part of the lowermost mantle is in asluggish convective regime, primarily due to pressure effects on viscosity.hence, we find substantially higher core temperatures than previously reportedfrom parameterized convection models. we also discuss the effect of meltingpoint depression in the presence of impurities (e.g., sulfur) in iron-richcores and compare corresponding melting relations to the calculated thermalstructure. since impurity effects become less important at the elevatedpressure and temperature conditions prevalent in the deep interior of corot-7b,iron-rich cores are likely solid, implying that a self-sustained magnetic fieldwould be absent.

1112.1035	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission xxi. corot-19b: a low  density planet orbiting an old inactive f9v-star	observations of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance to ourunderstanding of planets because their mass, radius, and mass density can bedetermined. the corot space mission allows us to achieve a very highphotometric accuracy. by combining corot data with high-precision radialvelocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. we reportthe discovery of corot-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactivef9v-type star with a period of four days. after excluding alternative physicalconfigurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radiusand mass of the planet by combining corot photometry with high-resolutionspectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs sophie, harps, fies, andsandiford. to improve the precision of its ephemeris and the epoch, we observedadditional transits with the trappist and euler telescopes. using harps spectraobtained during the transit, we then determine the projected angle between thespin of the star and the orbit of the planet. we find that the host star ofcorot-19b is an inactive f9v-type star close to the end of its main-sequencelife. the host star has a mass m*=1.21+/-0.05 msun and radius r*=1.65+/-0.04rsun. the planet has a mass of mp=1.11+/-0.06 mjup and radius of rp=1.29+/-0.03rjup. the resulting bulk density is only rho=0.71+/-0.06 gcm-3, which is muchlower than that for jupiter. the exoplanet corot-19b is an example of a giantplanet of almost the same mass as jupiter but a 30% larger radius.

1205.1963	improved variable star search in large photometric data sets -- new  variables in corot field lra02 detected by best ii	the corot field lra02 has been observed with the berlin exoplanet searchtelescope ii (best ii) during the southern summer 2007/2008. a first analysisof stellar variability led to the publication of 345 newly discovered variablestars. now, a deeper analysis of this data set was used to optimize thevariability search procedure. several methods and parameters have been testedin order to improve the selection process compared to the widely used j indexfor variability ranking. this paper describes an empirical approach to treatsystematic trends in photometric data based upon the analysis of variancestatistics that can significantly decrease the rate of false detections.  finally, the process of reanalysis and method improvement has virtuallydoubled the number of variable stars compared to the first analysis by kabathet al. a supplementary catalog of 272 previously unknown periodic variablesplus 52 stars with suspected variability is presented. improved ephemerides aregiven for 19 known variables in the field. in addition, the best ii results arecompared with corot data and its automatic variability classification.

1212.2372	the effect of stellar limb darkening values on the accuracy of the  planet radii derived from photometric transit observations	we study how the precision of the exoplanet radius determination is affectedby our present knowledge of limb darkening in two cases: when we fix the limbdarkening coefficients and when we adjust them. we also investigate the effectsof spots in one-colour photometry. we study the effect of limb darkening on theplanetary radius determination both via analytical expressions and by numericalexperiments. we also compare some of the existing limb darkening tables. whenstellar spots affect the fit, we replace the limb darkening coefficients,calculated for the unspotted cases, with effective limb darkening coefficientsto describe the effect of the spots. there are two important cases. (1) whenone fixes the limb darkening values according to some theoretical predictions,the inconsistencies of the tables do not allow us to reach accuracy in theplanetary radius of better than 1-10% (depending on the impact parameter) ifthe host star's surface effective temperature is higher than 5000 k. below 5000k the radius ratio determination may contain even 20% error. (2) when oneallows adjustment of the limb darkening coefficients, the a/rs ratio, theplanet-to-stellar radius ratio, and the impact parameter can be determined withsufficient accuracy (&lt;1%), if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough.however, the presence of stellar spots and faculae can destroy the agreementbetween the limb darkening tables and the fitted limb darkening coefficients,but this does not affect the precision of the planet radius determination. wealso find that it is necessary to fit the contamination factor, too. weconclude that the present inconsistencies of theoretical stellar limb darkeningtables suggests one should not fix the limb darkening coefficients. when oneallows them to be adjusted, then the planet radius, impact parameter, and thea/rs can be obtained with the required precision.

1303.6804	potential biosignatures in super-earth atmospheres ii. photochemical  responses	spectral characterization of super-earth atmospheres for planets orbiting inthe habitable zone of m-dwarf stars is a key focus in exoplanet science. acentral challenge is to understand and predict the expected spectral signals ofatmospheric biosignatures (species associated with life). our work applies aglobal-mean radiative-convective-photochemical column model assuming a planetwith an earth-like biomass and planetary development. we investigated planetswith gravities of 1g and 3g and a surface pressure of one bar around centralstars with spectral classes from m0 to m7. the spectral signals of thecalculated planetary scenarios have been presented by rauer et al. (2011). themain motivation of the present work is to perform a deeper analysis of thechemical processes in the planetary atmospheres. we apply a diagnostic tool,the pathway analysis program, to shed light on the photochemical pathways thatform and destroy biosignature species. ozone is a potential biosignature forcomplex- life. an important result of our analysis is a shift in the ozonephotochemistry from mainly chapman production (which dominates in theterrestrial stratosphere) to smog-dominated ozone production for planets in thehabitable zone of cooler (m5-m7)-class dwarf stars. this result is associatedwith a lower energy flux in the uvb wavelength range from the central star,hence slower planetary atmospheric photolysis of molecular oxygen, which slowsthe chapman ozone production.

1304.6024	n2-associated surface warming on early mars	early mars may have had a warmer and denser atmosphere allowing for thepresence of liquid water on the surface. however, climate model studies havenot been able to reproduce these conditions even with a co2 atmosphere ofseveral bars. recent 3d simulations of the early mars climate show that meansurface temperatures only slightly below 273k could be reached locally.  we want to investigate the effect of increased partial pressures of n2 onearly mars' surface temperature by including pressure broadening of absorptionlines and collision-induced n2-n2 absorption.  a 1d radiative-convective cloud-free atmospheric model was used to calculatetemperature profiles and surface conditions. we performed a parameter studyvarying the n2 partial pressures from 0 to 0.5bar at co2 partial pressuresbetween 0.02bar and 3bar. these values are consistent with existing estimatesof the initial, pre-noachian reservoir. solar insolation was set to beconsistent with the late noachian.  our 1d global mean simulations clearly show that enhanced n2 content in themartian atmosphere could have increased surface temperatures. an additionalgreenhouse warming of up to 13k was found at a high n2 partial pressure of0.5bar. still, even at this n2 partial pressure, global mean surfacetemperatures remained below 273k, i.e. the freezing point of water. however,given the magnitude of the n2-induced surface warming and the results of recent3d studies which show that local mean surface temperatures are not much lowerthan 273k, our results imply that the presence of atmospheric n2 could have ledto almost continously habitable mean surface conditions in some regions. inaddition, atmospheric water column amounts increased by up to a factor of 6 inresponse to the surface warming, indicating that precipitation might alsoincrease upon increasing n2 partial pressure.

1306.3940	clouds in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. iv. on the scattering  greenhouse effect of co2 ice particles: numerical radiative transfer studies	owing to their wavelengths dependent absorption and scattering properties,clouds have a strong impact on the climate of planetary atmospheres.especially, the potential greenhouse effect of co2 ice clouds in theatmospheres of terrestrial extrasolar planets is of particular interest becauseit might influence the position and thus the extension of the outer boundary ofthe classic habitable zone around main sequence stars.  we study the radiative effects of co2 ice particles obtained by differentnumerical treatments to solve the radiative transfer equation. the comparisonbetween the results of a high-order discrete ordinate method and simplertwo-stream approaches reveals large deviations in terms of a potentialscattering efficiency of the greenhouse effect. the two-stream methodsoverestimate the transmitted and reflected radiation, thereby yielding a higherscattering greenhouse effect. for the particular case of a cool m-type dwarfthe co2 ice particles show no strong effective scattering greenhouse effect byusing the high-order discrete ordinate method, whereas a positive netgreenhouse effect was found in case of the two-stream radiative transferschemes. as a result, previous studies on the effects of co2 ice clouds usingtwo-stream approximations overrated the atmospheric warming caused by thescattering greenhouse effect. consequently, the scattering greenhouse effect ofco2 ice particles seems to be less effective than previously estimated. ingeneral, higher order radiative transfer methods are necessary to describe theeffects of co2 ice clouds accurately as indicated by our numerical radiativetransfer studies.

1308.0899	the dependence of the ice-albedo feedback on atmospheric properties	the ice-albedo feedback is a potentially important de-stabilizing effect forthe climate of terrestrial planets. it is based on the positive feedbackbetween decreasing surface temperatures, an increase of snow and ice cover andan associated increase in planetary albedo, which then further decreasessurface temperature. a recent study shows that for m stars, the strength of theice-albedo feedback is reduced  this study investigates the influence of the atmosphere (in terms of surfacepressure and atmospheric composition) for this feedback. a plane-parallelradiative transfer model is used for the calculation of planetary albedos. wevaried co2 partial pressures as well as the h2o, ch4, and o3 content in theatmosphere for planets orbiting sun-like and m-type stars.  results suggest that for planets around m stars, the ice-albedo effect issignificantly reduced, compared to planets around sun-like stars. including theeffects of an atmosphere further suppresses the sensitivity to the ice-albedoeffect. atmospheric key properties such as surface pressure, but also theabundance of radiative trace gases can considerably change the strength of theice-albedo feedback. for dense co2 atmospheres of the order of a few to tens ofbar, atmospheric rather than surface properties begin to dominate the planetaryradiation budget. at high co2 pressures, the ice-albedo feedback is stronglyreduced for planets around m stars. the presence of trace amounts of h2o andch4 in the atmosphere also weakens the ice-albedo effect for both stellar typesconsidered. for planets around sun-like stars, o3 could also lead to a verystrong decrease of the ice-albedo feedback at high co2 pressures.

1401.1122	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission xxv. corot-27b: a  massive and dense planet on a short-period orbit	we report the discovery of a massive and dense transiting planet corot-27b ona 3.58 day orbit around a 4.2 gyr-old g2 star. the planet candidate wasidentified from the corot photometry, and was confirmed as a planet withground-based spectroscopy.  the confirmation of the planet candidate is based on radial velocityobservations combined with imaging to rule out blends. the characterisation ofthe planet and its host star is carried out using a bayesian approach where allthe data (corot photometry, radial velocities, and spectroscopiccharacterisation of the star) are used jointly. the bayesian analysis includesa study whether the assumption of white normally distributed noise holds forthe corot photometry, and whether the use of a non-normal noise distributionoffers advantages in parameter estimation and model selection.  corot-27b has a mass of $10.39 \pm 0.55$ $\mathrm{m}_{\rm jup}$, a radius of$1.01 \pm 0.04$ $\mathrm{r}_{\rm jup}$, a mean density of$12.6_{-1.67}^{+1.92}$ $\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$, and an effective temperature of$1500 \pm 130$ k. the planet orbits around its host star, a 4.2 gyr-old g2-starwith a mass $m_{\star}=1.06$ $m_{\odot}$, and a radius $r_{\star}=1.05$$r_{\odot}$, on a $0.048 \pm 0.007$ au orbit every 3.58 days. the radialvelocity observations allow us to exclude highly eccentric orbits, namely,$e&lt;0.065$ with a 99% confidence. given its high mass and density, theoreticalmodelling of corot-27b is demanding. we identify two solutions with heavyelement mass fractions of $0.11\pm0.08$ $\mathrm{m_{\oplus}}$ and $0.07\pm0.06$$\mathrm{m_{\oplus}}$, but even solutions void of heavy elements cannot beexcluded.  we carry out a secondary eclipse search from the corot photometry using amethod based on bayesian model selection, but conclude that the noise level istoo high to detect eclipses shallower than 9% of the transit depth.

1412.1048	exoplanet science with the european extremely large telescope. the case  for visible and near-ir spectroscopy at high resolution	exoplanet science is booming. in 20 years our knowledge has expandedconsiderably, from the first discovery of a hot jupiter, to the detection of alarge population of neptunes and super-earths, to the first steps toward thecharacterization of exoplanet atmospheres. between today and 2025, the fieldwill evolve at an even faster pace with the advent of several space-basedtransit search missions, ground-based spectrographs, high-contrast imagingfacilities, and the james webb space telescope. especially the esa m-classplato mission will be a game changer in the field. from 2024 onwards, platowill find transiting terrestrial planets orbiting within the habitable zones ofnearby, bright stars. these objects will require the power of extremely largetelescopes (elts) to be characterized further. the technique of ground-basedhigh-resolution spectroscopy is establishing itself as a crucial pathway tomeasure chemical composition, atmospheric structure and atmospheric circulationin transiting exoplanets. a high-resolution spectrograph covering the visibleand near-ir domains, mounted on the european elt, will be able to detectmolecules such as water vapour, carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmospheres ofhabitable planets under favourable circumstances. e-elt hires is the perfectground-based match to the plato space mission and represents a uniqueopportunity for europe to lead the world into the era of exploration ofexoplanets with habitable conditions. hires will also be extremelycomplementary to other e-elt planned instruments specialising in differentkinds of planets, such as metis and epics.

0804.4134	warming the early earth - co2 reconsidered	despite a fainter sun, the surface of the early earth was mostly ice-free.proposed solutions to this so-called "faint young sun problem" have usuallyinvolved higher amounts of greenhouse gases than present in the modern-dayatmosphere. however, geological evidence seemed to indicate that theatmospheric co2 concentrations during the archaean and proterozoic were far toolow to keep the surface from freezing. with a radiative-convective modelincluding new, updated thermal absorption coefficients, we found that theamount of co2 necessary to obtain 273 k at the surface is reduced up to anorder of magnitude compared to previous studies. for the late archaean andearly proterozoic period of the earth, we calculate that co2 partial pressuresof only about 2.9 mb are required to keep its surface from freezing which iscompatible with the amount inferred from sediment studies. this conclusion wasnot significantly changed when we varied model parameters such as relativehumidity or surface albedo, obtaining co2 partial pressures for the latearchaean between 1.5 and 5.5 mb. thus, the contradiction between sediment dataand model results disappears for the late archaean and early proterozoic.

1504.01558	3d climate modeling of earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting different  types of host stars	the potential habitability of a terrestrial planet is usually defined by thepossible existence of liquid water on its surface. the potential presence ofliquid water depends on many factors such as, most importantly, surfacetemperatures. the properties of the planetary atmosphere and its interactionwith the radiative energy provided by the planet's host star are thereby ofdecisive importance. in this study we investigate the influence of differentmain-sequence stars upon the climate of earth-like extrasolar planets and theirpotential habitability by applying a 3d earth climate model accounting forlocal and dynamical processes. the calculations have been performed for planetswith earth-like atmospheres at orbital distances where the total amount ofenergy received from the various host stars equals the solar constant. incontrast to previous 3d modeling studies, we include the effect of ozoneradiative heating upon the vertical temperature structure of the atmospheres.the global orbital mean results obtained have been compared to those of a 1dradiative convective climate model. the different stellar spectral energydistributions lead to different surface temperatures and due to ozone heatingto very different vertical temperature structures. as previous 1d studies wefind higher surface temperatures for the earth-like planet around the k-typestar, and lower temperatures for the planet around the f-type star compared toan earth-like planet around the sun. however, this effect is more pronounced inthe 3d model results than in the 1d model because the 3d model accounts forfeedback processes such as the ice-albedo and the water vapor feedback. whetherthe 1d model may approximate the global mean of the 3d model results stronglydepends on the choice of the relative humidity profile in the 1d model, whichis used to determine the water vapor profile.

1505.07713	effect of o3 on the atmospheric temperature structure of early mars	ozone is an important radiative trace gas in the earth's atmosphere. thepresence of ozone can significantly influence the thermal structure of anatmosphere, and by this e.g. cloud formation. photochemical studies suggestthat ozone can form in carbon dioxide-rich atmospheres. we investigate theeffect of ozone on the temperature structure of simulated early martianatmospheres. with a 1d radiative-convective model, we calculatetemperature-pressure profiles for a 1 bar carbon dioxide atmosphere. ozoneprofiles are fixed, parameterized profiles. we vary the location of the ozonelayer maximum and the concentration at this maximum. the maximum is placed atdifferent pressure levels in the upper and middle atmosphere (1-10 mbar).results suggest that the impact of ozone on surface temperatures is relativelysmall. however, the planetary albedo significantly decreases at large ozoneconcentrations. throughout the middle and upper atmospheres, temperaturesincrease upon introducing ozone due to strong uv absorption. this heating ofthe middle atmosphere strongly reduces the zone of carbon dioxide condensation,hence the potential formation of carbon dioxide clouds. for high ozoneconcentrations, the formation of carbon dioxide clouds is inhibited in theentire atmosphere. in addition, due to the heating of the middle atmosphere,the cold trap is located at increasingly higher pressures when increasingozone. this leads to wetter stratospheres hence might increase water loss rateson early mars. however, increased stratospheric h2o would lead to more hox,which could efficiently destroy ozone. this result emphasizes the need forconsistent climate-chemistry calculations to assess the feedback betweentemperature structure, water content and ozone chemistry. furthermore,convection is inhibited at high ozone amounts, leading to a stably stratifiedatmosphere.

1507.01727	the unstable co2 feedback cycle on ocean planets	ocean planets are volatile rich planets, not present in our solar system,which are thought to be dominated by deep, global oceans. this results in theformation of high-pressure water ice, separating the planetary crust from theliquid ocean and, thus, also from the atmosphere. therefore, instead of acarbonate-silicate cycle like on the earth, the atmospheric carbon dioxideconcentration is governed by the capability of the ocean to dissolve carbondioxide (co2).  in our study, we focus on the co2 cycle between the atmosphere and the oceanwhich determines the atmospheric co2 content. the atmospheric amount of co2 isa fundamental quantity for assessing the potential habitability of the planet'ssurface because of its strong greenhouse effect, which determines the planetarysurface temperature to a large degree. in contrast to the stabilisingcarbonate-silicate cycle regulating the long-term co2 inventory of the earthatmosphere, we find that the co2 cycle feedback on ocean planets is negativeand has strong destabilising effects on the planetary climate. by using achemistry model for oceanic co2 dissolution and an atmospheric model forexoplanets, we show that the co2 feedback cycle can severely limit theextension of the habitable zone for ocean planets.

1511.04920	atmospheric effects of stellar cosmic rays on earth-like exoplanets  orbiting m-dwarfs	m-dwarf stars are generally considered favourable for rocky planet detection.however, such planets may be subject to extreme conditions due to possible highstellar activity. the goal of this work is to determine the potential effect ofstellar cosmic rays on key atmospheric species of earth-like planets orbitingin the habitable zone of m-dwarf stars and show corresponding changes in theplanetary spectra. we build upon the cosmic rays model scheme of grenfell etal. (2012), who considered cosmic ray induced nox production, by adding furthercosmic ray induced production mechanisms (e.g. for hox) and introducing primaryprotons of a wider energy range (16 mev - 0.5 tev). previous studies suggestedthat planets in the habitable zone that are subject to strong flaringconditions have high atmospheric methane concentrations, while their ozonebiosignature is completely destroyed. our current study shows, however, thatadding cosmic ray induced hox production can cause a decrease in atmosphericmethane abundance of up to 80\%. furthermore, the cosmic ray induced hoxmolecules react with nox to produce hno$_3$, which produces strong hno$_3$signals in the theoretical spectra and reduces nox-induced catalyticdestruction of ozone so that more than 25\% of the ozone column remains. hence,an ozone signal remains visible in the theoretical spectrum (albeit with aweaker intensity) when incorporating the new cosmic ray induced nox and hoxschemes, even for a constantly flaring m-star case. we also find that hno$_3$levels may be high enough to be potentially detectable. since ozoneconcentrations, which act as the key shield against harmful uv radiation, areaffected by cosmic rays via nox-induced catalytic destruction of ozone, theimpact of stellar cosmic rays on surface uv fluxes is also studied.

astro-ph;0208322	a dynamical study of the circumstellar gas in ux orionis	we present the results of a high spectral resolution study of thecircumstellar (cs) gas around the intermediate mass, pre-main sequence star uxori. the results are based on a set of 10 echelle spectra, monitoring the staron time scales of months, days and hours. a large number of transientblueshifted and redshifted absorption features are detected in the balmer andin many metallic lines. a multigaussian fit is applied to determine for eachtransient absorption the velocity, v, dispersion velocity, delta v, and theparameter r, which provides a measure of the absorption strength of the cs gas.the time evolution of those parameters is presented and discussed. a comparisonof intensity ratios among the transient absorptions suggests a solar-likecomposition of the cs gas. this confirms previous results and excludes a verymetal-rich environment as the cause of the transient features in ux ori. thefeatures can be grouped by their similar velocities into 24 groups, of which 17are redshifted and 7 blueshifted. an analysis of the velocity of the groupsallows us to identify them as signatures of the dynamical evolution of 7 clumpsof gas, of which 4 represent accretion events and 3 outflow events. most of theevents decelerate at a rate of tenths of ms-2, while 2 events accelerate atapproximately the same rate; one event is seen experiencing both anacceleration and a deceleration phase and lasts for a period of few days. thistime scale seems to be the typical duration of outflowing and infalling eventsin ux ori. the dispersion velocity and the relative aborption strength of thefeatures do not show drastic changes during the lifetime of the events, whichsuggests they are gaseous blobs preserving their geometrical and physicalidentity.

0810.4760	the bast algorithm for transit detection	the pioneer space mission for photometric exoplanet searches, corot, steadilymonitors about 12000 stars in each of its fields of view. transit detectionalgorithms are applied to derive promising planetary candidates, which are thenfollowed-up with ground-based observations. we present bast (berlin automaticsearch for transits), a new algorithm for periodic transit detection, and testit on simulated corot data. bast searches for box-shaped signals in normalized,filtered, variability-fitted, and unfolded light curves. a low-pass filter isapplied to remove high-frequency signals, and linear fits to subsections ofdata are subtracted to remove the star's variability. a search for periodicityis then performed in transit events identified above a given detectionthreshold. some criteria are defined to better separate planet candidates frombinary stars.  from the analysis of simulated corot light curves, we show that the bastdetection performance is similar to that of the box-fitting least-square (bls)method if the signal-to-noise ratio is high. however, the bast box search fortransits computes 10 times faster than the bls method. by adding periodictransits to simulated corot data, we show that the minimum periodic depthdetectable with bast is a linearly increasing function of the noise level. forlow-noise light curves, the detection limit corresponds to a transit depthd~0.01%, i.e. a planet of 1 earth radius around a solar-type star.
