0903.3988	bright strongly lensed galaxies at redshift z~ 6-7 behind the clusters  abell 1703 and cl0024+161	we report on the discovery of three bright, strongly-lensed objects behindabell 1703 and cl0024+16 from a dropout search over 25 square arcminutes ofdeep nicmos data, with deep acs optical coverage. they are undetected in thedeep acs images below 8500 a and have clear detections in the j and h bands.fits to the acs, nicmos and irac data yield robust photometric redshifts in therange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshiftinterlopers. all three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of brightknots. the bright i-band dropout in abell 1703 has an h-band ab magnitude of23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z&gt;5.5. ourmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with amass of ~ 1e10 solar mass. the dropout galaxy candidates behind cl0024+16 areseparated by 2.5" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have h-band ab magnitudesof 25.0 and 25.6. lensing models of cl0024+16 suggest that the objects havecomparable intrinsic magnitudes of ab ~ 27.3, approximately one magnitudefainter than l* at z~6.5. their similar redshifts, spectral energydistribution, and luminosities, coupled with their very close proximity on thesky, suggest that they are spatially associated, and plausibly are physicallybound. combining this sample with two previously reported, similarly magnifiedgalaxy candidates at z~6-8, we find that complex systems with dual nuclei maybe a common feature of high-redshift galaxies.

0909.1082	stellar masses of lyman break galaxies, lyman alpha emitters and radio  galaxies in overdense regions at z=4-6	we present new information on galaxies in the vicinity of luminous radiogalaxies and quasars at z=4,5,6. these fields were previously found to containoverdensities of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) or spectroscopic lyman alphaemitters. we use hst and spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast ourresults with large samples of lbgs in more average environments as probed bythe great observatories origins deep survey (goods). the following results wereobtained. first, lbgs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lieon a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.this is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[m*/msun] = 9-11) inwhich galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their starformation rate (sfr) increases. second, the two radio galaxies are among themost massive objects (log[m*/msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and areextremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimatedfrom the ~25x larger area goods survey. we suggest that the presence of thesemassive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapidaccretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. third, the total stellarmass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' tn1338 accounts for &lt;30% of the stellarmass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z&gt;4, based on acomparison with the massive x-ray cluster cl1252 at z=1.2. although futurenear-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies arecurrently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference isthat tn1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than cl1252. this raises theinteresting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z&gt;4remain yet to be discovered.

0909.1803	discovery of z~8 galaxies in the hudf from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  observations	we utilize the newly-acquired, ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations over the hudfto search for star-forming galaxies at z~8-8.5, only 600 million years fromrecombination, using a y_{105}-dropout selection. the new 4.7 arcmin**2 wfc3/irobservations reach to ~28.8 ab mag (5 sigma) in the y_{105}j_{125}h_{160}bands. these remarkable data reach ~1.5 ab mag deeper than the previous dataover the hudf, and now are an excellent match to the hudf optical acs data. forour search criteria, we use a two-color lyman-break selection technique toidentify z~8-8.5 y_{105}-dropouts. we find 5 likely z~8-8.5 candidates. thesources have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~28.3 ab mag and very blue uv-continuumslopes, with a median estimated beta of &lt;~-2.5 (where f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{\beta}). this suggests that z~8 galaxies are not only essentially dustfree but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. the observednumber of y_{105}-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20+/-6 sourcesexpected assuming no evolution from z~6, but is consistent with the 5 expectedextrapolating the bouwens et al. 2008 lf results to z~8. these results provideevidence that the evolution in the lf seen from z~7 to z~3 continues to z~8.the remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of wfc3/ir has enabled hst tocross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~8-9.

0909.1806	z~7 galaxies in the hudf: first epoch wfc3/ir results	we present a sample of 16 robust z~7 z-drop galaxies detected by the newlyinstalled wfc3/ir camera on the hubble space telescope. our analysis is basedon the first epoch data of the hudf09 program covering the hubble ultra deepfield with 60 orbits of y, j, and h observations. these remarkable data cover4.7 arcmin^2 and are the deepest nir images ever taken, reaching to ~29 mag ab(5 sigma). the 16 z~6.5-7.5 galaxies have been identified based on the lymanbreak technique utilizing (z-y) vs. (y-j) colors. they have magnitudes j =26.0-29.0 (ab), an average apparent half-light radius of ~0.16 arcsec (&lt;~1kpc), and show very blue colors (some even beta&lt;~-2.5), in particular at lowluminosities. the wfc3/ir data confirms previous nicmos detections indicatingthat the dropout selection at z~7 is very reliable. our data allow a firstdetermination of the faint end slope of the z~7 luminosity function, reachingdown to m_uv ~ -18, a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements. whenfixing phi*=1.4e-3/mpc^3/mag to the value previously measured at z~6, we find abest-fit value of alpha=-1.77+-0.20, with a characteristic luminosity ofm_*=-19.91+-0.09. this steep slope is similar to what is seen at z~2-6 andindicates that low luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate fluxto reionize the universe. the remarkable depth and resolution of these newimages provide insights into the coming power of jwst.

0909.4074	uv continuum slope and dust obscuration from z~6 to z~2: the star  formation rate density at high redshift	we provide a systematic measurement of the rest-frame uv continuum slope betaover a wide range in redshift (z~2-6) and rest-frame uv luminosity (0.1-2l*) toimprove estimates of the sfr density at high redshift. we utilize the deepoptical and infrared data (acs/nicmos) over the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields,as well as the udf for our primary ubvi "dropout" sample. we correct theobserved distributions for selection biases and photometric scatter. we findthat the uv-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantiallyredder at z~2-4 than it is at z~5-6. lower luminosity galaxies are also foundto be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z~2.5 and z~4. we do not find alarge number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections atz~4, and particularly at z&gt;~5, even though such sources could be readilyselected from our data. this suggests that star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~5 almostuniversally have very blue uv-continuum slopes, and that there are not likelyto be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z&gt;~5 that are missed in"dropout" searches. using the same relation between uv-continuum slope and dustextinction as found to be appropriate at z~0 and z~2, we estimate the averagedust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and uv luminosity in aconsistent way. we find that the estimated dust extinction increasessubstantially with cosmic time for the most uv luminous galaxies, but remainssmall (&lt;~2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. because these samelower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the uv, theoverall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts. we includethe contribution from ulirgs in our sfr density estimates at z~2-6, but findthat they contribute only ~20% of the total at z~2.5 and &lt;~10% at z&gt;~4.

0909.5183	structure and morphologies of z~7-8 galaxies from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  imaging of the hudf	we present a first morphological study of z~7-8 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)from oesch et al. 2009 and bouwens et al. 2009 detected in ultra-deepnear-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) by the hudf09program. with an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies arefound to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness ofmu_j ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7galaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. by comparison tolower redshift lbgs it is found that only little size evolution takes placefrom z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in theirapparent profiles. the average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 forgalaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52for (0.12-0.3)l*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comovingsizes. the peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.however, a tail of larger galaxies (&gt;~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towardslater cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhancedaccretion of cold gas. additionally, the average star-formation surface densityof lbgs with luminosities (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} is nearly constant at sigma_{sfr}=1.9msun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similarstar-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. the above evolutionarytrends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possiblyincomplete.

0910.0001	very blue uv-continuum slopes of low luminosity z~7 galaxies from  wfc3/ir: evidence for extremely low metallicities?	we use the ultra-deep wfc3/ir data over the hudf and the early releasescience wfc3/ir data over the cdf-south goods field to quantify the broadbandspectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. we determine theuv-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxiesat later times to measure the evolution in beta. for luminous l*(z=3) galaxies,we measure a mean uv-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable tothe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. however, for the lowerluminosity 0.1l*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. this issubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just800 myr later, and even at z~5-6. in principle, the observed beta of -3.0 canbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebularemission is included the expected beta becomes &gt;~-2.7. to produce these veryblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms toreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. for example, a largeescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}&gt;~0.3) could minimize the contribution from thisred nebular emission. if this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7galaxies is &gt;~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

0910.0838	ultradeep infrared array camera observations of sub-l* z~7 and z~8  galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field: the contribution of low-luminosity  galaxies to the stellar mass density and reionization	we study the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) mid-infrared (rest-frameoptical) fluxes of 14 newly wfc3/ir-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5z=8 y_{105}-dropout galaxies. the wfc3/ir depth and spatial resolution allowaccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable fluxmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. none of the galaxies are detected to[3.6]=26.9 (ab, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detectionfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the y_{105}-dropouts. weconstruct average broadband seds using the stacked acs, wfc3, and irac fluxesand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellarmasses, and ages. for the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},(u-v)_{rest}=0.4, reddening a_v=0, stellar mass m*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9m_sun (salpeter imf). the best-fit ages ~300myr, m/l_v=0.2, andssfr=1.7gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. the sub-l* galaxiesobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and underfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustainedreionization at 7&lt;z&lt;11. in contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} y_{105}-dropoutshave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-completereliance on far-uv data. adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the m/l(z=8), thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab} &lt; -18 declines fromrho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 m_sun mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) &lt; 8 x 10^5 m_sunmpc^{-3}, following (1+z)^{-6} over 3&lt;z&lt;8. lower masses at z=8 would signifymore dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper iracobservations, long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope.

0704.1507	hst/acs coronagraphic observations of the dust surrounding hd 100546	we present acs/hst coronagraphic observations of hd 100546, a b9.5 star, 103pc away from the sun, taken in the f435w, f606w, and f814w bands. scatteredlight is detected up to 14'' from the star. the observations are consistentwith the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination asthe inner disk. the well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and theytrail the rotating disk material. weaker arms never before reported are alsoseen. the inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become moreneutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with modelsthat assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. along the majordisk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \delta(f435w-f606w) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \delta (f435w-f814w)~0.5--1 mags. to explainthese colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, andlarge minimum sizes on ism-like grains. we conclude each of these hypotheses byitself cannot explain the colors. the disk colors are similar to those derivedfor kuiper belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible fortheir colors may be at work here. we argue that we are observing only thegeometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the opticallythick disk responsible for the far-ir emission is undetected. the observedspiral arms are then structures on this envelope. the colors indicate that theextended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocesseddisk material.

0911.1356	star formation rates and stellar masses of z=7-8 galaxies from irac  observations of the wfc3/ir ers and the hudf field	we investigate the spitzer/irac properties of 36 z~7 z-dropout galaxies and 3z~8 y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area wfc3/ir data of the earlyrelease science, the ultradeep hudf09, and wide-area nicmos data. we fitstellar population synthesis models to the seds to derive mean redshifts,stellar masses, and ages. the z~7 galaxies are best characterized bysubstantial ages (&gt;100 myr) and m/l_v~0.2. the main trend with decreasingluminosity is that of bluing of the far-uv slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.this can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowestluminosity galaxies (0.1 l*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth sfhs failto match the blue far-uv and moderately red h-[3.6] color. such colors mayrequire episodic sfhs with short periods of activity and quiescence ("on-off"cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. the stellar mass of oursample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with sfr according to log m* =8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log sfr, implying star formation may havecommenced at z&gt;10. no galaxies are found with sfrs much higher or lower thanthe past averaged sfr suggesting that the typical star formation timescales areprobably a substantial fraction of the hubble time. we report the first iracdetection of y-dropout galaxies at z~8. the average rest-frame u-v=0.3 (ab) ofthe 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar m/l. thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 is rho*(z=8) = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-1.0} x 10^6m_sun mpc^-3, following log rho*(z)= 10.6(+-0.6) - 4.4(+-0.7) log(1+z) [m_sunmpc^-3] over 3&lt;z&lt; 8.

0707.2782	mass-selection and the evolution of the morphology-density relation from  z=0.8 to z=0	we examined the morphology-density relations for galaxy samples selected byluminosity and by mass in each of five massive x-ray clusters from z=0.023 to0.83 for 674 spectroscopically-confirmed members. rest-frame optical colors andvisual morphologies were obtained primarily from hubble space telescope images.morphology-density relations (mdr) are derived in each cluster from a complete,luminosity-selected sample of 452 galaxies with a magnitude limit m_v &lt;m^{*}_{v} + 1. the change in the early-type fraction with redshift matchesprevious work for massive clusters of galaxies. we performed a similaranalysis, deriving mdrs for complete, mass-selected samples of 441 galaxieswith a mass-limit of 10^{10.6} m_{\sun}. our mass limit includes faint objects,the equivalent of =~1 mag below l^{*} for the red cluster galaxies, andencompasses =~70% of the stellar mass in cluster galaxies. the mdrs in themass-selected sample at densities of sigma &gt; 50 galaxies mpc^{-2} are similarto those in the luminosity-selected sample but show larger early-typefractions. however, the trend with redshift in the fraction of elliptical ands0 galaxies with masses &gt; 10^{10.6} m_{\sun} differs significantly between themass- and luminosity-selected samples. the clear trend seen in the early-typefraction from z=0 to z=~ 0.8 is not found in mass-selected samples. theearly-type galaxy fraction changes much less, and is consistent with beingconstant at 92% +/- 4% at \sigma&gt; 500 galaxies mpc^{-2} and 83 +/- 3% at 50 &lt;\sigma &lt; 500 galaxies mpc^{-2}. this suggests that galaxies of mass lower than&gt; 10^{10.6} m_{\sun} play a significant role in the evolution of the early-typefraction in luminosity-selected samples.

0707.2787	the evolution of the field and cluster morphology-density relation for  mass-selected samples of galaxies	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and photometric/spectroscopic surveys inthe goods-south field (the chandra deep field-south, cdfs) are used toconstruct volume-limited, stellar mass-selected samples of galaxies atredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. the cdfs sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 contains 207 galaxies completedown to m=4x10^10 msol (for a ``diet'' salpeter imf), corresponding to aluminosity limit for red galaxies of m_b=-20.1. the sdss sample at0.020&lt;z&lt;0.045 contains 2003 galaxies down to the same mass limit, whichcorresponds to m_b=-19.3 for red galaxies. morphologies are determined with anautomated method, using the sersic parameter n and a measure of the residualfrom the model fits, called ``bumpiness'', to distinguish differentmorphologies. these classifications are verified with visual classifications.in agreement with previous studies, 65-70% of the galaxies are located on thered sequence, both at z~0.03 and at z~0.8. similarly, 65-70% of the galaxieshave n&gt;2.5. the fraction of e+s0 galaxies is 43+/-3%$ at z~0.03 and 48+/-7% atz~0.8, i.e., it has not changed significantly since z~0.8. when combined withrecent results for cluster galaxies in the same redshift range, we find thatthe morphology-density relation for galaxies more massive than 0.5m* hasremained constant since at least z~0.8. this implies that galaxies evolve inmass, morphology and density such that the morphology-density relation does notchange. in particular, the decline of star formation activity and theaccompanying increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies since z~1must happen without large changes in the early-type galaxy fraction in a givenenvironment.

0912.4263	a candidate redshift z ~ 10 galaxy and rapid changes in that population  at an age of 500 myr	searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded alarge sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years(myr) after the big bang (redshifts 6 &gt; z &gt; 3; ref. 1). the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10,11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. observations ofz ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z &gt; 9-10. here we usethe full two-year hudf09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 myr after the bigbang. not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we showthat, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is muchsmaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 myr later at z ~ 8. thisdemonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased inboth luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. the 100-200myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliestgalaxies.

1004.0384	the galaxy luminosity function during the reionization epoch	the new wide field camera 3/ir observations on the hubble ultra-deep fieldstarted investigating the properties of galaxies during the reionization epoch.to interpret these observations, we present a novel approach inspired by theconditional luminosity function method. we calibrate our model to observationsat z=6 and assume a non-evolving galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation.we first compare model predictions against the luminosity function measured atz=5 and z=4. we then predict the luminosity function at z&gt;=7 under the soleassumption of evolution in the underlying dark-matter halo mass function. ourmodel is consistent with the observed z&gt;6.5 galaxy number counts in the hudfsurvey and suggests a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of theluminosity function: alpha(z&gt;8)&lt; -1.9 compared to alpha=-1.74 at z=6. althoughwe currently see only the brightest galaxies, a hidden population of lowerluminosity objects (l/l_{*}&gt; 10^{-4}) might provide &gt;75% of the totalreionizing flux. assuming escape fraction f_{esc}~0.2, clumping factor c~5, topheavy-imf and low metallicity, galaxies below the detection limit producecomplete reionization at z&gt;8. for solar metallicity and normal stellar imf,reionization finishes at z&gt;6, but a smaller c/f_{esc} is required for anoptical depth consistent with the wmap measurement. our model highlights thatthe star formation rate in sub-l_* galaxies has a quasi-linear relation todark-matter halo mass, suggesting that radiative and mechanical feedback wereless effective at z&gt;6 than today.

1005.1661	the evolution of the uv luminosity function from z ~ 0.75 to z ~ 2.5  using hst ers wfc3/uvis observations	we present uv luminosity functions (lfs) at 1500 angstrom derived from thehst early release science wfc3/uvis data acquired over ~50 arcmin^2 of thegoods-south field. the lfs are determined over the entire redshift rangez=0.75-2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts forlyman break galaxies (lbgs): (1) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshiftsto study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropoutsamples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. thecharacteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistentwith earlier work. however, the other schechter function parameters, thefaint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constantover the range z=0.75-2.5. using these lf determinations we find the uvluminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} fromz~0 to its peak at z~2.5. strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our lfsare all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift lbg studies.since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatterwith alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expectedflattening occurs. despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggestalpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. these new results from such a shallow earlydataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of wfc3/uvis for thethorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift rangez~0.5 to z~3.

1006.4360	uv luminosity functions from 132 z~7 and z~8 lyman-break galaxies in the  ultra-deep hudf09 and wide-area ers wfc3/ir observations	we identify 73 z~7 and 59 z~8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch,and use this large 26-29.4 ab mag sample of galaxies to derive very deepluminosity functions to &lt;-18 ab mag and the star formation rate density at z~7and z~8. the galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated lyman-breaktechnique on the full two-year wfc3/ir and acs data available over the hudf09(~29.4 ab mag, 5 sigma), two nearby hudf09 fields (~29 ab mag, 14 arcmin) andthe wider area ers (~27.5 ab mag) ~40 arcmin**2). the application of strictoptical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low(just ~7% in the hudf). this very low value includes a full assessment of thecontamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, agn, spurioussources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., sne). from careful modelling ofthe selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosityfunctions for galaxies at z~7 and z~8 to &lt;-18 ab mag. the faint-end slopesalpha at z~7 and z~8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 andalpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. such steep slopes contrast to the localalpha&lt;~-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z~4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05.with such steep slopes (alpha&lt;~-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate thegalaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. the star formationrate densities derived from these new z~7 and z~8 luminosity functions areconsistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). we findreasonable consistency, with the sfr densities implied from reported stellarmass densities, being only ~40% higher at z&lt;7. this suggests that (1) thestellar mass densities inferred from the spitzer irac photometry are reasonablyaccurate and (2) that the imf at very high redshift may not be very differentfrom that at later times.

1006.5453	the age spread of quiescent galaxies with the newfirm medium-band  survey: identification of the oldest galaxies out to z~2	with a complete, mass-selected sample of quiescent galaxies from the newfirmmedium-band survey (nmbs), we study the stellar populations of the oldest andmost massive galaxies (&gt;10^11 msun) to high redshift. the sample includes 570quiescent galaxies selected based on their extinction-corrected u-v colors outto z=2.2, with accurate photometric redshifts, sigma_z/(1+z)~2%, and rest-framecolors, sigma_u-v~0.06 mag. we measure an increase in the intrinsic scatter ofthe rest-frame u-v colors of quiescent galaxies with redshift. this scatter incolor arises from the spread in ages of the quiescent galaxies, where we seeboth relatively quiescent red, old galaxies and quiescent blue, youngergalaxies towards higher redshift. the trends between color and age areconsistent with the observed composite rest-frame spectral energy distributions(seds) of these galaxies. the composite seds of the reddest and bluestquiescent galaxies are fundamentally different, with remarkably well-defined4000a- and balmer-breaks, respectively. some of the quiescent galaxies may beup to 4 times older than the average age- and up to the age of the universe, ifthe assumption of solar metallicity is correct. by matching the scatterpredicted by models that include growth of the red sequence by thetransformation of blue galaxies to the observed intrinsic scatter, the dataindicate that most early-type galaxies formed their stars at high redshift witha burst of star formation prior to migrating to the red sequence. the observedu-v color evolution with redshift is weaker than passive evolution predicts;possible mechanisms to slow the color evolution include increasing amounts ofdust in quiescent galaxies towards higher redshift, red mergers at z&lt;1, and afrosting of relatively young stars from star formation at later times.

1007.2422	active and passive galaxies at z~2: rest-frame optical morphologies with  wfc3	we use the high angular resolution in the near-infrared of the wfc3 on hst todetermine yhvz color-color selection criteria to identify and characterize1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5 galaxies in the hudf09 and ers (goods-south) fields. the wfc3 nirimages reveal galaxies at these redshifts that were undetected in therest-frame uv hudf/goods images, as well as true centers and regular disks ingalaxies classified as highly irregular in rest-frame uv light. across the1.5&lt;z&lt;2.15 redshift range, regular disks are unveiled in the wfc3 images of~25% of both intermediate and high mass galaxies, i.e., above 10^10 msun.meanwhile, galaxies maintaining diffuse and/or irregular morphologies in therest-frame optical light---i.e., not yet dynamically settled---at these epochsare almost entirely restricted to masses below 10^11 msun. in contrast at 2.25&lt; z &lt; 3.5 these diffuse and/or irregular structures overwhelmingly dominate themorphological mix in both the intermediate and high mass regimes, while noregular disks, and only a small fraction (25%) of smooth spheroids, are evidentabove 10^11 msun. strikingly, by 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.25 roughly 2 out of every 3galaxies at the highest masses are spheroids. in our small sample, the fractionof star-forming galaxies at these mass scales decreases concurrently from ~60%to ~5%. if confirmed, this indicates that z~2 is the epoch of both themorphological transformation and quenching of star-formation which assemble thefirst substantial population of massive ellipticals.

1011.2764	the simple survey: observations, reduction, and catalog	we present the spitzer irac/musyc public legacy survey in the extendedcdf-south (simple), which consists of deep irac observations covering the~1,600 arcmin^2 area surrounding goods-s. the limiting magnitudes of the simpleirac mosaics typically are 23.8, 23.6, 21.9, and 21.7, at 3.6 um, 4.5 um, 5.8um, and 8.0 um, respectively (5-sigma total point source magnitudes in ab). thesimple irac images are combined with the 10'x15' goods irac mosaics in thecenter. we give detailed descriptions of the observations, data reduction, andproperties of the final images, as well as the detection and photometry methodsused to build a catalog. using published optical and near-infrared data fromthe multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc), we construct an irac-selectedcatalog, containing photometry in ubvriz'jhk, [3.6 um], [4.5 um], [5.8 um], and[8.0 um]. the catalog contains 43,782 sources with s/n &gt; 5 at 3.6 um, 19,993 ofwhich have 13-band photometry. we compare this catalog to the publiclyavailable musyc and fireworks catalogs and discuss the differences. using ahigh signal-to-noise sub-sample of 3,391 sources with ([3.6] + [4.5])/2 &lt; 21.2,we investigate the star formation rate history of massive galaxies out to z ~1.8. we find that at z ~ 1.8 at least 30% +/-7% of the most massive galaxies(mstar &gt; 10^11 msol) are passively evolving, in agreement with earlier resultsfrom surveys covering less area.

1105.2038	lower-luminosity galaxies could reionize the universe: very steep  faint-end slopes to the uv luminosity functions at z&gt;=5-8 from the hudf09  wfc3/ir observations	the hudf09 data are the deepest near-ir observations ever, reaching to 29.5mag. luminosity functions (lf) from these new hudf09 data for 132 z\sim7 andz\sim8 galaxies are combined with new lfs for z\sim5-6 galaxies and the earlierz\sim4 lf to reach to very faint limits (&lt;0.05 l*(z=3)). the faint-end slopesalpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z\sim5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z\sim6), -2.01+/-0.21(z\sim7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z\sim8). slopes alpha\lesssim-2 lead to formallydivergent uv fluxes, though galaxies are not expected to form below \sim-10 abmag. these results have important implications for reionization. the weightedmean slope at z\sim6-8 is -1.87+/-0.13. for such steep slopes, and a faint-endlimit of -10 ab mag, galaxies provide a very large uv ionizing photon flux.while current results show that galaxies can reionize the universe by z\sim6,matching the thomson optical depths is more challenging. extrapolating thecurrent lf evolution to z&gt;8, taking alpha to be -1.87+/-0.13 (the mean value atz\sim6-8), and adopting typical parameters, we derive thomson optical depths of0.061_{-0.006}^{+0.009}. however, this result will change if the faint-endslope alpha is not constant with redshift. we test this hypothesis and find aweak, though uncertain, trend to steeper slopes at earlier times(dalpha/dz\sim-0.05+/-0.04), that would increase the thomson optical depths to0.079_{-0.017}^{+0.063}, consistent with recent wmap estimates(tau=0.088+/-0.015). it may thus not be necessary to resort to extremeassumptions about the escape fraction or clumping factor. nevertheless, theuncertainties remain large. deeper wfc3/ir+acs observations can furtherconstrain the ionizing flux from galaxies.

1105.2297	expanded search for z~10 galaxies from hudf09, ers, and candels data:  evidence for accelerated evolution at z&gt;8?	we search for z~10 galaxies over ~160 arcmin^2 of wfc3/ir data in the chandradeep field south, using the public hudf09, ers, and candels surveys, that reachto 5sigma depths ranging from 26.9 to 29.4 in h_160 ab mag. z&gt;~9.5 galaxycandidates are identified via j_125-h_160&gt;1.2 colors and non-detections in anyband blueward of j_125. spitzer irac photometry is key for separating thegenuine high-z candidates from intermediate redshift (z~2-4) galaxies withevolved or heavily dust obscured stellar populations. after removing 16 sourcesof intermediate brightness (h_160~24-26 mag) with strong irac detections, weonly find one plausible z~10 galaxy candidate in the whole data set, previouslyreported in bouwens et al. (2011). the newer data cover a 3x larger area andprovide much stronger constraints on the evolution of the uv luminosityfunction (lf). if the evolution of the z~4-8 lfs is extrapolated to z~10, sixz~10 galaxies are expected in our data. the detection of only one sourcesuggests that the uv lf evolves at an accelerated rate before z~8. theluminosity density is found to increase by more than an order of magnitude inonly 170 myr from z~10 to z~8. this increase is &gt;=4x larger than expected fromthe lower redshift extrapolation of the uv lf. we are thus likely witnessingthe first rapid build-up of galaxies in the heart of cosmic reionization.future deep hst wfc3/ir data, reaching to well beyond 29 mag, can enable a morerobust quantification of the accelerated evolution around z~10.

1109.0994	uv-continuum slopes at z~4-7 from the hudf09+ers+candels observations:  discovery of a well-defined uv-color magnitude relationship for z&gt;=4  star-forming galaxies	ultra-deep acs and wfc3/ir hudf+hudf09 data, along with the wide-areagoods+ers+candels data over the cdf-s goods field, are used to measure uvcolors, expressed as the uv-continuum slope beta, of star-forming galaxies overa wide range in luminosity (0.1l*(z=3) to 2l*(z=3)) at high redshift (z~7 toz~4). beta is measured using all acs and wfc3/ir passbands uncontaminated byly_alpha and spectral breaks. extensive tests show that our beta measurementsare only subject to minimal biases. using a different selection procedure,dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their beta measurements. toreconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found thatbeta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the samepassbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta.high-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame uv color-magnitude (cm)relationship that becomes systematically bluer towards fainter uv luminosities.no evolution is seen in the slope of the uv cm relationship in the first 1.5gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero-point to redder colors fromz~7 to z~4. this suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-definedsequence in the l(uv)-color (beta) plane (a "star-forming sequence"?). dustappears to be the principal factor driving changes in the uv color (beta) withluminosity. these new larger beta samples lead to improved dust extinctionestimates at z~4-7 and confirm that the extinction is still essentially zero atlow luminosities and high redshifts. inclusion of the new dust extinctionresults leads to (i) excellent agreement between the sfr density at z~4-8 andthat inferred from the stellar mass density, and (ii) to higher ssfrs at z&gt;~4,suggesting the ssfr may evolve modestly (by factors of ~2) from z~4-7 to z~2.

1201.0755	the bright end of the uv luminosity function at z~8: new constraints  from candels data in goods-south	we present new z~8 galaxy candidates from a search over ~95 arcmin^2 ofwfc3/ir data, tripling the previous search area for bright z~8 galaxies. ouranalysis uses newly acquired wfc3/ir imaging data from the candels multi-cycletreasury program over the goods south field. these new data are combined withexisting deep optical acs imaging to search for relatively bright (m_uv &lt; -19.5mag) z~8 galaxy candidates using the lyman break technique. these newcandidates are used to determine the bright end of the uv luminosity function(lf) of star-forming galaxies at z~8. to minimize contamination from lowerredshift galaxies, we make full use of all optical acs data and impose strictnon-detection criteria based on an optical chi^2_opt flux measurement. in thewhole search area we identify 16 candidate z~8 galaxies, spanning a magnituderange h_160 = 25.7-27.9 mag. the new data show that the uv lf is a factor ~1.7xlower at m_uv &lt; -19.5 mag than determined from the hudf09 and ers data alone.combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the hudf09 and ersdata allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the z~8 uv lf yet.schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best-fitcharacteristic magnitude of m*(z=8) = -20.04+-0.46 mag. the faint-end slope isvery steep, though quite uncertain, with alpha = -2.06+-0.32. a combination ofwide area data with additional ultra-deep imaging will be required tosignificantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future.

1209.3037	the spectral energy distributions of z~8 galaxies from the irac ultra  deep fields: emission lines, stellar masses, and specific star formation  rates at 650 myr	using new ultradeep spitzer/irac photometry from the irac ultradeep fieldprogram (iudf), we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 63y-dropout galaxy candidates at z~8, only 650myr after the big bang. the sourcesare selected from hst/acs+wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field (hudf),two hudf parallel fields, and wide area data over the candels/goods-south. thenew spitzer/irac data increase the coverage at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron to~120h over the hudf reaching depths of ~28 (ab,1 sigma). the improved depth andinclusion of brighter candidates result in direct &gt;3 sigma irac detections of20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at &gt; 5 sigma. the average[3.6]-[4.5] colors of irac detected galaxies at z~8 are markedly redder thanthose at z~7, observed only 130myr later. the simplest explanation is that wewitness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular[oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) moving through the irac bandpasses with redshift.assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z~7 and z~8we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of w([oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) = 670(+260,-170) angstrom contributing 0.56 (+0.16,-0.11) mag to the 4.5 micronfilter at z~8. the corresponding w(halpha) = 430 (+160,-110) angstrom impliesan average specific star formation rate of ssfr = 11 (+11,-5) gyr^-1 and astellar population age of 100 (+100,-50) myr. correcting the spectral energydistribution for the contribution of emission lines lowers the average best-fitstellar masses and mass-to-light ratios by x3, decreasing the integratedstellar mass density to rho*(z=8,muv&lt;-18)=0.6 (+0.4,-0.3) x 10^6 msun mpc^-3.

1211.1010	a rest-frame optical view on z~4 galaxies i: color and age distributions  from deep irac photometry of the iudf10 and goods surveys	we present a study of rest-frame uv-to-optical color distributions for z~4galaxies based on the combination of deep hst/acs+wfc3/ir data withspitzer/irac imaging. in particular, we use new, ultra-deep data from the iracultradeep field program (iudf10). our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxiesselected as b-dropout lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the hudf and one of itsdeep parallel fields, the hudf09-2, as well as goods-north and south. thissample is used to investigate the uv continuum slopes beta and balmer breakcolors (j_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. the [4.5]filter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame opticalemission lines. we find that galaxies at m_z&lt;-21.5 (roughly corresponding tol*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. theuv continuum slopes and the j_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. the mostsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at theseredshifts is better described by an smc-like extinction curve, rather than thetypically assumed calzetti reddening. after correcting for dust, we find thatthe galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function ofluminosity. in contrast to some results from the literature, we find that onlya small fraction of galaxies shows balmer break colors which are consistentwith extremely young ages, younger than 100 myr. under the assumption of smoothstar-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies atm_z&lt;-19.75. our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars anddust in galaxies at z&gt;4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed inshort, intense bursts of star-formation.

1211.3105	photometric constraints on the redshift of z~10 candidate udfj-39546284  from deeper wfc3/ir+acs+irac observations over the hudf	ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations on the hudf from the hudf09 program revealedjust one plausible z~10 candidate udfj-39546284. udfj-39546284 had all theproperties expected of a galaxy at z~10 showing (1) no detection in the deepacs+wfc3 imaging data blueward of the f160w band, exhibiting (2) a bluespectral slope redward of the break, and showing (3) no prominent detection indeep irac observations. the new, similarly deep wfc3/ir hudf12 f160wobservations over the hudf09/xdf allow us to further assess this candidate.these observations show that this candidate, previously only detected at ~5.9sigma in a single band, clearly corresponds to a real source. it is detected at~5.3 sigma in the new h-band data and at ~7.8 sigma in the full 85-orbit h-bandstack. interestingly, the non-detection of the source (&lt;1 sigma) in the newf140w observations suggests a higher redshift. formally, the best-fit redshiftof the source utilizing all the wfc3+acs (and irac+k-band) observations is11.8+/-0.3. however, we consider the z~12 interpretation somewhat unlikely,since the source would either need to be ~20x more luminous than expected orshow very high-ew ly-alpha emission (which seems improbable given the extensiveneutral gas prevalent early in the reionization epoch). lower-redshiftsolutions fail if only continuum models are allowed. plausible lower-redshiftsolutions require that the h-band flux be dominated by line emission such ashalpha or [oiii] with extreme ews. the tentative detection of line emission at1.6 microns in udfj-39546284 in a companion paper suggests that such emissionmay have already been found.

1301.6162	probing the dawn of galaxies at z~9-12: new constraints from hudf12/xdf  and candels data	we present a comprehensive analysis of z&gt;8 galaxies based on ultra-deepwfc3/ir data. we constrain the evolution of the uv luminosity function (lf) andluminosity densities from z~11 to z~8 by exploiting all the wfc3/ir data overthe hubble ultra-deep field from the hudf09 and the new hudf12 program, inaddition to the hudf09 parallel field data, as well as wider area wfc3/irimaging over goods-south. galaxies are selected based on the lyman breaktechnique in three samples centered around z~9, z~10 and z~11, with seven z~9galaxy candidates, and one each at z~10 and z~11. we confirm a new z~10candidate (with z=9.8+-0.6) that was not convincingly identified in our firstz~10 sample. the deeper data over the hudf confirms all our previous z&gt;~7.5candidates as genuine high-redshift candidates, and extends our samples tohigher redshift and fainter limits (h_160~29.8 mag). we perform one of thefirst estimates of the z~9 uv lf and improve our previous constraints at z~10.extrapolating the lower redshift uv lf evolution should have revealed 17 z~9and 9 z~10 sources, i.e., a factor ~3x and 9x larger than observed. theinferred star-formation rate density (sfrd) in galaxies above 0.7 m_sun/yrdecreases by 0.6+-0.2 dex from z~8 to z~9, in good agreement with previousestimates. the low number of sources found at z&gt;8 is consistent with a veryrapid build-up of galaxies across z~10 to z~8. from a combination of allcurrent measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10x decrease in thesfrd from z~8 to z~10, following (1+z)^(-11.4+-3.1). our measurements thusconfirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z~8, andsignify a rapid build-up of galaxies with m_uv&lt;-17.7 within only ~200 myr fromz~10 to z~8, in the heart of cosmic reionization.

1309.2280	the most luminous z~9-10 galaxy candidates yet found: the luminosity  function, cosmic star-formation rate, and the first mass density estimate at  500 myr	[abridged] we present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (h_160 ~ 26 -27 mag ab) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete hst candels wfc3/irgoods-n imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that areknown, just ~500 myr after the big bang. two similarly bright sources are alsodetected in a systematic re-analysis of the goods-s data set. three of the fourgalaxies in goods-n are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deepspitzer/irac 4.5 micron data, as is one of the goods-s candidates. furthermore,the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat uv spectral energy distribution with aslope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity athigh redshift. the abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that theluminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in l_* at z&gt;~8with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formationrate density for galaxies with sfr &gt;0.7 m_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitudeincrease in only 170 myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previousresults. based on the irac detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 m_sun. the cosmicstellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 m_sun mpc^-3 forgalaxies brighter than m_uv~-18. the remarkable brightness, and henceluminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deepspectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value ofadditional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation inthe very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for jwst to map thebuildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

0802.2506	discovery of a very bright strongly-lensed galaxy candidate at z ~ 7.6	using hst and spitzer irac imaging, we report the discovery of a very brightstrongly lensed lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidate at z~7.6 in the field of themassive galaxy cluster abell 1689. the galaxy candidate, which we refer to asa1689-zd1, shows a strong z-j break of at least 2.2 mag and is completelyundetected (&lt;1 sigma) in hst/acs g, r, i, and z-band data. these properties,combined with the very blue j-h and h-[4.5] colors, are exactly the propertiesof an z~7.6 lbg and can only be reasonably fit by a star-forming galaxy atz=7.6 +/- 0.4. attempts to reproduce these properties with a model galaxy atz&lt;4 yield particularly poor fits. a1689-zd1 has an observed (lensed) magnitudeof 24.7 ab (8 sigma) in the nicmos h band and is ~1.3 mag brighter than thebrightest-known z-dropout galaxy. when corrected for the cluster magnificationof 9.3 at z~7.6, the candidate has an intrinsic magnitude of h=27.1 ab, orabout an l* galaxy at z~7.6. the source-plane deprojection shows that the starformation is occurring in compact knots of size ~&lt;300 pc. the best-fit stellarpopulation synthesis models yield a median redshift of 7.6, stellar masses(1.6-3.9) x 10^9 m_sun, stellar ages 45-320 myr, star-formation rates ~&lt;7.6m_sun/yr, and low reddening with a_v &lt;= 0.3. these properties are generallysimilar to those of lbgs found at z~5-6. the inferred stellar ages suggest aformation redshift of z~8-10 (t~&lt;0.63 gyr). a1689-zd1 is the brightestobserved, highly reliable z&gt;7.0 galaxy candidate found to date.

1403.4295	uv luminosity functions at redshifts z~4 to z~10: 10000 galaxies from  hst legacy fields	the remarkable hst datasets from the candels, hudf09, hudf12, ers, andborg/hippies programs have allowed us to map out the evolution of the uv lffrom z~10 to z~4. we have identified 5859, 3001, 857, 481, 217, and 6 galaxycandidates at z~4, z~5, z~6, z~7, z~8, and z~10, respectively from the ~1000arcmin**2 area probed. the selection of z~4-8 galaxies over the five candelsfields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations areapparent at z&gt;=7. our new lf determinations at z~4 and z~5 span a 6-magbaseline (-22.5 to -16 ab mag). these determinations agree well with previousestimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a morereliable sampling of &gt;l* galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the uvlfs. our new lf results strengthen our earlier findings to 3.4 sigmasignificance for a steeper faint-end slope to the uv lf at z&gt;4, with alphaevolving from alpha=-1.64+/-0.04 at z~4 to alpha=-2.06+/-0.13 at z~7 (and alpha= -2.02+/-0.23 at z~8), consistent with that expected from the evolution of thehalo mass function. with our improved constraints at the bright end, we findless evolution in the characteristic luminosity m* over the redshift range z~4to z~7; the observed evolution in the lf is now largely represented by changesin phi*. no evidence for a non-schechter-like form to the z~4-8 lfs is found. asimple conditional lf model based on halo growth and evolution in the m/l ratioof halos ((1+z)**-1.5) provides a good representation of the observedevolution.

1407.7316	measurement of galaxy clustering at z~7.2 and the evolution of galaxy  bias from 3.8&lt;z&lt;8 in the xdf, goods-s and goods-n	lyman-break galaxy (lbg) samples observed during reionization ($z\gtrsim6$)with hubble space telescope's wide field camera 3 are reaching sizes sufficientto characterize their clustering properties. using a combined catalog from thehubble extreme deep field and candels surveys, containing $n=743$ lbgcandidates at z&gt;6.5 at a mean redshift of $z=7.2$, we detect a clear clusteringsignal in the angular correlation function (acf) at $\sim4\sigma$,corresponding to a real-space correlation length$r_{0}=6.7^{+0.9}_{-1.0}h^{-1}$cmpc. the derived galaxy bias$b=8.6^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ is that of dark-matter halos of$m=10^{11.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}}$m$_{\odot}$ at $z=7.2$, and highlights that galaxiesbelow the current detection limit ($m_{ab}\sim-17.7$) are expected inlower-mass halos ($m\sim10^{8}-10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$). we compute the acf oflbgs at $z\sim3.8-z\sim5.9$ in the same surveys. a trend of increasing bias isfound from $z=3.8$ ($b\sim3.0$) to $z=7.2$ ($b\sim8.6$), broadly consistentwith galaxies at fixed luminosity being hosted in dark-matter halos of similarmass at $4&lt;z&lt;6$, followed by a slight rise in halo masses at $z\sim7$($\sim2\sigma$ confidence). separating the data at the median luminosity of the$z=7.2$ sample ($m_{uv}=-19.4$) shows higher clustering at $z=5.9$ for brightgalaxies ($r_{0}=5.5^{+1.4}_{-1.5}h^{-1}$cmpc, $b=6.2^{+1.2}_{-1.5}$) comparedto faint galaxies ($r_{0}=1.9^{+1.1}_{-1.0}h^{-1}$cmpc, $b=2.7\pm1.2$) implyinga constant mass-to-light ratio $\frac{dlogm}{dlogl}\sim1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.8}$. asimilar trend is present in the $z=7.2$ sample with larger uncertainty.finally, our bias measurements allow us to investigate the fraction ofdark-matter halos hosting uv-bright galaxies (the duty-cycle, $\epsilon_{dc}$).at $z=7.2$ values near unity are preferred, which may be explained by theshortened halo assembly time at high-redshift.

1409.1228	first frontier field constraints on the cosmic star-formation rate  density at z~10 - the impact of lensing shear on completeness of  high-redshift galaxy samples	we search the complete hubble frontier field dataset of abell 2744 and itsparallel field for z~10 sources to further refine the evolution of the cosmicstar-formation rate density (sfrd) at z&gt;8. we independently confirm two imagesof the recently discovered triply-imaged z~9.8 source by zitrin et al. (2014)and set an upper limit for similar z~10 galaxies with red colors ofj_125-h_160&gt;1.2 in the parallel field of abell 2744. we utilize extensivesimulations to derive the effective selection volume of lyman-break galaxies atz~10, both in the lensed cluster field and in the adjacent parallel field.particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear toaccurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly-magnifiedsources. we show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness ata given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the criticalcurves. these effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on thedetectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantiallyreduce the expected number of highly-magnified sources. the detections andlimits from both pointings result in a sfrd which is higher by 0.4+-0.4 dexthan previous estimates at z~10 from blank fields. nevertheless, thecombination of these new results with all other estimates remain consistentwith a rapidly declining sfrd in the 170 myr from z~8 to z~10 as predicted bycosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in lambdacdm. oncebiases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for,the full six cluster and parallel frontier field program will be an extremelypowerful new dataset to probe the evolution of the galaxy population at z&gt;8before the advent of the jwst.

1502.03887	the impact of strong gravitational lensing on observed lyman-break  galaxy numbers at 4&lt;z&lt;8 in the goods and the xdf blank fields	detection of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at high-redshift can be affected bygravitational lensing induced by foreground deflectors not only in galaxyclusters, but also in blank fields. we quantify the impact of strongmagnification in the samples of $b$, $v$, $i$, $z$ $\&amp;$ $y$ lbgs ($4\lesssim z\lesssim8$) observed in the xdf and goods/candels fields, by investigating theproximity of dropouts to foreground objects. we find that $\sim6\%$ of brightlbgs ($m_{h_{160}}&lt;26$) at $z\sim7$ have been strongly lensed ($\mu&gt;2$) byforeground objects. this fraction decreases from $\sim 3.5\%$ at $z\sim6$ to$\sim1.5\%$ at $z\sim4$. since the observed fraction of strongly lensedgalaxies is a function of the shape of the luminosity function (lf), it can beused to derive schechter parameters, $\alpha$ and $m_{\star}$, independentlyfrom galaxy number counts. our magnification bias analysis yieldsschechter-function parameters in close agreement with those determined fromgalaxy counts albeit with larger uncertainties. extrapolation of our analysisto $z\gtrsim 8$ suggests that future surveys with jswt, wfirst and euclidshould find excess lbgs at the bright-end, even if there is an intrinsicexponential cutoff of number counts. finally, we highlight how themagnification bias measurement near the detection limit can be used as probe ofthe population of galaxies too faint to be detected. preliminary results usingthis novel idea suggest that the magnification bias at $m_{uv}\sim -18$ is notas strong as expected if $\alpha\lesssim -1.7$ extends well below the currentdetection limits in the xdf. at face value this implies a flattening of the lfat $m_{uv}\gtrsim-16.5$. however, selection effects and completeness estimatesare difficult to quantify precisely. thus, we do not rule out a steep lfextending to $m_{uv}\gtrsim -15$.

1502.05399	a spectroscopic redshift measurement for a luminous lyman break galaxy  at z=7.730 using keck/mosfire	we present a spectroscopic redshift measurement of a very bright lyman breakgalaxy at z=7.7302+-0.0006 using keck/mosfire. the source was pre-selectedphotometrically in the egs field as a robust z~8 candidate with h=25.0 magbased on optical non-detections and a very red spitzer/irac [3.6]-[4.5]broad-band color driven by high equivalent width [oiii]+hbeta line emission.the lyalpha line is reliably detected at 6.1 sigma and shows an asymmetricprofile as expected for a galaxy embedded in a relatively neutralinter-galactic medium near the planck peak of cosmic reionization. the line hasa rest-frame equivalent width of ew0=21+-4 a and is extended withv_fwhm=360+90-70 km/s. the source is perhaps the brightest and most massive z~8lyman break galaxy in the full candels and borg/hippies surveys, havingassembled already 10^(9.9+-0.2) m_sol of stars at only 650 myr after the bigbang. the spectroscopic redshift measurement sets a new redshift record forgalaxies. this enables reliable constraints on the stellar mass, star-formationrate, formation epoch, as well as combined [oiii]+hbeta line equivalent widths.the redshift confirms that the irac [4.5] photometry is very likely dominatedby line emission with ew0(oiii+hbeta)= 720-150+180 a. this detection thus addsto the evidence that extreme rest-frame optical emission lines are a ubiquitousfeature of early galaxies promising very efficient spectroscopic follow-up inthe future with infrared spectroscopy using jwst and, later, elts.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

1503.08228	reionization after planck: the derived growth of the cosmic ionizing  emissivity now matches the growth of the galaxy uv luminosity density	thomson optical depth tau measurements from planck provide new insights intothe reionization of the universe. in pursuit of model-independent constraintson the properties of the ionising sources, we determine the empirical evolutionof the cosmic ionizing emissivity. we use a simple two-parameter model to mapout the evolution in the emissivity at z&gt;~6 from the new planck optical depthtau measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectraand from the prevalence of ly-alpha emission in z~7-8 galaxies. we find theredshift evolution in the emissivity dot{n}_{ion}(z) required by theobservations to be d(log nion)/dz=-0.15(-0.11)(+0.08), largely independent ofthe assumed clumping factor c_{hii} and entirely independent of the nature ofthe ionising sources. the trend in dot{n}_{ion}(z) is well-matched by theevolution of the galaxy uv-luminosity density (dlog_{10}rho_uv/dz=-0.11+/-0.04) to a magnitude limit &gt;~-13 mag, suggesting thatgalaxies are the sources that drive the reionization of the universe. the roleof galaxies is further strengthened by the conversion from the uv luminositydensity rho_uv to dot(n)_{ion}(z) being possible for physically-plausiblevalues of the escape fraction f_{esc}, the lyman-continuum photon productionefficiency xi_{ion}, and faint-end cut-off $m_{lim}$ to the luminosityfunction. quasars/agn appear to match neither the redshift evolution nornormalization of the ionizing emissivity. based on the inferred evolution inthe ionizing emissivity, we estimate that the z~10 uv-luminosity density is8(-4)(+15)x lower than at $z~6, consistent with the observations. the presentapproach of contrasting the inferred evolution of the ionizing emissivity withthat of the galaxy uv luminosity density adds to the growing observationalevidence that faint, star-forming galaxies drive the reionization of theuniverse.

0705.3394	low star formation rates for z=1 early-type galaxies in the very deep  goods-mips imaging: implications for their optical/near-infrared spectral  energy distributions	we measure the obscured star formation in z~1 early-type galaxies. thisconstrains the influence of star formation on their optical/near-ir colors,which, we found, are redder than predicted by the model by bruzual &amp; charlot(2003). from deep acs imaging we construct a sample of 95 morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies in the hdf-n and cdf-s with spectroscopicredshifts in the range 0.85&lt;z&lt;1.15. we measure their 24 micron fluxes from thedeep goods-mips imaging and derive the ir luminosities and star formationrates. the fraction of galaxies with &gt;2 sigma detections (~25 mujy} is17(-4,+9)%. of the 15 galaxies with significant detections at least six have anagn. stacking the mips images of the galaxies without significant detectionsand adding the detected galaxies without agn we find an upper limit on the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of 5.2+/-3.0 msol yr^-1, and on the mean specific sfrof 4.6+/-2.2 * 10^-11 yr^-1. under the assumption that the average sfr willdecline at the same rate as the cosmic average, the in situ growth in stellarmass of the early-type galaxy population is less than 14+/-7% between z=1 andthe present. we show that the typically low ir luminosity and sfr imply thatthe effect of obscured star formation (or agn) on their rest-frameoptical/near-ir seds is negligible for ~90% of the galaxies in our sample.hence, their optical/near-ir colors are most likely dominated by evolvedstellar populations. this implies that the colors predicted by the bruzual &amp;charlot (2003) model for stellar populations with ages similar to those of z~1early-type galaxies (~1-3 gyr) are most likely too blue, and that stellarmasses of evolved, high-redshift galaxies can be overestimated by up to afactor of ~2.

astro-ph;0312511	acs observations of a strongly lensed arc in a field elliptical	we report the discovery of a strongly lensed arc system around a fieldelliptical galaxy in hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys(acs) images of a parallel field observed during nicmos observations of the hstultra-deep field. the acs parallel data comprise deep imaging in the f435w,f606w, f775w, and f850lp bandpasses. the main arc is at a radius of 1.6 arcsecfrom the galaxy center and subtends about 120 deg. spectroscopic follow-up atmagellan observatory yields a redshift z=0.6174 for the lensing galaxy, and wephotometrically estimate z_phot = 2.4\pm0.3 for the arc. we also identify alikely counter-arc at a radius of 0.6 arcsec, which shows structure similar tothat seen in the main arc. we model this system and find a good fit to anelliptical isothermal potential of velocity dispersion $\sigma \approx 300$\kms, the value expected from the fundamental plane, and some external shear.several other galaxies in the field have colors similar to the lensing galaxyand likely make up a small group.

astro-ph;0403167	star formation at z~6: the udf-parallel acs fields	we report on the i-dropouts detected in two exceptionally deep acs fields(b_{435}, v_{606}, i_{775}, and z_{850} with 10 sigma limits of 28.8, 29.0,28.5, and 27.8, respectively) taken in parallel with the udf nicmosobservations. using an i-z&gt;1.4 cut, we find 30 i-dropouts over 21 arcmin^2 downto z_ab=28.1, or 1.4 i-dropouts arcmin^{-2}, with significant field-to-fieldvariation (as expected from cosmic variance). this extends i-dropout searchessome ~0.9^m further down the luminosity function than was possible in the goodsfield, netting a ~7x increase in surface density. an estimate of the sizeevolution for uv bright objects is obtained by comparing the composite radialflux profile of the bright i-dropouts (z&lt;27.2) with scaled versions of thehdf-n + hdf-s u-dropouts. the best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-1.57_{-0.53}^{+0.50}} scaling in size (for fixed luminosity), extending lower redshift(1&lt;z&lt;5) trends to z~6. adopting this scaling and the brighter i-dropouts fromboth goods fields, we make incompleteness estimates and construct a z~6 lf inthe rest-frame continuum uv (~1350 a) over a 3.5 magnitude baseline, finding ashape consistent with that found at lower redshift. to evaluate the evolutionin the lf from z~3.8, we make comparisons against different scalings of a lowerredshift b-dropout sample. though a strong degeneracy is found betweenluminosity and density evolution, our best-fit model scales as (1+z)^{-2.8} innumber and (1+z)^0.1 in luminosity, suggesting a rest-frame continuum uvluminosity density at z~6 which is just 0.38_{-0.07} ^{+0.09}x that at z~3.8.our inclusion of size evolution makes the present estimate lower than previousz~6 estimates.

astro-ph;0406562	galaxy size evolution at high redshift and surface brightness selection  effects: constraints from the hubble ultra deep field	we use the exceptional depth of the ultra deep field (udf) and udf-parallelacs fields to study the sizes of high redshift (z~2-6) galaxies and addresslong-standing questions about possible biases in the cosmic star formation ratedue to surface brightness dimming. contrasting b, v, and i-dropout samplesculled from the deeper data with those obtained from the shallower goodsfields, we demonstrate that the shallower data are essentially complete atbright magnitudes to z&lt;5.5 and that the principal effect of depth is to addobjects at the magnitude limit. this indicates that high redshift galaxies arecompact in size (~0.1-0.3") and that large (&gt;0.4", &gt;3 kpc) low surfacebrightness galaxies are rare. a simple comparison of the half-light radii ofthe hdf-n + hdf-s u-dropouts with b, v, and i-dropouts from the udf shows thatthe sizes follow a (1+z)^{-1.05+/-0.21} scaling towards high redshift. a morerigorous measurement compares different scalings of our u-dropout sample withthe mean profiles for a set of intermediate magnitude (26.0&lt;z_{850,ab}&lt;27.5)i-dropouts from the udf. the best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-0.94_{-0.25}^{+0.19}} size scaling (for fixed luminosity). this result is then verified byrepeating this experiment with different size measures, low redshift samples,and magnitude ranges. very similar scalings are found for all comparisons. arobust measurement of size evolution is thereby demonstrated for galaxies fromz~6 to z~2.5 using data from the udf.

astro-ph;0406613	ultra compact dwarf galaxies in abell 1689: a photometric study with the  acs	the properties of ultra compact dwarf (ucd) galaxy candidates in abell 1689(z=0.183) are investigated, based on deep high resolution acs images. a ucdcandidate has to be unresolved, have i&lt;28 (m_v&lt;-11.5) mag and satisfy colorlimits derived from bayesian photometric redshifts. we find 160 ucd candidateswith 22&lt;i&lt;28 mag. it is estimated that about 100 of these are cluster members,based on their spatial distribution and photometric redshifts. for i&gt;26.8 mag,the radial and luminosity distribution of the ucd candidates can be explainedwell by abell 1689's globular cluster (gc) system. for i&lt;26.8 mag, there is anoverpopulation of 15 +/- 5 ucd candidates with respect to the gc luminosityfunction. for i&lt;26 mag, the radial distribution of ucd candidates is moreconsistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the gc system of abell1689. the ucd candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar tothat of abell 1689's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter byabout 2-3 mag. two of the three brightest ucd candidates (m_v ~ -17 mag) areslightly resolved. at the distance of abell 1689, these two objects would haveking-profile core radii of ~35 pc and r_eff ~300 pc, implying luminosities andsizes 2-3 times those of m32's bulge. additional photometric redshifts obtainedwith late type stellar and elliptical galaxy templates support the assignmentof these two resolved sources to abell 1689. our findings imply that in abell1689 there are at least 10 ucds with m_v&lt;-12.7 mag. compared to the ucds in thefornax cluster they are brighter, larger and have colors closer to normal dwarfgalaxies. this suggests that they may be in an intermediate stage of thestripping process. spectroscopy is needed to definitely confirm the existenceof ucds in abell 1689.

astro-ph;0407644	the luminosity function of early-type galaxies at z~0.75	we measure the luminosity function of morphologically selected e/s0 galaxiesfrom $z=0.5$ to $z=1.0$ using deep high resolution advanced camera for surveysimaging data. our analysis covers an area of $48\box\arcmin$ (8$\times$ thearea of the hdf-n) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ($i\sim24$ mag) than waspossible in the deep groth strip survey (dgss). at $0.5&lt;z&lt;0.75$, we find$m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.1\pm0.3$ and $\alpha=-0.53\pm0.2$, and at$0.75&lt;z&lt;1.0$, we find $m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.4\pm0.2$. these luminosityfunctions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosityfunction using morphological selection (e.g., dgss), but are much steeper thanthe luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies likethe color or spectral energy distribution (e.g., cfrs, cadis, or combo-17). thedifference is due to the `blue', $(u-v)_0&lt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies, which make up to$\sim30%$ of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faintgalaxies. we thereby demonstrate the need for {\it both morphological andstructural information} to constrain the evolution of galaxies.  we find that the `blue' e/s0 galaxies have the same average sizes and sersicparameters as the `red', $(u-v)_0&gt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies at brighter luminosities($m_b&lt;-20.1$), but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where`blue' galaxies are both smaller and have lower sersic parameters. fits of thecolors to stellar population models suggest that most e/s0 galaxies have shortstar-formation time scales ($\tau&lt;1$ gyr), and that galaxies have formed at anincreasing rate from $z\sim8$ until $z\sim2$ after which there has been agradual decline.

astro-ph;0502228	mass-to-light ratios of field early-type galaxies at z~1 from ultra-deep  spectroscopy: evidence for mass-dependent evolution	we present an analysis of the fundamental plane for a sample of 27 fieldearly-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.15. the galaxies in thissample have high s/n spectra obtained at the vlt and high resolution imagingfrom the acs. we find that the mean evolution in m/l of our sample is $delta ln(m/l_b) = -1.74+/-0.16z$, with a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter. this value canbe too low by 0.3 due to selection effects, resulting in $delta ln (m/l_b) =-1.43+/-0.16z$. the strong correlation between m/l and rest-frame colorindicates that the observed scatter is not due to measurement errors, but dueto intrinsic differences between the stellar populations of the galaxies. thispace of evolution is much faster than the evolution of cluster galaxies.however, we find that the measured m/l evolution strongly depends on galaxymass. for galaxies with masses $m&gt;2 x 10^11 msol$, we find no significantdifference between the evolution of field and cluster galaxies: $delta ln(m/l_b) = -1.20+/-0.18z for field galaxies and $delta ln (m/l_b) =-1.12+/-0.06z$ for cluster galaxies. the relation between the measured m/levolution and mass is partially due to selection effects. however, even whentaking selection effects into account, we still find a relation between m/levolution and mass, which is most likely caused by a lower mean age and alarger intrinsic scatter for low mass galaxies. results from lensing early-typegalaxies, which are mass-selected, show a very similar trend with mass. this,combined with our findings, provides evidence for down-sizing. previous studiesof the rate of evolution of field early-type galaxies found a large range ofmutually exclusive values. we show that these differences are largely caused bythe differences between fitting methods.

astro-ph;0503365	evolution in the cluster early-type galaxy size-surface brightness  relation at z =~ 1	we investigate the evolution in the distribution of surface brightness, as afunction of size, for elliptical and s0 galaxies in the two clusters rdcsj1252.9-2927, z=1.237 and rx j0152.7-1357, z=0.837. we use multi-color imagingwith the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope to determinethese sizes and surface brightnesses. using three different estimates of thesurface brightnesses, we find that we reliably estimate the surface brightnessfor the galaxies in our sample with a scatter of &lt; 0.2 mag and with systematicshifts of \lesssim 0.05 mag. we construct samples of galaxies with early-typemorphologies in both clusters. for each cluster, we use a magnitude limit in aband which closely corresponds to the rest-frame b, to magnitude limit of m_b =-18.8 at z=0, and select only those galaxies within the color-magnitudesequence of the cluster or by using our spectroscopic redshifts. we measureevolution in the rest-frame b surface brightness, and find -1.41 \+/- 0.14 magfrom the coma cluster of galaxies for rdcs j1252.9-2927 and -0.90 \+/- 0.12 magof evolution for rx j0152.7-1357, or an average evolution of (-1.13 \+/- 0.15)z mag. our statistical errors are dominated by the observed scatter in thesize-surface brightness relation, sigma = 0.42 \+/- 0.05 mag for rxj0152.7-1357 and sigma = 0.76 \+/- 0.10 mag for rdcs j1252.9-2927. we find nostatistically significant evolution in this scatter, though an increase in thescatter could be expected. overall, the pace of luminosity evolution we measureagrees with that of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies, implying thatthe majority of massive early-type galaxies observed at z =~ 1 formed at highredshifts.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.

astro-ph;0503454	distant red galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field	we take advantage of the hubble ultra deep field (udf) data to study therestframe optical and ultra violet (uv) morphologies of the novel population ofdistant red galaxies (drgs). six galaxies with j-ks &gt; 2.3 are found to ks=21.5,five of which have photometric redshifts z_phot &gt; 2, corresponding to a surfacedensity of 0.9/arcmin^2. the surface brightness distributions of the z_phot &gt; 2galaxies are better represented by exponential disks than r^{1/4}-laws. two ofthe z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies are extended, while three have compact morphologies.the restframe optical morphology of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies is quite differentfrom the restframe uv morphology: all the galaxies have red central componentswhich dominate in the nicmos h_{160}-band images, and distinct off-center bluefeatures which show up in (and often dominate) the acs images. the meanmeasured effective radius of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies is &lt;r_e&gt; =1.9+/-1.4 kpc,similar (within the errors) to the mean size of lbgs at similar redshifts. allthe drgs are resolved in the acs images, while four are resolved in the nicmosimages. two of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies are bright x-ray sources and hence hostagn. the diverse restframe optical and uv morphological properties of drgsderived here suggest that they have complex stellar populations, consisting ofboth evolved populations that dominate the mass and the restframe opticallight, and younger populations, which show up as patches of star formation inthe restframe uv light; in many ways resembling the properties of normal localgalaxies. this interpretation is supported by fits to the broadband seds, whichfor all five z_phot &gt; 2 are best represented by models with extended starformation histories and substantial amounts of dust.

astro-ph;0509104	submillimeter observations of distant red galaxies: uncovering the 1mjy  850um-population	we present a study of the submillimeter (submm) emission of distant redgalaxies (drgs). the drgs are selected by the criterion (j-k)&gt;2.3, and aregenerally massive galaxies at redshifts higher than 2, with red rest-frameoptical colors. using a deep scuba submm image of a field centred on thecluster ms1054-03, we obtain a statistical detection of the drgs at redshiftz=2-3.5, with an average 850um flux density of 1.11+-0.28mjy. the detectionimplies an average star formation rate (sfr) of 127+-34 m_sun/yr (lensingcorrected), assuming that the far-infrared (fir) spectral energy distribution(sed) is well-described by a modified blackbody. the sfr derived from the submmagrees well with sfrs derived from sed fitting of optical-near-infrared dataand average x-ray emission. constant star formation models imply ages of 2gyr,extinction a_v=2.4 mag, which is consistent with the fir to rest-frame opticalluminosity ratio of ~15. drgs are older and have lower sfrs relative to opticalluminosity than (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies, although their firluminosities are similar. the drgs at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 and the extremely red objects((i-k)&gt;4) at 1&lt;z&lt;2, which were also investigated, contribute 5.7 and 5.9 jydeg^-2 respectively to the submm background. simple estimates suggest thatthese populations contribute ~50% of the flux from sources with 0.5 &lt; f_850 &lt; 5mjy, which is where the peak of energy is produced. we have therefore uncoveredone of the most important populations of galaxies contributing to the sub-mmbackground.

astro-ph;0509308	clustering of star-forming galaxies near a radio galaxy at z=5.2	we present hst/acs observations of the most distant radio galaxy known, tnj0924-2201 at z=5.2. this radio galaxy has 6 spectroscopically confirmed lyaemitting companion galaxies, and appears to lie within an overdense region. theradio galaxy is marginally resolved in i_775 and z_850 showing continuumemission aligned with the radio axis, similar to what is observed for lowerredshift radio galaxies. both the half-light radius and the uv star formationrate are comparable to the typical values found for lyman break galaxies atz~4-5. the lya emitters are sub-l* galaxies, with deduced star formation ratesof 1-10 msun/yr. one of the lya emitters is only detected in lya. based on thestar formation rate of ~3 msun/yr calculated from lya, the lack of continuumemission could be explained if the galaxy is younger than ~2 myr and isproducing its first stars.  observations in v_606, i_775, and z_850 were used to identify additionallyman break galaxies associated with this structure. in addition to the radiogalaxy, there are 22 v-break (z~5) galaxies with z_850&lt;26.5 (5sigma), two ofwhich are also in the spectroscopic sample. we compare the surface density of2/arcmin^2 to that of similarly selected v-dropouts extracted from goods andthe udf parallel fields. we find evidence for an overdensity to very highconfidence (&gt;99%), based on a counts-in-cells analysis applied to the controlfield. the excess is suggestive of the v-break objects being associated with aforming cluster around the radio galaxy.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.

astro-ph;0703288	automated selection and characterization of emission-line sources in acs  wfc grism data	we present complimentary techniques to find emission-line targets and measuretheir properties in a semi-automated fashion from grism observations obtainedwith the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubble space telescope. thefirst technique is to find all likely sources in a direct image, extract theirspectra and search them for emission lines. the second method is to look foremission-line sources as compact structures in an unsharp masked version of thegrism image. using these methods we identify 46 emission-line targets in thehubble deep field north using a modest (3 orbit) expenditure of hst observingtime. grism spectroscopy is a powerful tool for efficiently identifyinginteresting low luminosity, moderate redshift emission-line field galaxies. thesources found here have a median i band flux 1.5 mag fainter than thespectroscopic redshift catalog of cohen et al. they have redshift z &lt;= 1.42,high equivalent widths (typically ew &gt; 100{\aa}), and are usually less luminousthan the characteristic luminosity at the same redshift. the chief obstacle ininterpreting the results is line identification, since the majority of sourceshave a single emission line and the spectral resolution is low. photometricredshifts are useful for providing a first guess redshift. however, even at thedepth of the state-of-the-art data used here, photometric errors can result inuncertainties in line identifications, especially for sources with i &gt; ~24.5abmag. reliable line identification for the faintest emission-line galaxiesrequires additional ground-based spectroscopy for confirmation. of particularconcern are the faint high ew [oii] emitters which could represent a stronglyevolving galaxy population if the possibility that they are mis-identifiedlower redshift interlopers can be ruled out.
