0903.4455	a spatially resolved inner hole in the disk around gm aurigae	we present 0.3 arcsec resolution observations of the disk around gm aurigaewith the submillimeter array (sma) at a wavelength of 860 um and with theplateau de bure interferometer at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. these observationsprobe the distribution of disk material on spatial scales commensurate with thesize of the inner hole predicted by models of the spectral energy distribution.the data clearly indicate a sharp decrease in millimeter optical depth at thedisk center, consistent with a deficit of material at distances less than ~20au from the star. we refine the accretion disk model of calvet et al. (2005)based on the unresolved spectral energy distribution (sed) and demonstrate thatit reproduces well the spatially resolved millimeter continuum data at bothavailable wavelengths. we also present complementary sma observations of coj=3-2 and j=2-1 emission from the disk at 2" resolution. the observed comorphology is consistent with the continuum model prediction, with twosignificant deviations: (1) the emission displays a larger co j=3-2/j=2-1 lineratio than predicted, which may indicate additional heating of gas in the upperdisk layers; and (2) the position angle of the kinematic rotation patterndiffers by 11 +/- 2 degrees from that measured at smaller scales from the dustcontinuum, which may indicate the presence of a warp. we note thatphotoevaporation, grain growth, and binarity are unlikely mechanisms forinducing the observed sharp decrease in opacity or surface density at the diskcenter. the inner hole plausibly results from the dynamical influence of aplanet on the disk material. warping induced by a planet could also potentiallyexplain the difference in position angle between the continuum and co datasets.

0909.1345	stringent limits on the polarized submillimeter emission from  protoplanetary disks	we present arcsecond-resolution submillimeter array (sma) polarimetricobservations of the 880 um continuum emission from the protoplanetary disksaround two nearby stars, hd 163296 and tw hydrae. although previousobservations and theoretical work have suggested that a 2-3% polarizationfraction should be common for the millimeter continuum emission from suchdisks, we detect no polarized continuum emission above a 3-sigma upper limit of7 mjy in each arcsecond-scale beam, or &lt;1% in integrated continuum emission. wecompare the sma upper limits with the predictions from the exploratory cho &amp;lazarian (2007) model of polarized emission from t tauri disks threaded bytoroidal magnetic fields, and rule out their fiducial model at the ~10-sigmalevel. we explore some potential causes for this discrepancy, focusing on modelparameters that describe the shape, magnetic field alignment, and sizedistribution of grains in the disk. we also investigate related effects likethe magnetic field strength and geometry, scattering off of large grains, andthe efficiency of grain alignment, including recent advances in grain alignmenttheory, which are not considered in the fiducial model. we discuss the impacteach parameter would have on the data and determine that the suppression ofpolarized emission plausibly arises from rounding of large grains, reducedefficiency of grain alignment with the magnetic field, and/or some degree ofmagnetic field tangling (perhaps due to turbulence). a poloidal magnetic fieldgeometry could also reduce the polarization signal, particularly for a face-onviewing geometry like the tw hya disk. the data provided here offer the moststringent limits to date on the polarized millimeter-wavelength emission fromdisks around young stars.

0909.3386	prosac: a submillimeter array survey of low-mass protostars. ii. the  mass evolution of envelopes, disks, and stars from the class 0 through i  stages	the key question about early protostellar evolution is how matter is accretedfrom the large-scale molecular cloud, through the circumstellar disk onto thecentral star. a sample of 20 class 0 and i protostars has been observed incontinuum at (sub)millimeter wavelengths at high angular resolution with thesubmillimeter array. using detailed dust radiative transfer models, we havedeveloped a framework for disentangling the continuum emission from theenvelopes and disks, and from that estimated their masses. for the class isources in the sample, hco+ 3-2 line emission has furthermore been observedwith the submillimeter array. four of these sources show signs of keplerianrotation, constraining the masses of the central stars. both class 0 and iprotostars are surrounded by disks with typical masses of about 0.05 m_sun. noevidence is found for a correlation between the disk mass and evolutionarystage of the young stellar objects. this contrasts the envelope mass, whichdecreases sharply from 1 m_sun in the class 0 stage to &lt;0.1 m_sun in the classi stage. typically, the disks have masses that are 1-10% of the correspondingenvelope masses in the class 0 stage and 20-60% in the class i stage. for theclass i sources for which keplerian rotation is seen, the central stars contain70-98% of the total mass in the star-disk-envelope system, confirming thatthese objects are late in their evolution through the embedded protostellarstages. theoretical models tend to overestimate the disk masses relative to thestellar masses in the late class i stage. the results argue in favor of apicture in which circumstellar disks are formed early during the protostellarevolution and rapidly process material accreted from the larger scale envelopeonto the central star.

1004.0158	grain growth across protoplanetary discs: 10-micron silicate feature  versus millimetre slope	young stars are formed within dusty discs. the grains in the disc areoriginally of the same size as interstellar dust. models predict that thesegrains will grow in size through coagulation. observations of the silicatefeatures at micron wavelengths are consistent with growth to micron sizeswhereas the slope of the sed at longer wavelengths traces growth up to mmsizes. we here look for a correlation between these two grain growthindicators. a large sample of t-tauri and herbig-ae/be stars was observed withthe spitzer space telescope at 5-13 micron; a subsample was observed at mmwavelengths. we complement this subsample with data from the literature tomaximise the overlap between micron and mm observations and search forcorrelations. synthetic spectra are produced to determine which processes mayproduce the dust evolution. dust disc masses in the range &lt;1 to 7 x 10^-4 msunare obtained. most sources have a mm spectral slope consistent with graingrowth. there is a tentative correlation between the 10-micron silicate featureand the mm slope of the sed. the observed sources seem to be grouped perstar-forming region in the micron-vs-mm diagram. the modelling results showthat the 10-micron feature becomes flatter and subsequently the mm slopebecomes shallower. grain size distributions shallower than that of the ismand/or bright central stars are required to explain specific features. settlingof larger grains towards the disc midplane affects the 10-micron feature, buthardly the mm slope. the tentative correlation between the strength of the10-micron feature and the mm slope suggests that the inner and outer discevolve simultaneously. dust with a mass dominated by mm-sized grains isrequired to explain the shallowest mm slopes. other processes besides graingrowth may also be responsible for the removal of small grains.

0708.1020	evidence for a population of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies from  interferometric imaging	we have used the submillimeter array to image a flux limited sample of sevensubmillimeter galaxies, selected by the aztec camera on the jcmt at 1.1 mm, inthe cosmos field at 890um with 2" resolution. all of the sources - tworadio-bright and five radio-dim - are detected as single point-sources at highsignificance (&gt; 6\sigma), with positions accurate to 0.2" that enablecounterpart identification at other wavelengths observed with similarly highangular resolution. all seven have irac counterparts, but only two have securecounterparts in deep hst/acs imaging. as compared to the two radio-brightsources in the sample, and those in previous studies, the five radio-dimsources in the sample (1) have systematically higher submillimeter-to-radioflux ratios, (2) have lower irac 3.6-8.0um fluxes, and (3) are not detected at24um. these properties, combined with size constraints at 890um (\theta &lt;1.2"), suggest that the radio-dim submillimeter galaxies represent a populationof very dusty starbursts, with physical scales similar to local ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, and an average redshift higher than radio-bright sources.

1202.3992	evidence for multiple pathways to deuterium enhancements in  protoplanetary disks	the distributions of deuterated molecules in protoplanetary disks areexpected to depend on the molecular formation pathways. we use observations ofspatially resolved dcn emission from the disk around tw hya, acquired duringalma science verification with a ~3" synthesized beam, together with comparabledco+ observations from the submillimeter array, to investigate differences inthe radial distributions of these species and hence differences in theirformation chemistry. in contrast to dco+, which shows an increasing columndensity with radius, dcn is better fit by a model that is centrally peaked. weinfer that dcn forms at a smaller radii and thus at higher temperatures thandco+. this is consistent with chemical network model predictions of dco+formation from h2d+ at t&lt;30 k and dcn formation from additional pathwaysinvolving ch2d+ at higher temperatures. we estimate a dcn/hcn abundance ratioof ~0.017, similar to the dco+/hco+ abundance ratio. deuterium fractionationappears to be efficient at a range of temperatures in this protoplanetary disk.these results suggest caution in interpreting the range of deuterium fractionsobserved in solar system bodies, as multiple formation pathways should be takeninto account.

1203.6353	a resolved census of millimeter emission from taurus multiple star  systems	we present a high angular resolution millimeter-wave dust continuum imagingsurvey of circumstellar material associated with individual components of 23multiple star systems in the taurus-auriga young cluster. combined withprevious measurements, these new data permit a comprehensive look at howmillimeter luminosity (a tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation andmass of a stellar companion. approximately one third (28-37%) of individualstars in multiples have detectable millimeter emission, a rate half that forsingle stars (~62%). there is a strong correlation between the luminosity andprojected separation (a_p) of a stellar pair. wide pairs (a_p &gt; 300 au) have asimilar luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (a_p ~ 30-300 au)are a factor of 5 fainter, and close pairs (a_p &lt; 30 au) are ~ 5 times fainteryet (aside from a small population of bright circumbinary disks). in mostcases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a widetertiary in triples), but there is no clear relationship between luminosity andstellar mass ratio. a direct comparison of resolved disk sizes with predictionsfrom tidal truncation models yields mixed results; some disks are larger thanexpected given their companion separations. we suggest that the presence of astellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the internalevolution mechanisms operating in isolated systems, with both the multiple starformation process itself and star-disk tidal interactions likely playingimportant roles in the evolution of disk material. from the perspective of themass content of the disk, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibitedaround the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as likely asfor single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in hierarchicaltriples) in more widely-separated multiple star systems.

1208.1285	kinematics of the co gas in the inner regions of the tw hya disk	we present a detailed analysis of the spatially and spectrally resolved 12coj=2-1 and j=3-2 emission lines from the tw hya circumstellar disk, based onscience verification data from the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array(alma). these lines exhibit substantial emission in their high-velocity wings(with projected velocities out to 2.1 km/s, corresponding to intrinsic orbitalvelocities &gt;20 km/s) that trace molecular gas as close as 2 au from the centralstar. however, we are not able to reproduce the intensity of these wings andthe general spatio-kinematic pattern of the lines with simple models for thedisk structure and kinematics. using three-dimensional non-local thermodynamicequilibrium molecular excitation and radiative transfer calculations, weconstruct some alternative models that successfully account for these featuresby modifying either (1) the temperature structure of the inner disk (inside thedust-depleted disk cavity; r &lt; 4 au); (2) the intrinsic (keplerian) diskvelocity field; or (3) the distribution of disk inclination angles (a warp).the latter approach is particularly compelling because a representative warpeddisk model qualitatively reproduces the observed azimuthal modulation ofoptical light scattered off the disk surface. in any model scenario, the almadata clearly require a substantial molecular gas reservoir located inside theregion where dust optical depths are known to be substantially diminished inthe tw hya disk, in agreement with previous studies based on infraredspectroscopy. the results from these updated model prescriptions are discussedin terms of their potential physical origins, which might include dynamicalperturbations from a low-mass companion with an orbital separation of a few au.

1209.4407	a disk-based dynamical mass estimate for the young binary v4046 sgr	we present sensitive, arcsecond-resolution submillimeter array observationsof the 12co j=2-1 line emission from the circumstellar disk orbiting thedouble-lined spectroscopic binary star v4046 sgr. based on a simple model ofthe disk structure, we use a novel monte carlo markov chain technique toextract the keplerian velocity field of the disk from these data and estimatethe total mass of the central binary. assuming the distance inferred fromkinematic parallax measurements in the literature (d is approximately 73 pc),we determine a total stellar mass m_star = 1.75^{+0.09}_{-0.06} solar massesand a disk inclination i_d = 33.5^{+0.7}_{-1.4} degrees from face-on. thesemeasurements are in excellent agreement with independent dynamical constraintsmade from multi-epoch monitoring of the stellar radial velocities, confirmingthe absolute accuracy of this precise (~ few percent uncertainties) disk-basedmethod for estimating stellar masses and reaffirming previous assertions thatthe disk and binary orbital planes are well aligned (with |i_d - i_star|\approx 0.1\pm1 degree). using these results as a reference, we demonstratethat various pre-main sequence evolution models make consistent and accuratepredictions for the masses of the individual components of the binary, anduniformly imply an advanced age of ~5-30 myr. taken together, these resultsverify that v4046 sgr is one of the precious few nearby and relatively evolvedpre-main sequence systems that still hosts a gas-rich accretion disk.

1210.5252	constraints on the radial variation of grain growth in the as 209  circumstellar disk	we present dust continuum observations of the protoplanetary disk surroundingthe pre-main sequence star as 209, spanning more than an order of magnitude inwavelength from 0.88 to 9.8 mm. the disk was observed with sub-arcsecondangular resolution (0.2"-0.5") to investigate radial variations in its dustproperties. at longer wavelengths, the disk emission structure is notably morecompact, providing model-independent evidence for changes in the grainproperties across the disk. we find that physical models which reproduce thedisk emission require a radial dependence of the dust opacity \kappa_{\nu}.assuming that the observed wavelength-dependent structure can be attributed toradial variations in the dust opacity spectral index (\beta), we find that\beta(r) increases from \beta&lt;0.5 at \sim20 au to \beta&gt;1.5 for r&gt;80 au,inconsistent with a constant value of \beta\ across the disk (at the 10\sigma\level). furthermore, if radial variations of \kappa_{\nu} are caused byparticle growth, we find that the maximum size of the particle-sizedistribution (a_{max}) increases from sub-millimeter-sized grains in the outerdisk (r&gt;70 au) to millimeter and centimeter-sized grains in the inner diskregions (r&lt; 70 au). we compare our observational constraint on a_{max}(r) withpredictions from physical models of dust evolution in proto-planetary disks.for the dust composition and particle-size distribution investigated here, ourobservational constraints on a_{max}(r) are consistent with models where themaximum grain size is limited by radial drift.

1304.2768	resolving the gap and au-scale asymmetries in the pre-transitional disk  of v1247 orionis	pre-transitional disks are protoplanetary disks with a gapped disk structure,potentially indicating the presence of young planets in these systems. in orderto explore the structure of these objects and their gap-opening mechanism, weobserved the pre-transitional disk v1247 orionis using the very large telescopeinterferometer, the keck interferometer, keck-ii, gemini south, and irtf. thisallows us spatially resolve the au-scale disk structure from near- tomid-infrared wavelengths (1.5 to 13 {\mu}m), tracing material at differenttemperatures and over a wide range of stellocentric radii. our observationsreveal a narrow, optically-thick inner-disk component (located at 0.18 au fromthe star) that is separated from the optically thick outer disk (radii &gt;46 au),providing unambiguous evidence for the existence of a gap in thispre-transitional disk. surprisingly, we find that the gap region is filled withsignificant amounts of optically thin material with a carbon-dominated dustmineralogy. the presence of this optically thin gap material cannot be deducedsolely from the spectral energy distribution, yet it is the dominantcontributor at mid-infrared wavelengths. furthermore, using keck/nirc2 aperturemasking observations in the h, k', and l' band, we detect asymmetries in thebrightness distribution on scales of about 15-40 au, i.e. within the gapregion. the detected asymmetries are highly significant, yet their amplitudeand direction changes with wavelength, which is not consistent with a companioninterpretation but indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of the gap material.we interpret this as strong evidence for the presence of complex densitystructures, possibly reflecting the dynamical interaction of the disk materialwith sub-stellar mass bodies that are responsible for the gap clearing.

1305.5262	the mass dependence between protoplanetary disks and their stellar hosts	we present a substantial extension of the mm-wave continuum photometrycatalog for taurus circumstellar dust disks. combining new submillimeter arraydata with measurements in the literature, we construct a mm-wave luminositydistribution for class ii disks that is statistically complete for stellarhosts with spectral types earlier than m8.5 and has a (3-sigma) depth of ~3mjy. the resulting census eliminates a longstanding bias against disks withlate-type hosts, and thereby reveals a strong correlation between l_mm and thehost spectral type. we confirm that this corresponds to a statistically robustrelationship between the masses of dust disks and the stars that host them. abayesian regression technique is used to characterize these relationships: theresults indicate a typical 1.3 mm flux density of 25 mjy for solar mass hostsand a power-law scaling l_mm \propto m_star^1.5-2.0. we suggest that areasonable treatment of dust temperature in the conversion from l_mm to m_diskfavors an inherently linear m_disk \propto m_star scaling, with a typicaldisk-to-star mass ratio of $\sim$0.2--0.6%. the rms dispersion around thisregression is 0.7 dex, suggesting that the combined effects of diverseevolutionary states, dust opacities, and temperatures in these disks imprint afwhm range of a factor of 40 on the inferred m_disk (or l_mm) at any given hostmass. we argue that this relationship between m_disk and m_star likelyrepresents the origin of the inferred correlation between giant planetfrequency and host star mass in the exoplanet population, and provides somebasic support for the core accretion model for planet formation. moreover, wecaution that selection bias must be considered in comparative studies of diskevolution, and illustrate that fact with statistical comparisons of l_mmbetween taurus and other clusters (abridged).

1306.4567	constraining a model of turbulent coronal heating for au microscopii  with x-ray, radio, and millimeter observations	many low-mass pre-main-sequence stars exhibit strong magnetic activity andcoronal x-ray emission. even after the primordial accretion disk has beencleared out, the star's high-energy radiation continues to affect the formationand evolution of dust, planetesimals, and large planets. young stars withdebris disks are thus ideal environments for studying the earliest stages ofnon-accretion-driven coronae. in this paper we simulate the corona of au mic, anearby active m dwarf with an edge-on debris disk. we apply a self-consistentmodel of coronal loop heating that was derived from numerical simulations ofsolar field-line tangling and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. we alsosynthesize the modeled star's x-ray luminosity and thermal radio/millimetercontinuum emission. a realistic set of parameter choices for au mic producessimulated observations that agree with all existing measurements and upperlimits. this coronal model thus represents an alternative explanation for arecently discovered alma central emission peak that was suggested to be theresult of an inner "asteroid belt" within 3 au of the star. however, it is alsopossible that the central 1.3 mm peak is caused by a combination of activecoronal emission and a bright inner source of dusty debris. additionalobservations of this source's spatial extent and spectral energy distributionat millimeter and radio wavelengths will better constrain the relativecontributions of the proposed mechanisms.

1404.5652	resolved multifrequency radio observations of gg tau	we present sub-arcsecond resolution observations of continuum emissionassociated with the gg tau quadruple star system at wavelengths of 1.3, 2.8,7.3, and 50 mm. these data confirm that the gg tau a binary is encircled by acircumbinary ring at a radius of 235 au with a fwhm width of ~60 au. we find noclear evidence for a radial gradient in the spectral shape of the ring,suggesting that the particle size distribution is spatially homogeneous onangular scales of ~0.1". a central point source, likely associated with theprimary component (gg tau aa), exhibits a composite spectrum from dust andfree-free emission. faint emission at 7.3 mm is observed toward the low-massstar gg tau ba, although its origin remains uncertain. using these measurementsof the resolved, multifrequency emission structure of the gg tau a system,models of the far-infrared to radio spectrum are developed to place constraintson the grain size distribution and dust mass in the circumbinary ring. thenon-negligible curvature present in the ring spectrum implies a maximumparticle size of 1-10 mm, although we are unable to place strong constraints onthe distribution shape. the corresponding dust mass is 30-300 m_earth, at atemperature of 20-30 k. we discuss how this significant concentration ofrelatively large particles in a narrow ring at a large radius might be producedin a local region of higher gas pressures (i.e., a particle "trap") locatednear the inner edge of the circumbinary disk.

1407.6873	cold molecular gas in merger remnants: i. formation of molecular gas  disks	we present &lt; 1 kpc resolution co imaging study of 37 optically-selected localmerger remnants using new and archival interferometric maps obtained with alma,carma, sma and pdbi. we supplement a sub-sample with single-dish measurementsobtained at the nro 45 m telescope for estimating the molecular gas mass (10^7- 10^11 m_sun), and evaluating the missing flux of the interferometricmeasurements. among the sources with robust co detections, we find that 80 %(24/30) of the sample show kinematical signatures of rotating molecular gasdisks (including nuclear rings) in their velocity fields, and the sizes ofthese disks vary significantly from 1.1 kpc to 9.3 kpc. the size of themolecular gas disks in 54 % of the sources is more compact than the k-bandeffective radius. these small gas disks may have formed from a past gas inflowthat was triggered by a dynamical instability during a potential merging event.on the other hand, the rest (46 %) of the sources have gas disks which areextended relative to the stellar component, possibly forming a late-type galaxywith a central stellar bulge. our new compilation of observational datasuggests that nuclear and extended molecular gas disks are common in the finalstages of mergers. this finding is consistent with recent major-mergersimulations of gas rich progenitor disks. finally, we suggest that some of therotation-supported turbulent disks observed at high redshifts may result fromgalaxies that have experienced a recent major merger.

1501.05962	resolved millimeter emission from the hd 15115 debris disk	we have used the submillimeter array (sma) to make 1.3 millimeterobservations of the debris disk surrounding hd 15115, an f-type star with aputative membership in the beta pictoris moving group. this nearly edge-ondebris disk shows an extreme asymmetry in optical scattered light, with anextent almost two times larger to the west of the star than to the east(originally dubbed the "blue needle"). the sma observations reveal resolvedemission that we model as a circumstellar belt of thermal dust emission. thisbelt extends to a radius of ~110 au, coincident with the break in the scatteredlight profile convincingly seen on the western side of the disk. this outeredge location is consistent with the presence of an underlying population ofdust-producing planetesimals undergoing a collisional cascade, as hypothesizedin "birth ring" theory. in addition, the millimeter emission shows a ~3 sigmafeature aligned with the asymmetric western extension of the scattered lightdisk. if this millimeter extension is real, then mechanisms for asymmetry thataffect only small grains, such as interactions with interstellar gas, aredisfavored. this tentative feature might be explained by secular perturbationsto grain orbits introduced by neutral gas drag, as previously invoked toexplain asymmetric morphologies of other, similar debris disks.

1505.01850	a disk-based dynamical mass estimate for the young binary ak sco	we present spatially and spectrally resolved atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) observations of gas and dust in the diskorbiting the pre-main sequence binary ak sco. by forward-modeling the diskvelocity field traced by co j=2-1 line emission, we infer the mass of thecentral binary, $m_\ast = 2.49 \pm 0.10~m_\odot$, a new dynamical measurementthat is independent of stellar evolutionary models. assuming the disk andbinary are co-planar within $\sim$2{\deg}, this disk-based binary massmeasurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocitymonitoring of the combined stellar spectra. these alma results are alsocompared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location ofthe binary in the hertzsprung-russell diagram, using several common pre-mainsequence model grids. these models predict stellar masses that are marginallyconsistent with our dynamical measurement (at $\sim 2\,\sigma$), but aresystematically high (by $\sim$10%). these same models consistently predict anage of $18\pm1$ myr for ak sco, in line with its membership in the uppercentaurus-lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host agas-rich disk. as alma accumulates comparable data for large samples ofpre-main sequence stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamicalmass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful forefforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.

1505.06347	the cometary composition of a protoplanetary disk as revealed by complex  cyanides	observations of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawnedour planetary system was rich in water and organic molecules. bombardmentbrought these organics to the young earth's surface, seeding its earlychemistry. unlike asteroids, comets preserve a nearly pristine record of thesolar nebula composition. the presence of cyanides in comets, including 0.01%of methyl cyanide (ch3cn) with respect to water, is of special interest becauseof the importance of c-n bonds for abiotic amino acid synthesis. comet-likecompositions of simple and complex volatiles are found in protostars, and canbe readily explained by a combination of gas-phase chemistry to form e.g. hcnand an active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advancescomplexity[3]. simple volatiles, including water and hcn, have been detectedpreviously in solar nebula analogues - protoplanetary disks around young stars- indicating that they survive disk formation or are reformed in situ. it hasbeen hitherto unclear whether the same holds for more complex organic moleculesoutside of the solar nebula, since recent observations show a dramatic changein the chemistry at the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks dueto accretion shocks[8]. here we report the detection of ch3cn (and hcn andhc3n) in the protoplanetary disk around the young star mwc 480. we findabundance ratios of these n-bearing organics in the gas-phase similar tocomets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex cyanides inthe disk ice. this implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles inprotoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of the solar nebulawas not unique.

1507.01642	the epsilon eridani system resolved by millimeter interferometry	we present observations of epsilon eridani from the submillimeter array (sma)at 1.3 millimeters and from the australia telescope compact array (atca) at 7millimeters that reach an angular resolution of ~4" (13 au). these firstmillimeter interferometer observations of epsilon eridani, which hosts theclosest debris disk to the sun, reveal two distinct emission components: (1)the well-known outer dust belt, which, although patchy, is clearly resolved inthe radial direction, and (2) an unresolved source coincident with the positionof the star. we use direct model-fitting of the millimeter visibilities toconstrain the basic properties of these two components. a simple gaussian shapefor the outer belt fit to the sma data results in a radial location of$64.4^{+2.4}_{-3.0}$ au and fwhm of $20.2^{+6.0}_{-8.2}$ au (fractional width$\delta r/r = 0.3$. similar results are obtained taking a power law radialemission profile for the belt, though the power law index cannot be usefullyconstrained. within the noise obtained (0.2 mjy/beam), these data areconsistent with an axisymmetric belt model and show no significant azimuthalstructure that might be introduced by unseen planets in the system. these dataalso limit any stellocentric offset of the belt to $&lt;9$ au, which disfavors thepresence of giant planets on highly eccentric ($&gt;0.1$) and wide (10's of au)orbits. the flux density of the unresolved central component exceedspredictions for the stellar photosphere at these long wavelengths, by amarginally significant amount at 1.3 millimeters but by a factor of a few at 7millimeters (with brightness temperature $13000 \pm 1600$ k for a source sizeof the optical stellar radius). we attribute this excess emission to ionizedplasma from a stellar corona or chromosphere.

0806.0217	sma imaging of co(3-2) line and 860 micron continuum of arp 220 :  tracing the spatial distribution of luminosity	we used the submillimeter array (sma) to image 860 micron continuum andco(3-2) line emission in the ultraluminous merging galaxy arp 220, achieving aresolution of 0.23" (80 pc) for the continuum and 0.33" (120 pc) for the line.the co emission peaks around the two merger nuclei with a velocity signature ofgas rotation around each nucleus, and is also detected in a kpc-size diskencompassing the binary nucleus. the dust continuum, in contrast, is mostlyfrom the two nuclei. the beam-averaged brightness temperature of both line andcontinuum emission exceeds 50 k at and around the nuclei, revealing thepresence of warm molecular gas and dust. the dust emission morphologicallyagrees with the distribution of radio supernova features in the east nucleus,as expected when a starburst heats the nucleus. in the brighter west nucleus,however, the submillimeter dust emission is more compact than the supernovadistribution. the 860 micron core, after deconvolution, has a size of 50-80 pc,consistent with recent 1.3 mm observations, and a peak brightness temperatureof (0.9-1.6)x10^2 k. its bolometric luminosity is at least 2x10^{11} lsun andcould be ~10^{12} lsun depending on source structure and 860 micron opacity,which we estimate to be of the order of tau_{860} ~ 1 (i.e., n_{h_2} ~ 10^{25}cm^{-2}). the starbursting west nuclear disk must have in its center a dustenshrouded agn or a very young starburst equivalent to hundreds of super starclusters. further spatial mapping of bolometric luminosity throughsubmillimeter imaging is a promising way to identify the heavily obscuredheating sources in arp 220 and other luminous infrared galaxies.

1510.00968	chemical imaging of the co snow line in the hd 163296 disk	the condensation fronts (snow lines) of h2o, co and other abundant volatilesin the midplane of a protoplanetary disk affect several aspects of planetformation. locating the co snow line, where the co gas column density isexpected to drop substantially, based solely on co emission profiles ischallenging. this has prompted an exploration of chemical signatures of cofreeze-out. we present alma cycle 1 observations of the n2h+ j=3-2 and dco+j=4-3 emission lines toward the disk around the herbig ae star hd~163296 at~0.5" (60 au) resolution, and evaluate their utility as tracers of the co snowline location. the n2h+ emission is distributed in a ring with an inner radiusat 90 au, corresponding to a midplane temperature of 25 k. this result isconsistent with a new analysis of optically thin c18o data, which implies asharp drop in co abundance at 90 au. thus n2h+ appears to be a robust tracer ofthe midplane co snow line. the dco+ emission also has a ring morphology, butneither the inner nor the outer radius coincides with the co snow line locationof 90 au, indicative of a complex relationship between dco+ emission and cofreeze-out in the disk midplane. compared to tw hya, co freezes out at a highertemperature in the disk around hd 163296 (25 vs. 17 k in the tw hya disk),perhaps due to different ice compositions. this highlights the importance ofactually measuring the co snow line location, rather than assuming a constantco freeze-out temperature for all disks.

1510.01375	weak turbulence in the hd 163296 protoplanetary disk revealed by alma co  observations	turbulence can transport angular momentum in protoplanetary disks andinfluence the growth and evolution of planets. with spatially and spectrallyresolved molecular emission line measurements provided by (sub)millimeterinterferometric observations, it is possible to directly measure non-thermalmotions in the disk gas that can be attributed to this turbulence. we report anew constraint on the turbulence in the disk around hd 163296, a nearby young astar, determined from alma science verification observations of four coemission lines (the co(3-2), co(2-1), 13co(2-1), and c18o(2-1) transitions).the different optical depths for these lines permit probes of non-thermalline-widths at a range of physical conditions (temperature and density) anddepths into the disk interior. we derive stringent limits on the non-thermalmotions in the upper layers of the outer disk such that any contribution to theline-widths from turbulence is &lt;3% of the local sound speed. these limits areapproximately an order of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions forfull-blown mhd turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability,potentially suggesting that this mechanism is less efficient in the outer(r&gt;30au) disk than has been previously considered.

1510.08890	resolved millimeter-wavelength observations of debris disks around  solar-type stars	the presence of debris disks around young main sequence stars hints at theexistence and structure of planetary systems. millimeter-wavelengthobservations probe large grains that trace the location of planetesimal belts.the feps (formation and evolution of planetary systems) $spitzer$ legacy surveyof nearby young solar analogues yielded a sample of five debris disk-hostingstars with millimeter flux suitable for interferometric follow-up. we presentobservations with the submillimeter array (sma) and the combined array forresearch in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma) at ~2" resolution that spatiallyresolve the debris disks around these nearby ($d\sim$50 pc) stars. two of thefive disks (hd 377, hd 8907) are spatially resolved for the first time and one(hd 104860) is resolved at millimeter wavelengths for the first time. wecombine our new observations with archival sma and atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) data to enable a uniform analysis of thefull five-object sample. we simultaneously model the broad-band photometricdata and resolved millimeter visibilities to constrain the dust temperaturesand disk morphologies, and perform an mcmc analysis to fit for basic structuralparameters. we find that the radii and widths of the cold outer belts exhibitproperties consistent with scaled-up versions of the solar system's kuiperbelt. all the disks exhibit characteristic grain sizes comparable to theblowout size, and all the resolved observations of emission from large dustgrains are consistent with an axisymmetric dust distribution to within theuncertainties. these results are consistent with comparable studies carried outat infrared wavelengths.

1512.05553	steepening of the 820 micron continuum surface-brightness profile  signals dust evolution in tw hya's disk	grain growth in planet-forming disks is the first step toward the formationof planets. the growth of grains and their inward drift leaves a distinctimprint on the dust surface-density distribution and the resultingsurface-brightness profile of the thermal continuum emission. we determine thesurface-brightness profile of the continuum emission using resolvedobservations at millimeter wavelengths of the disk around tw hya, and infer thesignature of dust evolution on the surface density and dust opacity. archivalalma observations at 820 micron on baselines up to 410 kilolambda are comparedto parametrized disk models to determine the surface-brightness profile. underthe assumption of a constant dust opacity, a broken radial power law bestdescribes the dust surface density, with a slope of -0.53 +/- 0.01 from the 4.1au radius of the (already known) inner hole to a turn-over radius of 47.1 +/-0.2 au, steepening to -8.0 +/- 0.1 at larger radii. the emission drops belowthe detection limit beyond ~60 au. the shape of the dust surface density isconsistent with theoretical expectations for grain growth, fragmentation, anddrift, but its total dust content and its turn-over radius are too large for twhya's age of 8-10 myr even when taking into account a radially varying dustopacity. higher resolution imaging with alma of tw hya and other disks isrequired to establish if unseen gaps associated with, e.g., embedded planetstrap grains at large radii or if locally enhanced grain growth associated withthe co snow line explains the extent of the millimeter-continuum surfacebrightness profile. in the latter case, population studies should reveal acorrelation between the location of the co snow line and the extent of themillimeter continuum. in the former case, and if co freeze out promotes planetformation, this correlation should extend to the location of gaps as well.

astro-ph;0307105	disk properties and density structure of the star-forming dense core  b335	we present subarcsecond resolution dust continuum observations of theprotostellar collapse candidate b335 made with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer at wavelengths of 1.2 and 3.0 mm. these observations probe to &lt;100 au size scales and reveal a compact source component that we identify witha circumstellar disk. we analyze these data in concert with previous lowerresolution interferometer observations and find a best fit density structurefor b335 that consists of a power law envelope with index p=1.55 +/- 0.04 (r &lt;5000 au) together with a disk (r &lt; 100 au) of flux f_{1.2 mm}=21 +/-2 mjy. weestimate a systematic uncertainty in the power law index delta(p) &lt; 0.15, wherethe largest error comes from the assumed form of the dust temperature falloffwith radius. this determination of the inner density structure of b335 has aprecision unique amongst protostellar cores, and it is consistent with ther^{-1.5} profile of gravitational free-fall, in accord with basic expectationsfor the formation of a star. the flux (and implied mass) of the compactcomponent in b335 is typical of the disks around t tauri stars.

astro-ph;0307106	inner structure of starless core l694--2 derived from millimeter-wave  interferometry	we study the density structure of candidate contracting starless core l694-2using 1.3 mm dust continuum observations from the iram plateau de bureinterferometer and the berkeley-illinois-maryland array, probing spatial scalesfrom 10000-500 au. the long baseline pdbi observations detect no emission, andlimit the contamination from a compact component f_c &lt; 2.7 mjy. this limitcorresponds to a very small disk mass, m_disk &lt; 5e-4 m_sun x (60 k / t_disk),and bolsters the ``starless'' interpretation of the core. the shorter baselinebima data are compared to density models using a physically motivatedtemperature distribution with a central minimum. this analysis provides clearevidence for a turn-over from the steep outer density profile observed in dustextinction to much more shallow behavior in the inner regions (&lt;7500 au). thebest fit bonnor-ebert, plummer-like, broken power law, and end-on cylindermodels produce very similar flattened profiles and cannot be distinguished. wequantify the sensitivity of the inferred structure to various uncertainties,including the temperature distribution, the central position, and the presenceof a weak unresolved central component. the largest uncertainty comes from thetemperature assumption; an isothermal model modifies the best fit parameters by\~2 sigma, with the inferred profiles more shallow. dust emission andextinction profiles are reproduced by an embedded cylinder with scale heighth=13.5'' inclined at a small angle to the line of sight. the flat centraldensity profile suggests that pressure forces still support the core, despitethe extended inward motions inferred from molecular line observations (lee,myers, &amp; tafalla 2001). in the context of the cylindrical density model, theseinward motions may represent the contraction of a prolate core along its majoraxis.

astro-ph;0308143	envelope structure of starless core l694-2 derived from a near-infrared  extinction map	we present a near-infrared extinction study of the dark globule l694-2, astarless core that shows strong evidence for inward motions in molecular lineprofiles. the j,h, and k band data were taken using the european southernobservatory new technology telescope. the best fit simple spherical power lawmodel has index p=2.6 +/- 0.2, over the 0.036--0.1 pc range in radius sampledin extinction. this power law slope is steeper than the value of p=2 for asingular isothermal sphere, the initial condition of the inside-out model forprotostellar collapse. including an additional extinction component along theline of sight further steepens the inferred profile. fitting a bonnor-ebertsphere results in a super-critical value of the dimensionless radius xi_max=25+/- 3. the unstable configuration of material may be related to the observedinward motions. the bonnor-ebert model matches the shape of the observedprofile, but significantly underestimates the amount of extinction (by a factorof ~4). this discrepancy in normalization has also been found for the nearbyprotostellar core b335 (harvey et al. 2001). a cylindrical density model withscale height h=0.0164+/- 0.002 pc viewed at a small inclination to the cylinderaxis provides an equally good radial profile as a power law model, andreproduces the asymmetry of the core remarkably well. in addition, this modelprovides a basis for understanding the discrepancy in the normalization of thebonnor-ebert model, namely that l694-2 has prolate structure, with the fullextent (mass) of the core being missed by assuming symmetry between theprofiles in the plane of the sky and along the line-of-sight. if the core issufficiently magnetized then fragmentation may be avoided, and later evolutionmight produce a protostar similar to b335.

astro-ph;0404346	submillimeter array observations of l1551 irs 5 in cs (j=7-6)	we have imaged the circumstellar envelope around the binary protostar l1551irs 5 in cs (j=7-6) and 343 ghz continuum emission at ~ 3 arcsec resolutionusing the submillimeter array. the continuum emission shows an elongatedstructure (~ 220 x 100 au) around the binary perpendicular to the axis of theassociated radio jet. the cs emission extends over ~ 400 au, appearsapproximately circularly symmetric, and shows a velocity gradient fromsoutheast (blueshifted) to northwest (redshifted). the direction of thevelocity gradient is different from that observed in c18o (j=1-0). this may bebecause rotation is more dominant in the cs envelope than the c18o envelope, inwhich both infall and rotation exist. the cs emission may be divided into twovelocity components: (1) a "high" velocity disk-like structure surrounding theprotostar, +-1.0 - 1.5 km s-1 from the systemic velocity, and (2) a "low"velocity structure, located southwest of the protostar, &lt; 1.0 km s -1 from thesystemic velocity. the high-velocity component traces warm and dense gas withkinematics consistent with rotation around the protostar. the low-velocitycomponent may arise from dense gas entrained in the outflow. alternatively,this component may trace infalling and rotating gas in an envelope with avertical structure.

astro-ph;0501621	iras 16293-2442b: a compact, possibly isolated protoplanetary disk in a  class 0 object	theoretical arguments suggest that protoplanetary disks around young starsshould start small and grow with the addition of high angular momentum materialto reach the radii of several hundred aus that characterize the disks aroundoptically visible t tauri stars. examples of much more compact disks, withradii much less than 100 au, have been found around some very young stars, butin all cases tidal truncation from a near binary companion provides a readyexplanation for the small disk size. we report here an example of a compact,possibly isolated disk around the class 0 object iras16293-2422b, which isthought to be among the youngest protostars known. this disk has a gaussianhalf power radius of only $\sim$8 au, and a detailed, self-consistent,accretion disk model indicates an outer radius of only 26 au. this discoverysupports the notion that protoplanetary disks start small and grow with time,although other explanations for the compact size cannot be ruled out, includinggravitational instability in its outer parts and tidal truncation from theclose approach of a now distant stellar companion.

astro-ph;0509430	molecular superbubbles in the starburst galaxy ngc 253	the central 2x1 kpc of the starburst galaxy ngc 253 has been imaged using thesubmillimeter array at a 60 pc resolution in the j=2-1 transitions of 12co,13co, and c18o as well as in the 1.3 mm continuum. molecular gas and dust aremainly in the circumnuclear disk of ~500 pc radius, with warm (~40 k) and higharea-filling factor gas in its central part. two gas shells or cavities havebeen discovered in the circumnuclear disk. they have ~100 pc diameters and havelarge velocity widths of 80-100 km/s, suggestive of expansion at ~50 km/s.modeled as an expanding bubble, each shell has an age of ~0.5 myr and neededkinetic energy of ~1e46 j as well as mean mechanical luminosity of ~1e33 w forits formation. the large energy allows each to be called a superbubble. a ~10^6msun super star cluster can provide the luminosity, and could be a buildingblock of the nuclear starburst in ngc 253. alternatively, a hypernova can alsobe the main source of energy for each superbubble, not only because it canprovide the mechanical energy and luminosity but also because the estimatedrate of superbubble formation and that of hypernova explosions are comparable.our observations indicate that the circumnuclear molecular disk harboring thestarburst is highly disturbed on 100 pc or smaller scales, presumably byindividual young clusters and stellar explosions, in addition to globallydisturbed in the form of the well-known superwind.

astro-ph;0511294	a high-mass protobinary system in the hot core w3(h2o)	we have observed a high-mass protobinary system in the hot core w3(h2o) withthe bima array. our continuum maps at wavelengths of 1.4mm and 2.8mm bothachieve sub-arcsecond angular resolutions and show a double-peaked morphology.the angular separation of the two sources is 1.19" corresponding to 2.43x10^3au at the source distance of 2.04 kpc. the flux densities of the two sources at1.4mm and 2.8mm have a spectral index of 3, translating to an opacity law ofkappa ~ nu. the small spectral indices suggest that grain growth has begun inthe hot core. we have also observed 5 k components of the ch3cn (12-11)transitions. a radial velocity difference of 2.81 km/s is found towards the twocontinuum peaks. interpreting these two sources as binary components in orbitabout one another, we find a minimum mass of 22 msun for the system. radiativetransfer models are constructed to explain both the continuum and methylcyanide line observations of each source. power-law distributions of bothdensity and temperature are derived. density distributions close to thefree-fall value, r^-1.5, are found for both components, suggesting continuingaccretion. the derived luminosities suggest the two sources have equivalentzero-age main sequence (zams) spectral type b0.5 - b0. the nebular massesderived from the continuum observations are about 5 msun for source a and 4msun for source c. a velocity gradient previously detected may be explained byunresolved binary rotation with a small velocity difference.

astro-ph;0606284	molecular line observations of infrared dark clouds: seeking the  precursors to intermediate and massive star formation	we have identified 41 infrared dark clouds from the 8 micron maps of themidcourse space experiment (msx), selected to be found within one square degreeareas centered on known ultracompact hii regions. we have mapped these infrareddark clouds in n2h+(1-0), cs(2-1) and c18o(1-0) emission using the five collegeradio astronomy observatory. the maps of the different species often showstriking differences in morphologies, indicating differences in evolutionarystate and/or the presence of undetected, deeply embedded protostars. we derivean average mass for these clouds using n2h+ column densities of ~2500 solarmasses, a value comparable to that found in previous studies of high mass starforming cores using other mass tracers. the linewidths of these clouds aretypically ~2.0 - 2.9 km/s. based on the fact that they are dark at 8 micron,compact, massive, and have large velocity dispersions, we suggest that theseclouds may be the precursor sites of intermediate and high mass star formation.

astro-ph;0610667	investigating grain growth in disks around southern t tauri stars at  millimetre wavelengths	context - low-mass stars form with disks in which the coagulation of grainsmay eventually lead to the formation of planets. it is not known when and wheregrain growth occurs, as models that explain the observations are oftendegenerate. a way to break this degeneracy is to resolve the sources understudy. aims - to find evidence for the existence of grains of millimetre sizesin disks around in t tauri stars, implying grain growth. methods - theaustralia telescope compact array (atca) was used to observe 15 southern ttauri stars, five in the constellation lupus and ten in chamaeleon, at 3.3millimetre. the five lupus sources were also observed with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 1.4 millimetre. our new data are complemented with data from theliterature to determine the slopes of the spectral energy distributions in themillimetre regime. results - ten sources were detected at better than 3sigmawith the atca, with sigma ~1-2 mjy, and all sources that were observed with thesma were detected at better than 15sigma, with sigma ~4 mjy. six of the sourcesin our sample are resolved to physical radii of ~100 au. assuming that theemission from such large disks is predominantly optically thin, the millimetreslope can be related directly to the opacity index. for the other sources, theopacity indices are lower limits. four out of six resolved sources have opacityindices &lt;~1, indicating grain growth to millimetre sizes and larger. the massesof the disks range from &lt; 0.01 to 0.08 msun, which is comparable to the minimummass solar nebula. a tentative correlation is found between the millimetreslope and the strength and shape of the 10-micron silicate feature, indicatingthat grain growth occurs on similar (short) timescales in both the inner andouter disk.

astro-ph;0611366	654 ghz continuum and c18o (6-5) observations of g240.31+0.07 with the  submillimeter array	we report a dual-band observation at 223 and 654 ghz (460 micron) toward anultracompact (uc) hii region, g240.31+0.07, with the submillimeter array. witha beam size of 1"5 x 0"8, the dust continuum emission is resolved into twoclumps, with clump a coincident well with an h2o maser and the uc hii region.the newly discovered clump, b, about 1"3 (~8.3 x 10^3 au) to the southwest ofclump a, is also associated with h2o masers and may be a more recentstar-forming site. the continuum flux densities imply an opacity spectral indexof \beta = 1.5 +- 0.3, suggestive of a value lower than the canonical 2.0 foundin the interstellar medium and in cold, massive cores. the presence of hot(~100 k) molecular gas is derived by the brightness ratio of two h2co lines inthe 223 ghz band. a radial velocity difference of 2.5 +- 0.4 km/s is foundbetween the two clumps in c18o (6-5) emission. the total (nebular and stellar)mass of roughly 58 msun in the central region is close to, but not by farlarger than, the minimum mass required for the two clumps to be gravitationallybound for binary rotation. our continuum data do not suggest a large amount ofmatter associated with the h2 knots that were previously proposed to arise froma massive disk or envelope.

astro-ph;0701115	prosac: a submillimeter array survey of low-mass protostars. i. overview  of program: envelopes, disks, outflows and hot cores	this paper presents a large spectral line and continuum survey of 8 deeplyembedded, low-mass protostellar cores using the submillimeter array. eachsource was observed in high excitation lines of some of the most commonmolecular species, co, hco+, cs, so, h2co, ch3oh and sio. line emission from 11species originating from warm and dense gas have been imaged at high angularresolution (1-3"; typically 200-600 au) together with continuum emission at 230ghz (1.3 mm) and 345 ghz (0.8 mm). compact continuum emission is observed forall sources which likely originates in marginally optically thick circumstellardisks, with typical lower limits to their masses of 0.1 m_sun (1-10% of themasses of their envelopes) and having a dust opacity law with betaapproximately 1. prominent outflows are present in co 2-1 observations in allsources: the most diffuse outflows are found in the sources with the lowestratios of disk-to-envelope mass, and it is suggested that these sources are ina phase where accretion of matter from the envelope has almost finished and theremainder of the envelope material is being dispersed by the outflows. othercharacteristic dynamical signatures are found with inverse p cygni profilesindicative of infalling motions seen in the 13co 2-1 lines towardngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. outflow-induced shocks are present on all scales inthe protostellar environments and are most clearly traced by the emission ofch3oh in ngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. these observations suggest that theemission of ch3oh and h2co from these proposed "hot corinos" are related to theshocks caused by the protostellar outflows. only one source, ngc1333-iras2a,has evidence for hot, compact ch3oh emission coincident with the embeddedprotostar.

0811.0930	sma co(j=6-5) and 435 micron interferometric imaging of the nuclear  region of arp 220	we have used the submillimeter array (sma) to make the first interferometricobservations (beam size ~1") of the 12co j=6-5 line and 435 micron (690 ghz)continuum emission toward the central region of the nearby ulirg arp 220. theseobservations resolve the eastern and western nuclei from each other, in boththe molecular line and dust continuum emission. at 435 micron, the peakintensity of the western nucleus is stronger than the eastern nucleus, and thedifference in peak intensities is less than at longer wavelengths. fitting asimple model to the dust emission observed between 1.3 mm and 435 micronsuggests that dust emissivity power law index in the western nucleus is nearunity and steeper in the eastern nucleus, about 2, and that the dust emissionis optically thick at the shorter wavelength. comparison with single dishmeasurements indicate that the interferometer observations are missing ~60% ofthe dust emission, most likely from a spatially extended component to whichthese observations are not sensitive. the 12co j=6-5 line observations clearlyresolve kinematically the two nuclei. the distribution and kinematics of the12co j=6-5 line appear to be very similar to lower j co lies observed atsimilar resolution. analysis of multiple 12co line intensities indicates thatthe molecular gas in both nuclei have similar excitation conditions, althoughthe western nucleus is warmer and denser. the excitation conditions are similarto those found in other extreme environments, including m82, mrk 231, and br1202-0725. simultaneous lower resolution observations of the 12co, 13co, andc18o j=2-1 lines show that the 13co and c18o lines have similar intensities,which suggests that both of these lines are optically thick, or possibly thatextreme high mass star formation has produced in an overabundance of c18o.
