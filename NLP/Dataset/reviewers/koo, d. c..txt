1002.0592	the asymptotic giant branch and the tip of the red giant branch as  probes of star formation history: the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy kkh 98	we investigate the utility of the asymptotic giant branch (agb) and the redgiant branch (rgb) as probes of the star formation history (sfh) of the nearby(d=2.5 mpc) dwarf irregular galaxy, kkh 98. near-infrared (ir) keck laser guidestar adaptive optics (ao) images resolve 592 ir bright stars reaching over 1magnitude below the tip of the red giant branch. significantly deeper optical(f475w and f814w) hubble space telescope images of the same field contain over2500 stars, reaching to the red clump and the main sequence turn-off for 0.5gyr old populations. compared to the optical color magnitude diagram (cmd), thenear-ir cmd shows significantly tighter agb sequences, providing a good probeof the intermediate age (0.5 - 5 gyr) populations. we match observed cmds withstellar evolution models to recover the sfh of kkh 98. on average, the galaxyhas experienced relatively constant low-level star formation (5 x 10^-4 moyr^-1) for much of cosmic time. except for the youngest main sequencepopulations (age &lt; 0.1 gyr), which are typically fainter than the ao data fluxlimit, the sfh estimated from the the 592 ir bright stars is a reasonable matchto that derived from the much larger optical data set. differences between theoptical and ir derived sfhs for 0.1 - 1 gyr populations suggest that currentstellar evolution models may be over-producing the agb by as much as a factorof three in this galaxy. at the depth of the ao data, the ir luminous stars arenot crowded. therefore these techniques can potentially be used to determinethe stellar populations of galaxies at significantly further distances.

1002.2365	the effects of an agn on host galaxy colour and morphology measurements	we assess the effects of simulated active galactic nuclei (agns) on thecolour and morphology measurements of their host galaxies. to test themorphology measurements, we select a sample of galaxies not known to host agnsand add a series of point sources scaled to represent specified fractions ofthe observed v band light detected from the resulting systems; we then comparemorphology measurements of the simulated systems to measurements of theoriginal galaxies. agn contributions &gt;20 per cent bias most of the morphologymeasurements tested, though the extent of the apparent bias depends on themorphological characteristics of the original galaxies. we test colourmeasurements by adding to non-agn galaxy spectra a quasar spectrum scaled tocontribute specified fractions of the rest-frame b band light detected from theresulting systems. a quasar fraction of 5 per cent can move the nuv-r colour ofan elliptical galaxy from the uv-optical red sequence to the green valley, and20 per cent can move it into the blue cloud. combining the colour andmorphology results, we find that a galaxy/agn system with an agn contribution&gt;20 per cent may appear bluer and more bulge-dominated than the underlyinggalaxy. we conclude that (1) bulge-dominated, e/s0/sa, and early-typemorphology classifications are accurate for red agn host galaxies and may beaccurate for blue host galaxies, unless the agn manifests itself as awell-defined point source; and (2) although highly unobscured agns, such as thequasar used for our experiments, can significantly bias the measured colours ofagn host galaxies, it is possible to identify such systems by examining opticalimages of the hosts for the presence of a point source and/or measuring thelevel of nuclear obscuration.

1007.1459	extragalactic background light inferred from aegis galaxy sed-type  fractions	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is of fundamental importance bothfor understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for gamma-rayastronomy, but the overall spectrum of the ebl between 0.1-1000 microns hasnever been determined directly from galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed)observations over a wide redshift range. the evolving, overall spectrum of theebl is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. thisis achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame k-band galaxyluminosity function up to redshift 4 (cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with adetermination of galaxy sed-type fractions. these are based on fitting swiretemplates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshiftrange from 0.2 to 1 from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). the changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forminggalaxies, starburst galaxies and agn galaxies in that redshift range areestimated, and two alternative extrapolations of sed-types to higher redshiftsare considered. this allows calculation of the evolution of the luminositydensities from the uv to the ir, the evolving star formation rate density ofthe universe, the evolving contribution to the bolometric ebl from thedifferent galaxy populations including agn galaxies and the buildup of the ebl.our ebl calculations are compared with those from a semi-analytic model, fromanother observationally-based model and observational data. the ebluncertainties in our modeling based directly on the data are quantified, andtheir consequences for attenuation of very high energy gamma-rays due to pairproduction on the ebl are discussed. it is concluded that the ebl is wellconstrained from the uv to the mid-ir, but independent efforts from infraredand gamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in thefar-ir.

0709.1692	precision photometric redshift calibration for galaxy-galaxy weak  lensing	accurate photometric redshifts are among the key requirements for precisionweak lensing measurements. both the large size of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and the existence of large spectroscopic redshift samples that areflux-limited beyond its depth have made it the optimal data source fordeveloping methods to properly calibrate photometric redshifts for lensing.here, we focus on galaxy-galaxy lensing in a survey with spectroscopic lensredshifts, as in the sdss. we develop statistics that quantify the effect ofsource redshift errors on the lensing calibration and on the weighting scheme,and show how they can be used in the presence of redshift failure and samplingvariance. we then demonstrate their use with 2838 source galaxies withspectroscopy from deep2 and zcosmos, evaluating several public photometricredshift algorithms, in two cases including a full p(z) for each object, andfind lensing calibration biases as low as 1% (due to fortuitous cancellation oftwo types of bias) or as high as 20% for methods in active use (despite thesmall mean photoz bias of these algorithms). our work demonstrates thatlensing-specific statistics must be used to reliably calibrate the lensingsignal, due to asymmetric effects of (frequently non-gaussian) photoz errors.we also demonstrate that large-scale structure (lss) can strongly impact thephotoz calibration and its error estimation, due to a correlation between thelss and the photoz errors, and argue that at least two independent degree-scalespectroscopic samples are needed to suppress its effects. given the size of ourspectroscopic sample, we can reduce the galaxy-galaxy lensing calibration errorwell below current sdss statistical errors.

0709.4659	stellar populations found in the central kpc of four luminous compact  blue galaxies at intermediate redshift	we investigate the star formation history of the central regions of fourluminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs). lcbgs are blue (b-v&lt;0.6), compact(mu_b&lt;21.5 mag arcsec^-2) galaxies with absolute magnitudes m_b brighter than-17.5. the lcbgs analyzed here are located at 0.436&lt;z&lt;0.525. they are among themost luminous (m_b &lt; -20.5), blue (b-v &lt; 0.4) and high surface brightness (mu_b&lt; 19.0 mag arcsec^-2) of this population. the observational data used wereobtained with the hst/stis spectrograph, the hst/wf/pc-2 camera and thehst/nicmos first camera. we find evidence for multiple stellar populations. oneof them is identified as the ionizing population, and the other one correspondsto the underlying stellar generation.  the estimated masses of the inferred populations are compatible with thedynamical masses, which are typically 2--10x 10^9 m_sun. our models alsoindicate that the first episodes of star formation the presented lcbgsunderwent happened between 5 and 7 gyr ago.  we compare the stellar populations found in lcbgs with the stellarpopulations present in bright, local hii galaxies, nearby spheroidal systemsand blue compact dwarf galaxies. it turns out that the underlying stellarpopulations of lcbgs are similar yet bluer to those of local hii galaxies. itis also the case that the passive color evolution of the lcbgs could convertthem into local spheroidal galaxies if no further episode of star formationtakes place. our results help to impose constraints on evolutionary scenariosfor the population of lcbgs found commonly at intermediate redshifts.

1107.4371	star formation rates and stellar masses of h-alpha selected star-forming  galaxies at z=0.84: a quantification of the downsizing	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 153 starforming galaxies at z~0.84, selected by their h-alpha flux with a nb filter.b-band luminosities of the objects are higher than those of local star forminggalaxies. most of the galaxies are located in the blue cloud, though someobjects are detected in the green valley and in the red sequence. after theextinction correction is applied virtually all these red galaxies move to theblue sequence, unveiling their dusty nature. a check on the extinction lawreveals that the typical extinction law for local starbursts is well suited forour sample but with e(b-v)_stars=0.55 e(b-v)_gas. we compare star formationrates (sfr) measured with different tracers (h-alpha, uv and ir) finding thatthey agree within a factor of three after extinction correction. we find acorrelation between the ratios sfr_fuv/sfr_h-alpha, sfr_ir/sfr_h-alpha and theew(h-alpha) (i.e. weighted age) which accounts for part of the scatter. weobtain stellar mass estimations fitting templates to multi-wavelengthphotometry. the typical stellar mass of a galaxy within our sample is ~10^10msun. the sfr is correlated with stellar mass and the specific star formationrate (ssfr) decreases with it, indicating that massive galaxies are lessaffected by star formation processes than less massive ones. this result isconsistent with the downsizing scenario. to quantify this downsizing weestimated the quenching mass m_q for our sample at z~0.84, finding that itdeclines from m_q ~10^12 msun to m_q ~8x10^10 msun at the local universe.

1206.4310	the swells survey - v. a salpeter stellar initial mass function in the  bulges of massive spiral galaxies	recent work has suggested that the stellar initial mass function (imf) is notuniversal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocitydispersion, or morphological type. in this paper, we investigate variations ofthe imf within individual galaxies. for this purpose, we use strong lensing andgas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the imf of thebulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies withsubstantial bulge components taken from the swells survey. we find that thestellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematicdata. a comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis modelsfitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a salpeter-likenormalisation of the imf. conversely, the disk masses are less well constraineddue to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with milkyway type imfs in agreement with previous studies. the disks are submaximal at2.2 disk scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxiesare baryon dominated at 2.2 disk scale lengths. globally, our inferred imfnormalisation is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies ofcomparable stellar mass (&gt; 10^11 m_sun). our results suggest a non-universalimf within the different components of spiral galaxies, adding to thewell-known differences in stellar populations between disks and bulges.

0801.1135	triggered or self-regulated star formation within intermediate redshift  luminous infrared galaxies (i). morphologies and spatially resolved spectral  energy distributions	we imaged a set of 15 intermediate redshift (z~0.8) luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs) with the keck laser guide star (lgs) ao facility. thesegalaxies were selected from the goods-s field, allowing us to combine the highspatial resolution hst optical (b, v, i, and z-bands) images with ournear-infrared (k'-band) images to study the lirg morphologies and spatiallyresolved spectral energy distributions (seds). two thirds of the lirgs are diskgalaxies, with only one third showing some evidence for interactions, minor, ormajor mergers. in contrast with local lirg disks (which are primarily barredsystems), only 10% of the lirg disks in our sample contain a prominent bar.while the optical bands tend to show significant point-like substructure,indicating distributed star formation, the ao k-band images tend to be smooth.the seds of the lirgs are consistent with distributed dusty star formation, asexhibited by optical to ir colors redder than allowed by old stellarpopulations alone. this effect is most pronounced in the galaxy cores, possiblyindicating central star formation. we also observed a set of 11 intermediateredshift comparison galaxies, selected to be non-ellipticals with apparentk-band magnitudes comparable to the lirgs. the "normal" (non-lirg) systemstended to have lower optical luminosity, lower stellar mass, and more irregularmorphology than the lirgs. half of the "normal" galaxies have seds consistentwith intermediate aged stellar populations and minimal dust. the other halfshow evidence for some dusty star formation, usually concentrated in theircores. our work suggests that the lirg disk galaxies are similar to large disksystems today, undergoing self regulated star formation, only at 10 - 20 timeshigher rates.

0801.2160	the role of agn in the colour transformation of galaxies at redshifts  z~1	we explore the role of agn in establishing and/or maintaining the bimodalcolour distribution of galaxies by quenching their star-formation and hence,causing their transition from the blue to the red cloud. important tests forthis scenario include (i) the x-ray properties of galaxies in the transitionzone between the two clouds and (ii) the incidence of agn in post-starbursts,i.e. systems observed shortly after (&lt;1gyr) the termination of theirstar-formation. we perform these tests by combining deep chandra observationswith multiwavelength data from the aegis survey. stacking the x-ray photons atthe positions of galaxies (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9) not individually detected at x-raywavelengths suggests a population of obscured agn among sources in thetransition zone and in the red cloud. their mean x-ray and mid-ir propertiesare consistent with moderately obscured low-luminosity agn, compton thicksources or a mix of both. morphologies show that major mergers are unlikely todrive the evolution of this population but minor interactions may play a role.the incidence of obscured agn in the red cloud (both direct detections andstacking results) suggests that bh accretion outlives the termination of thestar-formation. this is also supported by our finding that post-starburstgalaxies at z~0.8 and agn are associated, in agreement with recent results atlow-z. a large fraction of post-starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidencefor at least moderate levels of agn obscuration. this implies that if agnoutflows cause the colour transformation of galaxies, then some nuclear gas anddust clouds either remain unaffected or relax to the central galaxy regionsafter the quenching their star-formation.

1311.5559	candels+3d-hst: compact sfgs at z~2-3, the progenitors of the first  quiescent galaxies	we analyze the star-forming and structural properties of 45 massive(log(m/msun)&gt;10) compact star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 2&lt;z&lt;3 to explorewhether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2. theoptical/nir and far-ir spitzer/herschel colors indicate that most compact sfgsare heavily obscured. nearly half (47%) host an x-ray bright agn. in contrast,only about 10% of other massive galaxies at that time host agns. compact sfgshave centrally-concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similarto quiescent galaxies, and are thus strikingly different from other sfgs. mostcompact sfgs lie either within the sfr-m main sequence (65%) or below (30%), onthe expected evolutionary path towards quiescent galaxies. these results showconclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas anddust, quenching star formation. using extensive hst photometry from candels andgrism spectroscopy from the 3d-hst survey, we model their stellar populationswith either exponentially declining (tau) star formation histories (sfhs) orphysically-motivated sfhs drawn from semi-analytic models (sams). sams predictlonger formation timescales and older ages ~2 gyr, which are nearly twice asold as the estimates of the tau models. while both models yield good sed fits,sam sfhs better match the observed slope and zero point of the sfr-m mainsequence. some low-mass compact sfgs (log(m/msun)=10-10.6) have younger agesbut lower ssfrs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that thelow-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. if the progenitors of compactsfgs are extended sfgs, state-of-the-art sams show that mergers and diskinstabilities are both able to shrink galaxies, but disk instabilities are morefrequent (60% versus 40%) and form more concentrated galaxies. we confirm thisresult via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.

1401.5477	morphologies of z~0.7 agn host galaxies in candels: no trend of merger  incidence with agn luminosity	the processes that trigger active galactic nuclei (agn) remain poorlyunderstood. while lower luminosity agn may be triggered by minor disturbancesto the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to triggerluminous agn. major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for agntriggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques.there is however little observational evidence for a strong connection betweenagn and major mergers. we analyse the morphological properties of agn hostgalaxies as a function of agn and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to acarefully matched sample of control galaxies. agn are x-ray selected in theredshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and have luminosities 41 &lt; log(l_x [erg/s]) &lt;44.5. 'fake agn' are simulated in the control galaxies by adding point sourceswith the magnitude of the matched agn. we find that agn host and controlgalaxies have comparable assymetries, sersic indices and ellipticities atrestframe ~950nm. agn host galaxies show neither higher average asymmetries norhigher fractions of very disturbed objects. there is no increase in theprevalence of merger signatures with agn luminosity. at 95% confidence we findthat major mergers are responsible for &lt;6% of all agn in our sample as well as&lt;40% of the highest luminosity agn log(l_x [erg/s]) ~ 43.5). major mergerstherefore either play only a very minor role in the triggering of agn in theluminosity range studied or time delays are too long for merger features toremain visible.

1405.1736	the bulge-disk decomposed evolution of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  candels	we present the results of a new and improved study of the morphological andspectral evolution of massive galaxies over the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3. ouranalysis is based on a bulge-disk decomposition of 396 galaxies withmstar&gt;10^11 msolar from the candels wfc3/ir imaging within the cosmos andukidss uds survey fields. we find that, by modelling the h(160) image of eachgalaxy with a combination of a de vaucouleurs bulge (sersic index n=4) and anexponential disk (n=1), we can then lock all derived morphological parametersfor the bulge and disk components, and successfully reproduce theshorter-wavelength j(125), i(814), v(606) hst images simply by floating themagnitudes of the two components. this then yields sub-divided 4-band hstphotometry for the bulge and disk components which, with no additional priors,is well described by spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution. armed withthis information we are able to properly determine the masses andstar-formation rates for the bulge and disk components, and find that: i) fromz=3 to z=1 the galaxies move from disk-dominated to increasinglybulge-dominated, but very few galaxies are pure bulges/ellipticals by z=1; ii)while most passive galaxies are bulge-dominated, and most star-forming galaxiesdisk-dominated, 18+/-5% of passive galaxies are disk-dominated, and 11+/-3% ofstar-forming galaxies are bulge-dominated, a result which needs to be explainedby any model purporting to connect star-formation quenching with morphologicaltransformations; iii) there exists a small but significant population of purepassive disks, which are generally flatter than their star-forming counterparts(whose axial ratio distribution peaks at b/a~0.7); iv) flatter/larger disksre-emerge at the highest star-formation rates, consistent with recent studiesof sub-mm galaxies, and with the concept of a maximum surface-density forstar-formation activity.

1405.5221	the decomposed bulge and disk size-mass relations of massive galaxies at  1&lt;z&lt;3 in candels	we have constructed a mass-selected sample of mstar&gt;10^11msolar galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels uds and cosmos fields and have decomposed these systemsinto their separate bulge and disk components according to their h(160)-bandmorphologies. by extending this analysis to multiple bands we have been able toconduct individual bulge and disk component sed fitting which has provided uswith stellar-mass and star-formation rate estimates for the separate bulge anddisk components. these have been combined with size measurements to explore theevolution of these massive high-redshift galaxies. by utilising the newdecomposed stellar-mass estimates, we confirm that the bulge components displaya stronger size evolution than the disks. this can be seen from both thefraction of bulge components which lie below the local relation and the mediansizes of the bulge components, where the bulges are a median factor of2.93+/-0.32 times smaller than similarly massive local galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and3.41+/-0.58 smaller at 2&lt;z&lt;3; for the disks the corresponding factors are1.65+/-0.14 and 1.99+/-0.25. moreover, by splitting our sample into the passiveand star-forming bulge and disk sub-populations and examining their sizes as afraction of their present-day counter-parts, we find that the star-forming andpassive bulges are equally compact, star-forming disks are larger, while thepassive disks have intermediate sizes. this trend is not evident whenclassifying galaxy morphology on the basis of single-sersic fits and adoptingthe overall star-formation rates. finally, by evolving the star-formationhistories of the passive disks back to the redshifts when the passive diskswere last active, we show that the passive and star-forming disks haveconsistent sizes at the relevant epoch. these trends need to be reproduced byany mechanisms which attempt to explain the morphological evolution ofgalaxies.

1407.4233	geometry of star-forming galaxies from sdss, 3d-hst and candels	we determine the intrinsic, 3-dimensional shape distribution of star-forminggalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. inthe present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 msolare predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. wenow extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (m* &gt;1e10 msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z &lt; 2. lower-massgalaxies at z&gt;1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction ofelongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lowermasses. galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 msol (1e10 msol) are a mix of roughlyequal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z~1 (z~2). this suggests thatgalaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over manyorbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar masscomparable to that of the milky way typically first formed such sustainedstellar disks at redshift z~1.5-2. combined with constraints on the evolutionof the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation overgalaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmictime, the majority of stars formed in disks.

1409.5122	the host galaxies of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei to z=2.5:  structure, star-formation and their relationships from candels and  herschel/pacs	we study the relationship between the structure and star-formation rate (sfr)of x-ray selected low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe two chandra deep fields, using hubble space telescope imaging from thecosmic assembly near infrared extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and deepfar-infrared maps from the pep+goods-herschel survey. we derive detaileddistributions of structural parameters and fir luminosities from carefullyconstructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of theagns. at z~1, agns show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive(non-agn) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxydisturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpystructure). in contrast, at z~2, agns show similar levels of galaxy disturbanceas inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which mayarise due to a more pronounced bulge in agn hosts or due to extinguishednuclear light. we undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but ourresults do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. the mean sfrand its distribution among agns and inactive galaxies are similar at z&gt;1.5. atz&lt;1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the sfrs of agnswith bulge-dominated light profiles. these trends suggest an evolution in therelation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards aminor role for mergers and interactions at z&gt;1.5.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.3806	zfourge/candels: on the evolution of m* galaxy progenitors from z=3 to  0.5	galaxies with stellar masses near m* contain the majority of stellar mass inthe universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxyevolution. the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) have present day stellarmasses near m*, at 5x10^10 msol (mw-mass) and 10^11 msol (m31-mass). we studythe typical progenitors of these galaxies using zfourge, a deep medium-bandnear-ir imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxiesout to z~3. we use abundance-matching techniques to identify the mainprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. we measure the evolution inthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-ir luminosities, andstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-irhst imaging from candels, and far-ir imaging from goods-h and candels-h. thetypical mw-mass and m31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolutionstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,to redder dust-obscured ir-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and tored, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. the progenitors of themw-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lowerredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than theprogenitors of the m31-mass galaxies. the process driving this evolution,including the suppression of star-formation in present-day m* galaxies requiresan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass thresholdfor quiescent galaxies. the effective size and star-formation rates imply thatthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift toz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the s\'ersic index.therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in m* galaxies corresponds to a rapiddecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formationefficiency.

1503.00722	the role of bulge formation in the homogenization of stellar populations  at $z\sim2$ as revealed by internal color dispersion in candels	we use data from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations ofgalaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. we use theinternal color dispersion (icd), measured between the rest-frame uv and opticalbands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellarpopulations. the icd shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologiesof the galaxies. galaxies with the largest variation in their stellarpopulations as evidenced by high icd have disk-dominated morphologies (withs\'{e}rsic indexes $&lt; 2$) and stellar masses between $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot}&lt; 11$. there is a marked decrease in the icd as the stellar mass and/orthe s\'ersic index increases. by studying the relations between the icd andother galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, anddust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellarpopulations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-formingclumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. this phase reaches a peak forgalaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/ m_\odot}&lt; 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. in contrast,galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher s\'{e}rsic index ($n&gt; 2$) show reduced icd values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellarpopulations. this indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulgealong with a star forming disk, typical of hubble sequence galaxies, this ismost common for stellar masses $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot} &lt; 11$ and when thebulge component remains relatively small ($n&lt;2$).

1509.00469	a universal structural and star-forming relation since $z\sim3$:  connecting compact star-forming and quiescent galaxies	we study the evolution of the core (r&lt;1 kpc) and effective (r&lt;r_e)stellar-mass surface densities, in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. sincez=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(sigma_e) andlog(sigma_1) vs. log(m). these structural relations exhibit slopes and scatterthat remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. forsfgs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in bothsigma_e and sigma_1. such mild declines suggest that sfgs build dense cores bygrowing along these relations. we define this evolution as the structural mainsequence (sigma-ms). quiescent galaxies follow different relations (sigma^q_e,sigma^q_1) off the sigma-ms by having higher densities than sfgs of the samemass and redshift. the normalization of sigma^q_e declines by a factor of 10since z=3, but only a factor of 2 in sigma^q_1. thus, the common denominatorfor quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellarcore, and the formation of such cores in sfgs is the main requirement forquenching. expressed in 2d as deviations off the sfr-ms and off sigma^q_1 ateach redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, l-shapedsequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction andquenching. compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in sfgs relativeto that in the sigma-ms. this process increases the core-to-total mass andsersic index, thereby, making compact sfgs. quenching occurs once compact sfgsreach a maximum central density above sigma^q_1 &gt; 9.5 m_sun/kpc^2. thisthreshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify thestar-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0006169	the lbds hercules sample of millijansky radio sources at 1.4 ghz: i.  multi-colour photometry	the results are presented of an extensive programme of optical and infraredimaging of radio sources in a complete subsample of the leiden-berkeley deepsurvey. the lbds hercules sample consists of 72 sources observed at 1.4 ghz,with flux densities s(1.4) &gt;= 1.0 mjy, in a 1.2 deg^2 region of hercules. thissample is almost completely identified in the g, r, i and k bands, with someadditional data available at j and h. the magnitude distributions peak at r ~=22 mag, k ~= 16 mag and extend down to r ~= 26 mag, k ~= 21 mag. the k-bandmagnitude distributions for the radio galaxies and quasars are compared withthose of other radio surveys. at s(1.4) &lt;~ 1 jy, the k-band distribution doesnot change significantly with radio flux density. the sources span a broadrange of colours, with several being extremely red (r-k &gt;~ 6). although small,this is the most optically complete sample of millijansky radio sourcesavailable at 1.4 ghz, and is ideally suited to study the evolution of the radioluminosity function out to high redshifts.

astro-ph;0011092	the deep groth strip survey x: number density and luminosity function of  field e/s0 galaxies at z &lt; 1	we present the luminosity function and color-redshift relation of amagnitude-limited sample of 145 mostly red field e/s0 galaxies at z &lt; 1 fromthe deep groth strip survey (gss). most of the e/s0s (86%) form a red envelopein the redshift-color diagram, consistent with predictions of spectralsynthesis models in which the dominant stellar population is formed atredshifts z &gt; 1.5. constructing a luminosity function of the full sample of  145 e/s0s, we find that there is about 1.1--1.9 magnitude brightening inrest-frame b band luminosity back to z = 0.8 from z=0, consistent with otherstudies.  together with the red colors, this brightening favors models in which thebulk of stars in red field e/s0s formed before z_{for} &gt; 1.5 and have beenevolving rather quiescently with few large starbursts since then.  evolution in the number density of field e/s0 galaxies is harder to measure,and uncertainties in the raw counts and their ratio to local samples mightamount to as much as a factor of two.  within that uncertainty, the number density of red e/s0s to z = 0.8 seemsrelatively static, being comparable to or perhaps moderately less than that oflocal e/s0s depending on the assumed cosmology. a doubling of e/s0 numberdensity since z = 1 can be ruled out with high confidence (97%) if\omega_{m}=1.  taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that themajority of luminous field e/s0s were already in place by z = 1, that the bulkof their stars were already fairly old, and that their number density has notchanged by large amounts since then.

astro-ph;0210344	a multiwavelength approach to the sfr estimation in galaxies at  intermediate redshifts	we use a sample of 7 starburst galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z ~ 0.4and z ~ 0.8) with observations ranging from the observed ultraviolet to 1.4ghz, to compare the star formation rate (sfr) estimators which are used in thedifferent wavelength regimes. we find that extinction corrected halphaunderestimates the sfr, and the degree of this underestimation increases withthe infrared luminosity of the galaxies. galaxies with very different levels ofdust extinction as measured with sfr(ir)/sfr(halpha, uncorrected forextinction) present a similar attenuation a[halpha], as if the balmer linesprobed a different region of the galaxy than the one responsible for the bulkof the ir luminosity for large sfrs. in addition, sfr estimates derived from[oii]3727 match very well those inferred from halpha after applying themetallicity correction derived from local galaxies. sfrs estimated from the uvluminosities show a dichotomic behavior, similar to that previously reported byother authors in galaxies at z &lt;~ 0.4. here we extend this result up to z ~0.8. finally, one of the studied objects is a luminous compact galaxy (lcg)that may be suffering similar dust-enshrouded star formation episodes. theseresults highlight the relevance of quantifying the actual l(ir) of lcgs, aswell as that of a much larger and generic sample of luminous infrared galaxies,which will be possible after the launch of sirtf.

astro-ph;0506044	galaxy luminosity functions to z~1: deep2 vs. combo-17 and implications  for red galaxy formation	the deep2 and combo-17 surveys are used to study the evolution of theluminosity function of red and blue galaxies to $z \sim 1$. schechter functionfits show that, since $z = 1$, $m^*_b$ dims by $\sim$ 1.3 mag per unit redshiftfor both color classes, $\phi^*$ of blue galaxies shows little change, while$\phi^*$ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. at face value, thenumber density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since $ z = 1$,whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. luminosity densities support bothconclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our dataand local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest.we discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after $z = 1$from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the propertiesof local and distant e/s0s. we suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some bluegalaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to thered sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence inone or more purely stellar mergers. e/s0s of a given mass today will haveformed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain thefundamental plane and other local scaling laws.

astro-ph;0509037	optical morphology evolution of infrared luminous galaxies in goods-n	we combine optical morphologies and photometry from hst, redshifts from keck,and mid-infrared luminosities from spitzer for an optically selected sampleof~800 galaxies in goods-n to track morphology evolution of infrared luminousgalaxies (lirgs) since redshift z=1. we find a 50% decline in the number oflirgs from z~1 to lower redshift, in agreement with previous studies. inaddition, there is evidence for a morphological evolution of the populations oflirgs. above z=0.5, roughly half of all lirgs are spiral, thepeculiar/irregular to spiral ratio is ~0.7, and both classes span a similarrange of l_{ir} and m_b. at low-z, spirals account for one-third of lirgs, thepeculiar to spiral fraction rises to 1.3, and for a given m_b spirals tend tohave lower ir luminosity than peculiars. only a few percent of lirgs at anyredshift are red early-type galaxies. for blue galaxies (u-b &lt; 0.2), m_b iswell correlated with log(l_{ir}) with an rms scatter (about a bivariate linearfit) of ~0.25 dex in ir luminosity. among blue galaxies that are brighter thanm_b = -21, 75% are lirgs, regardless of redshift. these results can beexplained by a scenario in which at high-z, most large spirals experience anelevated star formation rate as lirgs. gas consumption results in a decline oflirgs, especially in spirals, to lower redshifts.

astro-ph;0612362	radius dependent luminosity evolution of blue galaxies in goods-n	we examine the radius-luminosity (r-l) relation for blue galaxies in the teamkeck redshift survey (tkrs) of goods-n. we compare with a volume-limited, sloandigital sky survey sample and find that the r-l relation has evolved to lowersurface brightness since z=1. based on the detection limits of goods this cannot be explained by incompleteness in low surface-brightness galaxies. numberdensity arguments rule out a pure radius evolution. it can be explained by aradius dependent decline in b-band luminosity with time. assuming a linearshift in m_b with z, we use a maximum likelihood method to quantify theevolution. under these assumptions, large (r_{1/2} &gt; 5 kpc), and intermediatesized (3 &lt; r_{1/2} &lt; 5 kpc) galaxies, have experienced delta m_b =1.53(-0.10,+0.13) and 1.65 (-0.18, +0.08) magnitudes of dimming since z=1. a simpleexponential decline in star formation with an e-folding time of 3 gyr canresult in this amount of dimming. meanwhile, small galaxies, or some subsetthereof, have experienced more evolution, 2.55 (+/- 0.38) magnitudes. thisfactor of ten decline in luminosity can be explained by sub-samples ofstarbursting dwarf systems that fade rapidly, coupled with a decline in burststrength or frequency. samples of bursting, luminous, blue, compact galaxies atintermediate redshifts have been identified by various previous studies. ifthere has been some growth in galaxy size with time, these measurements areupper limits on luminosity fading.

astro-ph;0701747	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: redshift identification of single-line  emission galaxies	we present two methods for determining spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies inthe deep2 survey which display only one identifiable feature, an emission line,in the observed spectrum ("single-line galaxies"). first, we assume each singleline is one of the four brightest lines accessible to deep2: halpha, [oiii]5007, hbeta, or [oii] 3727. then, we supplement spectral information with briphotometry. the first method, parameter space proximity (psp), calculates thedistance of a single-line galaxy to galaxies of known redshift in (b-r), (r-i),r, observed wavelength parameter space. the second method is an artificialneural network (ann). prior information, such as allowable line widths andratios, rules out one or more of the four lines for some galaxies in bothmethods. based on analyses of evaluation sets, both methods are nearly perfectat identifying blended [oii] doublets. of the lines identified as halpha in thepsp and ann methods, 91.4% and 94.2% respectively are accurate. although themethods are not this accurate at discriminating between [oiii] and hbeta, theycan identify a single line as one of the two, and the ann method in particularunambiguously identifies many [oiii] lines. from a sample of 640 single-linespectra, the methods determine the identities of 401 (62.7%) and 472 (73.8%)single lines, respectively, at accuracies similar to those found in theevaluation sets.

astro-ph;0701924	star formation in aegis field galaxies since z=1.1 : the dominance of  gradually declining star formation, and the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies	we analyze star formation (sf) as a function of stellar mass (m*) andredshift z in the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). for 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10^10(10^10.8) msun at z&lt;0.7(1),with keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile sf rates (sfr) fromemission lines, galex, and spitzer mips 24 micron photometry, optical-nir m*measurements, and hst morphologies. galaxies with reliable signs of sf form adistinct "main sequence (ms)", with a limited range of sfr at a given m* and z(1 sigma &lt; +-0.3 dex), and log(sfr) approximately proportional to log(m*). therange of log(sfr) remains constant to z&gt;1, while the ms as a whole moves tohigher sfr as z increases. the range of sfr along the ms constrains theamplitude of episodic variations of sf, and the effect of mergers on sfr.typical galaxies spend ~67(95)% of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of&lt;~ 2(4) of their average sfr at a given m* and z. the dominant mode of theevolution of sf since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average sfr inmost individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, ora decreasing factor by which sfr are enhanced in starbursts. lirgs at z~1 seemto mostly reflect the high sfr typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. thesmooth ms may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs starformation prior to additional quenching processes. a gradual process like gasexhaustion may play a dominant role.

astro-ph;0703056	star formation in aegis field galaxies since z=1.1 . staged galaxy  formation, and a model of mass-dependent gas exhaustion	we analyze star formation (sf) as a function of stellar mass (m_*) andredshift z in the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis), for star-forming field galaxies with m_* &gt;~ 10^10 m_sun out to z=1.1.the data indicate that the high specific sf rates (sfr) of many less massivegalaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolvedgalaxies. they rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominantsf episode of galaxies, after which sf gradually declines on gyr timescales toz=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's m_*. with decreasing mass, this onset ofmajor sf shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (stagedgalaxy formation). this process may be an important component of the``downsizing'' phenomenon. we find that the predominantly gradual decline ofsfr (noeske et al. 2007, this volume) can be reproduced by exponential sfhistories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longere-folding times tau, and a later onset of sf (z_f). our model can provide afirst parametrization of sfr as a function of m_* and z, and quantifymass-dependences of tau and z_f, from direct observations of m_* and sfr up toz&gt;1. the observed evolution of sf in galaxies can plausibly reflect thedominance of gradual gas exhaustion. the data are also consistent with thehistory of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.

astro-ph;9508100	slicing through multicolor space: galaxy redshifts from broadband  photometry	as a means of better understanding the evolution of optically selectedgalaxies we consider the distribution of galaxies within the multicolor space$u$, $b_j$, $r_f$ and $i_n$. we find that they form an almost planardistribution out to $b_j =22.5$ and $z&lt;0.3$. the position of a galaxy withinthis plane is dependent on its redshift, luminosity and spectral type. while inthe original $u$, $b_j$, $r_f$ and $i_n$ space these properties are highlycorrelated we can define an optimal rotation of the photometric axes that makesmuch of this information orthogonal. fitting the observed spectroscopicredshifts with a quadratic function of the four magnitudes we show thatredshifts for galaxies can be estimated to an accuracy better than $\delta z=0.05$. this dispersion is due to the photometric uncertainties within thephotographic data. assuming no galaxy evolution we derive a set of simulatedgalaxy fluxes in the u, j, f and n passbands. using these data we investigatehow the redshift is encoded within the broadband magnitudes and the intrinsicdispersion of the photometric-redshift relation. we find that the signal thatdefines a galaxy's photometric redshift is not related to specific absorptionor emission lines but comes from the break in the overall shape of the galaxycontinuum at around 4000 \aa. using high signal-to-noise photometric data weestimate that it is possible to achieve an intrinsic dispersion of less than$\delta z =0.02$.

astro-ph;9606076	a medium-deep survey of a mini-slice at the north galactic pole. ii. the  data	we report 328 redshifts, b$_j$ magnitudes and b$_j$--r$_f$ colors of galaxiesmeasured in a redshift survey of a 4$^\circ$ $\times$ 0.67$^\circ$ slice closeto the north galactic pole. the faintest galaxies in this survey have amagnitude of b$_j$ $\sim$ 20.5. the redshifts present external errors of theorder of 70 \kms, and we estimate that the mean photometry errors are $\sim$0.2 for magnitudes and $\sim$ 0.3 for colors. the redshift completeness levelof the sample is of the order of $\sim$ 35\% at b$_j$=20, and part of thisrather low completeness is the result of the combination of limitations imposedby the multifiber system with the clustering of galaxies, and an insufficientnumber of configurations. at the nominal magnitude limit of the survey, we wereable to measure redshifts for $\sim$ 70 \% of the galaxies we observed. fromthe correlation between observed properties of the galaxies in this sample, wedemonstrate that the mean surface brightness is a major limiting factor in ourability to measure redshifts of faint objects.

astro-ph;9610047	superclustering at redshift z=0.54	we present strong evidence for the existence of a supercluster at a redshiftof z=0.54 in the direction of selected area 68. from the distribution ofgalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts we find that there is a largeover-density of galaxies (a factor of four over the number expected in anunclustered universe) within the redshift range 0.530 &lt; z &lt; 0.555. byconsidering the spatial distribution of galaxies within this redshift range(using spectroscopic and photometric redshifts) we show that the galaxies insa68 form a linear structure passing from the south-west of the survey fieldthrough to the north-east (with a position angle of approximately 35 deg eastof north). this position angle is coincident with the positions of the x-rayclusters cl0016+16, rx j0018.3+1618 and a new x-ray cluster, rx j0018.8+1602,centered near the radio source 54w084. all three of these sources are at aredshift of approximately z=0.54 and have position angles, derived from theirx-ray photon distributions, consistent with that measured for the supercluster.assuming a redshift of 0.54 for the distribution of galaxies and a fwhmdispersion in redshift of 0.020 this represents a coherent structure with aradial extent of 31 mpc, transverse dimension of 12 mpc, and a thickness ofapproximately 4 mpc. the detection of this possible supercluster demonstratesthe power of using x-ray observations, combined with multicolor observations,to map the large scale distribution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

astro-ph;9703093	the nature of compact galaxies at z=0.2-1.3: implications for galaxy  evolution and the star formation history of the universe	we study the global scaling-laws of 51 compact field galaxies with redshiftsz = 0.2-1.3 and apparent magnitudes i&lt;23.74 in the flanking fields of thehubble deep field. roughly 60% of the 45 compact emission-line galaxies havesizes, surface brightnesses, luminosities, velocity widths, excitations, starformation rates (sfr), and mass-to-light ratios characteristic of youngstar-forming hii galaxies. the remaining 40% form a more heterogeneous class ofevolved starbursts, similar to local disk starburst galaxies. withoutadditional star formation, hii-like distant compacts will most likely fade toresemble today's spheroidal galaxies such as ngc 205. our sample implies alower limit for the global comoving sfr density of 0.004 m/yr/mpc^3 at z =0.55, and 0.008 m/yr/mpc^3 at z = 0.85. these values, when compared to asimilar sample of local galaxies, support a history of the universe in whichthe sfr density declines by a factor 10 from z = 1 to today. from thecomparison with the sfr densities derived from previous data sets, we concludethat compact emission-line galaxies, though only 20% of the general fieldpopulation, may contribute as much as 45% to the global sfr of the universe at0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.

astro-ph;9704001	the nature of compact galaxies in the hubble deep field (ii):  spectroscopic properties and implications for the evolution of the star  formation rate density of the universe	we present a spectroscopic study of 51 compact field galaxies with redshiftsz &lt; 1.4 and apparent magnitudes i &lt; 23.74 in the flanking fields of the hubbledeep field. these galaxies are compact in the sense that they have smallapparent half-light radii (r_e &lt; 0.5 arcsec) and high surface brightnesses(sb_e &lt; 22.2 mag arcsec^-2). the spectra, taken at the keck telescope, showemission lines in 88% of our sample, and only absorption lines in the remaining12%. emission-line profiles are roughly gaussian with velocity widths thatrange from the measurement limit of sigma = 35 km s^-1 to 150 km s^-1.rest-frame [oii]3727 equivalent widths range from 5a to 94a , yielding starformation rates (sfr) of 0.1 to 14 m yr^-1. the analysis of various linediagnostic diagrams reveals that 60% of compact emission-line galaxies havevelocity widths, excitations, hbeta luminosities, sfrs, and mass-to-lightratios characteristic of young star-forming hii galaxies. the remaining 40%form a more heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts, similar to localstarburst disk galaxies. we find that, although the compact galaxies at z&gt;0.7have similar sfrs per unit mass to those at z&lt;0.7, they are on average 10 timesmore massive. our sample implies a lower limit for the global comoving sfrdensity of 0.004 m yr^-1 mpc^-3 at z = 0.55, and 0.008 m yr^-1 mpc^-3 at z =0.85 (assuming salpeter imf, ho = 50 km s^-1 mpc^-1, and qo = 0.5). thesevalues, when compared to estimates for a sample of local compact galaxiesselected in a similar fashion, support a history of the universe in which thesfr density declines by a factor 10 from z = 1 to today.

astro-ph;9902147	the magnitude-size relation of galaxies out to z ~ 1	as part of the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe (deep) survey, a sampleof 190 field galaxies (i_{814} &lt;= 23.5) in the ``groth survey strip'' has beenused to analyze the magnitude-size relation over the range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.1. thesurvey is statistically complete to this magnitude limit. all galaxies havephotometric structural parameters, including bulge fractions (b/t), from hubblespace telescope images, and spectroscopic redshifts from the keck telescope.the analysis includes a determination of the survey selection function in themagnitude-size plane as a function of redshift, which mainly drops faintgalaxies at large distances. our results suggest that selection effects play avery important role. a first analysis treats disk-dominated galaxies with b/t &lt;0.5. if selection effects are ignored, the mean disk surface brightness(averaged over all galaxies) increases by ~1.3 mag from z = 0.1 to 0.9.however, most of this change is plausibly due to comparing low luminositygalaxies in nearby redshift bins to high luminosity galaxies in distant bins.if this effect is allowed for, no discernible evolution remains in the disksurface brightness of bright (m_b &lt; -19) disk-dominated galaxies. a secondanalysis treats all galaxies by substituting half-light radius for disk scalelength, with similar conclusions. indeed, at all redshifts, the bulk ofgalaxies is consistent with the magnitude-size envelope of local galaxies,i.e., with little or no evolution in surface brightness. in the two highestredshift bins (z &gt; 0.7), a handful of luminous, high surface brightnessgalaxies appears that occupies a region of the magnitude-size plane rarelypopulated by local galaxies. their wide range of colors and bulge fractionspoints to a variety of possible origins.
