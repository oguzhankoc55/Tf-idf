0706.4139	short gamma-ray bursts and binary mergers in spiral and elliptical  galaxies: redshift distribution and hosts	to test whether the short grb rates, redshift distribution and host galaxiesare consistent with current theoretical predictions, we use avery largedatabase of population synthesis calculations to examine bh-ns and ns-ns mergerrates in the universe, factoring in (i) the star formation history of theuniverse, (ii) a heterogeneous population of star-forming galaxies, includingspirals and ellipticals, and (iii) a simple flux-limited selection model forshort grb detection. when we require our models reproduce the known short grbrates and redshift measurements (and, for ns-ns, the merger rates extrapolatedfrom binary pulsars in the galaxy), a small fraction of models reproduce allobservations, both when we assume a ns-ns and a bh-ns origin for bursts. mostcommonly models produce mergers preferentially in spiral galaxies if short grbsarise from ns-ns mergers alone. model universes where present-day binarymergers occur preferentially in elliptical galaxies necessarily include asignificant fraction of binaries with long delay times between birth and merger(often $o(10{\rm gyr})$). though long delays occur, almost all of our modelspredict that a higher proportion of short grbs should occur at moderate to highredshift (e.g., $z&gt;1$) than has presently been observed, in agreement withrecent observations which suggest a selection bias towards successful follow-upof low-redshift short grbs. finally, if only a fraction of bh-ns mergers havethe right combination of masses and spins to make grbs, then at best only asmall fraction of bh-ns models could be consistent with all {\em current}available data.

0908.3635	binary compact object coalescence rates: the role of elliptical galaxies	we estimate binary compact object merger detection rates for ligo, includingthe binaries formed in ellipticals long ago. specifically, we convolve hundredsof model realizations of elliptical- and spiral-galaxy population syntheseswith a model for elliptical- and spiral-galaxy star formation history as afunction of redshift. our results favor local merger rate densities of 4\times10^{-3} {mpc}^{-3}{myr}^{-1} for binary black holes (bh), 3\times 10^{-2}{mpc}^{-3}{myr}^{-1} for binary neutron stars (ns), and 10^{-2}{mpc}^{-3}{myr}^{-1} for bh-ns binaries. mergers in elliptical galaxies are asignificant fraction of our total estimate for bh-bh and bh-ns detection rates;ns-ns detection rates are dominated by the contribution from spiral galaxies.using only models that reproduce current observations of galactic ns-nsbinaries, we find slightly higher rates for ns-ns and largely similar rangesfor bh-ns and bh-bh binaries. assuming a detection signal-to-noise ratiothreshold of 8 for a single detector (as part of a network), corresponding toradii \cv of the effective volume inside of which a single ligo detector couldobserve the inspiral of two 1.4 m_\sun neutron stars of 14 mpc and 197 mpc, forinitial and advanced ligo, we find event rates of any merger type of 2.9*10^{-2} -- 0.46 and 25-400 per year (at 90% confidence level), respectively. wealso find that the probability p_{detect} of detecting one or more mergers withthis single detector can be approximated by (i) p_{detect}\simeq 0.4+0.5\log(t/0.01{yr}), assuming \cv=197 {mpc} and it operates for t years, for t between2 days and 0.1 {yr}); or by (ii) p_{detect}\simeq 0.5 + 1.5 \log \cv/32{mpc},for one year of operation and for $\cv$ between 20 and 70 mpc.

1003.2480	predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors	we present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types ofcompact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advancedversions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors ligo and virgo.astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a numberof assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. the mostconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binaryneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars inour galaxy. these yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per myr per milky wayequivalent galaxy (mweg), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 permyr per mweg to 1000 per myr per mweg. we convert coalescence rates intodetection rates based on data from the ligo s5 and virgo vsr2 science runs andprojected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. using the detectorsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02per year for initial ligo-virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between0.0002 and 0.2 per year. the likely binary neutron-star detection rate for theadvanced ligo-virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a rangebetween 0.4 and 400 per year.

1004.0386	the effect of metallicity on the detection prospects for gravitational  waves	data from the sdss (300,000 galaxies) indicates that recent star formation(within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half the stars form from gas withhigh amounts of metals (solar metallicity), and the other half form with smallcontribution of elements heavier than helium (10-30% solar). theoreticalstudies of mass loss from the brightest stars derive significantly higherstellar-origin bh masses (30-80 msun) than previously estimated for sub-solarcompositions. we combine these findings to estimate the probability ofdetecting gravitational waves (gws) arising from the inspiral of double compactobjects. our results show that a low metallicity environment significantlyboosts the formation of double compact object binaries with at least one bh. inparticular, we find the gw detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if themetallicity is decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50mixture of solar and 10% solar metallicity. the current sensitivity of the twolargest instruments to ns-ns binary inspirals (virgo: 9 mpc; ligo: 18) is nothigh enough to ensure a first detection. however, our results indicate that ifa future instrument increased the sensitivity to 50-100 mpc, a detection of gwswould be expected within the first year of observation. it was previouslythought that ns-ns inspirals were the most likely source for gw detection. ourresults indicate that bh-bh binaries are 25-times more likely sources thanns-ns systems and that we are on the cusp of gw detection.

1109.1050	blindly detecting orbital modulations of jets from merging supermassive  black holes	in the last few years before merger, supermassive black hole binaries willrapidly inspiral and precess in a magnetic field imposed by a surroundingcircumbinary disk. multiple simulations suggest this relative motion willconvert some of the local energy to a poynting-dominated outflow, with aluminosity 10^{43} erg/s * (b/10^4 g)^2(m/10^8 msun)^2 (v/0.4 c)^2, some ofwhich may emerge as synchrotron emission at frequencies near 1 ghz wherecurrent and planned wide-field radio surveys will operate. on top of a secularincrease in power on the gravitational wave inspiral timescale, orbital motionwill produce significant, detectable modulations, both on orbital periods and(if black hole spins are not aligned with the binary's total angular momenta)spin-orbit precession timescales. because the gravitational wave merger timeincreases rapidly with separation, we find vast numbers of these transients areubiquitously predicted, unless explicitly ruled out (by low efficiency$\epsilon$) or obscured (by accretion geometry f_{geo}). if the fraction ofpoynting flux converted to radio emission times the fraction of lines of sightaccessible $f_{geo}$ is sufficiently large (f_{geo} \epsilon &gt; 2\times 10^{-4}for a 1 year orbital period), at least one event is accessible to future blindsurveys at a nominal 10^4 {deg}^2 with 0.5 mjy sensitivity. our proceduregeneralizes to other flux-limited surveys designed to investigate em signaturesassociated with many modulations produced by merging smbh binaries.

1109.1809	directional limits on persistent gravitational waves using ligo s5  science data	the gravitational-wave (gw) sky may include nearby pointlike sources as wellas astrophysical and cosmological stochastic backgrounds. since the relativestrength and angular distribution of the many possible sources of gws are notwell constrained, searches for gw signals must be performed in amodel-independent way. to that end we perform two directional searches forpersistent gws using data from the ligo s5 science run: one optimized forpointlike sources and one for arbitrary extended sources. the latter result isthe first of its kind. finding no evidence to support the detection of gws, wepresent 90% confidence level (cl) upper-limit maps of gw strain power withtypical values between 2-20x10^-50 strain^2 hz^-1 and 5-35x10^-49 strain^2hz^-1 sr^-1 for pointlike and extended sources respectively. the limits onpointlike sources constitute a factor of 30 improvement over the previous bestlimits. we also set 90% cl limits on the narrow-band root-mean-square gw strainfrom interesting targets including sco x-1, sn1987a and the galactic center aslow as ~7x10^-25 in the most sensitive frequency range near 160 hz. theselimits are the most constraining to date and constitute a factor of 5improvement over the previous best limits.

1201.2113	is j enough? comparison of gravitational waves emitted along the total  angular momentum direction with other preferred orientations	the gravitational wave signature emitted from a merging binary depends on theorientation of an observer relative to the binary. previous studies suggestthat emission along the total initial or total final angular momenta leads toboth the strongest and simplest signal from a precessing compact binary. inthis paper we describe a concrete counterexample: a binary with $m_1/m_2=4$,$a_1=0.6 \hat{x} = -a_2$, placed in orbit in the x,y plane. we extract thegravitational wave emission along several proposed emission directions,including the initial (newtonian) orbital angular momentum; the final (~initial) total angular momentum; and the dominant principal axis of $&lt;l_al_b&gt;_m$. using several diagnostics, we show that the suggested preferreddirections are not representative. for example, only for a handful of otherdirections (&lt; 15%) will the gravitational wave signal have comparable shape tothe one extracted along each of these fiducial directions, as measured by ageneralized overlap (&gt;0.95). we conclude that the information available in justone direction (or mode) does not adequately encode the complexity oforientation-dependent emission for even short signals from merging black holebinaries. future investigations of precessing, unequal-mass binaries shouldcarefully explore and model their orientation-dependent emission.

1209.3712	precession during merger 1: strong polarization changes are  observationally accessible features of strong-field gravity during binary  black hole merger	the short gravitational wave signal from the merger of compact binariesencodes a surprising amount of information about the strong-field dynamics ofmerger into frequencies accessible to ground-based interferometers. in thispaper we describe a previously-unknown "precession" of the peak emissiondirection with time, both before and after the merger, about the total angularmomentum direction. we demonstrate the gravitational wave polarization encodesthe orientation of this direction to the line of sight. we argue the effects ofpolarization can be estimated nonparametrically, directly from thegravitational wave signal as seen along one line of sight, as a slowly-varyingfeature on top of a rapidly-varying carrier. after merger, our results can beinterpreted as a coherent excitation of quasinormal modes of different angularorders, a superposition which naturally "precesses" and modulates theline-of-sight amplitude. recent analytic calculations have arrived at a similargeometric interpretation. we suspect the line-of-sight polarization contentwill be a convenient observable with which to define new high-precision testsof general relativity using gravitational waves. additionally, as the nonlinearmerger process seeds the initial coherent perturbation, we speculate theamplitude of this effect provides a new probe of the strong-field dynamicsduring merger. to demonstrate the ubiquity of the effects we describe, wesummarize the post-merger evolution of 104 generic precessing binary mergers.finally, we provide estimates for the detectable impacts of precession on thewaveforms from high-mass sources. these expressions may identify new precessingbinary parameters whose waveforms are dissimilar from the existing sample.

0712.1036	the lowest-mass stellar black holes: catastrophic death of neutron stars  in gamma-ray bursts	mergers of double neutron stars are considered the most likely progenitorsfor short gamma-ray bursts. indeed such a merger can produce a black hole witha transient accreting torus of nuclear matter (lee &amp; ramirez-ruiz 2007,oechslin &amp; janka 2006), and the conversion of a fraction of the torusmass-energy to radiation can power a gamma-ray burst (nakar 2006). usingavailable binary pulsar observations supported by our extensive evolutionarycalculations of double neutron star formation, we demonstrate that the fractionof mergers that can form a black hole -- torus system depends very sensitivelyon the (largely unknown) maximum neutron star mass. we show that the availableobservations and models put a very stringent constraint on this maximum massunder the assumption that a black hole formation is required to produce a shortgamma-ray burst in a double neutron star merger. specifically, we find that themaximum neutron star mass must be within 2 - 2.5 msun. moreover, a singleunambiguous measurement of a neutron star mass above 2.5 msun would exclude ablack hole -- torus central engine model of short gamma-ray bursts in doubleneutron star mergers. such an observation would also indicate that if in factshort gamma-ray bursts are connected to neutron star mergers, the gamma-rayburst engine is best explained by the lesser known model invoking a highlymagnetized massive neutron star (e.g., usov 1992; kluzniak &amp; ruderman 1998; daiet al. 2006; metzger, quataert &amp; thompson 2007).

1304.1775	parameter estimation for compact binary coalescence signals with the  first generation gravitational-wave detector network	compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the mostpromising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. gravitationalradiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameterestimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detectioncandidate events. detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inferenceon several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location anddistance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.however, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of modelsdescribing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals addedeither in hardware or software to the data collected by the two ligoinstruments and the virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed tothe collaboration. we exemplify the ability to extract information about thesource physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameterspace over the individual mass range 1 msun - 25 msun and the full range ofspin parameters. the cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of thestatus of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanceddetectors.

1304.3332	a single-spin precessing gravitational wave in closed form	in coming years, gravitational wave detectors should find black hole-neutronstar binaries, potentially coincident with astronomical phenomena like shortgrbs. these binaries are expected to precess. gravitational wave sciencerequires a tractable model for precessing binaries, to disentangle precessionphysics from other phenomena like modified strong field gravity, tidaldeformability, or hubble flow; and to measure compact object masses, spins, andalignments. moreover, current searches for gravitational waves from compactbinaries use templates where the binary does not precess and are ill-suited fordetection of generic precessing sources. in this paper we provide a closed-formrepresentation of the single-spin precessing waveform in the frequency domainby reorganizing the signal as a sum over harmonics, each of which resembles anonprecessing waveform. this form enables simple analytic calculations (e.g., afisher matrix) with easily-interpreted results. we have verified that forgeneric bh-ns binaries, our model agress with the time-domain waveform to 2\%.straightforward extensions of the derivations outlined here [and provided infull online] allow higher accuracy and error estimates.

1308.4704	parameter estimation of gravitational waves from nonprecessing bh-ns  inspirals with higher harmonics: comparing mcmc posteriors to an effective  fisher matrix	using the \texttt{lalinference} markov-chain monte carlo parameter estimationcode, we examine two distinct nonprecessing black hole-neutron star (bh-ns)binaries with and without higher-order harmonics. our simulations suggest thathigher harmonics provide a minimal amount of additional information,principally about source geometry. higher harmonics do providedisproportionately more information than expected from the signal power. ourresults compare favorably to the "effective fisher matrix" approach.extrapolating using analytic scalings, we expect higher harmonics will providelittle new information about nonprecessing bh-ns binaries at the signalamplitudes expected for the first few detections. any study of subdominantdegrees of freedom in gravitational wave astronomy can adopt the toolspresented here ($v/v_{\rm prior}$ and $d_{kl}$) to assess whether new physicsis accessible (e.g., modifications of gravity; spin-orbit misalignment) and ifso precisely what information those new parameters provide. forastrophysicists, we provide a concrete illustration of how well parameters of abh-ns binary can be measured, relevant to the astrophysical interpretation ofcoincident em and gw events (e.g., short grbs). for our fiducialinitial-detector example, the individual masses can be determined to liebetween $7.11-11.48 m_\odot$ and $1.77-1.276m_\odot$ at greater than 99%confidence, accounting for unknown bh spin. assuming comparable control overwaveform systematics, future measurements of bh-ns binaries can constrain thebh and perhaps ns mass distributions.

1403.0544	parameter estimation of gravitational waves from precessing bh-ns  inspirals with higher harmonics	precessing black hole-neutron star (bh-ns) binaries produce a richgravitational wave signal, encoding the binary's nature and inspiralkinematics. using the lalinference\_mcmc markov-chain monte carlo parameterestimation code, we use two fiducial examples to illustrate how the geometryand kinematics are encoded into the modulated gravitational wave signal, usingcoordinates well-adapted to precession. even for precessing binaries, we showthe performance of detailed parameter estimation can be estimated by"effective" estimates: comparisons of a prototype signal with its nearestneighbors, adopting a fixed sky location and idealized two-detector network. weuse detailed and effective approaches to show higher harmonics provide nonzerobut small local improvement when estimating the parameters of precessing bh-nsbinaries. that said, we show higher harmonics can improve parameter estimationaccuracy for precessing binaries ruling out approximately-degenerate sourceorientations.  our work illustrates quantities gravitational wave measurements can provide,such as reliable component masses and the precise orientation of a precessingshort gamma ray burst progenitor relative to the line of sight. "effective"estimates may provide a simple way to estimate trends in the performance ofparameter estimation for generic precessing bh-ns binaries in next-generationdetectors. for example, our results suggest that the orbital chirp rate,precession rate, and precession geometry are roughly-independent observables,defining natural variables to organize correlations in the high-dimensionalbh-ns binary parameter space.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1502.04370	a novel scheme for rapid parallel parameter estimation of gravitational  waves from compact binary coalescences	we introduce a highly-parallelizable architecture for estimating parametersof compact binary coalescence using gravitational-wave data and waveformmodels. using a spherical harmonic mode decomposition, the waveform isexpressed as a sum over modes that depend on the intrinsic parameters (e.g.masses) with coefficients that depend on the observer dependent extrinsicparameters (e.g. distance, sky position). the data is then prefiltered againstthose modes, at fixed intrinsic parameters, enabling efficiently evaluation ofthe likelihood for generic source positions and orientations, independent ofwaveform length or generation time. we efficiently parallelize our intrinsicspace calculation by integrating over all extrinsic parameters using a montecarlo integration strategy. since the waveform generation and prefilteringhappens only once, the cost of integration dominates the procedure. also, weoperate hierarchically, using information from existing gravitational-wavesearches to identify the regions of parameter space to emphasize in oursampling. as proof of concept and verification of the result, we haveimplemented this algorithm using standard time-domain waveforms, processingeach event in less than one hour on recent computing hardware. for most eventswe evaluate the marginalized likelihood (evidence) with statistical errors ofless than about 5%, and even smaller in many cases. with a bounded runtimeindependent of the waveform model starting frequency, a nearly-unchangedstrategy could estimate ns-ns parameters in the 2018 advanced ligo era. ouralgorithm is usable with any noise curve and existing time-domain model at anymass, including some waveforms which are computationally costly to evolve.

astro-ph;0408387	mapping inspiral rates on population synthesis parameters	formation rates of compact-object binaries are often derived from populationsynthesis calculations. however, such calculations depend sensitively on arelatively large number of model input parameters. given considerableuncertainty in those model parameters, the predicted inspiral rates for doublecompact objects relevant to gravitational-wave interferometric detectors havebeen shown to be are uncertain by several orders of magnitude. typically,inspiral rates are estimated for only a small set of models with a remarkablypoor coverage of the highly multi-dimensional parameter space (primarilybecause of limited computer resources). here, using as an example sevenpopulation-synthesis model parameters, we show that it is possible to derivefits of double-compact-object inspiral rates dependent simultaneously on allseven parameters. we find these fits to be accurate to 50% for binary blackholes and to 40% for binary neutron stars. the availability of such fitsimplies that (i) depending on the problem of interest, it is not necessary tocomplete large numbers of computationally demanding population synthesiscalculations; and (ii) for the first time, the sufficient exploration of therelevant phase space and the assessment of the uncertainties involved is notlimited by computational resources and becomes feasible. finally, we have alsoproduced a histogram of the (a priori likely) binary black hole inpsiral rate,assuming our population synthesis models are equally likely. this histogram,effectively an a priori probability distribution for the bh-bh inspiral rate,suggests that merger rate is conservatively bounded below by10^(-8)/yr/milky-way-galaxy.

astro-ph;0503219	bounds on expected black hole spins in inspiraling binaries	as a first step towards understanding the angular momentum evolution historyof black holes in merging black-hole/neutron-star binaries, we performpopulation synthesis calculations to track the distribution of accretionhistories of compact objects in such binaries. we find that there are threedistinct processes which can possibly contribute to the black-hole spinmagnitude: a birth spin for the black hole, imparted at either (i) the collapseof a massive progenitor star to a black hole or (ii) the accretion-inducedcollapse of a neutron star to a black hole; and (iii) an accretion spin-up whenthe already formed black hole [via (i) or (ii)] goes through an accretionepisode (through an accretion disk or a common-envelope phase). our resultsshow that, with regard to accretion-induced spinup in merging bh-ns binaries[method (iii) above], only  {\em accretion episodes associated with common-envelope phases andhypercritical accretion rates} occur in the formation history of merging blackhole/neutron star binaries. lacking unambiguous experimental information aboutbh birth spins [i.e., regarding the results of processes (i) and (ii)], wechoose two fiducial values for the bh birth angular momentum parameter a=j/m^2,consistent with observations of (i) ns birth spins (a roughly 0) and (ii) x-raybinaries (a=0.5). using these two fiducial values and a conservative upperbound on the specific angular momentum of accreted matter, we discuss theexpected range of black hole spins in the binaries of interest. we concludewith comments on the significance of these results for ground-basedgravitational-wave searches of inspiral signals from black hole binaries.

astro-ph;0504479	constraining population synthesis models via the binary neutron star  population	the observed sample of double neutron-star (ns-ns) binaries presents achallenge to population-synthesis models of compact object formation: theparameters entering into these models must be carefully chosen so as to match(i) the observed star formation rate and (ii) the formation rate of ns-nsbinaries, which can be estimated from the observed sample and the selectioneffects related to the discoveries with radio-pulsar surveys. in this paper, weselect from an extremely broad family of possible population synthesis modelsthose few (2%) which are consistent with the observed sample of ns-ns binaries.to further sharpen the constraints the observed ns-ns population places uponour understanding of compact-object formation processes, we separate theobserved ns-ns population into two channels: (i) merging ns-ns binaries, whichwill inspiral and merge through the action of gravitational waves within $10 $gyr, and (ii) wide ns-ns binaries, consisting of all the rest. with the subsetof astrophysically consistent models, we explore the implications for the ratesat which double black hole (bh-bh), black hole-neutron star (bh-ns), and ns-nsbinaries will merge through the emission of gravitational waves.

astro-ph;0609465	mapping population synthesis event rates on model parameters ii:  convergence and accuracy of multidimensional fits	binary population synthesis calculations and associated predictions,especially event rates, are known to depend on a significant number of inputmodel parameters with different degrees of sensitivity. at the same time, forsystems with relatively low formation rates, such simulations are heavilycomputationally demanding and therefore the needed explorations of thehigh-dimensional parameter space require major -- often prohibitive --computational resources. in the present study, to better understand several keyevent rates involving binary evolution and binaries with two compact objects inmilky way-like galaxies and to provide ways of reducing the computational costsof complete parameter space explorations: (i) we perform a methodical parameterstudy of the \emph{startrack} population synthesis code ; and (ii) we develop aformalism and methodology for the derivation of {\em multi-dimensional fits}for event rates. we significantly generalize our earlier study, and we focus onways of thoroughly assessing the accuracy of the fits. we anticipate that theefficient tools developed here can be applied in lieu of large-scale populationcalculations and will facilitate the exploration of the dependence of ratepredictions on a wide range binary evolution parameters. such explorations canthen allow the derivation of constraints on these parameters, given empiricalrate constraints and accounting for fitting errors. here we describe in detailthe principles and practice behind constructing these fits, estimating theiraccuracy, and comparing them with observations in a manner that accounts fortheir errors.

astro-ph;0610076	constraining population synthesis models via empirical binary compact  object merger and supernovae rates	the observed samples of supernovae (sn) and double compact objects (dcos)provide several critical constraints on population-synthesis models: theparameters of these models must be carefully chosen to reproduce, among otherfactors, (i) the formation rates of double neutron star (ns-ns) binaries and ofwhite dwarf-neutron star (wd-ns) binaries, estimated from binary samples, and(ii) the type ii and ib/c supernova rates. even allowing for extremelyconservative accounting of the uncertainties in observational and theoreticalpredictions, we find only a few plausible population synthesis models  (roughly 9%) are consistent with dco and sn rates empirically determined fromobservations. as a proof of concept, we describe the information that can beextracted about population synthesis models given such stringent observationaltests, including surprisingly good agreement with the neutron star kickdistributions inferred from pulsar proper-motion measurements. in the presentstudy, we find that the current observational constraints favor: kicksdescribed by a single maxwellian with a typical velocity of about 300km/s;mass-loss fractions during non-conservative, but stable, mass transfer episodesof about 90%; and common envelope parameters of about 0.2-0.5. finally, we usethe subset of astrophysically consistent models to predict the rates at whichblack hole-neutron star (bh-ns) and ns-ns binaries merge in the milky way andthe nearby universe, assuming milky-way-like galaxies dominate.

gr-qc;0211023	transition from inspiral to plunge for eccentric equatorial kerr orbits	ori and thorne have discussed the duration and observability (with lisa) ofthe transition from circular, equatorial inspiral to plunge for stellar-massobjects into supermassive ($10^{5}-10^{8}m_{\odot}$) kerr black holes. weextend their computation to eccentric kerr equatorial orbits. even with orbitalparameters near-exactly determined, we find that there is no universal lengthfor the transition; rather, the length of the transition depends sensitively --essentially randomly -- on initial conditions. still, ori and thorne'szero-eccentricity results are essentially an upper bound on the length ofeccentric transitions involving similar bodies (e.g., $a$ fixed). hence theimplications for observations are no better: if the massive body is$m=10^{6}m_{\odot}$, the captured body has mass $m$, and the process occurs atdistance $d$ from lisa, then $s/n \lesssim (m/10m_{\odot})(1\text{gpc}/d)\times o(1)$, with the precise constant depending onthe black hole spin. for low-mass bodies ($m \lesssim 7 m_\odot$) for which theevent rate is at least vaguely understood, we expect little chance (probably[much] less than 10%, depending strongly on the astrophysical assumptions) oflisa detecting a transition event with $s/n&gt;5$ during its run; however, even asmall infusion of higher-mass bodies or a slight improvement in lisa's noisecurve could potentially produce $s/n&gt;5$ transition events during lisa'slifetime.

0812.0591	impact of star formation inhomogeneities on merger rates and  interpretation of ligo results	within the next decade, ground based gravitational wave detectors are inprinciple capable of determining the compact object merger rate per unit volumeof the local universe to better than 20% with more than 30 detections. we arguethat the stellar models are sensitive to heterogeneities (in age andmetallicity at least) in such a way that the predicted merger rates are subjectto an additional 30-50% systematic errors unless these heterogeneities aretaken into account. without adding new electromagnetic constraints on massivebinary evolution or relying on more information from each merger (e.g., binarymasses and spins), as few as the $\simeq 5$ merger detections could exhaust theinformation available in a naive comparison to merger rate predictions. as aconcrete example, we use a nearby-universe catalog to demonstrate that no onetracer of stellar content can constrain merger rates without introducing asystematic error of order $o(30%)$ at 90% confidence. more generally, we arguethat theoretical binary evolution can depend sufficiently sensitively onstar-forming conditions -- even assuming no uncertainty in binary evolutionmodel -- that the \emph{distribution} of star forming conditions must beincorporated to reduce the systematic error in merger rate predictions belowroughly 40%.
