0903.5205	x-ray variability of agns in the soft and the hard x-ray bands	we investigate the x-ray variability characteristics of hard x-ray selectedagns (based on swift/bat data) in the soft x-ray band using the rxte/asm data.the uncertainties involved in the individual dwell measurements of asm arecritically examined and a method is developed to combine a large number ofdwells with appropriate error propagation to derive long duration fluxmeasurements (greater than 10 days). we also provide a general prescription toestimate the errors in variability derived from rms values from unequallyspaced data. though the derived variability for individual sources are not ofvery high significance, we find that, in general, the soft x-ray variability ishigher than those in hard x-rays and the variability strengths decrease withenergy for the diverse classes of agn. we also examine the strength ofvariability as a function of the break time scale in the power density spectrum(derived from the estimated mass and bolometric luminosity of the sources) andfind that the data are consistent with the idea of higher variability at timescales longer than the break time scale.

0905.3819	associated spectral and temporal state transition of the bright ulx  ngc1313 x-1	(abridged) stellar mass black hole x-ray binaries exhibit x-ray spectralstates which also have distinct and characteristic temporal properties. thesestates are believed to correspond to different accretion disk geometries. wepresent analysis of two long xmm-newton observations of the ultra-luminousx-ray source (ulx) ngc 1313 x-1, which reveal that the system was in twodifferent spectral/temporal states. with a count rate of 1.5 counts/s and afractional variability amplitude of ~15%, the ulx was in a high flux andstrongly variable state in march 2006. in october 2006, the count rate of theulx had reduced by a factor of ~2 and the spectral shape was distinctlydifferent with the presence of a soft component. no strong variability wasdetected during this low flux state with an upper limit on the amplitude &lt; 3%.moreover, the spectral properties of the two states implies that the accretiondisk geometry was different for them. the low flux state is consistent with amodel where a standard accretion disk is truncated at a radius of ~17schwarzschild radius around a ~200 msun black hole. the inner hot regioncomptonizes photons from the outer disk to give the primary spectral component.the spectrum of the high flux state is not compatible with such a geometry.instead, it is consistent with a model where a hot corona covers a coldaccretion disk and comptonizes the disk photons. the variability as a functionof energy is also shown to be consistent with the corona model. despite thesebroad analogies with galactic black hole systems, the spectral nature of theulx is distinct in having a colder comptonizing temperature (~2 kev) and higheroptical depth (~15) than what is observed for the galactic ones.

1011.6450	anti-correlated soft lags in the intermediate state of black hole source  gx 339-4	we report the few hundred second anti-correlated soft lags between soft andhard energy bands in the source gx 339-4 using rxte observations. in oneobservation, anti-correlated soft lags were observed using the isgri/integralhard energy band and the pca/rxte soft energy band light curves. the lags wereobserved when the source was in hard and soft intermediate states, i.e., in asteep power-law state.we found that the temporal and spectral properties werechanged during the lag timescale. the anti-correlated soft lags are associatedwith spectral variability during which the geometry of the accretion disk ischanged. the observed temporal and spectral variations are explained using theframework of truncated disk geometry. we found that during the lag timescale,the centroid frequency of quasi-periodic oscillation is decreased, the softflux is decreased along with an increase in the hard flux, and the power-lawindex steepens together with a decrease in the disk normalization parameter. weargue that these changes could be explained if we assume that the hot coronacondenses and forms a disk in the inner region of the accretion disk. theoverall spectral and temporal changes support the truncated geometry of theaccretion disk in the steep power-law state or in the intermediate state.

1110.1994	measuring the pulse of grb 090618: a simultaneous spectral and timing  analysis of the prompt emission	we develop a new method for simultaneous timing and spectral studies of gammaray burst (grb) prompt emission and apply it to make a pulse-wise descriptionof the prompt emission of grb 090618, the brightest grb detected in the fermiera. we exploit the large area (and sensitivity) of swift/bat and the wide bandwidth of fermi/gbm to derive the parameters for a complete spectral and timingdescription of the individual pulses of this grb, based on the variousempirical relations suggested in the literature. we demonstrate that thisempirical model correctly describes the other observed properties of the burstlike the variation of the lag with energy and the pulse width with energy. themeasurements also show an indication of an increase in pulse width as afunction of energy at low energies for some of the pulses, which is naturallyexplained as an off-shoot of some particular combination of the modelparameters. we argue that these model parameters, particularly the peak energyat the beginning of the pulse, are the natural choices to be used forcorrelation with luminosity. the implications of these results for the use ofgrbs as standard candles are briefly described.

1111.6219	coupled hbo and nbo variations in the z source gx 5-1: inner accretion  disk as the location of qpos	the simultaneous and coupled evolution of horizontal branch oscillation (hbo)and normal branch oscillation (nbo) in z-type sources suggests that theproduction of hbo is connected to nbo and is caused by changes in thephysical/radiative properties of the inner accretion disk, although there is alack of substantial spectral evidence to support this. in this {\it letter}, wepresent the results of an analysis of a rxte observation of a z source gx~5-1,where the 6 hz nbo is simultaneously detected along with a hbo at 51 hz. thevariations in the intensity and the associated power density spectrum indicatethat the hbo and nbo are strongly coupled, originating from the same locationin the inner accretion disk. the absence of hbo and nbo in the lower energybands, an increase in the rms amplitude with energy and a smooth transitionamong them suggest that they are produced in the hot inner regions of theaccretion disk. based on a spectral analysis, we found a signature of changingor physically modified inner disk front during the coupled hbo and nboevolution. we explore the various models to explain the observed phenomenon andpropose that the nbo is affiliated to the oscillations in the thick/puffed-upinner region of the accretion disk.

1202.3089	correlation between the isotropic energy and the peak energy at zero  fluence for the individual pulses of grbs: towards an universal physical  correlation for the prompt emission	we find a strong correlation between the peak energy at zero fluence ($\rme_{peak,0}$) and the isotropic energy ($\rm e_{\gamma,iso}$) of the 22 pulsesof 9 gamma ray bursts (grb) detected by the fermi satellite. the correlationholds for the individual pulses of each grb, which shows the reality of thecorrelation. the derived correlation (spearman correlation coefficient, $r$, is0.96) is much stronger compared to the correlations using $\rm e_{peak}$ (inplace of $\rm e_{peak,0}$) determined from the time-integrated spectrum ($r$ =0.8), or the time-resolved spectrum not accounting for broad pulse structures($r$ = 0.37), or the pulse-wise spectrum ($r$ = 0.89). though the improvementin the $\rm e_{peak}$ - $\rm e_{\gamma,iso}$ relation (the amati relation) fora pulse-wise analysis is known earlier, this is the first time a parameterderived from a joint spectral and timing fit to the data is shown to improvethe correlation. we suggest that $\rm e_{peak,0}$, rather than $\rm e_{peak}$,is intrinsic to a grb pulse and a natural choice as the parameter in thepulse-wise correlation studies.

1203.1674	fast transition of type-b qpo in the black hole transient xte j1817-330	the evolution of different types of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) andthe coupled radiative/physical changes in the accretion disk are still poorlyunderstood. in a few black hole binaries it was found that fast evolution ofqpos is associated with spectral variations. such studies in other black holebinaries are important to understand the qpo phenomenon. for the black holetransient xte j1817-330, we study fast qpo transitions and accompanyingspectral variations to investigate what causes the spectral variation duringthe qpo transition. roy et al.

1207.1774	pulse spectral evolution of grbs: implication as standard candle	using an \emph{empirical} description of a prompt grb pulse, we analyze theindividual pulses of all fermi/gbm grbs with known redshifts, till july 2009.this description is simultaneous in time and energy and allows one to determinethe peak energy of band spectrum at zero fluence ($e_{peak,0}$). wedemonstrate, for the first time, that the $e_{peak,0}$ bears a very strongcorrelation with the isotropic energy of the individual pulses, and hence, eachpulse can be used as a luminosity indicator. as a physical description isneeded in order to use grb pulses for cosmological purposes, we explore otherphysical spectral models. as pulses are the building blocks of a grb, we chooseanother sample of fermi/gbm grbs having bright, long and single/ separablepulse(s) and fit the time-resolved spectra of the individual pulses with theband model and a model consisting of a blackbody and a power-law. both thesemodels give acceptable fits. we find that the peak energy/ temperature alwaysdecreases exponentially with fluence in the later part of a pulse. weinvestigate multiple spectral components in the initial rising part and providea comprehensive empirical description of the spectral and timing behaviour ofprompt grb pulses. this work strongly extends the possibility of using grbpulses as standard candles and the spectral parameters as proxy for redshift.

1302.6091	a new method of pulse-wise spectral analysis of gamma-ray bursts	time-resolved spectral analysis, though a very promising method to understandthe emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (grbs), is difficult to implement inpractice because of poor statistics. we present a new method for pulse-wisetime-resolved spectral study of the individual pulses of grbs, using the factthat many spectral parameters are either constants or smooth functions of time.we use this method for the two pulses of grb 081221, the brightest grb withseparable pulses. we choose, from the literature, a set of possible modelswhich includes the band model, blackbody with a power-law (bbpl), a collectionof black bodies with a smoothly varying temperature profile, along with apower-law (mbbpl), and two blackbodies with a power-law (2bbpl). first, weperform time-resolved study to confirm the spectral parameter variations, andthen construct the new model to perform a joint spectral fit. we find that anyphotospheric emission in terms of black bodies is required mainly in the risingparts of the pulses and the falling part can be adequately explained in termsof the band model, with the low energy photon index within the regime ofsynchrotron model. interestingly, we find that 2bbpl is comparable or sometimeseven better, though marginally, than the band model, in all episodes.consistent results are also obtained for the brightest grb of fermi era --- grb090618. we point out that the method is generic enough to test any spectralmodel with well defined parameter variations.

1303.4298	a possible evolutionary scenario of highly magnetized  super-chandrasekhar white dwarfs: progenitors of peculiar type ia supernovae	several recently discovered peculiar type ia supernovae seem to demand analtogether new formation theory that might help explain the puzzlingdissimilarities between them and the standard type ia supernovae. the moststriking aspect of the observational analysis is the necessity of invokingsuper-chandrasekhar white dwarfs having masses ~ 2.1-2.8m_sun, m_sun being themass of sun, as their most probable progenitors. strongly magnetized whitedwarfs having super-chandrasekhar masses were already established to bepotential candidates for the progenitors of peculiar type ia supernovae. owingto the landau quantization of the underlying electron degenerate gas,theoretical results yielded the observationally inferred mass range. here wesketch a possible evolutionary scenario by which super-chandrasekhar whitedwarfs could be formed by accretion on to a commonly observed magnetized whitedwarf, invoking the phenomenon of flux freezing. this opens the multiplepossible evolutions ending in supernova explosions of super-chandrasekhar whitedwarfs having masses within the range stated above. we point out that ourproposal has observational support, like, the recent discovery of a largenumber of magnetized white dwarfs by sdss.

1303.6160	the uncorrelated long term gamma-ray and x-ray variability of blazars  and its implications on disk-jet coupling	we examine the long term (~10 years) gamma-ray variability of blazarsobserved by egret and fermi and find that for six sources the average fluxvaried by more than an order of magnitude. for two of these sources (pks0208-512 and pks 0528+134), there were extensive observations (at variousobserving periods) by egret. hence these dramatic variations are not due to asingle short time-scale flare, but reflect long term changes in the averageflux. over the last twenty years, these two sources were also the target ofseveral x-ray observatories (e.g. rosat, asca, rxte, bepposax, chandra, suzaku,xmm-newton and swift). while the ratios of the average gamma-ray fluxes betweenegret and fermi observations are 22.9 +/- 1.9 and 12.6 +/- 1.5, their estimated2-10 kev x-ray flux do not show such dramatic variations. the x-ray emissionfrom such flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) are believed to be due tosynchrotron self compton, while gamma-rays originate from inversecomptonization of external soft photons from an accretion disk and/or broadline region. we argue that in this scenario, the only explanation for theuncorrelated variability is that there was an order of magnitude decrease inthe external soft photons, while the jet parameters remained more or lessconstant. this result indicates that perhaps the accretion and jet processesare not tightly coupled in these sources.

1308.2819	a lingering non-thermal component in the grb prompt emission: predicting  gev emission from the mev spectrum	the high energy gev emission of gamma-ray bursts (grbs), detected by\emph{fermi}/lat, has a significantly different morphology compared to thelower energy mev emission, detected by \emph{fermi}/gbm. though the late timegev emission is believed to be synchrotron radiation produced via an externalshock, this emission as early as the prompt phase is puzzling. meaningfulconnection between these two emissions can be drawn only by an accuratedescription of the prompt mev spectrum. we perform a time-resolved spectroscopyof the gbm data of long grbs having significant gev emission, using a modelconsisting of 2 blackbodies and a power-law. we examine in detail the evolutionof the spectral components and found that grbs having high gev emission (grb090902b and grb 090926a) have a delayed onset of the power-law component, inthe gbm spectrum, which lingers at the later part of the prompt emission. thisbehaviour mimics the flux evolution in lat. in contrast, bright gbm grbs withan order of magnitude lower gev emission (grb 100724b and grb 091003) show acoupled variability of the total and the power-law flux. further, by analyzingthe data for a set of 17 grbs, we find a strong correlation between thepower-law fluence in the mev and the lat fluence (pearson correlation: r=0.88and spearman correlation: $\rho=0.81$). we demonstrate that this correlation isnot influenced by the correlation between the total and the power-law fluencesat a confidence level of 2.3$\sigma$. we speculate the possible radiationmechanisms responsible for the correlation.

1309.5233	pulse-wise amati correlation in fermi grbs	we make a detailed pulse-wise study of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with knownredshift detected by \emph{fermi}/gamma ray burst monitor (gbm). the samplecontains 19 grbs with 43 pulses. we find that the average peak energy iscorrelated to the radiated energy (the amati relation) for individual pulseswith a correlation coefficient of 0.86, which is slightly better than thecorrelation for the full grbs. as the present correlation holds within grbs, itis a strong evidence supporting the reliability of such a correlation. weinvestigate several aspects of this correlation. (i) we divide our sample intoredshift bins and study the evolution of the correlation. though there is amarginal indication of evolution of the correlation, we can conclude that thepresent data is consistent with no evolution. (ii) we compare the correlationin the first or single pulses of these grbs to that of the rest of the pulses,and confirm that the correlation is unaffected by the fact that first/singlepulses are generally harder than the rest. finally, we conclude that thepulse-wise amati correlation is more robust and it has the potential ofrefining the correlation so that grb study could be used as a cosmologicaltool.

1405.0119	time-resolved spectral study of fermi grbs having single pulses	we analyze gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by \textit{fermi}/gamma-ray burstmonitor (gbm) and having single pulse. we fit the light curves with a modelhaving exponential rise and decay parts. we perform a detailed time-resolvedspectroscopy using four models: band, blackbody with a power-law (bbpl),multicolour blackbody with a power-law (mbbpl) and two blackbodies with apower-law (2bbpl). we find that models other than the bbpl give better$\chi_{red}^2$ for the "hard-to-soft" (hts) pulses, while for the "intensitytracking" (it) pulses, the bbpl model is statistically as good as the othermodels. interestingly, the energy at the peak of the spectrum resulting fromthe bbpl model ($\sim3kt$), is always lower than that of the $\nu f_{\nu}$spectrum of the band function. the values of the low energy photon index($\alpha$) of the band function are often higher than the fundamental singleparticle synchrotron limit, especially for the hts pulses. specifically we findtwo extreme cases --- for grb~110817a (hts grb) $\alpha$ is always higher,while for grb~100528a (it grb) $\alpha$ is always within the synchrotronregime. the pl component of the bbpl model always starts with a delay comparedto the bb component, and it lingers at the later part of the prompt emissionphase. for three hts grbs, namely, grb~081224, grb~100707a and grb~110721a thisbehaviour is particularly significant and interestingly there are reported latdetections for them. finally, we argue that various evidences hint that neitherbbpl nor band model is acceptable, while 2bbpl and mbbpl are the mostacceptable models for the set of grbs we have analyzed.

1409.4538	discovery of smoothly evolving blackbodies in the early afterglow of grb  090618 : evidence for a spine-sheath jet?	grb 090618 is a bright grb with multiple pulses. it shows evidence of thermalemission in the initial pulses as well as in the early afterglow phase. as highresolution spectral data of \emph{swift}/xrt is available for the earlyafterglow, we investigate the shape and evolution of the thermal component inthis phase using data from the \emph{swift}/bat, the \emph{swift}/xrt, and the\emph{fermi}/gbm detectors. an independent fit to the bat and xrt data revealstwo correlated blackbodies with monotonically decreasing temperatures. hence weinvestigated the combined data with a model consisting of two blackbodies and apower-law (2bbpl), a model suggested for several bright grbs. we elicit thefollowing interesting features of the 2bbpl model: a) the same model isapplicable from the peak of the last pulse in the prompt emission to theafterglow emission, b) the ratio of temperatures and the fluxes of the twoblack bodies remains constant throughout the observations, c) the black bodytemperatures and fluxes show a monotonic decrease with time, with the bb fluxesdropping about a factor of two faster than that of the power-law emission, d)attributing the blackbody emission to photospheric emissions, we find that thephotospheric radii increase very slowly with time, and the lower temperatureblackbody shows a larger emitting radius than that of the higher temperatureblack body. we find some evidence that the underlying shape of the non-thermalemission is a cut-off power-law rather than a power-law. we sketch aspine-sheath jet model to explain our observations.

1505.03296	thermal emissions spanning the prompt and the afterglow phase of the  ultra-long grb 130925a	grb 130925a is an ultra-long grb, and it shows clear evidences for a thermalemission in the soft x-ray data of \emph{swift}/xrt ($\sim0.5$\,kev), lastingtill the x-ray afterglow phase. due to the long duration of the grb, the burstcould be studied in hard x-rays with high-resolution focusing detectors(\emph{nustar}). the blackbody temperature, as measured by the\emph{swift}/xrt, shows a decreasing trend till the late phase (piro et al.2014) whereas the high-energy data reveals a significant blackbody componentduring the late epochs at an order of magnitude higher temperature($\sim5$\,kev), as compared to the contemporaneous low energy data (bellm etal. 2014). we resolve this apparent contradiction by demonstrating that a modelwith two black bodies and a power-law (2bbpl) is consistent with the data rightfrom the late prompt emission to the afterglow phase. both the blackbodies showa similar cooling behaviour upto the late time. we invoke a structured jet,having a fast spine and a slower sheath layer, to identify the location ofthese blackbodies. independent of the physical interpretation, we propose thatthe 2bbpl model is a generic feature of the prompt emission of all long grbs,and the thermal emission found in the afterglow phase of different grbsreflects the lingering thermal component of the prompt emission with diversetime-scales. we strengthen this proposal by pointing out a close similaritybetween the spectral evolutions of this grb and grb~090618, a source withsignificant wide band data during the early afterglow phase.

1506.03629	study of underlying particle spectrum during huge x-ray flare of mkn 421  in april 2013	context: in april 2013, the nearby (z=0.031) tev blazar, mkn 421, showed oneof the largest flares in x-rays since the past decade. aim: to study allmultiwavelength data available during mjd 56392 to 56403, with special emphasison x-ray data, and understand the underlying particle energy distribution.methods: we study the correlations between the uv and gamma bands with thex-ray band using the z-transformed discrete correlation function. we model theunderlying particle spectrum with a single population of electrons emittingsynchrotron radiation, and do a statistical fitting of the simultaneous,time-resolved data from the swift-xrt and the nustar. results: there was rapidflux variability in the x-ray band, with a minimum doubling timescale of $1.69\pm 0.13$ hrs. there were no corresponding flares in uv and gamma bands. thevariability in uv and gamma rays are relatively modest with $ \sim 8 \% $ and$\sim 16 \% $ respectively, and no significant correlation was found with thex-ray light curve. the observed x-ray spectrum shows clear curvature which canbe fit by a log parabolic spectral form. this is best explained to originatefrom a log parabolic electron spectrum. however, a broken power law or a powerlaw with an exponentially falling electron distribution cannot be ruled outeither. moreover, the excellent broadband spectrum from $0.3-79$ kev allows usto make predictions of the uv flux. we find that this prediction is compatiblewith the observed flux during the low state in x-rays. however, during thex-ray flares, the predicted flux is a factor of $2-50$ smaller than theobserved one. this suggests that the x-ray flares are plausibly caused by aseparate population which does not contribute significantly to the radiation atlower energies. alternatively, the underlying particle spectrum can be muchmore complex than the ones explored in this work.

astro-ph;0007250	rapid state transitions in the galactic black hole candidate source grs  1915+105	we examine the x-ray spectral and temporal behavior of the galactic blackhole candidate source grs 1915+105 during its spectral state transitionobserved in 1997 march - august. the source was making a slow transition from alow-hard state to a high-soft state in about three months and during thistransition it was exhibiting a series of fast variations which can beclassified as bursts. during one type of bursts, called the irregular bursts,it was found that the source makes rapid transitions between two intensitystates. we have analyzed the rxte pca data obtained on 1997 june 18 (when thesource was making rapid state transitions) and compared the results with twosets of data each pertaining to the low hard-state and high-soft states. wefind that the power density spectrum (pds) during the burst shows remarkablesimilarity to that seen during the high-soft state of the source. the pdsduring the quiescence, on the other hand, is quite flat and is very similar tothe pds commonly seen during the canonical low-hard state of black hole x-raybinaries. a low frequency qpo at $\sim$3 hz is observed during the quiescence,a property seen during the low-hard state of the source. the x-ray spectrum ofthe source during quiescence is similar to the spectrum seen during thelow-hard state of the source and the spectra during the burst and high-softstate are very similar to each other. these observations corroborate thesuggestion made by yadav et al. (1999) that during the irregular bursts thesource shows spectral state variations at very fast time scales. we explainsuch fast state changes using the two component accretion flow model in whichthe accretion disk consists of a geometrically thin (and optically thick)standard disk co-existing with an advection dominated hot thick disk.

astro-ph;0008414	detection of a series of x-ray dips associated with a radio flare in grs  1915+105	we report the detection of a series of x-ray dips in the galactic black holecandidate grs 1915+105 during 1999 june 6-17 from observations carried out withthe pointed proportional counters of the indian x-ray astronomy experiment onboard the indian satellite irs-p3. the observations were made after the sourcemade a transition from a steady low-hard state to a chaotic state whichoccuered within a few hours. dips of about 20-160 seconds duration are observedon most of the days. the x-ray emission outside the dips shows a qpo at ~ 4 hzwhich has characteristics similar to the ubiquitous 0.5 - 10 hz qpo seen duringthe low-hard state of the source. during the onset of dips this qpo is absentand also the energy spectrum is soft and the variability is low compared to thenon-dip periods. these features gradually re-appear as the dip recovers. theonset of the occurrence of a large number of such dips followed the start of ahuge radio flare of strength 0.48 jy (at 2.25 ghz). we interpret these dips asthe cause for mass ejection due to the evacuation of matter from an accretiondisk around the black hole. we propose that a super-position of a large numberof such dip events produces a huge radio jet in grs 1915+105.

astro-ph;0008433	disk-jet connection in grs 1915+105: x-ray soft dips as cause of radio  flares	we have examined the radio emission characteristics of the micro-quasar grs1915+105 during its x-ray emission states as classified by belloni et al.(2000). we find that the radio emission is high during the 'chi_1' and 'chi_3'states (the radio ``plateau'' state) and also during the 'beta' and 'theta'states when x-ray soft dips are present in the x-ray light curve. for all theother x-ray states we find that the radio emission is low (&lt; 20 mjy at 2.25ghz). this result supports the suggestion made by naik et al. (2000) that theradio flares are caused by a series of x-ray dip events. to further confirmthis result, we have made a systematic study of all the pca rxte observationsfor those days when a radio flare was present. we find 11 such observations andfind that all of them are of class 'beta', 'theta' or 'chi'. further, we haveclassified all the rxte pca observations obtained from 1996 november to 2000february (when the radio data is available) and confirm that the radio flux, onan average, is much higher during the states 'beta', 'theta' and 'chi'. basedon these results, we argue that the radio flares are caused by the x-ray dipsin the source.

astro-ph;0104378	spectral differences between the radio-loud and radio-quiet low-hard  states of grs 1915+105: possible detection of synchrotron radiation in x-rays	the galactic microquasar grs 1915+105 exhibits several episodes of steadyx-ray emission characterized by a hard power-law spectrum and intense quasiperiodic oscillations. it is known that there are two types of such low-hardstates, one with steady radio emission and the other without any significantradio emission. we present the results of a detailed x-ray spectroscopic studyof grs 1915+105, using data from the rossi x-ray timing explorer obtainedduring various episodes of the low-hard states of the source. we show thatthere are distinct x-ray spectral differences between the radio-quiet andradio-loud low-hard states of the source. the x-ray spectra of the radio-quietlow-hard state is best described by a model consisting ofa multicolordisk-blackbody and a comptonized component, whereas the x-ray spectra ofradio-loud low-hard state requires a model consisting of three components: amulticolor disk-blackbody, a comptonized component and a power-law, forstatistically and physically acceptable fits. we attempt to model the presenceof this additional power-law component as due to synchrotronradiation which isresponsible for the radio and infrared radiation from thesource. we show that asimple adiabatically expanding jet model for the synchrotron radiation canaccount for the observed x-ray flux for reasonable values of the magnetic fieldand the mass outflow rate. this is the first report of detection of thesynchrotron radiation in the x-ray band for this source.

astro-ph;0410307	detection of anti-correlated hard x-ray time lag in cygnus x-3	the wide-band x-ray spectra of the high mass x-ray binary cygnus x-3 exhibitsa pivoting behavior in the `low' (as well as `hard') state, correlated to theradio emission. the time scale of the soft and hard x-rays' anti-correlation,which gave rise to the pivoting feature, was found to be less than a day fromthe monitoring observations by rxte--asm and cgro--batse. in this letter wereport the detection of a lag of $\lesssim$ 1000s in the anti-correlation ofthe hard x-ray emission (20--50 kev) to that of the soft x-ray emission (2--7kev), which may be attributed to the viscous time scale of flow of matter inthe accretion disk. this suggests the geometrical picture of a truncatedaccretion disc with a compton cloud inside the disc, the relative sizes ofwhich determine the spectral shape. any change in the disc structure will takeplace in a viscous time scale, with corresponding anti-correlated change in thecompton cloud. we also report the pivoting in the spectra in one span of apointed observation when an episode of the rearranging of the accretion systemis serendipitously observed. this is the first such observation of hard x-raydelay seen in the persistent galactic microquasars, within the precincts of thehard state.

astro-ph;9702113	torque-luminosity correlation and possible evidence for core-crust  relaxation in the x-ray pulsar gx 1+4	we present the detection of a positive correlation between spin-down rate$\dot{p}$ and pulsed x-ray luminosity in the batse archival data of the brighthard x-ray pulsar gx 1+4. we have also seen a delay of 5.6 $\pm$ 1.2 daysbetween the luminosity change and the corresponding change in the spin-downrate. the observed correlation between $\dot{p}$ and l_x is used to reproducethe period history of gx 1+4 based on the observed luminosity alone, and it isfound that the spin period can be predicted correct to 0.026% when theluminosity is adequately sampled. the idea that at a higher luminosity morematter is accreted and the accretion disk extends closer to the neutron starthereby transferring more angular momentum to the system, seems not to be thecase with gx 1+4. the observed lag between the spin-down rate and theluminosity is reported here for the first time in any such binary x-ray pulsar,and is found to be consistent with the time scale for the core-crust relaxationin a neutron star.

astro-ph;9702115	a double peaked pulse profile observed in gx 1+4	the hard x-ray pulsar gx 1+4 was observed several times in the last few yearswith a pair of balloon-borne xenon filled multi-cell proportional counters(xmpc). in a balloon flight made on 22 march 1995, the source was detected in abright state, the average observed source count rate being $8.0\pm0.2/s$ perdetector. x-ray pulsations with a period of $121.9\pm0.1$ s were detected inthe source with a broad double peak pulse feature. when observed in december1993 with the same instrument, the pulse profile of gx 1+4 showed a singlepeak. this change in the pulse profile to a double pulse structure in about 15months indicates either activation of the opposite pole of the neutron star ifthe magnetic field is asymmetric or possibly a change in the beam pattern, froma pencil beam to a fan beam. assuming a fan beam configuration, the pulseprofile is used to find the inclinations of the magnetic axis and the viewingaxis with the spin axis. the derived angles support the ginga observations of adip in the pulse profile which was resolved to have a local maximum in one ofthe observations and was explained with resonance scattering of cyclotron lineenergy photons by the accretion column (makishima et al., \markcite{maki1988},dotani et al., \markcite{dotani1989}.). compared to our previous observation ofthe same source with the same telescope (rao et al., \markcite{rao1994}) aperiod change rate of $0.72 \pm 0.40 s/yr$ is obtained which is the lowest rateof change of period for this source since its discovery. average pulse fractionin the hard x-ray range is low (30%), consistent with its anti correlation withluminosity as reported by us earlier (rao et al., \markcite{rao1994}) and theobserved spectrum is very hard (power law photon index $1.67\pm0.12$).

astro-ph;9710283	x-ray variability of grs 1915+105 during the low-hard state observed  with the indian x-ray astronomy experiment (ixae)	the galactic superluminal transient x-ray source grs 1915+105 was observedwith the pointed proportional counters (ppcs) onboard the indian satelliteirs-p3 during 1996 july 23-27. we report here details of the behavior of thissource during the relatively quiet and low luminosity state. large intensityvariations by a factor of 2 to 3, generally seen in black-hole candidates, areobserved at a time scale of 100 ms to few seconds. no significant variation isdetected over larger time scale of minute or more. the intensity variations aredescribed as sum of shots in the light curve, and the number distribution ofthe shots are found to be exponential function of the fluence and duration ofthe shots. the cross correlation spectrum between 6-18 kev and 2-6 kev x-raysis found to have asymmetry signifying a delay of the hard x-rays by about 0.2to 0.4 sec. this supports the idea of hard x-rays being generated by comptonup-scattering from high energy clouds near the source of soft x-rays. verystrong and narrow quasi periodic oscillations in the frequency range 0.62 to0.82 hz are observed. we discuss about a model which explains a gradual changein the qpo frequencies with corresponding changes in the mass accretion rate ofthe disk.

astro-ph;9710284	observations of cygnus x-1 during the two spectral states with the  indian x-ray astronomy experiment (ixae)	we present the time variability characteristics of cygnus x-1 in its twospectral states. the observations were carried out using the pointedproportional counters (ppc) on-board the indian x-ray astronomy experiment(ixae). the details of the instrument characteristics, the observationstrategy, and the background modeling methods are described. in the soft stateof cyg x-1, we confirm the general trend of the power density spectrum (pds)obtained using the proportional counter array (pca) on-board the rxtesatellite. the hard state of the source just prior to the spectral transitionwas not observed by the pca and we present the pds obtained in this state. wefind that the low frequency end of the pds is flatter than that observed duringthe spectral transition. additionally, we find that there is one more componentin the low frequency end of the pds, which is independent of the spectral stateof the source. the time variability is also examined by taking the statisticsof the occurrence of shots and it is found that the shot duration and shotenergy follow an exponential distribution, with time constants significantlydifferent in the two spectral states. in the soft state of the source a shotwith a very large strength has been identified and it has exponential rise anddecay phases with time constants of 0.4 s. we examine these results in thelight of the current models for accretion onto black holes.

astro-ph;9710285	quasi-regular x-ray bursts from grs 1915+105 observed with the ixae:  possible evidence for matter disappearing into the event horizon of the black  hole	three different types of very intense, quasi-regular x-ray bursts have beenobserved from the galactic superluminal x-ray transient source grs 1915+105with the pointed proportional counters of the indian x-ray astronomy experimentonboard the indian satellite irs-p3. the observations were carried out from1997 june 12 to june 29 in the energy range of 2-18 kev and revealed thepresence of persistent quasi-regular bursts with different structures. only oneof the three types of bursts is regular in occurrence revealing a stableprofile over extended durations. the regular bursts have an exponential risewith a time scale of about 7 s to 10 s and a sharp linear decay in 2 to 3 s.the x-ray spectrum becomes progressively harder as the burst evolves and it isthe hardest near the end of the burst decay. the profile and energetics of thebursts in this black hole candidate source are distinct from both the type iand type ii x-ray bursts observed in neutron star sources. we propose that thesharp decay in the observed burst pattern is a signature of the disappearanceof matter through the black hole horizon. the regular pattern of the bursts canbe produced by material influx into the inner disk due to oscillations in ashock front far away from the compact object.

astro-ph;9710287	broad band x-ray spectrum of cygnus x-1	we present the hard x-ray (20-100 kev) observations of cygnus x-1 obtainedusing a large area balloon-borne xenon filled multi-anode proportional counter(xmpc) telescope. the observations were carried out during the gamma_2 state ofthe source and we obtain a power law photon index of 1.62 +- 0.07. to constrainthe spectral shape of the source, we have analyzed the archival exosat me argonand gspc data in the low energies (2-20 kev band) as well as the archival ossedata in the high energies (50-500 kev). the data in different energy bands arenot obtained in simultaneous observations, but they pertain to the gamma_2state of the source. we have attempted a combined fit to the wide band datausing appropriate mutual detector calibrations. a combined fit to the exosatand xmpc data (2-100 kev) shows that the observed spectrum requires a lowenergy absorption corresponding to the galactic interstellar absorption, a lowenergy excess modeled as blackbody, a narrow emission line due to iron k_alphaand a continuum. the continuum can be either modeled as a power law with areflection bump or a comptonisation model with an additional bump which can bemodeled as the partial covering with a heavy absorber. to resolve between thesetwo models, we have attempted combined fit to the 2-500 kev data obtained fromexosat, xmpc and osse. we find that two component comptonisation modeladequately represents the data. we explore the possible emission region that isresponsible for the observed spectrum.

astro-ph;9901055	different types of x-ray bursts from grs 1915+105 and their origin	we report the x-ray observations of the galactic x-ray transient source grs1915+105 with the ppcs of the indian x-ray astronomy experiment(ixae) onboardthe indian satellite irs-p3 during 1997 june - august, which have revealed thepresence of four types of intense x-ray bursts. all the observed bursts have aslow exponential rise, a sharp linear decay, and they can broadly be put in twoclasses: irregular and quasi-regular bursts in one class, and regular bursts inanother class. the regular bursts are found to have two distinct time scalesand they persist over extended durations. there is a strong correlation betweenthe preceding quiescent time and the burst duration for the quasi-regular andirregular bursts. no such correlation is found for the regular bursts. theratio of average flux during the burst time to the average flux during thequiescent phase is high and variable for the quasi- regular and irregularbursts while it is low and constant for the regular bursts. we suggest that thepeculiar bursts that we have seen are charact- eristic of the change of stateof the source. the source can switch back and forth between the low-hard stateand the high-soft state near critical accretion rates in a very short timescale. a test of the model is presented using the publicly available 13-60 kevrxte/pca data for irregular and regular bursts concurrent with ourobservations.
