0906.4318	constraining dust and color variations of high-z sne using nicmos on  hubble space telescope	we present data from the supernova cosmology project for five high redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) that were obtained using the nicmos infrared cameraon the hubble space telescope. we add two sne from this sample to a rest-framei-band hubble diagram, doubling the number of high redshift supernovae on thisdiagram. this i-band hubble diagram is consistent with a flat universe(omega_matter, omega_lambda= 0.29, 0.71). a homogeneous distribution of largegrain dust in the intergalactic medium (replenishing dust) is incompatible withthe data and is excluded at the 5 sigma confidence level, if the sn host galaxyreddening is corrected assuming r_v=1.75. we use both optical and infraredobservations to compare photometric properties of distant sne ia with those ofnearby objects. we find generally good agreement with the expected colorevolution for all sne except the highest redshift sn in our sample (sn 1997ekat z=0.863) which shows a peculiar color behavior. we also present spectraobtained from ground based telescopes for type identification and determinationof redshift.

0908.3897	hubble space telescope weak-lensing study of the galaxy cluster xmmu  j2235.3-2557 at z=1.4: a surprisingly massive galaxy cluster when the  universe is one-third of its current age	we present a weak-lensing analysis of the z=1.4 galaxy cluster xmmuj2235.3-2557, based on deep advanced camera for surveys images. despite theobservational challenge set by the high redshift of the lens, we detect asubstantial lensing signal at the &gt;~ 8 sigma level. this clear detection isenabled in part by the high mass of the cluster, which is verified by our bothparametric and non-parametric estimation of the cluster mass. assuming that thecluster follows a navarro-frenk-white mass profile, we estimate that theprojected mass of the cluster within r=1 mpc is (8.5+-1.7) x 10^14 solar mass,where the error bar includes the statistical uncertainty of the shear profile,the effect of possible interloping background structures, the scatter inconcentration parameter, and the error in our estimation of the mean redshiftof the background galaxies. the high x-ray temperature 8.6_{-1.2}^{+1.3} kev ofthe cluster recently measured with chandra is consistent with this high lensingmass. when we adopt the 1-sigma lower limit as a mass threshold and use thecosmological parameters favored by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe5-year (wmap5) result, the expected number of similarly massive clusters at z&gt;~ 1.4 in the 11 square degree survey is n ~ 0.005. therefore, the discovery ofthe cluster within the survey volume is a rare event with a probability &lt; 1%,and may open new scenarios in our current understanding of cluster formationwithin the standard cosmological model.

0908.4176	near-ir search for lensed supernovae behind galaxy clusters: i.  observations and transient detection efficiency	massive galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift can magnify the flux ofdistant background sources by several magnitudes and we exploit this effect tosearch for lensed distant supernovae that may otherwise be too faint to bedetected. a supernova search was conducted at near infrared wavelengths usingthe isaac instrument at the vlt. the galaxy clusters abell 1689, abell 1835 andac114 were observed at multiple epochs of 2 hours of exposure time, separatedby a month. image-subtraction techniques were used to search for transientobjects with light curve properties consistent with supernovae, both in our newand archival isaac/vlt data. the limiting magnitude of the individual epochswas estimated by adding artificial stars to the subtracted images. most of theepochs reach 90% detection efficiency at sz(j) ~= 23.8-24.0 mag (vega). twotransient objects, both in archival images of abell 1689 and ac114, weredetected. the transient in ac114 coincides - within the position uncertainty -with an x-ray source and is likely to be a variable agn at the clusterredshift. the transient in abell 1689 was found at sz=23.24 mag, ~0.5 arcsecaway from a galaxy with photometric redshift z=0.6 +/-0.15. the light curvesand the colors of the transient are consistent with a reddened type iipsupernova at redshift z=0.59 +/- 0.05. the lensing model of abell 1689 predicts~1.4 mag of magnification at the position of the transient, making it the mostmagnified supernova ever found and only the second supernova found behind agalaxy cluster. our pilot survey has demonstrated the feasibility to finddistant gravitationally magnified supernovae behind massive galaxy clusters.one likely supernova was found behind abell 1689, in accordance with theexpectations for this survey, as shown in an accompanying analysis paper.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1106.4008	constraining type ia supernovae progenitors from three years of snls  data	while it is generally accepted that type ia supernovae are the result of theexplosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting mass in a binary system, thedetails of their genesis still elude us, and the nature of the binary companionis uncertain. kasen (2010) points out that the presence of a non-degeneratecompanion in the progenitor system could leave an observable trace: a fluxexcess in the early rise portion of the lightcurve caused by the ejecta impactwith the companion itself. this excess would be observable only under favorableviewing angles, and its intensity depends on the nature of the companion. wesearched for the signature of a non-degenerate companion in three years ofsupernova legacy survey data by generating synthetic lightcurves accounting forthe effects of shocking and comparing true and synthetic time series withkolmogorov-smirnov tests. our most constraining result comes from noting thatthe shocking effect is more prominent in rest-frame b than v band: we rule outa contribution from white dwarf-red giant binary systems to type ia supernovaexplosions greater than 10% at 2 sigma, and than 20% at 3 sigma level.

1110.6442	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: vi. the volumetric  type ia supernova rate	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate outto z ~ 1.6 from the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey. inobservations spanning 189 orbits with the advanced camera for surveys wediscovered 29 sne, of which approximately 20 are sne ia. twelve of these sne iaare located in the foregrounds and backgrounds of the clusters targeted in thesurvey. using these new data, we derive the volumetric sn ia rate in four broadredshift bins, finding results consistent with previous measurements at z &gt; 1and strengthening the case for a sn ia rate that is equal to or greater than~0.6 x 10^-4/yr/mpc^3 at z ~ 1 and flattening out at higher redshift. weprovide sn candidates and efficiency calculations in a form that makes it easyto rebin and combine these results with other measurements for increasedstatistics. finally, we compare the assumptions about host-galaxy dustextinction used in different high-redshift rate measurements, finding thatdifferent assumptions may induce significant systematic differences betweenmeasurements.

0710.3120	a new determination of the high redshift type ia supernova rates with  the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys	we present a new measurement of the volumetric rate of type ia supernova upto a redshift of 1.7, using the hubble space telescope (hst) goods datacombined with an additional hst dataset covering the north goods fieldcollected in 2004. we employ a novel technique that does not requirespectroscopic data for identifying type ia supernovae (although spectroscopicmeasurements of redshifts are used for over half the sample); instead we employa bayesian approach using only photometric data to calculate the probabilitythat an object is a type ia supernova. this bayesian technique can easily bemodified to incorporate improved priors on supernova properties, and it iswell-suited for future high-statistics supernovae searches in whichspectroscopic follow up of all candidates will be impractical. here, the methodis validated on both ground- and space-based supernova data having somespectroscopic follow up. we combine our volumetric rate measurements with lowredshift supernova data, and fit to a number of possible models for theevolution of the type ia supernova rate as a function of redshift. the data donot distinguish between a flat rate at redshift &gt; 0.5 and a previously proposedmodel, in which the type ia rate peaks at redshift &gt;1 due to a significantdelay from star-formation to the supernova explosion. except for the highestredshifts, where the signal to noise ratio is generally too low to apply thistechnique, this approach yields smaller or comparable uncertainties thanprevious work.

1201.3989	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: iii. correlated  properties of type ia supernovae and their hosts at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.46	using the sample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the hubblespace telescope (hst) cluster supernova survey and augmented with hst-observedsne ia in the goods fields, we search for correlations between the propertiesof sne and their host galaxies at high redshift. we use galaxy color andquantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters anddevelop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies fromstar-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. with this approach, weidentify six sn ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven sn iahosts that are early-type field galaxies. we confirm for the first time atz&gt;0.9 that sne ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quicklythan sne ia hosted by late-type galaxies. we also show that the two samples ofhosts produce sne ia with similar color distributions. the relatively simplespectral energy distributions (seds) expected for passive galaxies enable us tomeasure stellar masses of early-type sn hosts. in combination with stellar massestimates of late-type goods sn hosts from thomson &amp; chary (2011), weinvestigate the correlation of host mass with hubble residual observed at lowerredshifts. although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hintof this relation is found at z&gt;0.9. by simultaneously fitting the averagecluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,we show that the reddening of early-type cluster sn hosts is likely e(b-v) &lt;~0.06. the similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggeststhat field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also beminimally affected by dust. hence, the early-type hosted sne ia studied hereoccupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshiftstandard candles than other sne ia.

1205.1306	an efficient approach to obtaining large numbers of distant supernova  host galaxy redshifts	we use the wide-field capabilities of the 2df fibre positioner and theaaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope (aat) to obtainredshifts of galaxies that hosted supernovae during the first three years ofthe supernova legacy survey (snls). with exposure times ranging from 10 to 60ksec per galaxy, we were able to obtain redshifts for 400 host galaxies in twosnls fields, thereby substantially increasing the total number of snlssupernovae with host galaxy redshifts. the median redshift of the galaxies inour sample that hosted photometrically classified type ia supernovae (sne ia)is 0.77, which is 25% higher than the median redshift of spectroscopicallyconfirmed sne ia in the three-year sample of the snls. our results demonstratethat one can use wide-field fibre-fed multi-object spectrographs on 4mtelescopes to efficiently obtain redshifts for large numbers of supernova hostgalaxies over the large areas of sky that will be covered by futurehigh-redshift supernova surveys, such as the dark energy survey.

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1208.5143	evidence for significant growth in the stellar mass of brightest cluster  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	using new and published data, we construct a sample of 160 brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) spanning the redshift interval 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 1.63. we use thissample, which covers 70% of the history of the universe, to measure the growthin the stellar mass of bcgs after correcting for the correlation between thestellar mass of the bcg and the mass of the cluster in which it lives. we findthat the stellar mass of bcgs increase by a factor of 1.8 between z=0.9 andz=0.2. compared to earlier works, our result is closer to the predictions ofsemi-analytic models. however, bcgs at z=0.9, relative to bcgs at z=0.2, arestill a factor of 1.5 more massive than the predictions of these models. starformation rates in bcgs at z~1 are generally to low to result in significantamounts of mass. instead, it is likely that most of the mass build up occursthrough mainly dry mergers in which perhaps half of the mass is lost to theintra-cluster medium of the cluster.

(2009) classification scheme, andon the border between normal and "high-velocity" sne ia in the wang et al.(2009a) system. though it is a clear member of the "low velocity gradient"(lvg; benetii et al., 2005) group of sne ia and exhibits a very slowlight-curve decline, it shows key dissimilarities with the overluminous sn1991t or sn 1999aa subclasses of sne ia. sn 2012fr represents a well-observedsn ia at the luminous end of the normal sn ia distribution, and a keytransitional event between nominal spectroscopic subclasses of sne ia.

1305.0882	the importance of major mergers in the build up of stellar mass in  brightest cluster galaxies at z=1	recent independent results from numerical simulations and observations haveshown that brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) have increased their stellar massby a factor of almost two between z~0.9 and z~0.2. the numerical simulationsfurther suggest that more than half this mass is accreted through majormergers. using a sample of 18 distant galaxy clusters with over 600spectroscopically confirmed cluster members between them, we search forobservational evidence that major mergers do play a significant role. we find amajor merger rate of 0.38 +/- 0.14 mergers per gyr at z~1. while theuncertainties, which stem from the small size of our sample, are relativelylarge, our rate is consistent with the results that are derived from numericalsimulations. if we assume that this rate continues to the present day and thathalf of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the bcg during thesemergers, then we find that this rate can explain the growth in the stellar massof the bcgs that is observed and predicted by simulations. major mergerstherefore appear to be playing an important role, perhaps even the dominantone, in the build up of stellar mass in these extraordinary galaxies.

1307.0003	larger sizes of massive quiescent early-type galaxies in clusters than  in the field at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.5	[abridged] the mass-size relation of early-type galaxies (etgs) has beenlargely studied in the last years to probe the mass assembly of the mostmassive objects in the universe. in this paper, we focus on the mass-sizerelation of quiescent massive etgs (mstar/msol &gt; 3*10^10) living in massiveclusters (m200 ~ 10^14 mstar) at 0.8&lt; z &lt;1.5, as compared to those living inthe field at the same epoch. our sample contains ~ 400 etgs in clusters and thesame number in the field. therefore, our sample is approximately an order ofmagnitude larger than previous studies in the same redshift range for galaxyclusters. we find that etgs living in clusters are between ~30-50% larger thangalaxies with the same stellar mass residing in the field. we parametrize thesize using the mass-normalized size, gamma=re/mstar^0.57. the gammadistributions in both environments peak at the same position but thedistributions in clusters are more skewed towards larger sizes. since this sizedifference is not observed in the local universe, the size evolution at fixedstellar mass from z~1.5 of cluster galaxies is less steep ((1+z)-0.53pm0.04)than the evolution of field galaxies ((1+z)-0.92pm0.04).  the size difference seems to be essentially driven by the galaxies residingin the clusters cores (r&lt;0.5*r200). if part of the size evolution is due tomergers, the difference we see between cluster and field galaxies could be dueto higher merger rates in clusters at higher redshift, probably during theformation phase of the clusters when velocity dispersions are lower. we cannotexclude however that the difference is driven by newly quenched galaxies whichare quenched more efficiently in clusters. the implications of these resultsfor the hierarchical growth of etgs will be discussed in a companion paper.

1310.0470	two superluminous supernovae from the early universe discovered by the  supernova legacy survey	we present spectra and lightcurves of snls 06d4eu and snls 07d2bv, twohydrogen-free superluminous supernovae discovered by the supernova legacysurvey. at z = 1.588, snls 06d4eu is the highest redshift superluminous sn witha spectrum, at m_u = -22.7 is one of the most luminous sne ever observed, andgives a rare glimpse into the restframe ultraviolet where these supernovae putout their peak energy. snls 07d2bv does not have a host galaxy redshift, butbased on the supernova spectrum, we estimate it to be at z ~ 1.5. bothsupernovae have similar observer-frame griz lightcurves, which map to restframelightcurves in the u-band and uv, rising in ~ 20 restframe days or longer, anddeclining over a similar timescale. the lightcurves peak in the shortestwavelengths first, consistent with an expanding blackbody starting near 15,000k and steadily declining in temperature. we compare the spectra to theoreticalmodels, and identify lines of c ii, c iii, fe iii, and mg ii in the spectrum ofsnls 06d4eu and scp 06f6, and find that they are consistent with an expandingexplosion of only a few solar masses of carbon, oxygen, and other trace metals.thus the progenitors appear to be related to those suspected for sne ic. a highkinetic energy, 10^52 ergs, is also favored. normal mechanisms of poweringcore- collapse or thermonuclear supernovae do not seem to work for thesesupernovae. we consider models powered by 56ni decay and interaction withcircumstellar material, but find that the creation and spin-down of a magnetarwith a period of 2ms, magnetic field of 2 x 10^14 gauss, and a 3 solar massprogenitor provides the best fit to the data.

1311.6344	the host galaxies of type ia supernovae discovered by the palomar  transient factory	we present spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies of 82 low-redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the palomar transient factory (ptf).we determine star-formation rates, gas-phase/stellar metallicities, and stellarmasses and ages of these objects. as expected, strong correlations between thesn ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found:fainter, faster-declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-richgalaxies. there is some evidence that redder sne ia explode in highermetallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the sn colour and hostgalaxy extinction based on the balmer decrement, suggesting that the colourvariation of these sne does not primarily arise from this source. sne ia inhigher-mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colourcorrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the strongercorrelation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the moreimportant variable. we also compared the host stellar mass distribution to thatin galaxy targeted sn surveys and the high-redshift untargeted supernova legacysurvey (snls). snls has many more low mass galaxies, while the targetedsearches have fewer. this can be explained by an evolution in the galaxystellar mass function, coupled with a sn delay-time distribution proportionalto $t^{-1}$. finally, we found no significant difference in themass--metallicity relation of our sn ia hosts compared to field galaxies,suggesting any metallicity effect on the sn ia rate is small.

1312.2576	lensed type ia supernovae as probes of cluster mass models	using three magnified type ia supernovae (sne ia) detected behind clashclusters, we perform a first pilot study to see whether standardizable candlescan be used to calibrate cluster mass maps created from strong lensingobservations. such calibrations will be crucial when next generation hstcluster surveys (e.g. frontier) provide magnification maps that will, in turn,form the basis for the exploration of the high redshift universe. we classifysne using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations, finding two ofthe three to be clearly of type sn ia and the third probable. the sne exhibitsignificant amplification, up to a factor of 1.7 at $\sim5\sigma$ significance(sn-l2). we conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine tuning of parameters,finding a mean amplification difference between sne and the cluster lensingmodels of $0.09 \pm 0.09^{stat} \pm 0.05^{sys}$ mag. this impressive agreementsuggests no tension between cluster mass models and high redshift standardizedsne ia. however, the measured statistical dispersion of $\sigma_{\mu}=0.21$ magappeared large compared to the dispersion expected based on statisticaluncertainties ($0.14$). further work with the supernova and cluster lensingmodels, post unblinding, reduced the measured dispersion to$\sigma_{\mu}=0.12$. an explicit choice should thus be made as to whether sneare used unblinded to improve the model, or blinded to test the model. as thelensed sn samples grow larger, this technique will allow improved constraintson assumptions regarding e.g. the structure of the dark matter halo.

1402.4139	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): testing galaxy formation models through  the most massive galaxies in the universe	we have analysed the growth of brightest group galaxies and brightest clustergalaxies (bggs/bcgs) over the last 3 billion years using a large sample of 883galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly survey. by comparing the stellarmass of bggs and bcgs in groups and clusters of similar dynamical masses, wefind no significant growth between redshift $z=0.27$ and $z=0.09$. we alsoexamine the number of bggs/bcgs that have line emission, finding thatapproximately 65 per cent of bggs/bcgs show h$\alpha$ in emission. from thegalaxies where the necessary spectroscopic lines were accurately recovered (54per cent of the sample), we find that half of this (i.e. 27 per cent of thesample) harbour on-going star formation with rates up to$10\,$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and the other half (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample)have an active nucleus (agn) at the centre. bggs are more likely to haveongoing star formation, while bcgs show a higher fraction of agn activity. byexamining the position of the bggs/bcgs with respect to their host dark matterhalo we find that around 13 per cent of them do not lie at the centre of thedark matter halo. this could be an indicator of recent cluster-cluster mergers.we conclude that bggs and bcgs acquired their stellar mass rapidly at higherredshifts as predicted by semi-analytic models, mildly slowing down at lowredshifts.

1407.3801	combining dark energy survey science verification data with near  infrared data from the eso vista hemisphere survey	we present the combination of optical data from the science verificationphase of the dark energy survey (des) with near infrared data from the esovista hemisphere survey (vhs). the deep optical detections from des are used toextract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower vhs data. joint 7-band($grizyjk$) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg decamfield centred at 02h26m$-$04d36m where the availability of ancillarymulti-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the dataquality. dual photometry increases the number of des galaxies with measured vhsfluxes by a factor of $\sim$4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matchingand results in a $\sim$1.5 mag increase in the 80\% completeness limit of thenir data. almost 70\% of des sources have useful nir flux measurements in thisinitial catalogue. photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxieswith spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited bysmall number statistics, indicate that the vhs data can help reduce thephotometric redshift scatter at both $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1$. we present exampledes+vhs colour selection criteria for high redshift luminous red galaxies(lrgs) at $z\sim0.7$ as well as luminous quasars. using spectroscopicobservations in this field we show that the additional vhs fluxes enable acleaner selection of both populations with $&lt;$10\% contamination from galacticstars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and $&lt;0.5\%$contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmedlrgs. the combined des+vhs dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited fortarget selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

1501.07232	des13s2cmm: the first superluminous supernova from the dark energy  survey	we present des13s2cmm, the first spectroscopically-confirmed superluminoussupernova (slsn) from the dark energy survey (des). we briefly discuss the dataand search algorithm used to find this event in the first year of desoperations, and outline the spectroscopic data obtained from the europeansouthern observatory (eso) very large telescope to confirm its redshift (z =0.663 +/- 0.001 based on the host-galaxy emission lines) and likely spectraltype (type i). using this redshift, we find m_u_peak = -21.05 +0.10 -0.09 forthe peak, rest-frame u-band absolute magnitude, and find des13s2cmm to belocated in a faint, low metallicity (sub-solar), low stellar-mass host galaxy(log(m/m_sun) = 9.3 +/- 0.3); consistent with what is seen for other slsne-i.we compare the bolometric light curve of des13s2cmm to fourteen similarlywell-observed slsne-i in the literature and find it possesses one of theslowest declining tails (beyond +30 days rest frame past peak), and is thefaintest at peak. moreover, we find the bolometric light curves of all slsne-istudied herein possess a dispersion of only 0.2-0.3 magnitudes between +25 and+30 days after peak (rest frame) depending on redshift range studied; thiscould be important for 'standardising' such supernovae, as is done with themore common type ia. we fit the bolometric light curve of des13s2cmm with twocompeting models for slsne-i - the radioactive decay of 56ni, and a magnetar -and find that while the magnetar is formally a better fit, neither modelprovides a compelling match to the data. although we are unable to conclusivelydifferentiate between these two physical models for this particular slsn-i,further des observations of more slsne-i should break this degeneracy,especially if the light curves of slsne-i can be observed beyond 100 days inthe rest frame of the supernova.

1502.01026	a calibration of nicmos camera 2 for low count-rates	nicmos 2 observations are crucial for constraining distances to most of theexisting sample of z &gt; 1 sne ia. unlike the conventional calibration programs,these observations involve long exposure times and low count rates. reciprocityfailure is known to exist in hgcdte devices and a correction for this effecthas already been implemented for high and medium count-rates. howeverobservations at faint count-rates rely on extrapolations. here instead, weprovide a new zeropoint calibration directly applicable to faint sources. thisis obtained via inter-calibration of nic2 f110w/f160w with wfc3 in the lowcount-rate regime using z ~ 1 elliptical galaxies as tertiary calibrators.these objects have relatively simple near-ir seds, uniform colors, and theirextended nature gives superior signal-to-noise at the same count rate thanwould stars. the use of extended objects also allows greater tolerances on psfprofiles. we find st magnitude zeropoints (after the installation of the nicmoscooling system, ncs) of 25.296 +- 0.022 for f110w and 25.803 +- 0.023 forf160w, both in agreement with the calibration extrapolated from count-rates1,000 times larger (25.262 and 25.799). before the installation of the ncs, wefind 24.843 +- 0.025 for f110w and 25.498 +- 0.021 for f160w, also in agreementwith the high-count-rate calibration (24.815 and 25.470). we also check thestandard bandpasses of wfc3 and nicmos 2 using a range of stars and galaxies atdifferent colors and find mild tension for wfc3, limiting the accuracy of thezeropoints. to avoid human bias, our cross-calibration was "blinded" in thatthe fitted zeropoint differences were hidden until the analysis was finalized.

1504.03031	simulations of the ozdes agn reverberation mapping project	as part of the ozdes spectroscopic survey we are carrying out a large scalereverberation mapping study of $\sim$500 quasars over five years in the 30deg$^2$ area of the dark energy survey (des) supernova fields. these quasarshave redshifts ranging up to 4 and have apparent ab magnitudes between$16.8&lt;r&lt;22.5$ mag. the aim of the survey is to measure time lags betweenfluctuations in the quasar continuum and broad emission line fluxes ofindividual objects in order to measure black hole masses for a broad range ofagn and constrain the radius-luminosity ($r-l$) relationship. here weinvestigate the expected efficiency of the ozdes reverberation mapping campaignand its possible extensions. we expect to recover lags for $\sim$35-45\% of thequasars. agn with shorter lags and greater variability are more likely to yielda lag, and objects with lags $\lesssim$6 months or $\sim$1 year are expected berecovered the most accurately. the baseline ozdes reverberation mappingcampaign is predicted to produce an unbiased measurement of the $r-l$relationship parameters for h$\beta$, mg ii $\lambda$2798, and c iv$\lambda$1549. however, extending the baseline survey by either increasing thespectroscopic cadence, extending the survey season, or improving the emissionline flux measurement accuracy will significantly improve the $r-l$ parameterconstraints for all broad emission lines.

0805.2381	a twelve-image gravitational lens system in the z ~ 0.84 cluster cl  j0152.7-1357	gravitational lens modeling is presented for the first discovered example ofa three-component source for which each component is quadruply imaged. the lensis a massive galaxy member of the cluster cl j0152.7-1357 at z ~ 0.84. takingadvantage of this exceptional configuration and of the excellent angularresolution of the hst/acs, we measure the properties of the lens. severalparametric macroscopic models were developed for the lens galaxy, starting frompointlike to extended image models. for a lens model in terms of a singularisothermal sphere with external shear, the einstein radius is found to be r_{e}= (9.54 +/- 0.15) kpc. the external shear points to the cluster's northern masspeak. the unknown redshift of the source is determined to be higher than 1.9and lower than 2.9. our estimate of the lensing projected total mass inside theeinstein radius, m_{len}(r &lt; 9.54 kpc), depends on the source distance and liesbetween 4.6 and 6.2 x 10^{11} m_{sun}. this result turns out to be compatiblewith the dynamical estimate based on an isothermal model. by considering theconstraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio that comes from the evolution ofthe fundamental plane, we can exclude the possibility that at more than 4 sigmalevel the total mass enclosed inside the einstein ring is only luminous matter.moreover, the photometric-stellar mass measurement within the einstein radiusgives a minimum value of 50% (1 sigma) for the dark-to-total matter fraction.the lensing analysis has allowed us to investigate the distribution of mass ofthe deflector, also providing some interesting indications on scales that arelarger and smaller than the einstein radius of the lens galaxy. the combinationof different diagnostics has proved to be essential in determining quantitiesthat otherwise would have not been directly measurable with the current data.

1507.05460	redmagic: selecting luminous red galaxies from the des science  verification data	we introduce redmagic, an automated algorithm for selecting luminous redgalaxies (lrgs). the algorithm was specifically developed to minimizephotometric redshift uncertainties in photometric large-scale structurestudies. redmagic achieves this by self-training the color-cuts necessary toproduce a luminosity-thresholded lrg sample of constant comoving density. wedemonstrate that redmagic photozs are very nearly as accurate as the bestmachine-learning based methods, yet they require minimal spectroscopictraining, do not suffer from extrapolation biases, and are very nearlygaussian. we apply our algorithm to dark energy survey (des) scienceverification (sv) data to produce a redmagic catalog sampling the redshiftrange $z\in[0.2,0.8]$. our fiducial sample has a comoving space density of$10^{-3}\ (h^{-1} mpc)^{-3}$, and a median photoz bias ($z_{spec}-z_{photo}$)and scatter $(\sigma_z/(1+z))$ of 0.005 and 0.017 respectively. thecorresponding $5\sigma$ outlier fraction is 1.4%. we also test our algorithmwith sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 8 (dr8) and stripe 82 data,and discuss how spectroscopic training can be used to control photoz biases atthe 0.1% level.

1507.05909	redshift distributions of galaxies in the des science verification shear  catalogue and implications for weak lensing	we present photometric redshift estimates for galaxies used in the weaklensing analysis of the dark energy survey science verification (des sv) data.four model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- annz2,bpz calibrated against bcc-ufig simulations, skynet, and tpz -- are analysed.for training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct acatalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against des sv data.the performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopiccatalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, withadditional validation against cosmos photo-zs. from the galaxies in the des svshear catalogue, which have mean redshift $0.72\pm0.01$ over the range$0.3&lt;z&lt;1.3$, we construct three tomographic bins with means of $z=\{0.45, 0.67,1.00\}$. these bins each have systematic uncertainties $\delta z \lesssim 0.05$in the mean of the fiducial skynet photo-z $n(z)$. we propagate the errors inthe redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parametersestimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of$\sigma_8$ of approx. 3%. this shift is within the one sigma statistical errorson $\sigma_8$ for the des sv shear catalog. we further study the potentialimpact of systematic differences on the critical surface density,$\sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}$, finding levels of bias safely less than thestatistical power of des sv data. we recommend a final gaussian prior for thephoto-z bias in the mean of $n(z)$ of width $0.05$ for each of the threetomographic bins, and show that this is a sufficient bias model for thecorresponding cosmology analysis.

1512.03903	the xxl survey x: k-band luminosity - weak-lensing mass relation for  groups and clusters of galaxies	we present the k-band luminosity-halo mass relation, $l_{k,500}-m_{500,wl}$,for a subsample of 20 of the 100 brightest clusters in the xxl survey observedwith wircam at the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). for the first time,we have measured this relation via weak-lensing analysis down to $m_{500,wl}=3.5 \times 10^{13}\,m_\odot$. this allows us to investigate whether the slopeof the $l_k-m$ relation is different for groups and clusters, as seen in otherworks. the clusters in our sample span a wide range in mass, $m_{500,wl}=0.35-12.10 \times 10^{14}\,m_\odot$, at $0&lt;z&lt;0.6$. the k-band luminosityscales as $\log_{10}(l_{k,500}/10^{12}l_\odot) \propto \betalog_{10}(m_{500,wl}/10^{14}m_\odot)$ with $\beta = 0.85^{+0.35}_{-0.27}$ and anintrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{lnl_k|m} =0.37^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. combining oursample with some clusters in the local cluster substructure survey (locuss)present in the literature, we obtain a slope of $1.05^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ and anintrinsic scatter of $0.14^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. the flattening in the $l_k-m$ seenin previous works is not seen here and might be a result of a bias in the massmeasurement due to assumptions on the dynamical state of the systems. we alsostudy the richness-mass relation and find that group-sized halos have moregalaxies per unit halo mass than massive clusters. however, the brightestcluster galaxy (bcg) in low-mass systems contributes a greater fraction to thetotal cluster light than bcgs do in massive clusters; the luminosity gapbetween the two brightest galaxies is more prominent for group-sized halos.this result is a natural outcome of the hierarchical growth of structures,where massive galaxies form and gain mass within low-mass groups and areultimately accreted into more massive clusters to become either part of the bcgor one of the brighter galaxies.

astro-ph;0006168	exploring the gravitationally lensed system he 1104-1805: near-ir  spectroscopy	(abridged) a new technique for the spatial deconvolution of spectra isapplied to near-ir (0.95 - 2.50 micron) ntt/sofi spectra of the lensed,radio-quiet quasar he 1104-1805. the continuum of the lensing galaxy isrevealed between 1.5 and 2.5 micron. it is used in combination with previousoptical and ir photometry to infer a plausible redshift in the range 0.8 &lt; z &lt;1.2. modeling of the system shows that the lens is probably composed of the redgalaxy seen between the quasar images and a more extended component associatedwith a galaxy cluster with fairly low velocity dispersion (~ 575 km/s). thespectra of the two lensed images of the source show no trace of reddening atthe redshift of the lens nor at the redshift of the source. additionally, thedifference between the spectrum of the brightest component a nd that of ascaled version of the faintest component is a featureless continuum. broad andnarrow emission lines, including the feii features, are perfectly subtracted.the very good quality of our spectrum makes it possible to fit precisely theoptical fe ii feature, taking into account the underlying continuum over a widewavelength range. he 1104-1805 can be classified as a weak fe ii emitter.finally, the slope of the continuum in the brightest image is steeper than thecontinuum in the faintest image and supports the finding by wisotzki et al.(1993) that the brightest image is microlensed. this is particularlyinteresting in view of the new source reconstruction methods frommultiwavelength photometric monitoring.

astro-ph;0210547	physical properties of two low-luminosity z ~ 1.9 galaxies behind the  lensing cluster ac 114	we present vlt/isaac near-infrared spectroscopy of two gravitationally-lensedz ~ 1.9 galaxies, a2 and s2, located behind the cluster ac 114. thanks to largemagnification factors, we have been successful in detecting rest-frame opticalemission lines in star-forming galaxies 1 to 2 magnitudes fainter than inprevious studies of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3. from the haluminosity, we estimate star formation rates (sfrs) which are 7 to 15 timeshigher than those inferred from the uv continuum flux at 1500 ang without dustextinction correction. the behavior of s2 and a2 in terms of o/h and n/oabundance ratios are very different, and they are also different from typicallbgs at z ~ 3. s2 is a low-metallicity object (z ~ 0.03 zsun) with a low n/oratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-poor nearby hii galaxies. incontrast, a2 is a high-metallicity galaxy (z ~ 1.3 zsun) with a high n/oabundance ratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-rich starburstnucleus galaxies. the virial masses, derived from emission-line widths, are 0.5and 2.4 x 10^10 msun, for s2 and a2 respectively. thanks to the gravitationalamplification, the line profiles of s2 are spatially resolved, leading to avelocity gradient of +- 240 km/s, which yields a dynamical mass of ~ 1.3 x10^10 msun within the inner 1 kpc radius. combining these new data with thesample of lbgs at z ~ 3, we conclude that these three galaxies exhibitdifferent physical properties in terms of sfrs, abundance and mass-to-lightratios, and reddening. high-redshift galaxies of different luminosities couldthus have quite different star formation histories (abridged version).

astro-ph;0211444	the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae as a function of host galaxy  morphology	(abridged) we present new results on the hubble diagram of distant type iasupernovae (sne ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. this makesit possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitlycomparing sne residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with thelarger sample. the cosmological parameters derived from these sne ia hosted bypresumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for acosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and theinternal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (a_b&lt;0.2).thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely tosystematically dim distant sne ia in a manner that would produce a spuriouscosmological constant. we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant snediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) using the combination ofhst stis imaging, keck esi spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.we compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 sne ia. the scatter observed in thesne ia hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. we findthe scatter in the sne ia hubble diagram is smallest for sne occurring inearly-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.moreover, sne residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 magbrighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those inlate-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in thelate-type systems.

0808.2824	hawk-i imaging of the x-ray luminous galaxy cluster xmmu j2235.3-2557:  the red sequence at z=1.39	we use hawk-i, the recently-commissioned near-ir imager on yepun (vlt-ut4),to obtain wide-field, high-resolution images of the x-ray luminous galaxycluster xmmu j2235.3-2557 in the j and ks bands, and we use these images tobuild a colour-magnitude diagram of cluster galaxies. galaxies in the core ofthe cluster form a tight red sequence with a mean j-ks colour of 1.9 (vegasystem). the intrinsic scatter in the colour of galaxies that lie on the redsequence is similar to that measured for galaxies on the red sequence of thecoma cluster. the slope and location of the red sequence can be modelled bypassively evolving the red sequence of the coma cluster backwards in time.using simple stellar population (ssp) models, we find that galaxies in the coreof xmmu j2235.3-2557 are, even at z=1.39, already 3 gyr old, corresponding to aformation redshift of z ~ 4. outside the core, the intrinsic scatter and thefraction of galaxies actively forming stars increase substantially. using sspmodels, we find that most of these galaxies will join the red sequence within1.5 gyr. the contrast between galaxies in the cluster core and galaxies in thecluster outskirts indicates that the red sequence of xmmu j2235.3-2557 is beingbuilt from the dense cluster core outwards.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0309368	new constraints on $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from an  independent set of eleven high-redshift supernovae observed with hst	we report measurements of $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from elevensupernovae at z=0.36-0.86 with high-quality lightcurves measured using wfpc-2on the hst. this is an independent set of high-redshift supernovae thatconfirms previous supernova evidence for an accelerating universe. combinedwith earlier supernova cosmology project data, the new supernovae yield aflat-universe measurement of the mass density $\omega_m=0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$(statistical) $\pm0.04$ (identified systematics), or equivalently, acosmological constant of $\omega_\lambda=0.75^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ (statistical)$\pm0.04$ (identified systematics). when the supernova results are combinedwith independent flat-universe measurements of $\omega_m$ from cmb and galaxyredshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of$w=-1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ (statistical) $\pm0.09$ (identified systematic), if wis assumed to be constant in time. the new data offer greatly improved colormeasurements of the high-redshift supernovae, and hence improved host-galaxyextinction estimates. these extinction measurements show no anomalous negativee(b-v) at high redshift. the precision of the measurements is such that it ispossible to perform a host-galaxy extinction correction directly for individualsupernovae without any assumptions or priors on the parent e(b-v) distribution.our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that darkenergy is required with $p(\omega_\lambda&gt;0)&gt;0.99$, a result consistent withprevious and current supernova analyses which rely upon the identification of alow-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinctiondistribution.

astro-ph;0404474	ks-band luminosity function of the z=1.237 cluster of galaxies rdcs  j1252.9-2927	we derive the ks-band luminosity function (lf) of the z=1.237 massive x-rayluminous cluster of galaxies rdcs j1252.9-2927. photometric redshifts, derivedfrom deep multi-wavelength bvrizjks data, and calibrated using a large subsetof galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, are used to separate the clustergalaxy population from the foreground and background field galaxy population.this allows for a simultaneous determination of the characteristic magnitudeks* and faint end slope alpha of the lf without having to make an uncertainstatistical background subtraction. the shape of the bright end of the derivedlf is similar to that measured at similar restframe wavelengths (in the z-band)in local clusters, but the characteristic magnitude is brighter by deltamz*=-1.40(+0.49/-0.58) magnitudes, suggesting that the massive clusterellipticals that dominate the bright end of the lf were already in place atz=1.237. the derived alpha is shallower (at the 2.2 sigma level) than the valuemeasured in the z-band in clusters in the local universe, suggesting that rdcsj1252.9-2927 contains a relatively smaller fraction of low mass galaxies thanclusters in the local universe. the results presented in this paper are achallenge for semi analytical hierarchical models of galaxy formation whichpredict the characteristic magnitude to grow fainter and the faint end slope tosteepen with redshift as the massive galaxies break up into their progenitors.the observed evolution is consistent with a scenario in which clusters arecomposed of a population of massive galaxies which formed at high redshift(z&gt;&gt;1) and subsequently evolved passively, and a population of lower massgalaxies which are gradually accreted from the field, primarily at lowerredshift (z&lt;1).

(2003). cmagic takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior oftype ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages overcurrent techniques based on maximum magnitudes. among these are a reducedsensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-widthrelation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. this allows usto provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite thefact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for cmagic.we describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed toprevent experimenter bias. the data are broadly consistent with the picture ofan accelerating universe, and agree with a flat universe within 1.7\sigma,including systematics. we also compare the cmagic results directly with thoseof a maximum magnitude fit to the same sne, finding that cmagic favors moreacceleration at the 1.6\sigma level, including systematics and the correlationbetween the two measurements. a fit for w assuming a flat universe yields avalue which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2\sigma.

astro-ph;0703382	the first appearance of the red sequence of galaxies in proto-clusters  at 2&lt;~z&lt;~3	we explore the evolved galaxy population in the proto-clusters around fourhigh-z radio galaxies at 2&lt;~z&lt;~3 based on wide-field near-infrared imaging.three of the four fields are known proto-clusters as demonstrated byoverdensities of line emitting galaxies at the same redshifts as the radiogalaxies. we imaged the fields of three targets (pks1138-262, uss0943-242 andmrc0316-257) to a depth of ks~22 (5sigma) over a 4'x7' area centered on theradio galaxies with a new wide-field nir camera, moircs, on the subarutelescope. another target (uss1558-003) was observed with sofi on the ntt to adepth of ks=20.5 over a 5'x5' area. we apply colour cuts in j-ks and/or jhks inorder to exclusively search for galaxies located at high redshifts: z&gt;2. to the5sigma limiting magnitudes, we see a significant excess of nir selectedgalaxies by a factor of two to three compared to those found in the field ofgoods-south. the spatial distribution of these nir selected galaxies is notuniform and traces structures similar to those of emission line galaxies,although the samples of nir selected galaxies and emitters show little overlap.we focus on the nir colour-magnitude sequence of the evolved population andfind that the bright-end (m_{stars}&gt;10^{11}msun) of the red sequence is wellpopulated by z~2 but much less so in the z~3 proto-clusters. this may implythat the bright-end of the colour-magnitude sequence first appeared between z=3and 2, an era coinciding with the appearance of submm galaxies and the peak ofthe cosmic star formation rate. our observations show that during the sameepoch, massive galaxies are forming in high density environments by vigorousstar formation and assembly.

astro-ph;9610079	optical/near-infrared observations of gro j1744-28	we present results from a series of optical (g and r-band) and near-infrared(k'-band) observations of the region of the sky including the entire xte androsat error circles for the ``bursting pulsar'' gro j1744-28. these data weretaken with the astrophysical research consortium's 3.5-m telescope at apachepoint observatory and with the 2.2-m telescope at the european southernobservatory. we see no new object, nor any significant brightening of any knownobject, in these error circles, with the exception of an object detected in our8 february 1996 image. this object has already been proposed as a near-infraredcounterpart to gro j1744-28. while it is seen in only two of our ten 8 februaryframes, there is no evidence that this is an instrumental artifact, suggestingthe possibility of near-infrared flares from gro j1744-28, similar to thosethat have been reported from the rapid burster. the distance to the ``burstingpulsar'' must be more than 2 kpc, and we suggest that it is more than 7 kpc.

astro-ph;9712212	discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the universe and  its cosmological implications	the ultimate fate of the universe, infinite expansion or a big crunch, can bedetermined by measuring the redshifts, apparent brightnesses, and intrinsicluminosities of very distant supernovae. recent developments have providedtools that make such a program practicable: (1) studies of relatively nearbytype ia supernovae (sne ia) have shown that their intrinsic luminosities can beaccurately determined; (2) new research techniques have made it possible toschedule the discovery and follow-up observations of distant supernovae,producing well over 50 very distant (z = 0.3 -- 0.7) sne ia to date. thesedistant supernovae provide a record of changes in the expansion rate over thepast several billion years. by making precise measurements of supernovae atstill greater distances, and thus extending this expansion history back farenough in time, we can distinguish the slowing caused by the gravitationalattraction of the universe's mass density omega_m from the effect of a possiblyinflationary pressure caused by a cosmological constant lambda. we report herethe first such measurements, with our discovery of a type ia supernova (sn1997ap) at z = 0.83. measurements at the keck ii 10-m telescope make this themost distant spectroscopically confirmed supernova. over two months ofphotometry of sn 1997ap with the hubble space telescope and ground-basedtelescopes, when combined with previous measurements of nearer sne ia, suggeststhat we may live in a low mass-density universe. further supernovae atcomparable distances are currently scheduled for ground and space-basedobservations.

astro-ph;9806175	discovery of the peculiar supernova 1998bw in the error box of grb980425	the discovery of x-ray, optical and radio afterglows of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) and the measurements of the distances to some of them have establishedthat these events come from gpc distances and are the most powerful photonemitters known in the universe, with peak luminosities up to 10^52 erg/s. wehere report the discovery of an optical transient, in the bepposax wide fieldcamera error box of grb980425, which occurred within about a day of thegamma-ray burst. its optical light curve, spectrum and location in a spiral armof the galaxy eso 184-g82, at a redshift z = 0.0085, show that the transient isa very luminous type ic supernova, sn1998bw. the peculiar nature of sn1998bw isemphasized by its extraordinary radio properties which require that the radioemitter expand at relativistical speed. since sn1998bw is very different fromall previously observed afterglows of grbs, our discovery raises thepossibility that very different mechanisms may give rise to grbs, which differlittle in their gamma-ray properties.

astro-ph;9806382	a `hypernova' model for sn 1998bw associated with gamma-ray burst of 25  april 1998	the discovery of the peculiar supernova (sn) 1998bw and its possibleassociation with the gamma-ray burst (grb) 980425$^{1,2,3}$ provide new cluesto the understanding of the explosion mechanism of very massive stars and tothe origin of some classes of gamma-ray bursts. its spectra indicate thatsn~1998bw is a type ic supernova$^{3,4}$, but its peak luminosity is unusuallyhigh compared with typical type ic supernovae$^3$. here we report our findingsthat the optical spectra and the light curve of sn 1998bw can be wellreproduced by an extremely energetic explosion of a massive carbon+oxygen (c+o)star. the kinetic energy is as large as $\sim 2-5 \times 10^{52}$ ergs, morethan ten times the previously known energy of supernovae. for this reason, theexplosion may be called a `hypernova'. such a c+o star is the stripped core ofa very massive star that has lost its h and he envelopes. the extremely largeenergy, suggesting the existence of a new mechanism of massive star explosion,can cause a relativistic shock that may be linked to the gamma-ray burst.

astro-ph;9812133	measurements of omega and lambda from 42 high-redshift supernovae	we report measurements of the mass density, omega_m, andcosmological-constant energy density, omega_lambda, of the universe based onthe analysis of 42 type ia supernovae discovered by the supernova cosmologyproject. the magnitude-redshift data for these sne, at redshifts between 0.18and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of sne from the calan/tololo supernovasurvey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmologicalparameters. all sn peak magnitudes are standardized using a sn ia lightcurvewidth-luminosity relation. the measurement yields a joint probabilitydistribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by therelation 0.8 omega_m - 0.6 omega_lambda ~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region ofinterest (omega_m &lt;~ 1.5). for a flat (omega_m + omega_lambda = 1) cosmology wefind omega_m = 0.28{+0.09,-0.08} (1 sigma statistical) {+0.05,-0.04}(identified systematics). the data are strongly inconsistent with a lambda = 0flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. an open, lambda = 0cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that thecosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of p(lambda &gt;0) = 99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. the best-fit ageof the universe relative to the hubble time is t_0 = 14.9{+1.4,-1.1} (0.63/h)gyr for a flat cosmology. the size of our sample allows us to perform a varietyof statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. wefind no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution ormalmquist bias between the low-redshift calan/tololo sample and ourhigh-redshift sample. the conclusions are robust whether or not awidth-luminosity relation is used to standardize the sn peak magnitudes.

astro-ph;9903016	the phoenix survey: optical and near-infrared observations of faint  radio sources	using a deep australia telescope compact array (atca) radio survey coveringan area of ~3deg^{2} to a 4\sigma sensitivity of \ge 100 \mujy at 1.4ghz, westudy the nature of faint radio galaxies. about 50% of the detected radiosources are identified with an optical counterpart revealed by ccd photometryto m_{r}=22.5 mag. near-infrared (k-band) data are also available for aselected sample of the radio sources, while spectroscopic observations havebeen carried out for about 40% of the optically identified sample. theseprovide redshifts and information on the stellar content. emission-line ratiosimply that most of the emission line sources are star-forming galaxies, with asmall contribution (\approx 10%) from sy1/sy2 type objects. we also find asignificant number of absorption line systems, likely to be ellipticals. thesedominate at high flux densities (&gt; 1 mjy) but are also found at sub-mjy levels.using the balmer decrement we find a visual extinction a_{v}=1.0 for thestar-forming faint radio sources. this moderate reddening is consistent withthe v-r and r-k colours of the optically identified sources. for emission linegalaxies, there is a correlation between the radio power and the h\alphaluminosity, in agreement with the result of benn et al. (1993). this suggeststhat the radio emission of starburst radio galaxies is a good indicator ofstar-formation activity.

astro-ph;9904286	the x-ray, optical and infrared counterpart to grb 980703	we report on x-ray, optical and infrared follow-up observations of grb980703. we detect a previously unknown x-ray source in the grb error box;assuming a power law decline we find for its decay index alpha &lt; -0.91(3-sigma). we invoke host galaxy extinction to match the observed spectralslope with the slope expected from `fireball' models. we find no evidence for aspectral break in the infrared to x-ray spectral range on 1998 july 4.4, anddetermine a lower limit of the cooling break frequency: nu_c &gt; 1.3 x 10^{17}hz. for this epoch we obtain an extinction of a_v = 1.50 +/- 0.11. from thex-ray data we estimate the optical extinction to be a_v = 20.2 +12.3 -7.3,inconsistent with the former value. our optical spectra confirm the redshift ofz = 0.966 found by djorgovski et al. (1998). we compare the afterglow of grb980703 with that of grb 970508 and find that the fraction of the energy in themagnetic field, epsilon_b &lt; 6x10^{-5}, is much lower in the case of grb 980703,which is a consequence of the high frequency of the cooling break.

astro-ph;9908010	ir colors and sizes of faint galaxies	we present j and ks band galaxy counts down to j=24 and ks=22.5 obtained withthe new infrared imager/spectrometer, sofi, at the eso new technologytelescope. the co-addition of short, dithered, images led to a total exposuretime of 256 and 624 minutes respectively, over an area of $\sim20$ arcmin$^2$centered on the ntt deep field. the total number of sources with s/n$&gt;5$ is1569 in the j sample and 1025 in the ks-selected sample. these are the largestsamples currently available at these depths. a d$logn$/d$m$ relation with slopeof $\sim0.36$ in j and $\sim0.38$ in ks is found with no evident sign of adecline at the magnitude limit. the observed surface density of ``small''sources is much lower than ``large'' ones at bright magnitudes and rises moresteeply than the large sources to fainter magnitudes. fainter than $j\sim22.5$and ks$\sim21.5$, small sources dominate the number counts. galaxies get redderin j-k down to  j$\sim20$ and ks$\sim19$. at fainter magnitudes, the median color becomesbluer with an accompanying increase in the compactness of the galaxies. we showthat the blue, small sources which dominate the faint ir counts are notcompatible with a high redshift ($z&gt;1$) population. on the contrary, theobserved color and compactness trends, together with the absence of a turnoverat faint magnitudes and the dominance of small sources, can be naturallyexplained by an increasing contribution of sub-$l^*$ galaxies when going tofainter apparent magnitudes. such evidence strongly supports the existence of asteeply rising ($\alpha\ll-1$) faint end of the local infrared luminosityfunction of galaxies - at least for luminosities $l&lt;0.01l^*$.

0809.4407	photometry assisted spectral extraction (phase) and identification of  snls supernovae	aim: we present new extraction and identification techniques for supernova(sn) spectra developed within the supernova legacy survey (snls) collaboration.  method: the new spectral extraction method takes full advantage ofphotometric information from the canada-france-hawai telescope (cfht) discoveryand reference images by tracing the exact position of the supernova and thehost signals on the spectrogram. when present, the host spatial profile ismeasured on deep multi-band reference images and is used to model the hostcontribution to the full (supernova + host) signal. the supernova is modelledas a gaussian function of width equal to the seeing. a chi-square minimisationprovides the flux of each component in each pixel of the 2d spectrogram. for ahost-supernova separation greater than &lt;~ 1 pixel, the two components arerecovered separately and we do not use a spectral template in contrast to morestandard analyses. this new procedure permits a clean extraction of thesupernova separately from the host in about 70% of the 3rd year eso/vlt spectraof the snls. a new supernova identification method is also proposed. it usesthe salt2 spectrophotometric template to combine the photometric and spectraldata. a galaxy template is allowed for spectra for which a separate extractionof the supernova and the host was not possible.  result: these new techniques have been tested against more standardextraction and identification procedures. they permit a secure type andredshift determination in about 80% of cases. the present paper illustratestheir performances on a few sample spectra.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.

0810.4932	near-ir search for lensed supernovae behind galaxy clusters - ii. first  detection and future prospects	powerful gravitational telescopes in the form of massive galaxy clusters canbe used to enhance the light collecting power over a limited field of view byabout an order of magnitude in flux. this effect is exploited here to increasethe depth of a survey for lensed supernovae at near-ir wavelengths. a pilot snsearch program conducted with the isaac camera at vlt is presented. lensedgalaxies behind the massive clusters a1689, a1835 and ac114 were observed for atotal of 20 hours split into 2, 3 and 4 epochs respectively, separated byapproximately one month to a limiting magnitude j&lt;24 (vega). image subtractionsincluding another 20 hours worth of archival isaac/vlt data were used to searchfor transients with lightcurve properties consistent with redshiftedsupernovae, both in the new and reference data. the feasibility of findinglensed supernovae in our survey was investigated using synthetic lightcurves ofsupernovae and several models of the volumetric type ia and core-collapsesupernova rates as a function of redshift. we also estimate the number ofsupernova discoveries expected from the inferred star formation rate in theobserved galaxies. the methods consistently predict a poisson mean value forthe expected number of sne in the survey between n_sn=0.8 and 1.6 for allsupernova types, evenly distributed between core collapse and type ia sn. onetransient object was found behind a1689, 0.5" from a galaxy with photometricredshift z_gal=0.6 +- 0.15. the lightcurve and colors of the transient areconsistent with being a reddened type iip sn at z_sn=0.59. the lensing modelpredicts 1.4 magnitudes of magnification at the location of the transient,without which this object would not have been detected in the near-ir groundbased search described in this paper (unlensed magnitude j~25).
