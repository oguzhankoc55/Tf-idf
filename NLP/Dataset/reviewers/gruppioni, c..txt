0902.2517	revealing x-ray obscured quasars in swire sources with extreme  mid-ir/optical flux ratios	recent works have suggested that selection criteria based on mir colors canbe used to reveal a population of dust-enshrouded, extremely luminous quasarsat z&gt;1. however the x-ray spectral properties of these intriguing sources stillremain largely unexplored. we report on an x-ray spectroscopic study of asample of 44 very bright mid-ir galaxies with extreme mid-ir to optical fluxratios (mir/o&gt;2000). the x-ray coverage of the sample is highly inhomogeneous(from snap-shot 5 ks chandra observations to medium-deep xmm exposures of 70ks) and, consequently, a sizable fraction of them (~43%) remains undetected inthe 0.5-10 kev band. the vast majority (95%) of the detected sources (23) showan absorption column density nh&gt;10e22 cm-2 and, remarkably, we also find that50% of them can be classified as type 2 quasars on the basis of theirabsorption properties and x-ray luminosity. moreover, most of the x-rayundetected sources show extreme mid-ir colors, consistent with being luminousagn-powered objects, suggesting they might host heavily obscured (possiblycompton-thick) quasars in x-rays. this demonstrates that our selection criteriaapplied to a wide area survey is very efficient in finding a large number oftype 2 quasars at z &gt; 1. the existence of this class of very powerful, obscuredquasars at high z could have important implications in the context of theformation and cosmological evolution of accreting supermassive black holes andtheir host galaxies.

0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0902.4236	the hellas2xmm survey. xii. the infrared/sub-millimeter view of an x-ray  selected type 2 quasar at z=2	we present multi-wavelength observations (from optical to sub-millimeter,including spitzer and scuba) of h2xmmj 003357.2-120038 (also gd158_19), anx-ray selected, luminous narrow-line (type 2) quasar at z=1.957 selected fromthe hellas2xmm survey. its broad-band properties can be reasonably well modeledassuming three components: a stellar component to account for the optical andnear-ir emission, an agn component (i.e., dust heated by an accreting activenucleus), dominant in the mid-ir, with an optical depth at 9.7 micron along theline of sight (close to the equatorial plane of the obscuring matter) oftau(9.7)=1 and a full covering angle of the reprocessing matter (torus) of 140degrees, and a far-ir starburst component (i.e., dust heated by star formation)to reproduce the wide bump observed longward of 70 micron. the derivedstar-formation rate is about 1500 solar masses per year. the overall modelingindicates that gd158_19 is a high-redshift x-ray luminous, obscured quasar withcoeval powerful agn activity and intense star formation. it is probably caughtbefore the process of expelling the obscuring gas has started, thus quenchingthe star formation.

0909.2535	spectroscopic identifications of spitzer sources in the  swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field: a large fraction of active galactic nuclei  with high f(24micron)/f(r) ratio	we present a catalog of optical spectroscopic identifications of sourcesdetected by spitzer at 3.6 or 24 micron down to 10 and 280 microjy,respectively, in the swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field and classified via linewidth analysis and diagnostic diagrams. a total of 1376 sources down to r~24.2mag have been identified (1362 detected at 3.6 micron, 419 at 24 micron, and405 at both) by low-resolution optical spectroscopy carried out with fors2,vimos, and efosc2 at the very large telescope and 3.6m eso telescopes. thespectroscopic campaigns have been carried out over the central 0.6 squaredegrees area of elais-s1 which, in particular, has also been observed byxmm-newton and chandra. we find the first direct optical spectroscopic evidencethat the fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn; mostly agn2) increases withincreasing f(24 micron)/f(r) ratio, reaching values of 70(+/-20)% in the range316&lt;f(24 micron)f(r)&lt;1000. we present an irac-mips color-color diagram able toseparate agn1 from obscured agn2 candidates. after having corrected for thespectroscopic incompleteness of our sample, it results that the agn fraction atf(24 micron)=0.8 mjy is ~22(+/-7)% and decreases slowly to ~19(+/-5)% down tof(24 micron)=0.3 mjy.

0909.5044	spectroscopic cosmological surveys in the far-ir	we show the feasibility of spectroscopic cosmological surveys with the safariinstrument onboard of spica. the work is done through simulations that make useof both empirical methods, i.e. the use of observed luminosity functions andtheoretical models for galaxy formation and evolution. the relations assumedbetween the line emission to trace agn and star formation activity have beenderived from the observations of local samples of galaxies. the resultsconverge to indicate the use of blind spectroscopy with the safari fts atvarious resolutions to study galaxy evolution from the local to the distant(z~3) universe. specifically, two different and independent galaxy evolutionmodels predict about 7-10 sources to be spectroscopically detected in more thanone line in a 2'x 2'safari field of view, down to the expected flux limits ofsafari, with about 20% of sources to be detected at z&gt;2. spica-safari will betherefore excellent at detecting high-z sources and at assessing in a directway their nature (e.g whether mainly agn or star formation powered) thanks toblind spectroscopy.

0707.2342	agn counts at 15um. xmm observations of the elais-s1-5 sample	context: the counts of galaxies and agn in the mid infra-red (mir) bands areimportant instruments for studying their cosmological evolution. however, theclassic spectral line ratios techniques can become misleading when trying toproperly separate agn from starbursts or even from apparently normal galaxies.  aims: we use x-ray band observations to discriminate agn activity inpreviously classified mir-selected starburst galaxies and to derive updatedagn1 and (compton thin) agn2 counts at 15 um.  methods: xmm observations of the elais-s1 15um sample down to flux limits~2x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-10 kev band) were used. we classified as agn allthose mir sources with a unabsorbed 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity higher that~10^42 erg/s.  results: we find that at least about 13(+/-6) per cent of the previouslyclassified starburst galaxies harbor an agn. according to these figures, weprovide an updated estimate of the counts of agn1 and (compton thin) agn2 at 15um. it turns out that at least 24% of the extragalactic sources brighter than0.6 my at 15 um are agn (~13% contribution to the extragalactic backgroundproduced at fluxes brighter than 0.6 mjy).

1003.5563	the hellas2xmm survey. xiii. multi-component analysis of the spectral  energy distribution of obscured agn	we combine near-to-mid-ir spitzer data with shorter wavelength observations(optical to x-rays) to get insights on the properties of a sample of luminous,obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). we aim at modeling their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds) in order to estimate the main parametersrelated to the dusty torus. the sample comprises 16 obscured high-redshift(0.9&lt;z&lt;2.1) xray luminous quasars (l_2-10 ~ 10^44 erg s-1) selected from thehellas2xmm survey. the seds are described by a multi-component model includinga stellar component, an agn component and a starburst. the majority (~80%) ofthe sources show moderate optical depth (tau_9.7um&lt;3) and the derived columndensities n_h are consistent with the xray inferred values (10^22 &lt;n_h&lt; 3x10^23cm-2) for most of the objects, confirming that the sources are moderatelyobscured compton-thin agn. accretion luminosities in the range 5x10^44 &lt; lbol &lt;4x10^46 erg s-1 are inferred. we compare model luminosities with those obtainedby integrating the observed sed, finding that the latter are lower by a factorof ~2 in the median. the discrepancy can be as high as an order of magnitudefor models with high optical depth (tau_9.7um=10). the ratio between theluminosities obtained by the fitting procedure and from the observed sedsuggest that, at least for type~2 agn, observed bolometric luminosities arelikely to underestimate intrinsic ones and the effect is more severe for highlyobscured sources. bolometric corrections from the hard x-ray band are computedand have a median value of k_2-10kev ~ 20. the obscured agn in our sample arecharacterized by relatively low eddington ratios (median lambda_edd~0.08). onaverage, they are consistent with the eddington ratio increasing at increasingbolometric correction (e.g. vasudevan &amp; fabiam 2009).

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.1473	pep: first herschel probe of dusty galaxy evolution up to z~3	we exploit the deepest existing far-infrared (fir) data obtained so far byherschel at 100 and 160 um in the goods-n, as part of the pacs evolutionaryprobe (pep) survey, to derive for the first time the evolution of therest-frame 60-um, 90-um, and total ir luminosity functions (lfs) of galaxiesand agns from z=0 to unprecedented high redshifts (z~2-3). the pep lfs werecomputed using the 1/vmax method. the fir sources were classified by means of adetailed broad- band sed-fitting analysis and spectral characterisation. basedon the best-fit model results, k-correction and total ir (8-1000 um) luminositywere obtained for each source. lfs (monochromatic and total) were then derivedfor various ir populations separately in different redshift bins and comparedto backward evolution model predictions. we detect strong evolution in the lfto at least z~2. objects with seds similar to local spiral galaxies are themajor contributors to the star formation density (sfd) at z&lt; 0.3, then, asredshift increases, moderate sf galaxies - most likely containing alow-luminosity agn - start dominating up to z ~= 1.5. at &gt;1.5 the sfd isdominated by the contributions of starburst galaxies. in agreement withprevious findings, the comoving ir ld derived from our data evolvesapproximately as (1 + z)^(3.8+/-0.3) up to z~1, there being some evidence offlattening up to z~2.

1005.1575	herschel deep far-infrared counts through the abell 2218 cluster-lens	gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters allows study of thepopulation of intrinsically faint infrared galaxies that lie below thesensitivity and confusion limits of current infrared and submillimetertelescopes. we present ultra-deep pacs 100 and 160 microns observations towardthe cluster lens abell 2218, to penetrate the herschel confusion limit. wederive source counts down to a flux density of 1 mjy at 100 microns and 2 mjyat 160 microns, aided by strong gravitational lensing. at these levels, sourcedensities are 20 and 10 beams/source in the two bands, approaching sourcedensity confusion at 160 microns. the slope of the counts below the turnover ofthe euclidean-normalized differential curve is constrained in both bands and isconsistent with most of the recent backwards evolutionary models. byintegrating number counts over the flux range accessed by abell 2218 lensing(0.94-35 mjy at 100 microns and 1.47-35 mjy at 160 microns, we retrieve acosmic infrared background (cib) surface brightness of ~8.0 and ~9.9 nw m^-2sr^-1, in the respective bands. these values correspond to 55% (+/- 24%) and77% (+/- 31%) of dirbe direct measurements. combining abell 2218 results withwider/shallower fields, these figures increase to 62% (+/- 25%) and 88% (+/-32%) cib total fractions, resolved at 100 and 160 microns, disregarding thehigh uncertainties of dirbe absolute values.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1007.1902	unveiling far-infrared counterparts of bright submillimeter galaxies  using pacs imaging	we present a search for herschel-pacs counterparts of dust-obscured,high-redshift objects previously selected at submillimeter and millimeterwavelengths in the great observatories origins deep survey north field. wedetect 22 of 56 submillimeter galaxies (39%) with a snr of &gt;=3 at 100 microndown to 3.0 mjy, and/or at 160 micron down to 5.7 mjy. the fraction of smgsseen at 160 micron is higher than that at 100 micron. about 50% ofradio-identified smgs are associated with pacs sources. we find a trend betweenthe scuba/pacs flux ratio and redshift, suggesting that these flux ratios couldbe used as a coarse redshift indicator. pacs undetected submm/mm selectedsources tend to lie at higher redshifts than the pacs detected ones. a total of12 sources (21% of our smg sample) remain unidentified and the fact that theyare blank fields at herschel-pacs and vla 20 cm wavelength may imply higherredshifts for them than for the average smg population (e.g., z&gt;3-4). theherschel-pacs imaging of these dust-obscured starbursts at high-redshiftssuggests that their far-infrared spectral energy distributions havesignificantly different shapes than template libraries of local infraredgalaxies.

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1105.1955	modelling galaxy and agn evolution in the ir: black hole accretion  versus star-formation activity	we present a new backward evolution model for galaxies and agns in theinfrared (ir). what is new in this model is the separate study of theevolutionary properties of the different ir populations (i.e. spiral galaxies,starburst galaxies, low-luminosity agns, "unobscured" type 1 agns and"obscured" type 2 agns) defined through a detailed analysis of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of large samples of ir selected sources. theevolutionary parameters have been constrained by means of all the availableobservables from surveys in the mid- and far-ir (source counts, redshift andluminosity distributions, luminosity functions). by decomposing the sedsrepresentative of the three agn classes into three distinct components (astellar component emitting most of its power in the optical/near-ir, an agncomponent due to hot dust heated by the central black hole peaking in themid-ir, and a starburst component dominating the far-ir spectrum) we havedisentangled the agn contribution to the monochromatic and total ir luminosityemitted by the different populations considered in our model from that due tostar-formation activity. we have then obtained an estimate of the total irluminosity density (and star-formation density - sfd - produced by ir galaxies)and the first ever estimate of the black hole mass accretion density (bhar)from the ir. the derived evolution of the bhar is in agreement with estimatesfrom x-rays, though the bhar values we derive from ir are slightly higher thanthe x-ray ones. finally, we have simulated source counts, redshiftdistributions and sfd and bhar that we expect to obtain with the futurecosmological surveys in the mid-/far-ir that will be performed with jwst-miriand spica-safari.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.3194	the evolution of quiescent galaxies at high redshift (z &gt; 1.4)	we have studied the evolution of high redshift quiescent galaxies over aneffective area of ~1.7 deg^2 in the cosmos field. galaxies have been dividedaccording to their star-formation activity and the evolution of the differentpopulations has been investigated in detail. we have studied an irac (mag_3.6 &lt;22.0) selected sample of ~18000 galaxies at z &gt; 1.4 with multi-wavelengthcoverage. we have derived accurate photometric redshifts (sigma=0.06) and otherimportant physical parameters through a sed-fitting procedure. we have dividedour sample into actively star-forming, intermediate and quiescent galaxiesdepending on their specific star formation rate. we have computed the galaxystellar mass function of the total sample and the different populations atz=1.4-3.0. we have studied the properties of high redshift quiescent galaxiesfinding that they are old (1-4 gyr), massive (log(m/m_sun)~10.65), weakly starforming stellar populations with low dust extinction (e(b-v) &lt; 0.15) and smalle-folding time scales (tau ~ 0.1-0.3 gyr). we observe a significant evolutionof the quiescent stellar mass function from 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 to 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.6,increasing by ~ 1 dex in this redshift interval. we find that z ~ 1.5 is anepoch of transition of the gsmf. the fraction of star-forming galaxiesdecreases from 60% to 20% from z ~ 2.5-3.0 to z ~ 1.4-1.6 for log(m/m_sun) &gt;11, while the quiescent population increases from 10% to 50% at the sameredshift and mass intervals. we compare the fraction of quiescent galaxiesderived with that predicted by theoretical models and find that the kitzbichler&amp; white (2007) model is the one that better reproduces the data. finally, wecalculate the stellar mass density of the star-forming and quiescentpopulations finding that there is already a significant number of quiescentgalaxies at z &gt; 2.5 (rho~6.0 msunmpc^-3).

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

1301.4496	panchromatic spectral energy distributions of herschel sources	(abridged) far-infrared herschel photometry from the pep and hermes programsis combined with ancillary datasets in the goods-n, goods-s, and cosmos fields.based on this rich dataset, we reproduce the restframe uv to fir ten-colorsdistribution of galaxies using a superposition of multi-variate gaussian modes.the median sed of each mode is then fitted with a modified version of themagphys code that combines stellar light, emission from dust heated by starsand a possible warm dust contribution heated by an agn. the defined gaussiangrouping is also used to identify rare sources. the zoology of outliersincludes herschel-detected ellipticals, very blue z~1 ly-break galaxies,quiescent spirals, and torus-dominated agn with star formation. out of thesegroups and outliers, a new template library is assembled, consisting of 32 sedsdescribing the intrinsic scatter in the restframe uv-to-submm colors ofinfrared galaxies. this library is tested against l(ir) estimates with andwithout herschel data included, and compared to eight other popular methodsoften adopted in the literature. when implementing herschel photometry, theseapproaches produce l(ir) values consistent with each other within a medianabsolute deviation of 10-20%, the scatter being dominated more by fine tuningof the codes, rather than by the choice of sed templates. finally, the libraryis used to classify 24 micron detected sources in pep goods fields. agn appearto be distributed in the stellar mass (m*) vs. star formation rate (sfr) spacealong with all other galaxies, regardless of the amount of infrared luminositythey are powering, with the tendency to lie on the high sfr side of the "mainsequence". the incidence of warmer star-forming sources grows for objects withhigher specific star formation rates (ssfr), and they tend to populate the"off-sequence" region of the m*-sfr-z space.

1303.4436	the deepest herschel-pacs far-infrared survey: number counts and  infrared luminosity functions from combined pep/goods-h observations	we present results from the deepest herschel-pacs (photodetector array cameraand spectrometer) far-infrared blank field extragalactic survey, obtained bycombining observations of the goods (great observatories origins deep survey)fields from the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and goods-herschel keyprogrammes. we describe data reduction and the construction of images andcatalogues. in the deepest parts of the goods-s field, the catalogues reach3-sigma depths of 0.9, 0.6 and 1.3 mjy at 70, 100 and 160 um, respectively, andresolve ~75% of the cosmic infrared background at 100um and 160um intoindividually detected sources. we use these data to estimate the pacs confusionnoise, to derive the pacs number counts down to unprecedented depths and todetermine the infrared luminosity function of galaxies down to lir=10^11 lsunat z~1 and lir=10^12 lsun at z~2, respectively. for the infrared luminosityfunction of galaxies, our deep herschel far-infrared observations arefundamental because they provide more accurate infrared luminosity estimatesthan those previously obtained from mid-infrared observations. maps and sourcecatalogues (&gt;3-sigma) are now publicly released. combined with the large wealthof multi-wavelength data available for the goods fields, these data provide apowerful new tool for studying galaxy evolution over a broad range ofredshifts.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1308.2199	cosmological model dependence of the galaxy luminosity function:  far-infrared results in the lemaitre-tolman-bondi model	this is the first paper of a series aiming at investigating galaxy formationand evolution in the giant-void class of the lemaitre-tolman-bondi (ltb) modelsthat best fits current cosmological observations. here we investigate theluminosity function (lf) methodology, and how its estimates would be affectedby a change on the cosmological model assumed in its computation. are thecurrent observational constraints on the allowed cosmology enough to yieldrobust lf results? we use the far-infrared source catalogues built on theobservations performed with the herschel/pacs instrument, and selected as partof the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey. schechter profiles are obtained inredshift bins up to z approximately 4, assuming comoving volumes in both thestandard model, that is, friedmann-lemaitre-robertson-walker metric with aperfect fluid energy-momentum tensor, and non-homogeneous ltb dust models,parametrized to fit the current combination of results stemming from theobservations of supernovae ia, the cosmic microwave background, and baryonicacoustic oscillations. we find that the luminosity functions computed assumingboth the standard model and ltb void models show in general good agreement.however, the faint-end slope in the void models shows a significant departurefrom the standard model up to redshift 0.4. we demonstrate that this result isnot artificially caused by the used lf estimator which turns out to be robustunder the differences in matter-energy density profiles of the models. thedifferences found in the lf slopes at the faint end are due to variation in theluminosities of the sources, which depend on the geometrical part of the model.it follows that either the standard model is over-estimating the number densityof faint sources or the void models are under-estimating it.

1401.4503	tracing the cosmic growth of super massive black holes to z ~ 3 with  herschel	we study a sample of herschel-pacs selected galaxies within the goods-southand the cosmos fields in the framework of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)project. starting from the rich multi-wavelength photometric data-setsavailable in both fields, we perform a broad-band spectral energy distribution(sed) decomposition to disentangle the possible active galactic nucleus (agn)contribution from that related to the host galaxy. we find that 37 per cent ofthe herschel-selected sample shows signatures of nuclear activity at the 99 percent confidence level. the probability to reveal agn activity increases forbright ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt; 10^{11} \rm l_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at$z&gt;0.3$, becoming about 80 per cent for the brightest ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt;10^{12} \rm l_{\odot}$) infrared (ir) galaxies at $z \geq 1$. finally, wereconstruct the agn bolometric luminosity function and the super-massive blackhole growth rate across cosmic time up to $z \sim 3$ from a far-infrared (fir)perspective. this work shows general agreement with most of the panchromaticestimates from the literature, with the global black hole growth peaking at $z\sim 2$ and reproducing the observed local black hole mass density withconsistent values of the radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm rad}$($\sim$0.07).

1401.6572	relativistic cosmology number densities in void-lemaitre-tolman-bondi  models	the goal of this work is to compute the number density of far-ir selectedgalaxies in the comoving frame and along the past lightcone of observationallyconstrained ltb models and to compare those results with their standard modelcounterparts.  we derived integral number densities and differential number densities usingdifferent cosmological distance definitions in the ltb models. then, wecomputed selection functions and consistency functions for the luminosityfunctions in the combined fields of the herschel/pacs evolutionary probe (pep)survey in both standard and void cosmologies, from which we derived theobserved values of the above-mentioned densities. we used thekolmogorov-smirnov statistics to study both the evolution of the consistencyfunctions and its connection to the evolution of the comoving density ofsources. finally, we fitted the power-law behaviour of the densities along theobserver's past lightcone.  the analysis of the comoving number density shows that the increasedflexibility of the ltb models is not enough to fit the observed redshiftevolution of the number counts, if it is specialised to a recent best-fit giantvoid parametrisation. the results for the power-law fits of the densities alongthe observer's past lightcone show general agreement across both cosmologicalmodels studied here around a slope of -2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 for the integral numberdensity on the luminosity-distance volumes. the differential number densitiesshow much bigger slope discrepancies.  we conclude that the differential number densities on the observer's pastlightcone were still rendered dependent on the cosmological model by the fluxlimits of the pep survey. in addition, we show that an intrinsic evolution ofthe sources must be assumed to fit the comoving number-density redshiftevolution in the giant void parametrisation for the ltb models used in thiswork.

1406.1189	a multiwavelength consensus on the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies at z~2	we compare various star formation rate (sfr) indicators for star-forminggalaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5$ in the cosmos field. the main focus is on the sfrs fromthe far-ir (pacs-herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxiesselected according to the bzk criterion. fir-selected samples lead to a vastlydifferent slope of the sfr-stellar mass ($m_*$) relation, compared to that ofthe dominant main sequence population as measured from the uv, since the firselection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. however, there isoverall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two sfrindicators, when stacking on the pacs maps the bzk-selected galaxies. theresulting logarithmic slope of the sfr-{$m_*$} relation is $\sim0.8-0.9$, inagreement with that derived from the dust-corrected uv-luminosity. exploitingdeeper 24$\mu$m-spitzer data we have characterized a sub-sample of galaxieswith reddening and sfrs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the $b$band. the combination of herschel with spitzer data have allowed us to largelybreak the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, bydistinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in b-z because of being heavilydust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being)quenched. finally, we have compared our sfr(uv) to the sfrs derived by stackingthe radio data and to those derived from the h$\alpha$ luminosity of a sampleof star-forming galaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;1.7$. the two sets of sfrs are broadlyconsistent as they are with the sfrs derived from the uv and by stacking thecorresponding pacs data in various mass bins.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1408.3234	exploring the relationship between black hole accretion and star  formation with blind mid-/far-infrared spectroscopic surveys	we present new estimates of redshift-dependent luminosity functions of irlines detectable by spica/safari and excited both by star formation and by agnactivity. the new estimates improve over previous work by using updatedevolutionary models and dealing in a self consistent way with emission ofgalaxies as a whole, including both the starburst and the agn component. newrelationships between line and agn bolometric luminosity have been derived andthose between line and ir luminosities of the starburst component have beenupdated. these ingredients were used to work out predictions for the sourcecounts in 11 mid/far-ir emission lines partially or entirely excited by agnactivity. we find that the statistics of the emission line detection ofgalaxies as a whole is mainly determined by the star formation rate, because ofthe rarity of bright agns. we also find that the slope of the line integralnumber counts is flatter than 2 implying that the number of detections at fixedobserving time increases more by extending the survey area than by goingdeeper. we thus propose a wide spectroscopic survey of 1 hour integration perfield-of-view over an area of 5 deg$^{2}$ to detect (at 5$\sigma$) $\sim$760agns in [oiv]25.89$\mu$m $-$ the brightest agn mid-infrared line $-$ out to$z\sim2$. pointed observations of strongly lensed or hyper-luminous galaxiespreviously detected by large area surveys such as those by herschel and by thespt can provide key information on the galaxy-agn co-evolution out to higherredshifts.

1501.04634	relationship between star formation rate and black hole accretion at  z=2: the different contributions in quiescent, normal and starburst galaxies	we investigate the co-evolution of black-hole-accretion-rate (bhar) andstar-formation-rate (sfr) in $1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ galaxies displaying a greaterdiversity of star-forming properties compared to previous studies. we combinex-ray stacking and far-ir photometry of stellar mass-limited samples of normalstar-forming, starburst and quiescent/quenched galaxies in the cosmos field. wecorroborate the existence of a strong correlation between bhar (i.e. the x-rayluminosity, l_x), and stellar mass (m*) for normal star-forming galaxies,although find a steeper relation than previously reported. we find thatstarbursts show a factor of 3 enhancement in bhar compared to normal sfgalaxies (against a factor of 6 excess in sfr), while quiescents show a deficitof a factor 5.5 at a given mass. one possible interpretation of this is thatthe starburst phase does not coincide with cosmologically relevant bh growth,or that starburst-inducing mergers are more efficient at boosting sfr thanbhar. contrary to studies based on smaller samples, we find the bhar/sfr ratioof main sequence (ms) galaxies is not mass invariant, but scales weakly asm*^(0.43\pm0.09}, implying faster bh growth in more massive galaxies at$z\sim2$. furthermore, bhar/sfr during the starburst is a factor of 2 lowerthan in ms galaxies, at odds with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulationsof merger galaxies that foresee a sudden enhancement of l_x/sfr during themerger. finally, we estimate that the bulk of the accretion density of theuniverse at $z\sim2$ is associated with normal star-forming systems, with only6(+/-1)% and 11(+/-1)% associated with starburst and quiescent galaxies,respectively.

1501.07602	mapping the average agn accretion rate in the sfr-m* plane for herschel  selected galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation of agn accretion, star formation rate (sfr), andstellar mass (m$_*$) using a sample of $\approx$ 8600 star-forming galaxies upto z=2.5 selected with \textit{herschel} imaging in the goods and cosmosfields. for each of them we derive sfr and m$_*$, both corrected, whennecessary, for emission from an active galactic nucleus (agn), through thedecomposition of their spectral energy distributions (seds). about 10 per centof the sample are detected individually in \textit{chandra} observations of thefields. for the rest of the sample we stack the x-ray maps to get average x-rayproperties. after subtracting the x-ray luminosity expected from star formationand correcting for nuclear obscuration, we derive the average agn accretionrate for both detected sources and stacks, as a function of m$_{*}$, sfr andredshift. the average accretion rate correlates with sfr and with m$_*$. thedependence on sfr becomes progressively more significant at z$&gt;$0.8. this maysuggest that sfr is the original driver of these correlations. we find thataverage agn accretion and star formation increase in a similar fashion withoffset from the star-forming "main-sequence". our interpretation is thataccretion onto the central black hole and star formation broadly trace eachother, irrespective of whether the galaxy is evolving steadily on themain-sequence or bursting.

1502.03686	are z&gt;2 herschel galaxies proto-spheroids?	we present a backward approach for the interpretation of the evolution of thenear-infrared and the far-infrared luminosity functions across the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;3. in our method, late-type galaxies are treated by means of aparametric phenomenological method based on pep/hermes data up to z~4, whereasspheroids are described by means of a physically motivated backward model. thespectral evolution of spheroids is modelled by means of a single-mass model,associated to a present-day elliptical with k-band luminosity comparable to thebreak of the local early-type luminosity function. the formation ofproto-spheroids is assumed to occurr across the redshift range 1&lt; z &lt; 5. thekey parameter is represented by the redshift z_0.5 at which halfproto-spheroids are already formed. a statistical study indicates for thisparameter values between z_0.5=1.5 and z_0.5=3. we assume as fiducial valuez_0.5~2, and show that this assumption allows us to describe accourately theredshift distributions and the source counts. by assuming z_0.5 ~ 2 at thefar-ir flux limit of the pep-cosmos survey, the pep-selected sources observedat z&gt;2 can be explained as progenitors of local spheroids caught during theirformation. we also test the effects of mass downsizing by dividing thespheroids into three populations of different present-day stellar masses. theresults obtained in this case confirm the validity of our approach, i.e. thatthe bulk of proto-spheroids can be modelled by means of a single model whichdescribes the evolution of galaxies at the break of the present-day early typek-band lf.

0805.0705	the contribution of agn and star-forming galaxies to the mid-infrared as  revealed by their spectral energy distributions	we present the broad-band spectral energy distributions (seds) of the largestavailable highly (72%) complete spectroscopic sample of mid-infrared (mir)selected galaxies and agn at intermediate redshift. the sample contains 203extragalactic sources from the 15-micron survey in the elais-swire field s1,all with measured spectroscopic redshift. most of these sources have fullmulti-wavelength coverage from the far-uv to the far-infrared and lie in theredshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3. due to its size, this sample allows us for the firsttime to characterise the spectral properties of the sources responsible for thestrong evolution observed in the mir. based on sed-fitting technique we haveclassified the mir sources, identifying agn signatures in about 50% of them.this fraction is significantly higher than that derived from opticalspectroscopy (~29%) and is due in particular to the identification of agnactivity in objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies. it is likely thatin most of our objects, the agn is either obscured or of low-luminosity, andthus it does not dominate the energetic output at any wavelength, except in themir, showing up just in the range where the host galaxy sed has a minimum. thefraction of agn strongly depends on the flux density, with that derived throughthe sed-fitting being about 20% at s(15)~0.5-1 mjy and gradually increasing upto 100% at s(15)&gt;10 mjy, while that obtained from optical spectroscopy neverbeing &gt;30%, even at the higher flux densities. the results of this work will bevery useful for updating all the models aimed at interpreting the deep infraredsurvey data and, in particular, for constraining the nature and the role ofdust-obscured systems in the intermediate/high-redshift universe.

1505.01153	the most obscured agn in the cosmos field	highly obscured active galactic nuclei (agn) are common in nearby galaxies,but are difficult to observe beyond the local universe, where they are expectedto significantly contribute to the black hole accretion rate density.furthermore, compton-thick (ct) absorbers (nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) suppress even thehard x-ray (2-10 kev) agn nuclear emission, and therefore the column densitydistribution above 10^24 cm^-2 is largely unknown. we present theidentification and multi-wavelength properties of a heavily obscured (nh&gt;~10^25cm^-2), intrinsically luminous (l(2-10kev)&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn at z=0.353 inthe cosmos field. several independent indicators, such as the shape of thex-ray spectrum, the decomposition of the spectral energy distribution andx-ray/[nev] and x-ray/6{\mu}m luminosity ratios, agree on the fact that thenuclear emission must be suppressed by a 10^25 cm^-2 column density. the hostgalaxy properties show that this highly obscured agn is hosted in a massivestar-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlatewith the presence of ct absorbers. finally, asymmetric and blueshiftedcomponents in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate thepresence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense agn activity(l(bol)/l(edd) = 0.3-0.5). such highly obscured, highly accreting agn areintrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be muchmore common at the peak of the star formation and bh accretion history, atz~2-3. we demonstrate that a fully multi-wavelength approach can recover asizable sample of such peculiar sources in large and deep surveys such ascosmos.

1506.02135	predictions for surveys with the spica mid-infrared instrument	we present predictions for number counts and redshift distributions ofgalaxies detectable in continuum and in emission lines with the mid-infrared(mir) instrument (smi) proposed for the space infrared telescope for cosmologyand astrophysics (spica). we have considered 24 mir fine-structure lines, fourpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) bands (at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3$\mu$m)and two silicate bands (in emission and in absorption) at 9.7$\mu$m and18.0$\mu$m. six of these lines are primarily associated with active galacticnuclei (agns), the others with star formation. a survey with the smispectrometers of 1 hour integration per field-of-view (fov) over an area of$1\,\hbox{deg}^2$ will yield $5\,\sigma$ detections of $\simeq 140$ agn linesand of $\simeq 5.2\times10^{4}$ star-forming galaxies, $\simeq 1.6\times10^{4}$of which will be detected in at least two lines. the combination of a shallow($20.0\,\hbox{deg}^{2}$, $1.4\times10^{-1}$ h integration per fov) and a deepsurvey ($6.9\times10^{-3}\,\hbox{deg}^{2}$, $635$ h integration time), with thesmi camera, for a total of $\sim$1000 h, will accurately determine the mirnumber counts of galaxies and of agns over five orders of magnitude in fluxdensity, reaching values more than one order of magnitude fainter than thedeepest spitzer $24\,\mu$m surveys. this will allow us to determine the cosmicstar formation rate (sfr) function down to sfrs more than 100 times fainterthan reached by the herschel observatory.

1507.00005	dust attenuation in z $\sim$ 1 galaxies from herschel and 3d-hst  h$\alpha$ measurements	we combined the spectroscopic information from the 3d-hst survey with\textit{herschel} data to characterize the h$\alpha$ dust attenuationproperties of a sample of 79 main sequence star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$in the goods-s field. the sample was selected in the far-ir, at $\lambda$=100and/or 160 $\mu$m, and only includes galaxies with a secure h$\alpha$ detection(s/n$&gt;$3). from the low resolution 3d-hst spectra we measured the redshifts andthe h$\alpha$ fluxes for the whole sample (a factor of 1/1.2 was applied to theobserved fluxes to remove the [nii] contamination). the stellar masses(m$_{\star}$), infrared (l$_{ir}$) and uv luminosities (l$_{uv}$) were derivedfrom the seds by fitting multi-band data from galex near-uv to spire 500$\mu$m. we estimated the continuum extinction e$_{star}$(b-v) from both theirx=l$_{ir}$/l$_{uv}$ ratio and the uv-slope, $\beta$, and found an excellentagreement between the two. the nebular extinction was estimated from comparisonof the observed sfr$_{h\alpha}$ and sfr$_{uv}$. we obtained\emph{f}=e$_{star}$(b-v)/e$_{neb}$(b-v)=0.93$\pm$0.06, i.e. higher than thecanonical value of \emph{f}=0.44 measured in the local universe. our deriveddust correction produces good agreement between the h$\alpha$ and ir+uv sfrsfor galaxies with sfr$\gtrsim$ 20 m$_{\odot}$/yr and m$_{\star} \gtrsim 5\times 10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, while objects with lower sfr and m$_{\star}$ seemto require a smaller \emph{f}-factor (i.e. higher h$\alpha$ extinctioncorrection). our results then imply that the nebular extinction for our sampleis comparable to that in the optical-uv continuum and suggest that the\emph{f}-factor is a function of both m$_{\star}$ and sfr, in agreement withprevious studies.

1508.01679	the star formation rate cookbook at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3: extinction-corrected  relations for uv &amp; [oii]{\lambda}3727 luminosities	we use a spectroscopic sample of 286 star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 1&lt;z&lt;3from the gmass survey to study different star formation rate (sfr) estimators.infrared (ir) data are used to derive empirical calibrations to correctultraviolet (uv) and [oii]{\lambda}3727 luminosities for dust extinction anddust-corrected estimates of sfr. in the selection procedure we fully exploitthe available spectroscopic information. on the basis of three continuumindices, we are able to identify and exclude from the sample galaxies in whichold stellar populations might bring a non-negligible contribution to irluminosity (lir) and continuum reddening. using spitzer-mips and herschel-pacsdata we derive lir for two-thirds of our sample. the lir/luv ratio is used as aprobe of effective attenuation (airx) to search for correlations with continuumand spectroscopic features. the relation between airx and uv continuum slope({\beta}) was tested for our sample and found to be broadly consistent with theliterature results at the same redshift, though with a larger dispersion withrespect to uv-selected samples. we find a correlation between the rest-frameequivalent width (ew) of the [oii]{\lambda}3727 line and {\beta}, which is themain result of this work. we therefore propose the [oii]{\lambda}3727 line ewas a dust attenuation probe and calibrate it through airx, though theassumption of a reddening curve is still needed to derive the actualattenuation towards the [oii]{\lambda}3727 line. we tested the issue ofdifferential attenuation towards stellar continuum and nebular emission: ourresults are in line with the traditional prescription of extra attenuationtowards nebular lines. a set of relations is provided that allows the recoveryof the total unattenuated sfr from uv and [oii]{\lambda}3727 luminosities.(abridged)

0705.2864	unveiling obscured accretion in the chandra deep field south	a large population of heavily obscured, compton thick agns is predicted bymodels of galaxy formation, models of cosmic x-ray background and by the``relic'' super-massive black-hole mass function measured from local bulges.however, so far only a handful of compton thick agns have been possiblydetected using even the deepest chandra and xmm surveys. compton-thick agns canbe recovered thanks to the reprocessing of the agn uv emission in the infraredby selecting sources with agn luminosity's in the mid-infrared and faintnear-infrared and optical emission. to this purpose, we make use of deep hst,vlt, spitzer and chandra data on the chandra deep field south to constrain thenumber of compton thick agn in this field. we show that sources with high24$\mu$m to optical flux ratios and red colors form a distinct sourcepopulation, and that their infrared luminosity is dominated by agn emission.analysis of the x-ray properties of these extreme sources shows that most ofthem (80$\pm15%$) are indeed likely to be highly obscured, compton thick agns.the number of infrared selected, compton thick agns with 5.8$\mu$m luminosityhigher than $10^{44.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ turns out to be similar to that of x-rayselected, unobscured and moderately obscured agns with 2-10 kev luminosityhigher than $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the redshift bin 1.2-2.6. this ``factorof 2'' source population is exactly what it is needed to solve thediscrepancies between model predictions and x-ray agn selection.

0704.0735	the hellas2xmm survey. x. the bolometric output of luminous obscured  quasars: the spitzer perspective	aims: we aim at estimating the spectral energy distributions (seds) and thephysical parameters related to the black holes harbored in eight highx-ray-to-optical (f_x/f_r&gt;10) obscured quasars at z&gt;0.9 selected in the 2--10kev band from the hellas2xmm survey.  methods: we use irac and mips 24 micron observations, along with optical andks-band photometry, to obtain the seds of the sources. the observed seds aremodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (usingthe phenomenological templates of silva et al. 2004) for six sources associatedwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical seds of redquasars are adopted. the bolometric luminosities and the m_bh-l_k relation areused to provide an estimate of the masses and eddington ratios of the blackholes residing in these agn.  results: all of our sources are detected in the irac and mips (at 24 micron)bands. the sed modeling described above is in good agreement with the observednear- and mid-infrared data. the derived bolometric luminosities are in therange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 kev bolometric correction is~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by elvis et al. (1994).for the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the k_s band, we derive highstellar masses (0.8-6.2)x10^11 mo, black hole masses in the range(0.2-2.5)x10^9 mo, and eddington ratios l/l_edd&lt;0.1, suggesting a low-accretionphase.

astro-ph;0303116	the radio/mid-infrared correlation and the contribution of 15-micron  galaxies to the 1.4-ghz source counts	the radio counterparts to the 15-micron sources in the european large areaiso survey southern fields are identified in 1.4-ghz maps down to about 80microjy. the radio-mir correlation is investigated and derived for the firsttime at these flux densities for a sample of this size. our results show thatradio and mir luminosities correlate almost as well as radio and fir, at leastup to z ~ 0.6. using the derived relation and its spread together with theobserved 15-micron counts, we have estimated the expected contribution of the15-micron extragalactic populations to the radio source counts and the role ofmir starburst galaxies in the well known 1.4-ghz source excess observed atsub-mjy levels. our analysis demonstrates that ir emitting starburst galaxiesdo not contribute significantly to the 1.4-ghz counts for strong sources, butstart to become a significant fraction of the radio source population at fluxdensities &lt; 0.5 - 0.8 mjy. they are expected to be responsible for more than60% of the observed radio counts at &lt; 0.05 mjy. these results are in agreementwith the existing results on optical identifications of faint radio sources.

astro-ph;0305299	on the nature of the iso-selected sources in the elais s2 region	we have studied the optical, near-ir and radio properties of a completesample of 43 sources detected at 15-micron in one of the deeper elaisrepeatedly observed region. the extragalactic objects in this sample have15-micron flux densities in the range 0.4-10 mjy, where the source counts startdiverging from no evolution models. about 90% of the sources (39 out of 43)have optical counterparts brighter than i=21 mag. eight of these 39 sourceshave been identified with stars on the basis of imaging data, while for another22 sources we have obtained optical spectroscopy, reaching a highidentification percentage (30/43, ~70%). all but one of the 28 sources withflux density &gt; 0.7 mjy are identified. most of the extragalactic objects arenormal spiral or starburst galaxies at moderate redshift (z_med~0.2); fourobjects are active galactic nuclei. we have used the 15-micron, h_alpha and1.4-ghz luminosities as indicators of star-formation rate and we have comparedthe results obtained in these three bands. while 1.4-ghz and 15-micronestimates are in good agreement, showing that our galaxies are forming stars ata median rate of ~40 mo/yr, the raw h_alpha-based estimates are a factor ~5-10lower and need a mean correction of ~2 mag to be brought on the same scale asthe other two indicators. a correction of ~2 mag is consistent with whatsuggested by the balmer decrements h_alpha/h_beta and by the optical colours.moreover, it is intermediate between the correction found locally for normalspirals and the correction needed for high-luminosity 15-micron objects,suggesting that the average extinction suffered by galaxies increases withinfrared luminosity.

astro-ph;0312163	high-frequency polarization properties of southern kuhr sources	we have carried out observations at 18.5 ghz with the australia telescopecompact array (atca) of 250 out of the 258 southern extragalactic sources inthe complete 5 ghz 1 jy sample by k\"uhr et al. (1981). in this paper we focuson the polarization properties of this sample, while other properties will beaddressed in a future paper. in our analysis we subdivide the sample into flatand steep spectrum sources following stickel et al. (1994) classification,where spectral indices were measured between 2.7 and 5 ghz. the polarized fluxhas been measured with a s/n &gt; 5 for 170 sources (114 flat-spectrum and 56steep-spectrum) and upper limits have been set for additional 27 sources (12flat-spectrum and 15 steep-spectrum). the median polarization degree at 18.5ghz for the flat-spectrum sub-sample is \pi_{18.5}\simeq 2.7%, about a factorof 2 higher than at 1.4 ghz (\pi_{1.4}\simeq 1.4%, based on nvss data). forflat-spectrum sources we find a weak correlation between \pi_{18.5} and thehigh frequency (5--18.5 ghz) spectral index. no evidences of significantcorrelations of the polarization degree with other source properties are found.the median value of \pi_{18.5} for the steep spectrum sources is \simeq 4.8%,but our sample might be biased against extended sources. we find indications ofa correlation between \pi_{18.5} and both the low frequency (1.4--5 ghz) andthe high frequency (5--18.5 ghz) spectral indices. an important application ofthis work is the possibility to estimate the contamination of cmb polarizationmaps by extragalactic radio sources. our results indicate that suchcontamination is within the range of estimates given by mesa et al. (2002).

astro-ph;0401289	the european large area iso survey ix: the 90 micron luminosity function  from the final analysis sample	we present the 90 micron luminosity function of the final analysis of theeuropean large area iso survey (elais), extending the sample size of ourprevious analysis (paper iv) by about a factor of 4. our sample extends toz=1.1, around 50 times the comoving volume of paper iv, and 10^{7.7} &lt;h^{-2}l/lsun &lt; 10^{12.5}. from our optical spectroscopy campaigns of thenorthern elais 90 mircon survey (7.4 deg^2 in total, to s(90um)&gt;70mjy), weobtained redshifts for 61% of the sample (151 redshifts) to b&lt;21 identified at7 microns, 15 microns, 20cm or with bright (b&lt;18.5) optical identifications.the selection function is well-defined, permitting the construction of the 90micron luminosity function of the final analysis catalogue in the elaisnorthern fields, which is in excellent agreement with our preliminary analysisluminosity function in the elais s1 field from paper iv. the luminosityfunction is also in good agreement with the iras-based prediction of serjeant &amp;harrison (2004), which if correct requires luminosity evolution of (1+z)^{3.4+/- 1.0} for consistency with the source counts. this implies an evolution incomoving volume averaged star formation rate at z&lt;~1 consistent with thatderived from rest-frame optical and ultraviolet surveys.

astro-ph;0403211	the nature of the mid-infrared population from optical identifications  of the elais-s1 sample	we present a multi-wavelength catalog (15 um, r, k-band, 1.4 ghz flux) plusspectroscopic identifications for 406 15 um sources detected in the elaisregion s1, over the flux density range 0.5&lt;s&lt;150 mjy. 332 (~82%) sources areoptically identified down to r~23.0. spectra or bona fide stellaridentifications are obtained for 290 objects. the areal coverage, mir andoptical completeness of the sample are discussed in order to allow statisticaland evolutionary analyses. two main spectroscopic classes have been found todominate the mir extragalactic population: z&lt;0.5 star-forming galaxies (fromabsorbed to extreme starbursts: nul_nu~10^8-10^11 l_odot), which account for\~75% of the sources, and agn (both type 1 and 2), which account for ~25% ofthe sources. about 20% of the extragalactic sources are dust-enshroudedstarburst galaxies [e(a) spectra], and all the starburst galaxies appear moredust extincted in the optical than nearby normal galaxies. we also identified91 stellar objects (~22% of the mir sources). the counts for starburst galaxiesand agn down to 0.6 mjy have been derived. a general trend is found in theoptical-mir sed of the galaxies, where the mir-luminous objects have larger mirto optical luminosity ratios.

astro-ph;0403242	the mid-ir luminosity function of galaxies in the elais southern fields	we present the first determination of the 15micron luminosity functiogalaxies from the european large area iso survey (elais) southern fields. wehave adopted a new criterion to separate the quiescent, non-evolving and thestarburst, evolving populations based on the ratio of mid-infrared to opticalluminosities. strong evolution is suggested by our data for the starburstgalaxy population, while normal spiral galaxies are consistent with noevolution. the starburst population must evolve both in luminosity and indensity with rates of the order l(z) (1+z)^(3.5) and rho(z) (1+z)^3.8 up toz~1. the evolutionary parameters of our model have been tested by comparing themodel predictions with other observables, like source counts at all fluxdensity levels (from 0.1 to 300 mjy) and redshift distributions and luminosityfunctions at high-z (0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 from hdf-n data). the agreement between ourmodel predictions and the observed data is remarkably good. we use our data toestimate the star-formation density of the universe up to z=0.4 and we use theluminosity function model to predict the trend of the star-formation history upto z=1.

astro-ph;0404315	final analysis of elais 15 $\mu$m observations : method, reduction and  catalogue	we present the final analysis of the european large area iso survey (elais)15 $\mu$m observations, carried out with the isocam instrument on board theinfrared space observatory (iso).  the data reduction method, known as lari method, is based on a mathematicalmodel of the detector's behaviour and was specifically designed for thedetection of faint sources in iso-cam/phot data. the method is fullyinteractive and leads to very reliable and complete source lists.  the resulting catalogue includes 1923 sources detected with $s/n &gt; 5$ in the{0.5 -- 100 mjy} flux range and over an area of 10.85 {deg$^2$} split into fourfields, making it the largest non-serendipitous extragalactic source catalogueobtained to date from iso data.  this paper presents the concepts underlying the data reduction methodtogether with its latest enhancements. the data reduction process, theproduction and basic properties of the resulting catalogue are discussed. thecatalogue quality is assessed by means of detailed simulations, opticalidentifications and comparison with previous analyses.

astro-ph;0503258	the redshift-space two point correlation function of elais-s1 galaxies	we investigate the clustering properties of galaxies in the recentlycompleted elais-s1 redshift survey through their spatial two pointautocorrelation function. we used a sub-sample of the elais-s1 catalog coveringapproximately 4 deg^2 and consisting of 148 objects selected at 15 micron witha flux &gt;0.5 mjy and redshift z&lt;0.5. we detected a positive signal in thecorrelation function that, in the range of separations 1-10 h mpc is wellapproximated by a power law with a slope gamma = 1.4 and a correlation length s=5.4 h mpc. this result is in good agreement with the redshift-spacecorrelation function measured in more local samples of mid infrared selectedgalaxies like the iras psc$z$ redshift survey. this suggests a lack ofsignificant clustering evolution of infrared selected objects out to $z=0.5$that is further confirmed by the consistency found between the correlationfunctions measured in a local (z&lt;0.2) and a distant (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5) subsample ofelais-s1 galaxies. we also confirm that optically selected galaxies in thelocal redshift surveys, especially those of the sdss sample, are significantlymore clustered than infrared objects.

astro-ph;0511563	counting individual galaxies from deep 24 micron spitzer surveys: beyond  the confusion limit	we address the question of how to deal with confusion limited surveys in themid-infrared domain by using informations from higher frequency observationsover the same sky regions. such informations, once applied to apparentlyextended mid-infrared sources, which are indeed ``blends'' of two or moredifferent sources, allow us to disentangle the single counterparts and to splitthe measured flux density into different components. we present the applicationof this method to the 24 micron spitzer archival data in the goods-en1 testfield, where apparently extended, ``blended'' sources constitute about 20% of areliable sample of 983 sources detected above the 5-sigma threshold down to 23microjy. as higher frequency data-set we have considered the public irac imagesand catalogues on the same field. we show that the 24 micron sample is almostunbiased down to ~40 microjy and the careful application of the deblendingprocedure does not require any statistical completeness correction (at least atthe flux level considered). this is probed by direct comparison of our resultswith those of chary et al. (2004), who analysed the same data-set throughextensive monte carlo simulations. the deblending procedure reduces of about30% the confusion limit of the mips 24 micron survey, allowing one to obtainreliable source counts down to ~40 microjy. the extrapolation of the sourcecounts down to fainter fluxes suggests that our 24 micron sample is able toresolve ~62% of the cosmic background down to a flux level of 38 microjy.

astro-ph;0601355	active galactic nuclei in the mid-ir. evolution and contribution to the  cosmic infrared background	we study the evolution of the luminosity function (lf) of type-1 and type-2agn in the mid-infrared, and derive their contribution to the cosmic infraredbackground (cirb) and the expected deep source counts to be observed by spitzerat 24 micron. the sample of type-1 and type-2 agn was selected at 15 micron(iso) and 12 micron (iras), and classified on the basis of their opticalspectra. local templates of type-1 and type-2 agn have been used to derive theintrinsic 15 micron luminosities. we adopted an evolving smooth two-power lawshape of the lf, whose parameters have been derived using an un-binned maximumlikelihood method. we find that the lf of type-1 agn is compatible with a pureluminosity evolution (l(z)=l(0)(1+z)^k_l) model where k_l~2.9. a smallflattening of the faint slope of the lf with increasing redshift is favoured bythe data. a similar evolutionary scenario is found for the type-2 populationwith a rate k_l ranging from ~1.8 to 2.6, depending significantly on theadopted mid-infrared spectral energy distribution. also for type-2 agn aflattening of the lf with increasing redshift is suggested by the data,possibly caused by the loss of a fraction of type-2 agn hidden within theoptically classified starburst and normal galaxies. the type-1 agn contributionto the cirb at 15 micron is (4.2-12.1) x 10e-11 w m^-2 sr^-1, while the type-2agn contribution is (5.5-11.0) x 10e-11 w m^-2 sr^-1. we expect that spitzerwill observe, down to a flux limit of s_24 = 0.01 mjy, a density of ~1200deg^-2 type-1 and ~1000 deg^-2 type-2 optically classified agn. the derivedtotal contribution of the agn galaxies to the cirb (4-10%) and spitzer countsshould be considered as lower limits, because of a possible loss of type-2sources caused by the optical classification.

astro-ph;0701178	hidden activity in high-redshift spheroidal galaxies from mid-infrared  and x-ray observations in the goods-north field	we exploit very deep mid-ir (mir) and x-ray observations by spitzer andchandra in the goods north to identify signs of hidden (either starburst oragn) activity in spheroidal galaxies between z~0.3 and 1. our reference is acomplete sample of 168 morphologically classified spheroidal galaxies withz[ab]&lt;22.5 selected from goods acs imaging. nineteen of these have 24 microndetections in the goods catalogue, half of which have an x-ray counterpart inthe 2 ms chandra catalogue, while about 25% have 1.4 ghz fluxes larger than 40microjy. traces of hidden activity in the spheroidal population are alsosearched for in the deep x-ray images and 14 additional galaxies are detectedin x-rays only. the nature of the observed mir emissions is investigated bymodelling their seds based on the available multi-wavelength photometry,including x-ray, uv, optical, near-ir, mir and radio fluxes, and opticalspectroscopy. the amount of dust derived from the ir emission observed byspitzer appears in excess of that expected by mass loss from evolved stars. ouranalysis of the x-ray and mir properties leads us to conclude that at least 8of the 19 24-um bright sources should hide an obscured agn, while the x-rayundetected sources are more likely dominated by star formation. [abridged] weconclude that ~30 objects (~20%) of the original flux-limited sample of 168spheroidal galaxies in the goods-north are detected during phases of prominentactivity, of both stellar and quasar origin. due to the short expectedlifetimes of the ir and x-ray emissions, this fraction might imply asignificant level of activity in this class of galaxies during the relativelyrecent cosmic epochs, z~0.3 to z~1, under investigation.
