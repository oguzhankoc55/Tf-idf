0901.4162	a quintet of black hole mass determinations	we report five new measurements of central black hole masses based on stisand wfpc2 observations with the hubble space telescope and on axisymmetric,three-integral, schwarzschild orbit-library kinematic models. we selected asample of galaxies within a narrow range in velocity dispersion that cover arange of galaxy parameters (including hubble type and core/power-law surfacedensity profile) where we expected to be able to resolve the galaxy's sphere ofinfluence based on the predicted value of the black hole mass from the m-sigmarelation. we find masses in units of 10^8 solar masses for the followinggalaxies:  ngc 3585, m_bh = 3.4 (+1.5, -0.6);  ngc 3607, m_bh = 1.2 (+0.4, -0.4);  ngc 4026, m_bh = 2.1 (+0.7, -0.4); and  ngc 5576, m_bh = 1.8 (+0.3, -0.4), all significantly excluding m_bh = 0. for  ngc 3945, m_bh = 0.09 (+0.17, -0.21), which is significantly belowpredictions from m-sigma and m-l relations and consistent with m_bh = 0, thoughthe presence of a double bar in this galaxy may present problems for ouraxisymmetric code.

0903.4897	the m-sigma and m-l relations in galactic bulges and determinations of  their intrinsic scatter	we derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black holemass (m_bh) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity(l) (the m-sigma and m-l relations), based on 49 m_bh measurements and 19 upperlimits. particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter(epsilon_0) in both relations. we find log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta *log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/-0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.23 +/-0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. the results forellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatterrecovered for spirals is significantly larger. the scatter inferred reinforcesthe need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass functionbased on the m-sigma relation, and further implies that there may besubstantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the m-sigma relation.we estimate the m-l relationship as log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta * log(l_v/ 10^11 l_sun,v) of (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18,0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. these results appear to beinsensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and thedistribution of intrinsic scatter. we show that culling the sample according tothe resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations tolarger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

0906.0576	hydrostatic gas constraints on supermassive black hole masses:  implications for hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical modelling in a sample  of early-type galaxies	we present new mass measurements for the supermassive black holes (smbhs) inthe centres of three early-type galaxies. the gas pressure in the surrounding,hot interstellar medium (ism) is measured through spatially resolvedspectroscopy with the chandra x-ray observatory, allowing the smbh mass (mbh)to be inferred directly under the hydrostatic approximation. this techniquedoes not require calibration against other smbh measurement methods and itsaccuracy depends only on the ism being close to hydrostatic, which is supportedby the smooth x-ray isophotes of the galaxies. combined with results from ourrecent study of the elliptical galaxy ngc4649, this brings to four the numberof galaxies with smbhs measured in this way. of these, three already have massdeterminations from the kinematics of either the stars or a central gas disc,and hence join only a handful of galaxies with mbh measured by more than onetechnique. we find good agreement between the different methods, providingsupport for the assumptions implicit in both the hydrostatic and the dynamicalmodels. the stellar mass-to-light ratios for each galaxy inferred by ourtechnique are in agreement with the predictions of stellar population synthesismodels assuming a kroupa initial mass function (imf). this concurrence impliesthat no more than ~10-20% of the ism pressure is nonthermal, unless there is aconspiracy between the shape of the imf and nonthermal pressure. finally, wecompute bondi accretion rates, finding that the two galaxies with the highestrates exhibit little evidence of x-ray cavities, suggesting that thecorrelation with the agn jet power takes time to be established.

0906.1492	the black hole mass, stellar m/l, and dark halo in m87	we model the dynamical structure of m87 (ngc4486) using high spatialresolution long-slit observations of stellar light in the central regions,two-dimensional stellar light kinematics out to half of the effective radius,and globular cluster velocities out to 8 effective radii. we simultaneously fitfor four parameters, black hole mass, dark halo core radius, dark halo circularvelocity, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. we find a black hole mass of6.4(+-0.5)x10^9 msun(the uncertainty is 68% confidence marginalized over theother parameters). the stellar m/l_v=6.3+-0.8. the best-fitted dark halo coreradius is 14+-2 kpc, assuming a cored logarithmic potential. the best-fitteddark halo circular velocity is 715+-15 km/s. our black hole mass is over afactor of 2 larger than previous stellar dynamical measures, and our derivedstellar m/l ratio is 2 times lower than previous dynamical measures. when we donot include a dark halo, we measure a black hole mass and stellar m/l ratiothat is consistent with previous measures, implying that the major differenceis in the model assumptions. the stellar m/l ratio from our models is verysimilar to that derived from stellar population models of m87. the reason forthe difference in the black hole mass is because we allow the m/l ratio tochange with radius. the dark halo is degenerate with the stellar m/l ratio,which is subsequently degenerate with the black hole mass. we argue thatdynamical models of galaxies that do not include the contribution from a darkhalo may produce a biased result for the black hole mass. this bias isespecially large for a galaxy with a shallow light profile such as m87, and maynot be as severe in galaxies with steeper light profiles unless they have alarge stellar population change with radius.

0908.2810	the spatially resolved star formation law from integral field  spectroscopy: virus-p observations of ngc 5194	we investigate the relation between the star formation rate surface density(sigma_sfr) and the mass surface density of gas (sigma_gas) in ngc 5194.virus-p integral field spectroscopy is used to measure h-alpha, h-beta[nii]6548,6584, and [sii]6717,6731 emission line fluxes for 735 regions ~170 pcin diameter, and derive extinction corrected sigma_sfrs. hi 21cm and co mapsare used to measure the hi and h_2 gas surface density for each region. wepresent a new method for fitting the star formation law (sfl), which includesthe intrinsic scatter in the relation as a free parameter, allows the inclusionof non-detections, and is free of the systematics involved in performing linearcorrelations over incomplete data in logarithmic space. we use the[sii]/h-alpha ratio to separate the h-alpha flux contribution from the diffuseionized gas (dig). after removing the dig, we measure a slope n=0.82+/-0.05,and an intrinsic scatter epsilon=0.43+/-0.02 dex for the molecular gas sfl. wealso measure a typical depletion timescale tau~2 gyr, in good agreement withbigiel et al. (2008). the hi density shows no correlation with the sfr, and thetotal gas sfl closely follows the molecular gas sfl. we assess the validity ofcorrections applied in narrow-band h-alpha measurements to overcome issuesrelated to continuum subtraction, underlying photospheric absorption, andcontamination by the [nii] doublet. the disagreement with the super-linearmolecular sfl measured by kennicutt et al. (2007) is due to differences in thefitting method. our results support a low and close to constant star formationefficiency (sfe = 1/tau) in the molecular ism. the data shows excellentagreement with the model of krumholz et al (2009). the large intrinsic scattermay imply the existence of other important parameters setting the sfr.

0910.4168	the supermassive black hole and dark matter halo of ngc 4649 (m60)	we apply the axisymmetric orbit superposition modeling to estimate the massof the supermassive black hole and dark matter halo profile of ngc 4649. wehave included data sets from the hubble space telescope, stellar, and globularcluster observations. our modeling gives the black hole mass = 4.5 \pm 1.0 10^9\msun and m/l = 8.7 \pm 1.0 (or 8.0 \pm 0.9 after foreground galacticextinction is corrected). we confirm the presence of a dark matter halo, butthe stellar mass dominates inside the effective radius. the parameters of thedark halo are less constrained due to the sparse globular cluster data at largeradii. we find that in ngc 4649 the dynamical mass profile from our modeling isconsistently larger than that derived from the x-ray data over most of theradial range by roughly 60% to 80%. it implies that either some forms ofnon-thermal pressure need to be included, the assumed hydrostatic equilibriummay not be a good approximation in the x-ray modelings of ngc 4649, or ourassumptions used in the dynamical models are biased. our new black hole mass isabout two times larger than the previous published value; the earlier model didnot adequately sample the orbits required to match the large tangentialanisotropy in the galaxy center. if we assume that there is no dark matter, theresults on the black hole mass and m/l do not change significantly, which weattribute to the inclusion of hst spectra, the sparse globular clusterkinematics, and a diffuse dark matter halo. without the hst data, thesignificance of the black hole detection is greatly reduced.

1009.0750	the black hole mass in brightest cluster galaxy ngc 6086	we present the first direct measurement of the central black hole mass, m_bh,in ngc 6086, the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in abell 2162. ourinvestigation demonstrates for the first time that stellar dynamicalmeasurements of m_bh in bcgs are possible beyond the nearest few galaxyclusters. we observed ngc 6086 with laser guide star adaptive optics and theintegral-field spectrograph (ifs) osiris at the w.m. keck observatory, and withthe seeing-limited ifs gmos-n at gemini observatory north. we combined the twoifs data sets with existing major-axis kinematics, and used axisymmetricstellar orbit models to determine m_bh and the r-band stellar mass-to-lightratio, m*/l_r. we find m_bh = 3.6(+1.7)(-1.1) x 10^9 m_sun and m*/l_r =4.6(+0.3)(-0.7) m_sun/l_sun (68% confidence), from models using the mostmassive dark matter halo allowed within the gravitational potential of the hostcluster. models fitting only ifs data confirm m_bh ~ 3 x 10^9 m_sun and m*/l_r~ 4 m_sun/l_sun, with weak dependence on the dark matter halo structure. whendata out to 19 kpc are included, the unrealistic omission of dark matter causesthe best-fit black hole mass to decrease dramatically, to 0.6 x 10^9 m_sun, andthe best-fit stellar mass-to-light ratio to increase to 6.7 m_sun/l_sun. thelatter value is at further odds with stellar population studies favoring m*/l ~2 m_sun/l_sun,r. biases from dark matter omission could extend to dynamicalmodels of other galaxies with central stellar cores, and new measurements ofm_bh from models with dark matter could steepen the empirical scalingrelationships between black holes and their host galaxies.

1011.0426	hetdex pilot survey for emission-line galaxies - i. survey design,  performance, and catalog	we present a catalog of emission-line galaxies selected solely by theiremission-line fluxes using a wide-field integral field spectrograph. this workis partially motivated as a pilot survey for the upcoming hobby-eberlytelescope dark energy experiment (hetdex). we describe the observations,reductions, detections, redshift classifications, line fluxes, and counterpartinformation for 397 emission-line galaxies detected over 169 sq.arcmin with a3500-5800 ang. bandpass under 5 ang. full-width-half-maximum (fwhm) spectralresolution. the survey's best sensitivity for unresolved objects underphotometric conditions is between 4-20 e-17 erg/s/sq.cm depending on thewavelength, and ly-alpha luminosities between 3-6 e42 erg/s are detectable.this survey method complements narrowband and color-selection techniques in thesearch for high redshift galaxies with its different selection properties andlarge volume probed. the four survey fields within the cosmos, goods-n, munics,and xmm-lss areas are rich with existing, complementary data. we find 104galaxies via their high redshift ly-alpha emission at 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.8, and themajority of the remainder objects are low redshift [oii]3727 emitters atz&lt;0.56. the classification between low and high redshift objects depends onrest frame equivalent width, as well as other indicators, where available.based on matches to x-ray catalogs, the active galactic nuclei (agn) fractionamongst the ly-alpha emitters (laes) is 6%. we also analyze the survey'scompleteness and contamination properties through simulations. we find fivehigh-z, highly-significant, resolved objects with full-width-half-maximum sizes&gt;44 sq.arcsec which appear to be extended ly-alpha nebulae. we also find threehigh-z objects with rest frame ly-alpha equivalent widths above the levelbelieved to be achievable with normal star formation, ew(rest)&gt;240 ang.

1011.0431	the hetdex pilot survey iii: the low metallicities of high-redshift  lyman alpha galaxies	we present keck/nirspec spectroscopic observations of three lyman alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 2.3 discovered with the hetdex pilot survey. wedetect halpha, [oiii], and hbeta emission from two galaxies at z = 2.29 and2.49, designated hps194 and hps256, respectively, representing the firstdetection of multiple rest-frame optical emission lines in galaxies athigh-redshift selected on the basis of their lyman alpha emission. theredshifts of the lyman alpha emission from these galaxies are offset redward ofthe systemic redshifts by delta_v = 162 +/- 37 (photometric) +/- 42(systematic) km/s for hps194, and delta_v = 36 +/- 35 +/- 18 km/s for hps256.an interpretation for hps194 is that a large-scale outflow may be occurring inits interstellar medium. the emission line ratios imply that neither lae hostsan active galactic nucleus. using the upper limits on the [nii] emission weplace meaningful constraints on the gas-phase metallicities in these two laesof z &lt; 0.17 and &lt; 0.28 zsol (1 sigma). measuring the stellar masses of theseobjects via spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting (~ 10^10 and 6 x 10^8msol, respectively), we study the nature of laes in a mass-metallicity plane.at least one of these two laes appears to be more metal poor thancontinuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift and stellar mass,implying that objects exhibiting lyman alpha emission may be systematicallyless chemically enriched than the general galaxy population. we use the seds ofthese two galaxies to show that neglecting the emission lines when fittingstellar population models to the observed photometry can result inoverestimates of the population age by orders of magnitude, and the stellarmass by a factor of ~ 2. this effect is particularly important at z &gt; 7, wheresimilarly strong emission lines may masquerade in the photometry as a 4000 abreak (abridged).

1011.5077	effect of a dark matter halo on the determination of black hole masses	stellar dynamical modeling is a powerful method to determine the mass ofblack holes in quiescent galaxies. however, in previous work the presence of adark matter halo has been ignored in the modeling. gebhardt &amp; thomas (2009)showed that accounting for a dark matter halo increased the black hole mass ofthe massive galaxy m87 by a factor of two. we used a sample of 12 galaxies toinvestigate the effect of accounting for a dark matter halo in the dynamicalmodeling in more detail, and also updated the masses using improved modeling.the sample of galaxies possesses hubble space telescope and ground basedobservations of stellar kinematics. their black hole masses have been presentedbefore, but without including a dark matter halo in the models. without a darkhalo, we find a mean increase in the estimated mass of 1.5 for the whole samplecompared to previous results. we attribute this change to using a more completeorbit library. when we include a dark matter halo, along with the updatedmodels, we find an additional increase in black hole mass by a factor of 1.2 inthe mean, much less than for m87. we attribute the smaller discrepancy in blackhole mass to using data that better resolves the black hole's sphere ofinfluence. we redetermined the m-sigma and m-l relationships using our updatedblack hole masses and found a slight increase in both normalization andintrinsic scatter.

0709.0585	the black hole mass and extreme orbital structure in ngc1399	the largest galaxies, and in particular central galaxies in clusters, offerunique insight into understanding the mechanism for the growth of nuclear blackholes. we present hubble space telescope kinematics for ngc1399, the centralgalaxy in fornax. we find the best-fit model contains a black hole of 5.1 +-0.7x 10^8 msun (at a distance of 21.1 mpc), a factor of over 2 below thecorrelation of black hole mass and velocity dispersion. we also find a dramaticsignature for central tangential anisotropy. the velocity profiles on adjacentsides 0.5" away from the nucleus show strong bimodality, and the centralspectrum shows a large drop in the dispersion. both of these observations pointto an orbital distribution that is tangentially biased. the best-fit orbitalmodel suggests a ratio of the tangential to radial internal velocitydispersions of three. this ratio is the largest seen in any galaxy to date andwill provide an important measure for the mode by which the central black holehas grown.

1101.1954	the black-hole mass in m87 from gemini/nifs adaptive optics observations	we present the stellar kinematics in the central 2" of the luminouselliptical galaxy m87 (ngc 4486), using laser adaptive optics to feed thegemini telescope integral-field spectrograph, nifs. the velocity dispersionrises to 480 km/s at 0.2". we combine these data with extensive stellarkinematics out to large radii to derive a black-hole mass equal to(6.6+-0.4)x10^9 msun, using orbit-based axisymmetric models and including onlythe nifs data in the central region. including previously-reported ground-baseddata in the central region drops the uncertainty to 0.25x10^9 msun with nochange in the best-fit mass; however, we rely on the values derived from thenifs-only data in the central region in order to limit systematic differences.the best-fit model shows a significant increase in the tangential velocityanisotropy of stars orbiting in the central region with decreasing radius;similar to that seen in the centers of other core galaxies. the black-hole massis insensitive to the inclusion of a dark halo in the models --- the highangular-resolution provided by the adaptive optics breaks the degeneracybetween black-hole mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. the present black-holemass is in excellent agreement with the gebhardt &amp; thomas value, implying thatthe dark halo must be included when the kinematic influence of the black holeis poorly resolved. this degeneracy implies that the black-hole masses ofluminous core galaxies, where this effect is important, may need to bere-evaluated. the present value exceeds the prediction of the blackhole-dispersion and black hole-luminosity relations, both of which predictabout 1x10^9 msun for m87, by close to twice the intrinsic scatter in therelations. the high-end of the black hole correlations may be poorly determinedat present.

1101.1957	galaxy kinematics with virus-p: the dark matter halo of m87	we present 2-d stellar kinematics of m87 out to r = 238" taken with theintegral field spectrograph virus-p. we run a large set of axisymmetric,orbit-based dynamical models and find clear evidence for a massive dark matterhalo. while a logarithmic parameterization for the dark matter halo ispreferred, we do not constrain the dark matter scale radius for an nfw profileand therefore cannot rule it out. our best-fit logarithmic models return anenclosed dark matter fraction of 17.2 +/- 5.0 % within one effective radius(r_e ~ 100"), rising to 49.4 (+7.2,-8.8) % within 2 r_e. existing sauron data(r &lt; 13"), and globular cluster kinematic data covering 145" &lt; r &lt; 540"complete the kinematic coverage to r = 47 kpc. at this radial distance thelogarithmic dark halo comprises 85.3 (+2.5,-2.4) % of the total enclosed massof 5.7^(+1.3)_(-0.9) x 10^(12) m_sun making m87 one of the most massivegalaxies in the local universe. our best-fit logarithmic dynamical modelsreturn a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 9.1^(+0.2)_(-0.2) (v-band), a dark halocircular velocity of 800^(+75)_(-25) kms, and a dark halo scale radius of36^(+7)_(-3) kpc. the stellar m/l, assuming an nfw dark halo, is wellconstrained to 8.20^(+0.05)_(-0.10) (v-band). the stars in m87 are found to beradially anisotropic out to r ~ 0.5 r_e then isotropic or slightly tangentiallyanisotropic to our last stellar data point at r = 2.4 r_e where the anisotropyof the stars and globular clusters are in excellent agreement. the globularclusters then become radially anisotropic in the last two modeling bins at r =3.4 r_e and r = 4.8 r_e. as one of the most massive galaxies in the localuniverse, constraints on both the mass distribution of m87 and anisotropy ofits kinematic components strongly informs our theories of early-type galaxyformation and evolution in dense environments.

1105.1755	gemini/gmos imaging of globular cluster systems in five early-type  galaxies	this paper presents deep high quality photometry of globular cluster (gc)systems belonging to five early-type galaxies covering a range of mass andenvironment. photometric data were obtained with the gemini north and geminisouth telescopes in the filter passbands g', r', and i'. the combination ofthese filters with good seeing conditions allows an excellent separationbetween gc candidates and unresolved field objects. bimodal gc colourdistributions are found in all five galaxies. most of the gc systems appearbimodal even in the (g' -r') vs (r' -i') plane. a population ofresolved/marginally resolved gc and ultra compact dwarf candidates was found inall the galaxies. a search for the so-called "blue tilt" in thecolour-magnitude diagrams reveals that ngc 4649 clearly shows that phenomenonalthough no conclusive evidence was found for the other galaxies in the sample.this "blue tilt" translates into a mass-metallicity relation given by z \proptom^0.28\pm0.03 . this dependence was found using a new empirical (g' -i') vs[z/h] relation which relies on an homogeneous sample of gc colours andmetallicities. this paper also explores the radial trends in both colour andsurface density for the blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) gcsubpopulations. as usual, the red gcs show a steeper radial distribution thanthe blue ones. evidence of galactocentric colour gradients is found in some ofthe gc systems, being more significant for the two s0 galaxies in the sample.red gc subpopulations show similar colours and gradients to the galaxy halostars in their inner region. a gc mean colour-galaxy luminosity relation,consistent with [z/h] \propto l_b ^0.26\pm0.08, is present for the red gcs. anestimate of the total gc populations and specific frequency sn values ispresented for ngc 3115, ngc 3379, ngc 3923 and ngc 4649.

1110.5951	the central dark matter distribution of ngc 2976	we study the mass distribution in the late-type dwarf galaxy ngc 2976 throughstellar kinematics obtained with the virus-p integral-field spectrograph andanisotropic jeans models as a test of cosmological simulations and baryonicprocesses that putatively alter small-scale structure. previous measurements ofthe h-alpha emission-line kinematics have determined that the dark matter haloof ngc 2976 is most consistent with a cored density profile. we find that thestellar kinematics are best fit with a cuspy halo. cored dark matter halo fitsare only consistent with the stellar kinematics if the stellar mass-to-lightratio is significantly larger than that derived from stellar populationsynthesis, while the best-fitting cuspy model has no such conflict. theinferred mass distribution from a harmonic decomposition of the gaseouskinematics is inconsistent with that of the stellar kinematics. this differenceis likely due to the gas disk not meeting the assumptions that underlie theanalysis such as no pressure support, a constant kinematic axis, and planarorbits. by relaxing some of these assumptions, in particular the form of thekinematic axis with radius, the gas-derived solution can be made consistentwith the stellar kinematic models. a strong kinematic twist in the gas of ngc2976's center suggests caution, and we advance the mass model based on thestellar kinematics as more reliable. the analysis of this first galaxy showspromising evidence that dark matter halos in late-type dwarfs may in fact bemore consistent with cuspy dark matter distributions than earlier work hasclaimed.

1112.1078	two ten-billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of giant  elliptical galaxies	observational work conducted over the last few decades indicates that allmassive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres. although theluminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early universesuggest that some are powered by black holes with masses greater than 10billion solar masses, the remnants of these objects have not been found in thenearby universe. the giant elliptical galaxy messier 87 hosts the hitherto mostmassive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses. here wereport that ngc 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance fromearth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billionsolar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present inngc 4889, the brightest galaxy in the coma cluster (at a distance of 103megaparsecs). these two black holes are significantly more massive thanpredicted by linearly extrapolating the widely-used correlations between blackhole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the hostgalaxy. although these correlations remain useful for predicting black holemasses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest thatdifferent evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxiesand their black holes.

1202.4464	the stellar halos of massive elliptical galaxies	we use the mitchell spectrograph (formerly virus-p) on the mcdonaldobservatory 2.7m harlan j. smith telescope to search for the chemicalsignatures of massive elliptical galaxy assembly. the mitchell spectrograph isan integral-field spectrograph with a uniquely wide field of view (107x107 sqarcsec), allowing us to achieve remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios of~20-70 per pixel in radial bins of 2-2.5 times the effective radii of the eightgalaxies in our sample. focusing on a sample of massive elliptical galaxieswith stellar velocity dispersions sigma* &gt; 150 km/s, we study the radialdependence in the equivalent widths (ews) of key metal absorption lines. bytwice the effective radius, the mgb ews have dropped by ~50%, and only a weakcorrelation between sigma* and mgb ew remains. the mgb ews at large radii arecomparable to those seen in the centers of elliptical galaxies that areapproximately an order of magnitude less massive. we find that the well-knownmetallicity gradients often observed within an effective radius continuesmoothly to 2.5r_e, while the abundance ratio gradients remain flat. much likethe halo of the milky way, the stellar halos of our galaxies have lowmetallicities and high alpha-abundance ratios, as expected for very old starsformed in small stellar systems. our observations support a picture in whichthe outer parts of massive elliptical galaxies are built by the accretion ofmuch smaller systems whose star formation history was truncated at early times.

1203.1620	dynamical measurements of black hole masses in four brightest cluster  galaxies at 100 mpc	we present stellar kinematics and orbit superposition models for the centralregions of four brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs), based upon integral-fieldspectroscopy at gemini, keck, and mcdonald observatories. our integral-fielddata span radii from &lt; 100 pc to tens of kpc. we report black hole masses,m_bh, of 2.1 +/- 1.6 x 10^10 m_sun for ngc 4889, 9.7 + 3.0 - 2.6 x 10^9 m_sunfor ngc 3842, and 1.3 + 0.5 - 0.4 x 10^9 m_sun for ngc 7768. for ngc 2832 wereport an upper limit of m_bh &lt; 9 x 10^9 m_sun. stellar orbits near the centerof each galaxy are tangentially biased, on comparable spatial scales to thegalaxies' photometric cores. we find possible photometric and kinematicevidence for an eccentric torus of stars in ngc 4889, with a radius of nearly 1kpc. we compare our measurements of m_bh to the predicted black hole massesfrom various fits to the relations between m_bh and stellar velocitydispersion, luminosity, or stellar mass. the black holes in ngc 4889 and ngc3842 are significantly more massive than all dispersion-based predictions andmost luminosity-based predictions. the black hole in ngc 7768 is consistentwith a broader range of predictions.

1204.4074	central kinematics of the globular cluster ngc 2808: upper limit on the  mass of an intermediate-mass black hole	globular clusters are an excellent laboratory for stellar population anddynamical research. recent studies have shown that these stellar systems arenot as simple as previously assumed. with multiple stellar populations as wellas outer rotation and mass segregation they turn out to exhibit highcomplexity. this includes intermediate-mass black holes which are proposed tosit at the centers of some massive globular clusters. today's high angularresolution ground based spectrographs allow velocity-dispersion measurements ata spatial resolution comparable to the radius of influence for plausible imbhmasses, and to detect changes in the inner velocity-dispersion profile.together with high quality photometric data from hst, it is possible toconstrain black-hole masses by their kinematic signatures. we determine thecentral velocity-dispersion profile of the globular cluster ngc 2808 usingvlt/flames spectroscopy. in combination with hst/acs data our goal is to probewhether this massive cluster hosts an intermediate-mass black hole at itscenter and constrain the cluster mass to light ratio as well as its total mass.we derive a velocity-dispersion profile from integral field spectroscopy in thecenter and fabry perot data for larger radii. high resolution hst data are usedto obtain the surface brightness profile. together, these data sets arecompared to dynamical models with varying parameters such as mass to lightratio profiles and black-hole masses. using analytical jeans models incombination with variable m/l profiles from n-body simulations we find that thebest fit model is a no black hole solution. after applying various monte carlosimulations to estimate the uncertainties, we derive an upper limit of the backhole mass of m_bh &lt; 1 x 10^4 m_sun (with 95 % confidence limits) and a globalmass-to-light ratio of m/l_v = (2.1 +- 0.2) m_sun/l_sun.

1205.0256	reconciling stellar dynamical and hydrostatic x-ray mass measurements of  an elliptical galaxy with gas rotation, turbulence and magnetic fields	recent hydrostatic x-ray studies of the hot interstellar medium (ism) inearly-type galaxies underestimate the gravitating mass as compared to stellardynamics, implying modest, but significant deviations from exact hydrostaticequilibrium. we present a method for combining x-ray measurements and stellardynamical constraints in the context of bayesian statistics that allows theradial distribution of the implied nonthermal pressure or bulk motions in thehot ism to be constrained. we demonstrate the accuracy of the method withhydrodynamical simulations tailored to produce a realistic galaxy model.applying the method to the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc4649, we find asignificant but subdominant nonthermal pressure fraction (0.27+/-0.06) in thecentral (&lt;5 kpc) part of the galaxy, similar to the level of deviations fromhydrostatic equilibrium expected in galaxy clusters. plausible sources ofsystematic error, if important, may reduce this fraction. this would imply &gt;360km/s random turbulence or a magnetic field b=(39+/-6)(n_e/0.1cm^{-3})^{0.59+/-0.09} mug, whereas gas rotation alone is unlikely to explainthe detailed nonthermal profile. future observations with astro-h will allowturbulence or gas rotation at this level to be detected.

1205.4022	high-velocity stars in the cores of globular clusters: the illustrative  case of ngc 2808	we report the detection of five high-velocity stars in the core of theglobular cluster ngc 2808. the stars lie on the the red giant branch and showtotal velocities between 40 and 45 km/s. for a core velocity dispersion sigma_c= 13.4 km/s, this corresponds to up to 3.4 sigma_c. these velocities are closeto the estimated escape velocity (~ 50 km/s) and suggest an ejection from thecore. two of these stars have been confirmed in our recent integral fieldspectroscopy data and we will discuss them in more detail here. these two redgiants are located at a projected distance of ~ 0.3 pc from the center.according to their positions on the color magnitude diagram, both stars arecluster members. we investigate several possible origins for the highvelocities of the stars and conceivable ejection mechanisms. since thevelocities are close to the escape velocity, it is not obvious whether thestars are bound or unbound to the cluster. we therefore consider both cases inour analysis. we perform numerical simulations of three-body dynamicalencounters between binaries and single stars and compare the resulting velocitydistributions of escapers with the velocities of our stars. we compare thepredictions for a single dynamical encounter with a compact object with thoseof a sequence of two-body encounters due to relaxation. if the stars areunbound, the encounter must have taken place recently, when the stars werealready in the giant phase. after including binary fractions and black-holeretention fractions, projection effects, and detection probabilities frommonte-carlo simulations, we estimate the expected numbers of detections for allthe different scenarios. based on these numbers, we conclude that the mostlikely scenario is that the stars are bound and were accelerated by a singleencounter between a binary of main-sequence stars and a ~ 10 m_sun black hole.

1211.5376	measuring dark matter profiles non-parametrically in dwarf spheroidals:  an application to draco	we introduce a novel implementation of orbit-based (or schwarzschild)modeling that allows dark matter density profiles to be calculatednon-parametrically in nearby galaxies. our models require no assumptions to bemade about velocity anisotropy or the dark matter profile. the technique can beapplied to any dispersion-supported stellar system, and we demonstrate its useby studying the local group dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy draco. we useexisting kinematic data at larger radii and also present 12 new radialvelocities within the central 13 pc obtained with the virus-w integral fieldspectrograph on the 2.7m telescope at mcdonald observatory. our non-parametricschwarzschild models find strong evidence that the dark matter profile in dracois cuspy for 20 &lt; r &lt; 700 pc. the profile for r &gt; 20 pc is well-fit by a powerlaw with slope \alpha=-1.0 +/- 0.2, consistent with predictions from cold darkmatter (cdm) simulations. our models confirm that, despite its low baryoncontent relative to other dsphs, draco lives in a massive halo.

1211.6429	an over-massive black hole in the compact lenticular galaxy ngc1277	all massive galaxies likely have supermassive black holes at their centers,and the masses of the black holes are known to correlate with properties of thehost galaxy bulge component. several explanations have been proposed for theexistence of these locally-established empirical relationships; they includethe non-causal, statistical process of galaxy-galaxy merging, direct feedbackbetween the black hole and its host galaxy, or galaxy-galaxy merging and thesubsequent violent relaxation and dissipation. the empirical scaling relationsare thus important for distinguishing between various theoretical models ofgalaxy evolution, and they further form the basis for all black hole massmeasurements at large distances. in particular, observations have shown thatthe mass of the black hole is typically 0.1% of the stellar bulge mass of thegalaxy. the small galaxy ngc4486b currently has the largest published fractionof its mass in a black hole at 11%. here we report observations of the stellarkinematics of ngc 1277, which is a compact, disky galaxy with a mass of 1.2 x10^11 msun. from the data, we determine that the mass of the central black holeis 1.7 x 10^10 msun, or 59% its bulge mass. five other compact galaxies haveproperties similar to ngc 1277 and therefore may also contain over-sized blackholes. it is not yet known if these galaxies represent a tail of adistribution, or if disk-dominated galaxies fail to follow the normal blackhole mass scaling relations.

1212.4152	the virus-p exploration of nearby galaxies (venga): the xco gradient in  ngc 628	we measure the radial profile of the 12co(1-0) to h_2 conversion factor (xco)in ngc 628. the h\alpha emission from the venga integral field spectroscopy isused to map the star formation rate surface density (\sigma_{sfr}). we estimatethe molecular gas surface density (\sigma_{h2}) from \sigma_{sfr} by invertingthe molecular star formation law (sfl), and compare it to the co intensity tomeasure xco. we study the impact of systematic uncertainties by changing theslope of the sfl, using different sfr tracers (h\alpha vs. far-uv plus 24\mum), and co maps from different telescopes (single-dish and interferometers).the observed xco profile is robust against these systematics, drops by a factorof 2 from r~7 kpc to the center of the galaxy, and is well fit by a gradient\delta log(xco)=0.06\pm0.02 dex kpc^-1. we study how changes in xco followchanges in metallicity, gas density, and ionization parameter. theoreticalmodels show that the gradient in xco can be explained by a combination ofdecreasing metallicity, and decreasing \sigma_{h2} with radius. photoelectricheating from the local uv radiation field appears to contribute to the decreaseof xco in higher density regions. our results show that galactic environmentplays an important role at setting the physical conditions in star formingregions, in particular the chemistry of carbon in molecular complexes, and theradiative transfer of co emission. we caution against adopting a single xcovalue when large changes in gas surface density or metallicity are present.

1303.4393	the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio on black  hole mass measurements	we have tested the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio(y) on measurements of black hole masses (mbh) derived from stellar orbitsuperposition models. such models construct a static gravitational potentialfor a galaxy and its central black hole, but typically assume spatially uniformy. we have modeled three giant elliptical galaxies with gradients alpha = d(logy)/d(log r) from -0.2 to +0.1. color and line strength gradients suggest mildlynegative alpha in these galaxies. introducing a negative (positive) gradient iny increases (decreases) the enclosed stellar mass near the center of the galaxyand leads to systematically smaller (larger) mbh measurements. for models withalpha = -0.2, the best-fit values of mbh are 28%, 27%, and 17% lower than theconstant-y case, in ngc 3842, ngc 6086, and ngc 7768, respectively. for alpha =+0.1, mbh are 14%, 22%, and 17% higher than the constant-y case for the threerespective galaxies. for ngc 3842 and ngc 6086, this bias is comparable to thestatistical errors from individual modeling trials. at larger radii, negative(positive) gradients in y cause the total stellar mass to decrease (increase)and the dark matter fraction within one effective radius to increase(decrease).

1304.7156	the m_bh - sigma relation for intermediate-mass black holes in globular  clusters	for galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (smbhs), it has been observedthat the mass of the central black hole (m_bh) tightly correlates with theeffective or central velocity dispersion (sigma) of the host galaxy. the originof this m_bh - sigma scaling relation is assumed to lie in the merging historyof the galaxies but many open questions about its origin and the behavior indifferent mass ranges still need to be addressed. the goal of this work is tostudy the black-hole scaling relations for low black-hole masses, where theregime of intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) in globular clusters (gcs) isentered. we collect all existing reports of dynamical black-hole measurementsin globular clusters, providing black-hole masses or upper limits for 14candidates. we plot the black-hole masses versus different cluster parametersincluding total mass, velocity dispersion, concentration and half-mass radius.we search for trends and test the correlations in order to quantify theirsignificance using a set of different statistical approaches. for correlationsshowing a large significance we perform a linear fit, accounting foruncertainties and upper limits. we find a clear correlation between the mass ofthe imbh and the velocity dispersion of the globular cluster. as expected, thetotal mass of the globular cluster then also correlates with the mass of theimbh. while the slope of the m_bh - sigma correlation differs strongly from theone observed for smbhs, the other scaling relations m_bh - m_tot, and m_bh - lare similar to the correlations in galaxies. significant correlations ofblack-hole mass with other cluster properties were not found in the presentsample.

1306.4157	galaxy redshift surveys with sparse sampling	survey observations of the three-dimensional locations of galaxies are apowerful approach to measure the distribution of matter in the universe, whichcan be used to learn about the nature of dark energy, physics of inflation,neutrino masses, etc. a competitive survey, however, requires a large volume(e.g., vsurvey is roughly 10 gpc3) to be covered, and thus tends to beexpensive. a "sparse sampling" method offers a more affordable solution to thisproblem: within a survey footprint covering a given survey volume, vsurvey, weobserve only a fraction of the volume. the distribution of observed regionsshould be chosen such that their separation is smaller than the length scalecorresponding to the wavenumber of interest. then one can recover the powerspectrum of galaxies with precision expected for a survey covering a volume ofvsurvey (rather than the volume of the sum of observed regions) with the numberdensity of galaxies given by the total number of observed galaxies divided byvsurvey (rather than the number density of galaxies within an observed region).we find that regularly-spaced sampling yields an unbiased power spectrum withno window function effect, and deviations from regularly-spaced sampling, whichare unavoidable in realistic surveys, introduce calculable window functioneffects and increase the uncertainties of the recovered power spectrum. whilewe discuss the sparse sampling method within the context of the forthcominghobby-eberly telescope dark energy experiment, the method is general and can beapplied to other galaxy surveys.

0801.2782	gemini and hubble space telescope evidence for an intermediate mass  black hole in omega centauri	the globular cluster omega centauri is one of the largest and most massivemembers of the galactic system. however, its classification as a globularcluster has been challenged making it a candidate for being the stripped coreof an accreted dwarf galaxy; this together with the fact that it has one of thelargest velocity dispersions for star clusters in our galaxy makes it aninteresting candidate for harboring an intermediate mass black hole. we measurethe surface brightness profile from integrated light on an hst}/acs image ofthe center, and find a central power-law cusp of logarithmic slope -0.08. wealso analyze gemini gmos-ifu kinematic data for a 5x5 arcsec field centered onthe nucleus of the cluster, as well as for a field 14 arcsecaway. we detect aclear rise in the velocity dispersion from 18.6 km/s at 14 arcsec to 23 km/s inthe center. a rise in the velocity dispersion could be due to a central blackhole, a central concentration of stellar remnants, or a central orbitalstructure that is radially biased. we discuss each of these possibilities. anisotropic, spherical dynamical model implies a black hole mass of4.0^{+0.75}_{-1.0} times 10^4 m_sun, and excludes the no black hole case atgreater than 99% significance. we have also run flattened, orbit-based modelsand find similar results. while our preferred model is the existence of acentral black hole, detailed numerical simulations are required to confidentlyrule out the other possibilities.

1308.1957	the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha emission of three lyman-alpha  selected field galaxies at z~2.4 from the hetdex pilot survey	we present new results on the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha (lya) emissionof three lya emitting field galaxies at z~2.4 with high lya equivalent width(&gt;100 angstroms) and lya luminosity (~10^43 erg/s). at 120 km/s (fwhm) spectralresolution, the prominent double-peaked lya profile straddles the systemicvelocity, where the velocity zero-point is determined from spectroscopy of thegalaxies' rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. the average velocityoffset from systemic of the stronger redshifted emission component for oursample is 176 km/s while the average total separation between the redshiftedand main blueshifted emission components is 380 km/s. these measurements are afactor of ~2 smaller than for uv continuum-selected galaxies that show lya inemission with lower lya equivalent width. we compare our lya spectra to thepredicted line profiles of a spherical "expanding shell" lya radiative transfergrid that models large-scale galaxy outflows. specifically blueward of thesystemic velocity where two galaxies show a weak, highly blueshifted (by ~1000km/s) tertiary emission peak, the model line profiles are a relatively poorrepresentation of the observed spectra. since the neutral gas column densityhas a dominant influence over the shape of the lya line profile, we cautionagainst equating the observed lya velocity offset with a physical outflowvelocity, especially at lower spectral resolution where the unresolved lyavelocity offset is a convoluted function of several degenerate parameters.referring to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical hubble space telescope imaging,we find that galaxy-galaxy interactions may play an important role in inducinga starburst that results in copious lya emission, as well as perturbing the gasdistribution and velocity field which have strong influence over the lyaemission line profile.

1312.4747	discovery of a large number of candidate proto-clusters traced by ~15  mpc-scale galaxy overdensities in cosmos	to demonstrate the feasibility of studying the epoch of massive galaxycluster formation in a more systematic manner using current and future galaxysurveys, we report the discovery of a large sample of proto-cluster candidatesin the 1.62 deg^2 cosmos/ultravista field traced by optical/ir selectedgalaxies using photometric redshifts. by comparing properly smoothed 3d galaxydensity maps of the observations and a set of matched simulations incorporatingthe dominant observational effects (galaxy selection and photometric redshiftuncertainties), we first confirm that the observed ~15 comoving mpc scalegalaxy clustering is consistent with lcdm models. using further the relationbetween high-z overdensity and the present day cluster mass calibrated in thesematched simulations, we found 36 candidate structures at 1.6&lt;z&lt;3.1, showingoverdensities consistent with the progenitors of m_z=0 ~10^15 m_sun clusters.taking into account the significant upward scattering of lower mass structures,the probabilities for the candidates to have at least m_z=0 ~10^14 m_sun are~70%. for each structure, about 15%-40% of photometric galaxy candidates areexpected to be true proto-cluster members that will merge into a cluster-scalehalo by z=0. with solely photometric redshifts, we successfully rediscover twospectroscopically confirmed structures in this field, suggesting that ouralgorithm is robust. this work generates a large sample of uniformly-selectedproto-cluster candidates, providing rich targets for spectroscopic follow-upand subsequent studies of cluster formation. meanwhile, it demonstrates thepotential for probing early cluster formation with upcoming redshift surveyssuch as the hobby-eberly telescope dark energy experiment and the subaru primefocus spectrograph survey.

1312.4799	the black hole mass and the stellar ring in ngc 3706	we determine the mass of the nuclear black hole ($m$) in ngc 3706, an earlytype galaxy with a central surface brightness minimum arising from an apparentstellar ring, which is misaligned with respect to the galaxy's major axis atlarger radii. we fit new hst/stis and archival data with axisymmetric orbitmodels to determine $m$, mass-to-light ratio ($\upsilon_v$), and dark matterhalo profile. the best-fit model parameters with 1$\sigma$ uncertainties are $m= (6.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}) \times 10^8\ m_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}$ and$\upsilon_v = 6.0 \pm 0.2\ m_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}\ l_{{\scriptscriptstyle\odot},v}^{-1}$ at an assumed distance of 46 mpc. the models are inconsistentwith no black hole at a significance of $\delta\chi^2 = 15.4$ and require adark matter halo to adequately fit the kinematic data, but the fits areconsistent with a large range of plausible dark matter halo parameters. thering is inconsistent with a population of co-rotating stars on circular orbits,which would produce a narrow line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd).instead, the ring's losvd has a small value of $|v|/\sigma$, the ratio of meanvelocity to velocity dispersion. based on the observed low $|v|/\sigma$, ourorbit modeling, and a kinematic decomposition of the ring from the bulge, weconclude that the stellar ring contains stars that orbit in both directions. weconsider potential origins for this unique feature, including multiple tidaldisruptions of stellar clusters, a change in the gravitational potential fromtriaxial to axisymmetric, resonant capture and inclining of orbits by a binaryblack hole, and multiple mergers leading to gas being funneled to the center ofthe galaxy.

1403.1581	the rising stellar velocity dispersion of m87 from integrated starlight	we have measured the line-of-sight velocity distribution from integratedstellar light at two points in the outer halo of m87 (ngc 4486), thesecond-rank galaxy in the virgo cluster. the data were taken at r = 480" ($\sim41.5$ kpc) and r = 526" ($\sim 45.5$ kpc) along the se major axis. the secondmoment for a non-parametric estimate of the full velocity distribution is $420\pm 23$ km/s and $577 \pm 35$ km/s respectively. there is intriguing evidencein the velocity profiles for two kinematically distinct stellar components atthe position of our pointing. under this assumption we employ a two-gaussiandecomposition and find the primary gaussian having rest velocities equal to m87(consistent with zero rotation) and second moments of $383 \pm 32$ km/s and$446 \pm 43$ km/s respectively. the asymmetry seen in the velocity profilessuggests that the stellar halo of m87 is not in a relaxed state and confuses aclean dynamical interpretation. that said, either measurement (full or twocomponent model) shows a rising velocity dispersion at large radii, consistentwith previous integrated light measurements, yet significantly higher thanglobular cluster measurements at comparable radial positions. these integratedlight measurements at large radii, and the stark contrast they make to themeasurements of other kinematic tracers, highlight the rich kinematiccomplexity of environments like the center of the virgo cluster and the needfor caution when interpreting kinematic measurements from various dynamicaltracers.

1403.7227	beyond the brim of the hat: kinematics of globular clusters out to large  radius in the sombrero galaxy	we have obtained radial velocity measurements for 51 new globular clustersaround the sombrero galaxy. these measurements were obtained usingspectroscopic observations from the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope and the hydra spectrograph at wiyn. combined withour own past measurements and velocity measurements obtained from theliterature we have constructed a large database of radial velocities thatcontains a total of 360 confirmed globular clusters. previous studies' analysesof the kinematics and mass profile of the sombrero globular cluster system havebeen constrained to the inner ~9' (~24 kpc or ~5 effective radii), but our newmeasurements have increased the radial coverage of the data, allowing us todetermine the kinematic properties of m104 out to ~15' (~41 kpc or ~9 effectiveradii). we use our set of radial velocities to study the gc system kinematicsand to determine the mass profile and v-band mass-to-light profile of thegalaxy. we find that the v-band mass-to-light ratio increases from 4.5 at thecenter to a value of 20.9 at 41 kpc (~9 effective radii or 15'), which impliesthat the dark matter halo extends to the edge of our available data set. wecompare our mass profile at 20 kpc (~4 effective radii or ~7.4') to the masscomputed from x-ray data and find good agreement. we also use our data to lookfor rotation in the globular cluster system as a whole, as well as in the redand blue subpopulations. we find no evidence for significant rotation in any ofthese samples.

1405.4854	dwarf galaxy dark matter density profiles inferred from stellar and gas  kinematics	we present new constraints on the density profiles of dark matter (dm) halosin seven nearby dwarf galaxies from measurements of their integrated stellarlight and gas kinematics. the gas kinematics of low mass galaxies frequentlysuggest that they contain constant density dm cores, while n-body simulationsinstead predict a cuspy profile. we present a data set of high resolutionintegral field spectroscopy on seven galaxies and measure the stellar and gaskinematics simultaneously. using jeans modeling on our full sample, we examinewhether gas kinematics in general produce shallower density profiles than arederived from the stars. although 2/7 galaxies show some localized differencesin their rotation curves between the two tracers, estimates of the centrallogarithmic slope of the dm density profile, gamma, are generally robust. themean and standard deviation of the logarithmic slope for the population aregamma=0.67+/-0.10 when measured in the stars and gamma=0.58+/-0.24 whenmeasured in the gas. we also find that the halos are not under concentrated atthe radii of half their maximum velocities. finally, we search for correlationsof the dm density profile with stellar velocity anisotropy and other baryonicproperties. two popular mechanisms to explain cored dm halos are an exotic dmcomponent or feedback models that strongly couple the energy of supernovae intorepeatedly driving out gas and dynamically heating the dm halos. we investigatecorrelations that may eventually be used to test models. we do not find asecondary parameter that strongly correlates with the central dm density slope,but we do find some weak correlations. determining the importance of thesecorrelations will require further model developments and larger observationalsamples.

1501.07441	intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters: observations and  simulations	the study of intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) is a young and promisingfield of research. formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in young anddense stellar clusters, intermediate-mass black holes could still be present inthe centers of globular clusters, today. our group investigated the presence ofintermediate-mass black holes for a sample of 10 galactic globular clusters. wemeasured the inner kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy anddetermined masses or upper limits of central black holes in each cluster. incombination with literature data we further studied the positions of ourresults on known black-hole scaling relations (such as m_bh - sigma) and founda similar but flatter correlation for imbhs. applying cluster evolution codes,the change in the slope could be explained with the stellar mass loss occurringin clusters in a tidal field over its life time. furthermore, we presentresults from several numerical simulations on the topic of imbhs and integralfield units (ifus). we ran n-body simulations of globular clusters containingimbhs in a tidal field and studied their effects on mass-loss rates and remnantfractions and showed that an imbh in the center prevents core collapse andejects massive objects more rapidly. these simulations were further used tosimulate ifu data cubes. for the specific case of ngc 6388 we simulated twodifferent ifu techniques and found that velocity dispersion measurements fromindividual velocities are strongly biased towards lower values due to blends ofneighbouring stars and background light. in addition, we use the astrophysicalmultipurpose software environment (amuse) to combine gravitational physics,stellar evolution and hydrodynamics to simulate the accretion of stellar windsonto a black hole.

1507.02813	a re-evaluation of the central velocity-dispersion profile in ngc 6388	recently, two independent groups found very different results when measuringthe central velocity dispersion of the galactic globular cluster ngc 6388 withdifferent methods. while l\"utzgendorf et al. (2011) found a rising profile anda high central velocity dispersion (23.3 km/s), measurements obtained bylanzoni et al. (2013) showed a value 40% lower. the value of the centralvelocity dispersion has a serious impact on the mass and possible presence ofan intermediate-mass black hole at the center of ngc 6388. we use a photometriccatalog of ngc 6388 to create a simulated sinfoni and argus dataset. theconstruction of the ifu data cube is done with different observing conditionsreproducing the conditions reported for the original observations as closely aspossible. in addition, we produce an n-body realization of a 10^6 m_sun stellarcluster with the same photometric properties as ngc 6388 to account forunresolved stars. we find that the individual radial velocities, i.e. themeasurements from the simulated sinfoni data, are systematically biased towardslower velocity dispersions. the reason is that due to the wings in the pointspread function the velocities get biased towards the mean cluster velocity.this study shows that even with ao supported observations, individual radialvelocities in crowded fields are likely to be biased. the argus observations donot show this kind of bias but were found to have larger uncertainties thanpreviously obtained. we find a bias towards higher velocity dispersions in theargus pointing when fixing the extreme velocities of the three brightest starsbut find those variations are within the determined uncertainties. we rerunjeans models and fit the kinematic profile with the new uncertainties. thisyields a bh mass of m_bh = (2.8 +- 0.4) x 10^4 m_sun and m/l ratio m/l = (1.6+- 0.1) m_sun/l_sun, consistent with our previous results.

astro-ph;0104433	the spatial distribution and kinematics of stellar populations in e+a  galaxies	we use long-slit spectroscopic observations of the sample of e+a galaxiesdescribed by zabludoff et al. to constrain the nature of the progenitors andremnants of the e+a phase of galaxy evolution. we measure spatially-resolvedkinematic properties of the young (&lt;~1 gyr) and old (&gt; few gyr) stellarpopulations. the young stellar populations are more centrally concentrated thanthe older populations, but they are not confined to the galaxy core (radius &lt;~1 kpc). the kinematics of the old stellar population place 16 of 20 of our e+ason a trend parallel to the faber-jackson relation that is offset by $\sim$ 0.6mag in r. eighteen of 20 e+as have v/sigma &lt; 1. as the young stars in thesesystems evolve, the luminosity offset will disappear and the remnants will bepressure-supported systems that lie on the faber-jackson relation. althoughzabludoff et al. spectroscopically selected the most extreme e+a galaxies inthe local volume, the sample is kinematically diverse: velocity dispersionsrange from &lt;~ 30 km/s to ~ 200 km/s over a luminosity range of m_r = -19 to -22+ 5 log h. combining these results with an estimate of the number of galaxiesthat experience an e+a phase, we conclude that the e+a phase of galaxyevolution is important in the development of a large fraction ofspheroid-dominated galaxies over a wide range of luminosities and masses. ourkinematic observations, together with evidence that e+as have recently evolvedfrom a vigorous star forming phase to a quiescent phase (e.g. couch andsharples, caldwell et al.) and that many have tidal features consistent withdisk-like progenitors (zabludoff et al.), indicate that these galaxies areundergoing a transformation from star-forming, disk-dominated galaxies intoquiescent, spheroid-dominated galaxies.

astro-ph;0105230	supermassive black holes in nuclei of galaxies	we review the motivation and search for supermassive black holes (bhs) ingalaxies. energetic nuclear activity provides indirect but compelling evidencefor bh engines. ground-based dynamical searches for central dark objects arereviewed in kormendy &amp; richstone (1995, ara&amp;a, 33, 581). here we provide anupdate of results from the hst. as of 2001 march, dynamical bh detections areavailable for at least 37 galaxies. the demographics of these objects lead tothe following conclusions: (1) bh mass correlates with the luminosity of thebulge component of the host galaxy. the median bh mass fraction is 0.13% of themass of the bulge. (2) bh mass correlates with the mean velocity dispersion ofthe bulge inside its effective radius. for the best mass determinations, thescatter is consistent with the measurement errors. (3) bh mass correlates withthe luminosity of the high-density central component in disk galaxiesindependent of whether this is a real bulge (a mini-elliptical, believed toform via a merger-induced dissipative collapse and starburst) or a``pseudobulge'' (believed to form by inward transport of disk material). (4) bhmass does not correlate with the luminosity of galaxy disks. if pure diskscontain bhs, then their masses are much smaller than 0.13% of the mass of thedisk. we conclude that present observations show no dependence of bh mass onthe details of whether bh feeding happens rapidly during a collapse or slowlyvia secular evolution of the disk. the above results increasingly support thehypothesis that the major events that form a bulge or elliptical galaxy and themain growth phases of its bh -- when it shone like a quasar -- were the sameevents.

astro-ph;0105389	are there blue, massive e/s0s at z &lt; 1 ?: kinematics of blue spheroidal  galaxy candidates	several recent studies find that 10 - 50% of morphologically selected fieldearly-type galaxies at redshifts z &lt;= 1 have blue colors indicative of recentstar formation. such ``blue spheroids''might be massive early-type galaxieswith active star formation, perhaps induced by recent merger events.  alternatively, they could be starbursting, low-mass spheroids. to distinguishbetween these two choices, we have selected 10 ``blue spheroid candidates''  (hereafter, bscs) from a quantitatively selected e/s0 sample and studiedtheir properties, including kinematics from keck spectra obtained as part ofthe deep groth strip survey (gss). most bscs (70%) turn out to belong to twobroad categories, while the remaining objects are likely to be misclassifiedobjects. type-1 bscs have underlying red stellar components with bluer innercomponents. type-2 bscs do not show an obvious sign of the underlying redstellar component, and their overall colors are quite blue ((u-b)_rest &lt; 0).  both type-1 and type-2 bscs have internal velocity dispersions measured fromemission lines sigma &lt; 80$ km/sec and estimated dynamical masses of only a fewtimes 10^10 m_sun or less. for type-1 bscs, we estimate sigma of the redcomponent using the fundamental plane relation of distant field absorption-linegalaxies and find that these sigma estimates are similar to the sigma measuredfrom emission lines. overall, we conclude that our type-1 and type-2 bscs aremore likely to be star-forming low mass spheroids than star-forming, massive,early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0203468	the slope of the black-hole mass versus velocity dispersion correlation	observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the massof the central dark object m and the velocity dispersion sigma of the hostgalaxy, of the form log(m/m_sun) = a + b*log(sigma/sigma_0); however, publishedestimates of the slope b span a wide range (3.75 to 5.3). merritt &amp; ferraresehave argued that low slopes (&lt;4) arise because of neglect of random measurementerrors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of themilky way galaxy. we show that these explanations account for at most a smallpart of the slope range. instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because ofsystematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups forthe same galaxies. the origin of these differences remains unclear, but wesuggest that one significant component of the difference results from ferrarese&amp; merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r_e/8 (r_e is theeffective radius) using an empirical formula. another component may arise fromdispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. a new determinationof the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, forsigma_0=200 km/s. the m-sigma relation has an intrinsic dispersion in log mthat is no larger than 0.3 dex. in an appendix, we present a simple model forthe velocity-dispersion profile of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0209314	hubble space telescope evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole in  the globular cluster m15: i. stis spectroscopy and wfpc2 photometry	in this series of two papers we describe a project with stis on hst tomeasure the line-of-sight velocities of stars in the central few arcsec of thedense globular cluster m15. this first paper focuses on the observations andreduction of the data. we `scanned' the central region of m15 spectroscopicallyby consecutively placing an 0.1 arcsec slit at 18 adjacent positions. carefuland complicated data reduction and analysis were required. the spectral pixelsize exceeds the velocity dispersion of m15, which puts the project at thelimit of what is feasible with stis. we applied corrections for the followingeffects: drifts in the stis wavelength scale during an hst orbit; the orbitalvelocity component of hst along the line-of-sight to the cluster, and itsvariations during the hst orbit; and the apparent wavelength shift that isperceived for a star that is not centered in the slit. to make thesecorrections we present a detailed study of the hst/stis point-spread functionand line-spread function. we also present a catalog with positions and u, b andv magnitudes of 31,983 stars in m15, created from existing hst/wfpc2 data. weextract 19,200 one-dimensional spectra from the stis data, each for a differentposition in m15, and each with a velocity scale accurate to better than 2.5km/s. we develop an algorithm that co-adds the spectra for individual aperturesand use it to extract spectra of individual stars with minimum blending andmaximum s/n. in paper ii we use these spectra to extract the line-of-sightvelocities of individual stars. the velocities constrain the central structure,dynamics and mass distribution of the cluster, and provide evidence for theexistence of an intermediate-mass black hole in the center of thecluster.[abridged]

astro-ph;0209315	hubble space telescope evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole in  the globular cluster m15: ii. kinematical analysis and dynamical modeling	we analyze hst/stis spectra (see paper i) of the central region of the denseglobular cluster m15. we infer the velocities of 64 individual stars,two-thirds of which have their velocity measured for the first time. thistriples the number of stars with measured velocities in the central 1 arcsec ofm15 and doubles the number in the central 2 arcsec. combined with existingground-based data we obtain the radial profiles of the projected kinematicalquantities. the rms velocity sigma_rms rises to 14 km/s in the central fewarcsec, somewhat higher than the values of 10-12 km/s inferred previously fromground-based data. to interpret the results we construct dynamical models basedon the jeans equation, which imply that m15 must have a central concentrationof non-luminous material. if this is due to a single black hole, then its massis m_bh = (3.9 +/- 2.2) x 10^3 solar masses. this is consistent with therelation between m_bh and sigma_rms that has been established for galaxies.also, the existence of intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters isconsistent with several scenarios for globular cluster evolution proposed inthe literature. therefore, these results may have important implications forour understanding of the evolution of globular clusters, the growth of blackholes, the connection between globular cluster and galaxy formation, and thenature of the recently discovered `ultra-luminous' x-ray sources in nearbygalaxies. instead of a single black hole, m15 could have a centralconcentration of dark remnants (e.g., neutron stars) due to mass segregation.however, the best-fitting fokker-planck models that have previously beenconstructed for m15 do not predict a central mass concentration that issufficient to explain the observed kinematics.[abridged]

astro-ph;0209483	axisymmetric dynamical models of the central regions of galaxies	we present axisymmetric, orbit superposition models for 12 galaxies usingdata taken with the hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-basedobservatories. in each galaxy, we detect a central black hole (bh) and measureits mass to accuracies ranging from 10% to 70%. we demonstrate that in mostcases the bh detection requires both the hst and ground-based data. using theground-based data alone does provide an unbiased measure of the bh mass(provided they are fit with fully general models), but at a greatly reducedsignificance. the most significant correlation with host galaxy properties isthe relation between the bh mass and the velocity dispersion of the hostgalaxy; we find no other equally strong correlation, and no second parameterthat improves the quality of the mass-dispersion relation. we are also able tomeasure the stellar orbital properties from these general models. the mostmassive galaxies are strongly biased to tangential orbits near the bh,consistent with binary bh models, while lower-mass galaxies have a range ofanisotropies, consistent with an adiabatic growth of the bh.

astro-ph;0210158	addendum: "hubble space telescope evidence for an intermediate-mass  black hole in the globular cluster m15: ii. kinematical analysis and  dynamical modeling"	it has been reported that there is an error in the figure in dull et al.(1997, d97) that shows the radial m/l profile in fokker-planck models of m15.we discuss how this modifies the interpretation of our kinematical data. theseimply the existence of a dark and compact mass component near the center ofm15, either a single black hole (bh) or a collection of dark remnants that havesunk to the cluster center due to mass segregation. we previously showed thatthe latter interpretation is in conflict with the d97 m/l profile, whichsupported the bh interpretation. we repeat our analysis here with the correctedd97 profile. models without a bh are now found to be statistically acceptable(within 1-sigma), although inclusion of a bh still provides a marginally betterfit. it does not necessarily follow that dark remnants are now the preferredinterpretation of the data. the d97 models, as well as n-body models bybaumgardt et al. (2002), assume that all neutron stars are retained duringcluster evolution. this conflicts with predictions of the neutron-starretention rate (typically below 10 per cent) based on pulsar kick velocities.the presence of a single bh therefore continues to be a viable interpretationof the data. the best fit bh mass with the corrected d97 m/l profile is m_bh =1.7^{+2.7}_{-1.7} x 10^3 solar masses, and with a constant m/l it is m_bh =3.2^{+2.2}_{-2.2} x 10^3 solar masses. a model that includes both neutron starescape and mass segregation would probably yield a value between these numbers.this agrees with the correlation between velocity dispersion and bh massinferred for galaxies. however, with the presently available models and data itis neither uniquely implied nor ruled out that m15 has an intermediate-mass bh.

astro-ph;0303590	dust and the infrared kinematic properties of early-type galaxies	we have obtained spectra and measured the stellar kinematics in a sample of25 nearby early-type galaxies (with velocity dispersions from less than 100km/s to over 300 km/s) using the near-infrared co absorption bandhead at 2.29microns. our median uncertainty for the dispersions is ~10%. we examine theeffects of dust on existing optical kinematic measurements. we find that thenear-infrared velocity dispersions are in general smaller than optical velocitydispersions, with differences as large as 30%. the median difference is 11%smaller, and the effect is of greater magnitude for higher dispersion galaxies.the lenticular galaxies (18 out of 25) appear to be causing the shift to lowerdispersions while the classical ellipticals (7 out of 25) are consistentbetween the two wavelength regimes. if uniformly distributed dust causes thesedifferences, we would expect to find a correlation between the relative amountof dust in a galaxy and the fractional change in dispersion, but we do not findsuch a correlation. we do see correlations both between velocity dispersion andco bandhead equivalent width, and velocity dispersion and mg2 index. thedifferences in dispersion are not well explained by current models of dustabsorption. the lack of correlation between the relative amount of dust andshift in dispersion possibly suggets that dust does not have a similardistribution from galaxy to galaxy. the co equivalent widths of these galaxiesare quite high (&gt;10 angstroms for almost all), requiring the light at thesewavelengths to be dominated by very cool stars.

astro-ph;0307242	the deep groth strip survey ix: evolution of the fundamental plane of  field galaxies	fundamental plane studies provide an excellent means of understanding theevolutionary history of early-type galaxies. using the low resolution imagingspectrograph on the keck telescope, we obtained internal stellar kinematicinformation for 36 field galaxies in the groth strip--21 early-type and 15 diskgalaxies. their redshifts range from 0.3--1.0, with a median redshift 0.8. theslope of the relation shows no difference compared with the local slope.however, there is significant evolution in the zero-point offset; an offset dueto evolution in magnitude requires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening atz=1. we see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction, which is agood surrogate for galaxy type. correcting for the luminosity evolution reducesthe orthogonal scatter in the fundamental plane to 8%, consistent with thelocal scatter. this scatter is measured for our sample, and does not includeresults from other studies which may have different selection effects. thedifference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and publishedcluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch--around z=1.5 for fieldgalaxies compared to z&gt;2.0 for cluster galaxies. the magnitude differenceimplies that the field early-type galaxies are about 2 gyr younger than thecluster ellipticals using standard single-burst models. however, the samemodels imply a significant change in the rest-frame u-b color from then topresent, which is not seen in our sample. continuous low-level star formation,however, would serve to explain the constant colors over this large magnitudechange. a consistent model has 7% of the stellar mass created after the initialburst, using an exponentially decaying star formation rate with an e-foldingtime of 5 gyr.

astro-ph;0403257	black hole mass determinations from orbit superposition models are  reliable	we show that orbit-superposition dynamical models (schwarzschild's method)provide reliable estimates of nuclear black hole masses and errors whenconstructed from adequate orbit libraries and kinematic data. we thus rebut tworecent papers that argue that bh masses obtained from this method areunreliable. these papers claim to demonstrate that the range of allowable bhmasses derived from a given dataset is artificially too narrow as a result ofan inadequate number of orbits in the library used to construct dynamicalmodels. this is an elementary error that is easily avoided. we describe amethod to estimate the number and nature of orbits needed for the library. weprovide an example that shows that this prescription is adequate, in the sensethat the range of allowable bh masses is not artificially narrowed by use oftoo few orbits. a second point raised by critics is that kinematic data aregenerally obtained with insufficient spatial resolution to obtain a reliablemass. we make the distinction between unreliable determinations and impreciseones. we show that there are several different properties of a kinematicdataset that can lead to imprecise bh determinations, but none of theattributes we have investigated leads to an unreliable determination. in short,the degree to which the bh radius of influence is resolved by spectroscopicobservations is already reflected in the bh-mass error envelope, and is not ahidden source of error. the bh masses published by our group and the leidengroup are reliable.

astro-ph;0407383	the relationship between black hole mass and velocity dispersion in  seyfert 1 galaxies	black hole masses in active galactic nuclei (agn) are difficult to measureusing conventional dynamical methods, but can be determined using the techniqueof reverberation mapping. however, it is important to verify that the resultsof these different methods are equivalent. this can be done indirectly, usingscaling relations between the black hole and the host galaxy spheroid. for thispurpose, we have obtained new measurements of the bulge stellar velocitydispersion, sigma, in seyfert 1 galaxies. these are used in conjunction withthe m_bh -- sigma relation to validate nuclear black hole masses, m_bh, inactive galaxies determined through reverberation mapping. we find that seyfertgalaxies follow the same m_bh -- sigma relation as non-active galaxies,indicating that reverberation mapping measurements of m_bh are consistent withthose obtained using other methods. we also reconsider the relationship betweenbulge absolute magnitude, m_bulge, and black hole mass. we find that seyfertgalaxies are offset from non-active galaxies, but that the deviation can beentirely understood as a difference in bulge luminosity, not black hole mass;seyfert hosts are brighter than normal galaxies for a given value of theirvelocity dispersion, perhaps as a result of younger stellar populations.

astro-ph;0501446	gemini near infrared spectrograph observations of the central  supermassive black hole in centaurus a	the infrared spectrograph gnirs on gemini south unlocks new possibilities tostudy the central black holes in dusty galaxies that have been inaccessible toprevious black hole studies. we exploit good near-infrared seeing to measurethe central black hole (bh) of centaurus a (ngc 5128). we measure the stellarkinematics of ngc 5128 using the region around the co bandheads at 2.3 micronsand determine the black hole mass using orbit-based models. black holes arebelieved to be essential components of galaxies, and their evolutionary statesappear to be closely linked to those of their hosts. our current knowledge doesnot go much beyond this; galaxies such as ngc 5128 (an agn and recent merger)can further develop this knowledge. however, ngc 5128 and galaxies like itcontain large amounts of dust which hamper optical spectroscopy, makingnear-infrared measurements an attractive alternative. we find a bh mass of2.4e8 solar masses for an edge-on model, 1.8e8 solar masses for a model withinclination of 45 degrees, and 1.5e8 solar masses for a model with inclinationof 20 degrees. we adopt the value for the edge-on model, which hassignificantly lower chi^2. these estimates are consistent with a previous gasdynamical estimate and are five to ten times higher than that predicted by thecorrelation between bh mass and velocity dispersion. if ngc 5128 willeventually follow the trend for quiescent galaxies, this result suggests thatits bh assembled first before its host component. ngc 5128 thus provides animportant example for our knowledge of central black holes; this technique canbe applied to other such galaxies to further explore this question.

astro-ph;0606739	the masses of nuclear black holes in luminous elliptical galaxies and  implications for the space density of the most massive black holes	black hole masses predicted from the mbh-sigma relationship conflict withthose predicted from the mbh-l relationship for the most luminous galaxies,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). this is because stellar velocitydispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with l for bcgs and other giantellipticals. the mbh-l relationship predicts that the most luminous bcgs mayhave mbh approaching 10^{10}m_sol, while the m-sigma relationship alwayspredicts mbh&lt;3x10^9m_sol. we argue that the mbh-l relationship is a plausibleor even preferred description for bcgs and other galaxies of similarluminosity. if cores in central stellar density are formed by binary bhs, thenthe inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of mbh.using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxiesobserved by hst, we argue that l is superior to sigma as an indicator ofr_gamma in luminous galaxies. the observed r_gamma-mbh relationship for 11 coregalaxies with measured mbh appears to be consistent with the mbh-l relationshipfor bcgs. bcgs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities thatmay be difficult to generate with the modest bh masses inferred from thembh-sigma relationship. mbh~l may be expected to hold for bcgs, if they wereformed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of bh to stellarmass. this picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigmawith l and the more rapid increase in effective radii with l seen in bcgs. ifbcgs have large bhs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local bhmass function for mbh&gt;3x10^9m_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richerthan that inferred from the mbh-sigma relationship. the volume density of qsosat earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the mbh-l relationship.

(2) the velocity distribution in the cluster center is essentiallyisotropic, as expected. (3) using a sample of radial velocities for stars inthe core, we estimate the distance to 47 tuc: d = 4.0 +/- 0.35 kpc. and (4) weinfer a 1-sigma upper limit of m&lt;1000-1500 solar masses for any central,intermediate-mass black hole. we can neither confirm nor refute the hypothesisthat 47 tuc might lie on an extension of the m-sigma relation observed forsupermassive black holes in galaxy bulges.

astro-ph;9604092	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst iii: non-parametric recovery  of stellar luminosity distributions	we have non-parametrically determined the luminosity density profiles andtheir logarithmic slopes for 42 early-type galaxies observed with hst. assumingthat the isodensity contours are spheroidal, then the luminosity density isuniquely determined from the surface brightness data through the abel equation.for nearly all the galaxies in our sample, the logarithmic slope of theluminosity density measured at 0.1" (the innermost reliable measurement withthe uncorrected hst) is significantly different from zero; i.e. most ellipticalgalaxies have cusps. there are only two galaxies for which an analytic corecannot be excluded. the distribution of logarithmic slopes at 0.1" appears tobe bimodal, confirming the conclusion of lauer et al. (1995) that early-typegalaxies can be divided into two types based on their surface-brightnessprofiles; i.e., those with cuspy cores and those whose steep power-law profilescontinue essentially unchanged in to the resolution limit. the peaks in theslope distribution occur at -0.8 and -1.9. more than half of the galaxies haveslopes steeper than -1.0. taken together with the recent theoretical work ofmerritt &amp; fridman, these results suggest that many (and maybe most) ellipticalgalaxies are either nearly axisymmetric or spherical near the center, or slowlyevolve due to the influence of stochastic orbits.

astro-ph;9610055	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst. iv. central parameter  relations	we analyze hubble space telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hot galaxies). luminous hot galaxieshave cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r ~ r_b toshallow inner profiles with logslope less than 0.3. faint hot galaxies showsteep, largely featureless power-law profiles at all radii and lack cores. thecenters of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass andluminosity than the cores of large galaxies at a limiting radius of 10 pc. atintermediate magnitudes (-22.0 &lt; m_v &lt; -20.5), core and power-law galaxiescoexist, and there is a range in r_b at a given luminosity of at least twoorders of magnitude. central properties correlate with global rotation andshape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-lawgalaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. the dense power-law centers ofdisky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-richmergers. the parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products ofgas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. for example, core galaxies accretesmall, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-densitycores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. an alternative modelfor core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (bhs): thebh may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any existsand scouring out a core. an average bh mass per spheroid of 0.002 times thestellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii ofobserved cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of agns andkinematic detections of bhs in nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;9807231	the spin of m87 as measured from the rotation of its globular clusters	we revisit the kinematical data for 204 globular clusters in the halo of m87.beyond 3 r_eff along the major axis of the galaxy light, these globularclusters exhibit substantial rotation (~ 300 +/- 70 km/s) that translates intoan equally substantial spin (lambda ~ 0.18). the present appearance of m87 ismost likely the product of a single major merger, since this event is best ableto account for so sizable a spin. a rotation this large makes improbable anysignificant accretion of material after this merger, since that would havediluted the rotation signature. we see weak evidence for a difference betweenthe kinematics of the metal-poor and metal-rich population, in the sense thatthe metal-poor globular clusters appear to dominate the rotation. if, as wesuspect, the last major merger event of m87 was mainly dissipationless and didnot trigger the formation of a large number of globular clusters, the kinematicdifference between the two could reflect their orbital properties in theprogenitor galaxies; these differences would be compatible with theseprogenitors having formed in dissipational mergers. however, to put strongkinematic constraints on the origin of the globular clusters themselves isdifficult, given the complex history of the galaxy and its last dominant mergerevent.

astro-ph;9911361	obtaining galaxy masses using stellar absorption and [o ii]  emission-line diagnostics in late-type galaxies	the [o ii] lambda3727 emission lines and absorption features from stellarbalmer and ca h&amp;k lines are the most accessible kinematic diagnotics ingalaxies at z~1. we investigate the kinematics of 22 local late-type galaxiesusing these spectral features and we compare the results to 21-cm neutralhydrogen spectra in order to assess the utility of each diagnostic formeasuring galaxy masses. in order to simulate data at high redshift where only1-dimensional velocity profiles are normally available, we study spatiallyintegrated as well as spatially-resolved spectra. although the studied galaxiesspan a wide range of morphological types, inclinations, and star formationrates, we find that the gaseous and stellar kinematic tracers yield comparablekinematic line widths and systemic velocities. the [o ii] and h i line widthscorrelate most strongly, showing an intrinsic dispersion of ~20 km/s, or ~10%for a typical galaxy with a kinematic width of 200 km/s. in a few extremecases, the [o ii] line widths underestimate the neutral hydrogen width by 50%.reliable velocity widths can also be obtained from the stellar balmer and cah&amp;k absorption lines, even for some of the very late-type galaxies which havestrong emission lines. the intrinsic dispersion is &lt;10% between the stellarabsorption and h i line widths. we provide a prescription for using thesestrong stellar absorption and [o ii] emission features to measure thekinematics, and thus masses, of galaxies in the distant universe.

astro-ph;9912026	axisymmetric, 3-integral models of galaxies: a massive black hole in  ngc3379	we fit axisymmetric 3-integral dynamical models to ngc3379 using theline-of-sight velocity distribution obtained from hst/fos spectra of the galaxycenter and ground-based long-slit spectroscopy along four position angles, withthe light distribution constrained by wfpc2 and ground-based images. we havefitted models with inclinations from 29 (intrinsic galaxy type e5) to 90degrees (intrinsic e1) and black hole masses from 0 to 1e9 m_solar. thebest-fit black hole masses range from 6e7 to 2e8 m_solar, depending oninclination. the velocity ellipsoid of the best model is not consistent witheither isotropy or a two-integral distribution function. along the major axis,the velocity ellipsoid becomes tangential at the innermost bin, radial in themid-range radii, and tangential again at the outermost bins. for the acceptablemodels, the radial to tangential dispersion in the mid-range radii ranges from1.1 &lt; sigma_r / sigma_t &lt; 1.7. compared with these 3-integral models,2-integral isotropic models overestimate the black hole mass since they cannotprovide adequate radial motion. however, the models presented in this paperstill contain restrictive assumptions-namely assumptions of constant m/l andspheroidal symmetry-requiring yet more models to study black hole properties incomplete generality.

astro-ph;9912172	cfht adaptive optics observations of the central kinematics in m15	we have used an imaging fabry-perot spectrophotometer with the adaptiveoptics bonnette on the canada-france-hawaii telescope to measure stellar radialvelocities in the globular cluster m15. an average seeing of 0.15" full-widthat half maximum, with the best-seeing image having 0.09", allowed us to measureaccurately the velocities for five stars within 1" of the center of m15. ourestimate of the second moment of the velocity distribution inside a radius of2" is 11.5 km/s, the same value we find out to a radius of about 6". however,the projected net rotation does increase dramatically at small radii, as ourprevious observations led us to suspect. the rotation amplitude inside a radiusof 3.4" is v = 10.4 +- 2.7 km/s and the dispersion after removing the rotationis sigma = 10.3 +- 1.4 km/s, so v/sigma = 1 in this region. in addition, theposition angle (pa) of the projected rotation axis differs by 100 degrees fromthat of the net cluster rotation at larger radii. current theoretical models donot predict either this large an increase in the rotation amplitude or such achange in the pa. however, a central mass concentration, such as a black hole,could possibly sustain such a configuration. the rotation increase isconsistent with the existence of a central dark mass concentration equal to2500 m_solar.
