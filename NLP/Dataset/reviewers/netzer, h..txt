0905.1577	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest). iv. comparison of 1-jy  ultraluminous infrared galaxies with palomar-green quasars	we report the results from a comprehensive study of 74 ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) and 34 palomar-green (pg) quasars within z ~ 0.3$ observedwith the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the contribution of nuclearactivity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using sixindependent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent resultswithin ~ +/-10-15% on average. the average derived agn contribution in ulirgsis ~35-40%, ranging from ~15-35% among "cool" (f_25/f_60 =&lt; 0.2) opticallyclassified hii-like and liner ulirgs to ~50 and ~75% among warm seyfert 2 andseyfert 1 ulirgs, respectively. this number exceeds ~80% in pg qsos. ulirgsfall in one of three distinct agn classes: (1) objects with small extinctionsand large pah equivalent widths are highly starburst-dominated; (2) systemswith large extinctions and modest pah equivalent widths have larger agncontributions, but still tend to be starburst-dominated; and (3) ulirgs withboth small extinctions and small pah equivalent widths host agn that are atleast as powerful as the starbursts. the agn contributions in class 2 ulirgsare more uncertain than in the other objects, and we cannot formally rule outthe possibility that these objects represent a physically distinct type ofulirgs. a morphological trend is seen along the sequence (1)-(2)-(3), ingeneral agreement with the standard ulirg - qso evolution scenario andsuggestive of a broad peak in extinction during the intermediate stages ofmerger evolution. however, the scatter in this sequence, implies that blackhole accretion, in addition to depending on the merger phase, also has a strongchaotic/random component, as in local agn.

0908.0280	enhanced star formation in narrow line seyfert 1 agn revealed by spitzer	we present new low resolution spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sampleof 20 rosat selected local narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1s). we detectstrong agn continuum in all and clear pah emission in 70% of the sources. the6.2 micron pah luminosity spans three orders of magnitudes, from ~10^(39) erg/sto ~10^(42) erg/s providing strong evidence for intense ongoing star formationin the circumnuclear regions of these sources. using the irs/spitzer archive wegather a large number of additional nls1s and their broad line counterparts(bls1s) and constructed nls1 and bls1 sub-samples to compare them in variousways. the comparison shows a clear separation according to fwhm(h_beta) suchthat objects with narrower broad h_beta lines are the strongest pah emitters.we test this division in various ways trying to remove biases due to luminosityand aperture size. specifically, we find that star formation activity aroundnls1 agn is larger than around bls1 of the same agn luminosity. the aboveresult seems to hold over the entire range of distance and luminosity. moreoverthe star formation rate is higher in low black hole mass and high l/l_eddsystems indicating that black hole growth and star formation are occurringsimultaneously.

1107.3397	a view of the narrow-line region in the infrared: active galactic nuclei  with resolved fine-structure lines in the spitzer archive	we queried the spitzer archive for high-resolution observations with theinfrared spectrograph of optically selected active galactic nuclei (agn) forthe purpose of identifying sources with resolved fine-structure lines thatwould enable studies of the narrow-line region (nlr) at mid-infraredwavelengths. by combining 298 spitzer spectra with 6 infrared space observatoryspectra, we present kinematic information of the nlr for 81 z&lt;=0.3 agn. we usedthe [nev], [oiv], [neiii], and [siv] lines, whose fluxes correlate well witheach other, to probe gas photoionized by the agn. we found that the widths ofthe lines are, on average, increasing with the ionization potential of thespecies that emit them. no correlation of the line width with the criticaldensity of the corresponding transition was found. the velocity dispersion ofthe gas, sigma, is systematically higher than that of the stars, sigma_*, inthe agn host galaxy, and it scales with the mass of the central black hole,m_bh. further correlations between the line widths and luminosities l, andbetween l and m_bh, are suggestive of a three dimensional plane connectinglog(m_bh) to a linear combination of log(sigma) and log(l). such a plane can beunderstood within the context of gas motions that are driven by agn feedbackmechanisms, or virialized gas motions with a power-law dependence of the nlrradius on the agn luminosity. the m_bh estimates obtained for 35 type 2 agnfrom this plane are consistent with those obtained from the m_bh-sigma_*relation.

1112.3071	observational evidence of quasar feedback quenching star formation at  high redshift	most galaxy evolutionary models require quasar feedback to regulate starformation in their host galaxies. in particular, at high redshift, modelsexpect that feedback associated with quasar-driven outflows is so efficientthat the gas in the host galaxy is largely swept away or heated up, hencesuppressing star formation in massive galaxies. we observationally investigatethis phenomenon by using vlt-sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of theluminous quasar 2qzj002830.4-281706 at z=2.4. the spectra sample the opticalemission lines redshifted into the near-ir. the [oiii]5007 emission-linekinematics map reveals a massive outflow on scales of several kpc. thedetection of narrow halpha emission reveals star formation in the quasar hostgalaxy, with sfr=100 msun/yr. however, the star formation is not distributeduniformly, but is strongly suppressed in the region with the highest outflowvelocity and highest velocity dispersion. this result indicates that starformation in this region is strongly quenched by the quasar outflow, which iscleaning the galaxy disk of its molecular gas. this is one of the first directobservational proofs of quasar feedback quenching the star formation at highredshift.

0710.5503	high-ionization mid-infrared lines as black hole mass and bolometric  luminosity indicators in active galactic nuclei	we present relations of the black hole mass and the optical luminosity withthe velocity dispersion and the luminosity of the [ne v] and the [o iv]high-ionization lines in the mid-infrared (mir) for 28 reverberation-mappedactive galactic nuclei. we used high-resolution spitzer infrared spectrographand infrared space observatory short wavelength spectrometer data to fit theprofiles of these mir emission lines that originate from the narrow-line regionof the nucleus. we find that the lines are often resolved and that the velocitydispersion of [ne v] and [o iv] follows a relation similar to that between theblack hole mass and the bulge stellar velocity dispersion found for localgalaxies. the luminosity of the [ne v] and the [o iv] lines in these sources iscorrelated with that of the optical 5100a continuum and with the black holemass. our results provide a means to derive black hole properties in varioustypes of active galactic nuclei, including highly obscured systems.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1212.2401	the surprising absence of absorption in the far-ultraviolet spectrum of  mrk 231	mrk 231, the nearest (z = 0.0422) quasar, hosts both a galactic-scale windand a nuclear-scale iron low-ionization broad absorption line (felobal)outflow. we recently obtained a far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectrum of this objectcovering ~1150 - 1470 a with the cosmic origins spectrograph on board thehubble space telescope. this spectrum is highly peculiar, highlighted by thepresence of faint (~&lt; 2% of predictions based on h-alpha), broad (&gt;~ 10,000km/s at the base), and highly blueshifted (centroid at ~ -3500 km/s) ly-alphaemission. the fuv continuum emission is slightly declining at shorterwavelengths (consistent with f_lambda ~ lambda^1.7) and does not show thepresence of any obvious photospheric or wind stellar features. surprisingly,the fuv spectrum also does not show any unambiguous broad absorption features.it thus appears to be dominated by the agn, rather than hot stars, andvirtually unfiltered by the dusty felobal screen. the observed ly-alphaemission is best explained if it is produced in the outflowing bal cloudsystem, while the balmer lines arise primarily from the standard broad emissionline region seen through the dusty (a_v ~ 7 mag.) broad absorption line region.two possible geometric models are discussed in the context of these newresults.

1302.1202	nuclear activity is more prevalent in star-forming galaxies	we explore the question of whether low and moderate luminosity activegalactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially found in galaxies that are undergoinga transition from active star formation to quiescence. this notion has beensuggested by studies of the uv-to-optical colors of agn hosts, which find themto be common among galaxies in the so-called "green valley", a region of galaxycolor space believed to be composed mostly of galaxies undergoingstar-formation quenching. combining the deepest current x-ray and herschel.pacs far-infrared (fir) observations of the two chandra deep fields (cdfs) withredshifts, stellar masses and rest-frame photometry derived from the extensiveand uniform multi-wavelength data in these fields, we compare the rest-frameu-v color distributions and sfr distributions of agns and carefully constructedsamples of inactive control galaxies. the uv-to-optical colors of agns areconsistent with equally massive inactive galaxies at redshifts out to z~2, butwe show that such colors are poor tracers of star formation. while the firdistributions of both star-forming agns and star-forming inactive galaxies arestatistically similar, we show that agns are preferentially found instar-forming host galaxies, or, in other words, agns are less likely to befound in weakly star-forming or quenched galaxies. we postulate that, amongx-ray selected agns of low and moderate accretion luminosities, the supply ofcold gas primarily determines the accretion rate distribution of the nuclearblack holes.

1308.3139	fast molecular outflows in luminous galaxy mergers: evidence for quasar  feedback from herschel	we report the results from a systematic search for molecular (oh-119 um)outflows with herschel-pacs in a sample of 43 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) galaxy mergers,mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos. we find that thecharacter of the oh feature (strength of the absorption relative to theemission) correlates with that of the 9.7-um silicate feature, a measure ofobscuration in ulirgs. unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based onthe detection of oh absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshiftedthan -50 km/sec, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 oh-detected targets, suggestinga wide-angle (~145 degrees) outflow geometry. conversely, unambiguous evidencefor molecular inflows, based on the detection of oh absorption profiles withmedian velocities more redshifted than +50 km/sec, is seen in only 4 objects,suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. terminaloutflow velocities of ~-1000 km/sec are measured in several objects, but medianoutflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s^{-1}. while the outflow velocitiesshow no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, theyare distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large agn fractions andluminosities [log (l_agn / l_sun) &gt; 11.8 +/- 0.3]. the quasars in these systemsplay a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. in contrast, the mostagn dominated systems, where oh is seen purely in emission, show relativelymodest oh line widths, despite their large agn luminosities, perhaps indicatingthat molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through theobscuring material.

1310.1922	the mean star-forming properties of qso host galaxies	quasi-stellar objects (qsos) occur in galaxies in which supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. manypopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and smbhs predict thatqsos are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by importantprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature ofgalaxies. a detailed study of the star-forming properties of qsos is a criticaltest of such models. we present a far-infrared herschel/pacs study of the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of a sample of spectroscopically observed qsos to z~2from the cosmos extragalactic survey. this is the largest sample to date ofmoderately luminous agns studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.we study trends of the mean sfr with redshift, black hole mass, nuclearbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (eddington ratio). tominimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of smbhproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects withinspectroscopic qso samples that influence the interpretation of sfr trends. wefind that the mean sfrs of these qsos are consistent with those of normalmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between smbh and galaxy massat all redshifts. no strong enhancement in sfr is found even among the mostrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean sfr trends from differentassumptions about the star-forming properties of qso hosts and redshiftevolution of the smbh-galaxy relationship. while limited currently byuncertainties, valuable constraints on agn-galaxy co-evolution can emerge fromour approach.

0801.4637	extended silicate dust emission in pg qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the silicate emission observed in pg qsos,based on observations with the spitzer space telescope. scenarios based on theunified model suggest that silicate emission in agn arises mainly from theilluminated faces of the clouds in the torus at temperatures near sublimation.however, detections of silicate emission in type 2 qsos, and the estimated cooldust temperatures, argue for a more extended emission region.to investigatethis issue we present the mid-infrared spectra of 23 qsos. these spectra, andespecially the silicate emission features at ~10 and ~18 mu can be fitted usingdusty narrow line region (nlr) models and a combination of black bodies. thebolometric luminosities of the qsos allow us to derive the radial distances andcovering factors for the silicate-emitting dust. the inferred radii are 100-200times larger than the dust sublimation radius, much larger than the expecteddimensions of the inner torus. our qso mid-ir spectra are consistent with thebulk of the silicate dust emission arising from the dust in the innermost partsof the nlr.

1310.4107	supermassive black holes with high accretion rates in active galactic  nuclei: i. first results from a new reverberation mapping campaign	we report first results from a large project to measure black hole (bh) massin high accretion rate active galactic nuclei (agns). such objects may bedifferent from other agns in being powered by slim accretion disks and showingsaturated accretion luminosities, but both are not yet fully understood. theresults are part of a large reverberation mapping (rm) campaign using the 2.4-mshangri-la telescope at the yunnan observatory in china. the goals are toinvestigate the gas distribution near the bh and the properties of the centralaccretion disks, to measure bh mass and eddington ratios, and to test thefeasibility of using such objects as a new type of cosmological candles. thepaper presents results for three objects, mrk 335, mrk 142 and iras f12397+3333with h$\beta$ time lags relative to the 5100\aa\ continuum of$10.6^{+1.7}_{-2.9}$, $6.4^{+0.8}_{-2.2}$ and $11.4^{+2.9}_{-1.9}$ days,respectively. the corresponding bh masses are $(8.3_{-3.2}^{+2.6})\times10^6m_{\odot}$, $(3.4_{-1.2}^{+0.5})\times 10^6m_{\odot}$ and$(7.5_{-4.1}^{+4.3})\times 10^6m_{\odot}$, and the lower limits on theeddington ratios 0.6, 2.3, and 4.6 for the minimal radiative efficiency of0.038. mrk 142 and iras f12397+333 (extinction corrected) clearly deviate fromthe currently known relation between h$\beta$ lag and continuum luminosity. thethree eddington ratios are beyond the values expected in thin accretion disksand two of them are the largest measured so far among objects with rm-based bhmasses. we briefly discuss implications for slim disks, bh growth andcosmology.

1311.1978	locating star-forming regions in quasar host galaxies	we present a study of the morphology and intensity of star formation in thehost galaxies of eight palomar-green quasars using observations with the hubblespace telescope. our observations are motivated by recent evidence for a closerelationship between black hole growth and the stellar mass evolution in itshost galaxy. we use narrow-band [o ii] $\lambda$3727, h$\beta$, [o iii]$\lambda$5007 and pa$\alpha$ images, taken with the wfpc2 and nicmosinstruments, to map the morphology of line-emitting regions, and, afterextinction corrections, diagnose the excitation mechanism and inferstar-formation rates. significant challenges in this type of work are theseparation of the quasar light from the stellar continuum and thequasar-excited gas from the star-forming regions. to this end, we present anovel technique for image decomposition and subtraction of quasar light. ourprimary result is the detection of extended line-emitting regions with sizesranging from 0.5 to 5 kpc and distributed symmetrically around the nucleus,powered primarily by star formation. we determine star-formation rates of ordera few tens of m$_\odot$/yr. the host galaxies of our target quasars havestellar masses of order $10^{11}$ m$_\odot$ and specific star formation rateson a par with those of m82 and luminous infrared galaxies. as such they fall atthe upper envelope or just above the star-formation mass sequence in thespecific star formation vs stellar mass diagram. we see a clear trend ofincreasing star formation rate with quasar luminosity, reinforcing the linkbetween the growth of the stellar mass of the host and the black hole massfound by other authors.

1501.05951	space telescope and optical reverberation mapping project. ii. swift and  hst reverberation mapping of the accretion disk of ngc 5548	recent intensive swift monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 yielded282 usable epochs over 125 days across six uv/optical bands and the x-rays.this is the densest extended agn uv/optical continuum sampling ever obtained,with a mean sampling rate &lt;0.5 day. approximately daily hst uv sampling wasalso obtained. the uv/optical light curves show strong correlations (r_max =0.57 - 0.90) and the clearest measurement to date of interband lags. these lagsare well-fit by a \tau propto \lambda^4/3 wavelength dependence, with anormalization that indicates an unexpectedly large disk radius of 0.35 +/- 0.05lt-day at 1367 a, assuming a simple face-on model. the u-band shows amarginally larger lag than expected from the fit and surrounding bands, whichcould be due to balmer continuum emission from the broad-line region assuggested by korista and goad. the uv/x-ray correlation is weaker (r_max &lt;0.45) and less consistent over time. this indicates that while swift isbeginning to measure uv/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disktheory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationshipwith x-ray variability is less well understood. combining this accretion disksize estimate with those from quasar microlensing studies suggests that agndisk sizes scale approximately linearly with central black hole mass over awide range of masses.

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

astro-ph;0002008	iso-sws spectroscopy of ngc 1068	we present iso-sws spectroscopy of ngc 1068 for the wavelength range 2.4 to45um, detecting a total of 36 emission lines. most of the observed transitionsare fine structure and recombination lines originating in the narrow lineregion. we compare the line profiles of optical lines and reddening-insensitiveinfrared lines to constrain the dynamical structure and extinction propertiesof the nlr. the considerable differences found are most likely explained by twoeffects. (1) the spatial structure of the nlr is a combination of a highlyionized outflow cone and lower excitation extended emission. (2) parts of thenlr, mainly in the receding part at velocities above systemic, are subject toextinction that is significantly suppressing optical emission. line asymmetriesand net blueshifts remain, however, even for infrared fine structure linessuffering very little obscuration. this may be either due to an intrinsicasymmetry of the nlr, or due to a very high column density obscuring componentwhich is hiding part of the nlr even from infrared view. mid-infrared emissionof molecular hydrogen in ngc 1068 arises in a dense molecular medium attemperatures of a few hundred kelvin that is most likely closely related to thewarm and dense components seen in the near-infrared h2 transitions, and inmillimeter wave tracers of molecular gas. any emission of the putative pc-scalemolecular torus is likely overwhelmed by this larger scale emission.

astro-ph;0104035	a chandra study of the circinus galaxy point-source population	we have used the chandra x-ray observatory to resolve spatially andspectrally the x-ray emission from the circinus galaxy. we report here on thenature of the x-ray emission from the off-nuclear point sources associated withthe disk of circinus. we find that many of the serendipitous x-ray sources areconcentrated along the optical disk of the galaxy, but few have opticalcounterparts within 1" of their x-ray positions down to v=23-25. at 3.8 mpc,their intrinsic 0.5-10 kev luminosities range from approx. 2e37 erg/s to 4e39erg/s. one quarter of the sources are variable over the duration of the 67 ksobservation, and spectral fitting of these off-nuclear sources shows a diverserange of spectral properties. the properties of the two strongest off-nuclearsources are remarkable, with average x-ray luminosities of 3.7e39 erg/s and3.4e39 erg/s. the former displays large and periodic flux variations every 7.5hr and is well fit by a multicolor blackbody accretion-disk model witht_in=1.35 kev, properties consistent with an eclipsing &gt;50 m_sun black-holebinary. the latter appears to be a young supernova remnant, as it coincideswith a non-thermal radio counterpart and an h\alpha-detected hii region. thissource exhibits both long-term (approx. 4 yr) x-ray variability and a 6.67-6.97kev iron emission-line blend with a 1.6 kev equivalent width. these two objectsfurther support the notion that super-eddington x-ray sources in nearbygalaxies can be explained by a mixture of intermediate-mass black holes inx-ray binaries and young supernova remnants.

astro-ph;0105083	the x-ray emission from the nucleus of the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc  3226	we present the first high resolution x-ray image of the dwarf ellipticalgalaxy ngc 3226. the data were obtained during an observation of the nearbyseyfert galaxy ngc 3227 using the chandra x-ray observatory. we detect a pointx-ray source spatially consistent with the optical nucleus of ngc 3226 and arecently-detected, compact, flat-spectrum, radio source. the x-ray spectrum canbe measured up to ~10 kev and is consistent with a power law with a photonindex 1.7 &lt;~ gamma &lt;~ 2.2, or thermal bremmstrahlung emission with 4 &lt;~ kt &lt;~10 kev. in both cases the luminosity in the 2--10 kev band ~10^{40} h_{75}^{-1}erg/s. we find marginal evidence that the nucleus varies within theobservation. these characteristics support evidence from other wavebands thatngc 3226 harbors a low-luminosity, active nucleus. we also comment on twopreviously-unknown, fainter x-ray sources &lt;~ 15 arcsec from the nucleus of ngc3226. their proximity to the nucleus (with projected distances &lt;~ 1.3/h_{75}kpc) suggests both are within ngc 3226, and thus have luminosities (~few x10^{38} -- few x 10^{39} erg/s) consistent with black-hole binary systems.

astro-ph;0107075	multiwavelength monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564.  iii. optical observations and the optical--uv--x-ray connection	we present the results of a two-year long optical monitoring program of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564. the majority of this monitoring projectwas also covered by x-ray observations (rxte) and for a period of ~50 days, weobserved the galaxy in uv (hst) and x-rays (rxte &amp; asca) simultaneously withthe ground-based observations. rapid and large-amplitude variations seen in thex-ray band, on a daily and hourly time-scale, were not detected at optical anduv wavelengths, which in turn exhibited much lower variability either on short(one day) or long (several months) time-scales. the only significant opticalvariations can be described as two 2--4 day events with ~10% flux variations.we detect no significant optical line variations and thus cannot infer areverberation size for the broad-line region. similarly, the large x-rayvariations seem to vanish when the light curve is smoothed over a period of 30days. the uv continuum follows the x-rays with a lag of ~0.4 days, and theoptical band lags the uv band by ~2 days. no significant correlation was foundbetween the entire x-ray dataset and the optical band. focusing on a 20-dayinterval around the strongest optical event we detect a significantx-ray--optical correlation with similar events seen in the uv and x-rays. ourdata are consistent with reprocessing models on the grounds of the energyemitted in this single event. however, several large x-ray flares produced nocorresponding optical emission.

astro-ph;0110303	reddening, emission-line, and intrinsic absorption properties in the  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564	we use hubble space telescope uv and optical spectra of the narrow-lineseyfert 1 (nls1) galaxy akn 564 to investigate its internal reddening andproperties of its emission-line and intrinsic uv absorption gas. we find thatthe extinction curve of akn 564, derived from a comparison of its uv/opticalcontinuum to that of an unreddened nls1, lacks a 2200 a bump and turns uptowards the uv at a longer wavelength (4000 a) than the standard galactic, lmc,and smc curves. however, it does not show the extremely steep rise to 1200 athat characterizes the extinction curve of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3227. theemission-lines and continuum experience the same amount of reddening,indicating the presence of a dust screen that is external to the narrow-lineregion (nlr). echelle spectra from the space telescope imaging spectrographshow intrinsic uv absorption lines due to ly-alpha, n v, c iv, si iv, and siiii, centered at a radial velocity of -190 km/s (relative to the host galaxy).photoionization models of the uv absorber indicate that it has a sufficientcolumnand is at a sufficient distance from the nucleus (d &gt; 95 pc) to be thesource of the dust screen. thus, akn 564 contains a dusty ``lukewarm absorber''similar to that seen in ngc 3227.

astro-ph;0111523	the detection of circumnuclear x-ray emission from the seyfert galaxy  ngc 3516	we present the first high-resolution, x-ray image of the circumnuclearregions of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516, using the chandra x-ray observatory(cxo). all three of the cxo observations reported were performed with one ofthe two grating assemblies in place, and here we restrict our analysis toundispersed photons (i.e. those detected in the zeroth-order). apreviously-unknown x-ray source is detected approx 6 arcsec (1.1 h_{75}^{-1}kpc) nne of the nucleus (position angle approx 29 degrees) which we designatecxou 110648.1+723412. its spectrum can be characterized as a power law with aphoton index gamma ~ 1.8--2.6, or as thermal emission with a temperaturekt~0.7--3 kev. assuming a location within ngc 3516, isotropic emission impliesa luminosity l ~ 2--8e39 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} in the 0.4--2 kev band. if dueto a single point source, the object is super-eddington for a 1.4 m_sun neutronstar. however, multiple sources or a small, extended source cannot be excludedusing the current data. large-scale extended x-ray emission is also detectedout to ~10 arcsec (~1.7 h_{75}^{-1} kpc) from the nucleus to the ne and sw, andis approximately aligned with the morphologies of the radio emission andextended narrow emission line region (enlr). the mean luminosity of thisemission is 1--5e37 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} arcsec^{-2}, in the 0.4--2 kev band.unfortunately the current data cannot usefully constrain its spectrum. theseresults are consistent with earlier suggestions of circumnuclear x-ray emissionin ngc 3516. if the extended emission is due to scattering of the nuclear x-raycontinuum, then the pressure in the x-ray emitting gas is at least two ordersof magnitude too small to provide the confining medium for the enlr clouds.

astro-ph;0112027	the density and location of the x-ray absorbing gas in ngc 3516	a new chandra observation and archival observations by asca are used toinvestigate spectral variations in the sy1 galaxy ngc 3516 over a period of 7years. a large change in flux (factor ~50 at 1kev) is observed between an ascaobservation in '94 and the chandra observation in 2000, with the source closeto the all-time maximum and minimum x-ray flux states, respectively. we findthe variations in the observed flux and spectra at these epochs to beconsistent with a constant column density of line-of-sight material reacting tochanges in the ionizing continuum. the data from the two epochs are consistentwith a simple decrease (by a factor 8-10) in the luminosity of a constant0.5-50 kev slope source and a line-of-sight absorber with an equivalenthydrogen column density of 10^21.9 cm^-2. intermediate luminosities, sampledduring other asca observations, are all fitted by the same model with a verysmall change in spectral index (well below \delta\gamma=0.2). in addition,analysis of the long (360 ks) asca observation in 1998 shows clear "color"variations that are entirely consistent with this model and are interpreted asdue to changes in the opacity of the absorbing gas. the data allow us to put aconservative upper limit of 60 ks on the recombination time which translates toa lower limit of about 2.4 times 10^6 cm^-3 on the density of the recombininggas and an upper limit of about 6 times 10^17 h_{75}^-2 cm on its distance fromthe central source. these are the best limits obtained so far on the densityand location of the x-ray absorbing gas in a type-1 agn. they indicate that theabsorbing gas is different, in terms of its density and location, from theionized gas commonly observed in type-ii agn.

astro-ph;0205389	variable uv absorption in the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc 3516: the case for  associated uv and x-ray absorption	we present observations of the uv absorption lines in the seyfert 1 galaxyngc 3516, obtained at a resolution of $\lambda$/$\delta\lambda$ $\approx$40,000 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) on 2000 october 1.the uv continuum was $\sim$4 times lower than that observed during 1995 withthe goddard high resolution spectrograph (ghrs), and the x-ray flux from acontemporaneous {\it chandra x-ray observatory (cxo)} observation was a factorof $\sim$8 below that observed with {\it asca}. the stis spectra show kinematiccomponents of absorption in ly$\alpha$, c iv, and n v at radial velocities of-376, -183, and -36 km s$^{-1}$ (components 1, 2, and 3+4, respectively), whichwere detected in the earlier ghrs spectra; the last of these is a blend of twoghrs components that have increased greatly in column density. four additionalabsorption components have appeared in the stis spectra at radial velocities of-692, -837, -994, and -1372 km s$^{-1}$ (components 5 through 8); these mayalso have been present in earlier low-flux states observed by the {\itinternational ultraviolet explorer (iue)}. based on photoionization models, wesuggest that the components are arranged in increasing radial distance in theorder, 3+4, 2, 1, followed by components 5 -- 8. we have achieved an acceptablefit to the x-ray data using the combined x-ray opacity of the uv components 1,2 and 3+4. by increasing the uv and x-ray fluxes of these models to match theprevious high states, we are able to match the ghrs c iv column densities,absence of detectable c iv absorption in components 5 through 8, and the 1994{\it asca} spectrum. we conclude that variability of the uv and x-rayabsorption in ngc 3516 is primarily due to changes in the ionizing flux.

astro-ph;0207571	the correlation of line strength with luminosity and redshift from  composite qso spectra	we have generated a series of composite qso spectra using over 22000individual low resolution (~8a) qso spectra obtained from the 2df(18.25&lt;bj&lt;20.85) and 6df (16&lt;bj&lt;18.25) qso redshift surveys. the large size ofthe catalogue has enabled us to construct composite spectra in narrow redshift(dz=0.25) and absolute magnitude (dmb=0.5) bins. the median number of qsos ineach composite is ~200, yielding typical s/n of ~100. for a given redshiftinterval, the composite spectra cover a factor of over 25 in luminosity. usingthe composite spectra we have measured the equivalent widths (ews) of the majorbroad and narrow emission lines, and the caii k absorption feature due to thehost galaxy of the agn. assuming a fixed host galaxy spectral energydistribution (sed), the correlation between caii k ew and luminosity implieslgal proportional to lqso**{0.42+-0.05}. we find strong anti-correlations withluminosity for the ews of [oii] and [nev]. these provide hints to the generalfading of the nlr in high luminosity sources which we attribute to the nlrdimensions becoming larger than the host galaxy. if average agn host galaxieshave seds similar to average galaxies, then the observed narrow [oii] emissioncould be solely due to the host galaxy at low luminosities (m_b~-20). wemeasure highly significant baldwin effects for most broad emission lines (civ,ciii], mgii, hbeta, hgamma) and show that they are predominantly due tocorrelations with luminosity, not redshift. we find that the hbeta and hgammabalmer lines show an inverse baldwin effect and are positively correlated withluminosity, unlike the broad uv lines. we postulate that this previouslyunknown effect is due to a luminosity dependent change in the the ratio of diskto non-disk continuum components (abridged).

astro-ph;0209475	infrared spectroscopy around 4micron of seyfert 2 galaxies: obscured  broad line regions and coronal lines	the state of the matter that is obscuring a small circumnuclear region in agncan be probed by observations of its broad emission lines. infrared lines areparticularly useful since they penetrate significant columns of obscuringmatter, the properties of which can be constrained by comparing infrared andx-ray obscuration. we report on new 4um spectroscopy of a sample of 12 seyfert2 galaxies, probing for broad components to the brackett alpha 4.05um line.broad components are observed in 3 to 4 objects. all objects with a broadcomponent exhibit relatively low x-ray obscuring columns, and our results areconsistent with a galactic ratio of 4um obscuration to the blr and x-raycolumn. in combination with observations of a non-galactic ratio of visualobscuration of blrs and x-ray obscuring column in seyferts, and interpreted ina unified agn scheme, this result can be reconciled with two interpretations.either the properties of dust near the agn are modified towards larger grains,for example through coagulation, in a way that significantly flattens theoptical/ir extinction curve, or the ratio of dust obscuration to x-ray columnvaries for different viewing angles with respect to the axis of symmetry of theputative torus. our spectra also provide a survey of emission in the [siix]3.94um coronal line, finding variation by an order of magnitude in its ratio tobr alpha. the first extragalactic detection of the [cavii] 4.09um and [cav]4.16um coronal lines is reported in the spectrum of the circinus galaxy.

astro-ph;0304541	emission line widths and qso black hole mass estimates from the 2df qso  redshift survey	we have used composite spectra generated from more than 22000 qsos observedin the course of the 2df and 6df qso redshift surveys to investigate therelationship between the velocity width of emission lines and qso luminosity.we find that the velocity width of the broad emission lines hbeta, hgamma,mgii, ciii] and civ are correlated with the continuum luminosity, with asignificance of more than 99 per cent. of the major narrow emission lines([oiii] 5007, [oii] 3727, neiii 3870 and nev 3426) only [oiii] exhibits asignificant correlation between line width and luminosity. assuming that thegas is moving in keplerian orbits and that the radius of the broad line regionis related to the qso continuum luminosity, we use the velocity widths of thebroad lines to derive average black hole masses for the qsos contributing tothe composite spectra. the resultant qso mass-luminosity relationship isconsistent with m ~ l^0.97+-0.16. we find that the correlation between linewidth and redshift, if present, must be weak, and only civ shows significantevidence of evolution. this enables us to constrain the redshift evolution ofthe black hole mass-luminosity ratio to be ~(1+z)^beta with beta ~&lt; 1, muchless than the ~(1+z)^3 evolution seen in qso luminosity evolution. assumingthat the motion of the broad line region gas is keplerian and that its radiusdepends on the qso luminosity, our models indicate that the observed weakredshift dependence is too small for the observed qso luminosity function to bedue to the evolution of a single long-lived population of sources.

astro-ph;0309096	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783. iv. variability and  modeling of the 900 ks chandra spectrum	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the data obtained from ngc 3783during the period 2000-2001 using chandra. this analysis leads us to thefollowing results. 1) ngc 3783 fluctuated in luminosity by a factor ~1.5 duringindividual observations (~170 ks duration). these fluctuations were notassociated with significant spectral variations. 2) on a longer time scale(20-120 days), we found the source to exhibit two very different spectralshapes. the main difference between these can be well-described by theappearance and disappearance of a spectral component that dominates theunderlying continuum at the longest wavelengths. the spectral variations arenot related to the brightening or the fading of the continuum at shortwavelengths in any simple way. 3) the appearance of the soft continuumcomponent is consistent with being the only spectral variation, and there is noneed to invoke changes in the opacity of the absorbers. 4) photoionizationmodeling indicates that a combination of three ionized absorbers, each splitinto two kinematic components, can explain the strengths of almost all theabsorption lines and bound-free edges. all three components are thermallystable and seem to have the same gas pressure. 5) the only real discrepancybetween our model and the observations concerns the range of wavelengthsabsorbed by the iron m-shell uta feature. this most likely arises as the resultof our underestimation of the poorly-known dielectronic recombination ratesappropriate for these ions. 6) the lower limit on the distance of the absorbinggas in ngc 3783 is between 0.2 and 3.2 pc. the assumption of pressureequilibrium imposes an upper limit of about 25 pc on the distance of theleast-ionized component from the central source.

astro-ph;0407299	central masses and broad-line region sizes of active galactic nuclei.  ii. a homogeneous analysis of a large reverberation-mapping database	we present improved black hole masses for 35 active galactic nuclei (agns)based on a complete and consistent reanalysis of broad emission-linereverberation-mapping data. from objects with multiple line measurements, wefind that the highest precision measure of the virial product is obtained byusing the cross-correlation function centroid (as opposed to thecross-correlation function peak) for the time delay and the line dispersion (asopposed to full width half maximum) for the line width and by measuring theline width in the variable part of the spectrum. accurate line-widthmeasurement depends critically on avoiding contaminating features, inparticular the narrow components of the emission lines. we find that theprecision (or random component of the error) of reverberation-based black holemass measurements is typically around 30%, comparable to the precision attainedin measurement of black hole masses in quiescent galaxies by gas or stellardynamical methods. based on results presented in a companion paper by onken etal., we provide a zero-point calibration for the reverberation-based black holemass scale by using the relationship between black hole mass and host-galaxybulge velocity dispersion. the scatter around this relationship implies thatthe typical systematic uncertainties in reverberation-based black hole massesare smaller than a factor of three. we present a preliminary version of amass-luminosity relationship that is much better defined than any previousattempt. scatter about the mass-luminosity relationship for these agns appearsto be real and could be correlated with either eddington ratio or objectinclination.

astro-ph;0506323	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783 v. variability and  modeling of the intrinsic ultraviolet absorption	we present results on the location, physical conditions, and geometry of theoutflow in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 from a study of the variable intrinsicuv absorption. based on 18 observations with hst/stis and 6 observations withfuse, we find: 1) the absorption from the lowest-ionization species in each ofthe three strong kinematic components varied inversely with the continuum flux,indicating the ionization structure responded to changes in the photoionizingflux over the weekly timescales sampled by our observations. 2) a multi-component model with an unocculted nlr and separate blr and continuumline-of-sight covering factors predicts saturation in several lines, consistentwith the lack of observed variability. 3) column densities for the individualmetastable levels are measured from the resolved c iii *1175 absorption complexobserved in one component. based on our computed metastable level populations,the electron density of this absorber is ~3x10^4 cm^-3. photoionizationmodeling results place it at ~25 pc from the central source. 4) usingtime-dependent calculations, we are able to reproduce the detailed variabilityobserved in this absorber, and derive upper limits on the distances for theother components of 25-50 pc. 5) the ionization parameters derived for thehigher ionization uv absorbers are consistent with the modeling results for thelowest-ionization x-ray component, but with smaller total column density. theyhave similar pressures as the three x-ray ionization components. these resultsare consistent with an inhomogeneous wind model for the outflow in ngc 3783. 6)based on the predicted emission-line luminosities, global covering factorconstraints, and distances derived for the uv absorbers, they may be identifiedwith emission- line gas observed in the inner nlr of agns.

astro-ph;0606158	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest): i. the origin of the  far infrared continuum of qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the far-infrared (fir) continuum of qsos,based on the quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest) of nearby qsos and ulirgsusing observations with the spitzer space telescope. for 27 palomar-green qsosat z &lt;~ 0.3, we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([neii]12.8um,[nev]14.3um, [oiv]25.9um) and emission features (pah7.7um emission which isrelated to star formation), as well as continuum luminosities over a range ofmid- to far-infrared wavelengths between 6 and 60um. we detect star-formationrelated pah emission in 11/26 qsos and fine-structure line emission in all ofthem, often in multiple lines. the detection of pahs in the average spectrum ofsources which lack individual pah detections provides further evidence for thewidespread presence of pahs in qsos. similar pah/fir and [neii]/fir ratios arefound in qsos and in starburst-dominated ulirgs and lower luminositystarbursts. we conclude that the typical qso in our sample has at least 30% butlikely most of the far-infrared luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)lsun) arising fromstar formation, with a tendency for larger star formation contribution at thelargest fir luminosities. in the qso sample, we find correlations between mostof the quantities studied including combinations of agn tracers and starbursttracers. the common scaling of agn and starburst luminosities (and fluxes) isevidence for a starburst-agn connection in luminous agn. strong correlations offar-infrared continuum and starburst related quantities (pah, low excitation[neii]) offer additional support for the starburst origin of far-infraredemission.

astro-ph;0610772	mid-infrared diagnostics of liners	we report results from the first mid-infrared spectroscopic study of acomprehensive sample of 33 liners, observed with the spitzer space telescope.we compare the properties of two different liner populations: infrared-faintliners, with liner emission arising mostly in compact nuclear regions, andinfrared-luminous liners, which often show spatially extended (non-agn) lineremission. we show that these two populations can be easily distinguished bytheir mid-infrared spectra in three different ways: (i) their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions (seds), (ii) the emission features of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs), and (iii) various combinations of ir fine-structure lineratios. ir-luminous liners show mid-ir seds typical of starburst galaxies,while the mid-ir seds of ir-faint liners are much bluer. pah flux ratios aresignificantly different in the two groups. fine structure emission lines fromhighly excited gas, such as [o iv], are detected in both populations,suggesting the presence of an additional agn also in a large fraction ofir-bright liners, which contributes little to the combined mid-ir light. thetwo liner groups occupy different regions of mid-infrared emission-lineexcitation diagrams. the positions of the various liner types in our diagnosticdiagrams provide important clues regarding the power source of each liner type.most of these mid-infrared diagnostics can be applied at low spectralresolution, making agn- and starburst-excited liners distinguishable also athigh redshifts.

astro-ph;9803051	asca observations of the ionized gas in the seyfert galaxy ngc 3783	we present the results from asca observations of ngc 3783 carried out during1993 and 1996. variability is observed both between the two epochs and withinthe individual observations, the latter due to a non-stationary process.  we find the spectra at both epochs to contain features due to absorption byionized material, predominantly due to ovii and oviii. we find the opacity forsuch material to decrease by a factor approx 2 in the approx 0.7--1.0 kev bandbetween the epochs while the photoionizing flux increases by approx25%. bycomparison with detailed photoionization models we show this behaviour isinconsistent with that expected from a single-zone of photoionized gas. adeficit in the data compared to such models, consistent with excess absorptionby oviii, supports the suggestion that the material consists of two or morezones.  significant fe k-shell emission is also observed during both epochs. we showthis emission is dominated by the asymmetric line profile expected from theinnermost regions of the accretion flow. we find no evidence that the feemission varied in either shape or equivalent width between the two epochs.

astro-ph;9803205	the soft x-ray spectrum of scattering--dominated agn	this paper discusses the properties of scattering--dominated active galacticnuclei (agn). we define these to be agn for which the direct line-of-sight tothe continuum source is obscured by compton-thick material. the aim is toconstruct, for the first time, a model consistent with x-ray line luminosities,line ratios and various luminosity indicators. the asca spectra of six suchsources show several x-ray lines that can be reliably measured, mostly due tohighly ionized magnesium, silicon sulphur and iron. these enable us toinvestigate the physical conditions of the scattering material. the sourcesshow evidence of he-like and h-like iron lines that are likely to be producedin hot (t approx 10^6 k) photoionized gas. by measuring the ew of the lines,and by constructing a diagnostic line-ratio diagram, we demonstrate that thesilicon and magnesium lines are produced by the same gas emitting the highlyionized iron lines. the properties of this gas are rather different from theproperties of warm absorbers in type i agn. neutral 6.4 kev iron lines are alsodetected, originating in a different component which can be either compton-thinor compton-thick. the best measured iron lines suggest an enhancement ofn_{fe}/n_h by a factor approx 2 compared to solar, in both the hot and coolcompton-thin components. we further show that in four of the sources, the fekalpha(6.4kev)/hbeta (lambda 4861ang) line ratio is consistent with thatpredicted for typical narrow line region clouds, and the reddening correctedhbeta is known, provided the column density is larger than approx10^{22.5}/cm^2, alpha_{ox} is smaller than 1.3. for some sources, this is aviable alternative to the commonly assumed compton thick medium as the originof the 6.4 kev iron line.

astro-ph;9910218	x-ray observations of optically-selected, radio-quiet quasars i: the  asca results	we present the result of 27 asca observations of 26 radio-quiet quasars(rqqs) from the pg survey. all the rqqs were detected except 2 balqsos. we findthe variability characteristics of the sources to be consistent with seyf-1s. apowerlaw offers an acceptable description of the time-averaged spectra in the2-10 kev (rqq-frame) band for all but 1 dataset. the photon indices vary fromobject to object over the range 1.5~&lt;gamma(2-10 kev)~&lt;3 with a meangamma(2-10kev)~2 and dispersion ~=0.25. the distribution of gamma(2-10 kev istherefore similar to that observed in other rq agn, and seems unrelated tox-ray luminosity. no single model adequately describes the full 0.6-10 kev(obs-frame) continuum of all the rqqs. ~50% of the sources can be described bya single powerlaw (or with only very subtle deviations). all but one of theremaining datasets have convex spectra (flattening to higher energies). theexception is pg 1411+442, in which a substantial column density obscures ~98%of the continuum. we find only 5 (or 6) of 14 objects with z&lt;~0.25 to have a'soft excess' at energies &lt;~1 kev, but find no universal shape for thesespectral components. the spectrum of pg 1244+026 contains an emission featureat ~1 kev. the detection rate of absorption due to ionized material in theserqqs is lower than in seyf-1s. in part, this may be due to selection effects.however, when detected, the absorbers in the rqqs exhibit a similar range ofcolumn density and ionization parameter as seyf-1s. we find evidence of fek-shell emission in at least 8 rqqs. these are all low-luminosity objects, andthe line parameters are consistent with other low-luminosity rq agn. however wefind a trend whereby the profile and strength of the fe k-shell emissionchanges as a function of luminosity.
