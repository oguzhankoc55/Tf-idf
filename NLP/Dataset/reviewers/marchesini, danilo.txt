0901.0551	the newfirm medium-band survey: filter definitions and first results	deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distantgalaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding ofthe early universe. as the vast majority of k- or irac-selected galaxies is toofaint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almostexclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to thebroad-band photometry. the best-achieved accuracy of these redshiftsdelta(z)/(1+z) ~ 0.06 at z&gt;1.5, which is sufficient for determining the broadcharacteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accuraterest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density.we have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the newfirm camera on thekitt peak 4m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshiftsin the range 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5. the survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, whichprovide crude "spectra" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 micron for all objectsin the 27.6 x 27.6 arcmin newfirm field. in this first paper, we illustrate thetechnique by showing medium band newfirm photometry of several galaxies at1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7 from the near-infrared spectroscopic sample of kriek et al. (2008).the filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted balmer breakin these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. the fullsurvey will provide similar data for ~8000 faint k-selected galaxies at z&gt;1.5in the cosmos and aegis fields. the filter set also enables efficient selectionof exotic objects such as high redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emissionlines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late t and candidate "y" dwarfscould be identified using only two of the filters.

0903.2044	the relation between compact, quiescent high redshift galaxies and  massive nearby elliptical galaxies: evidence for hierarchical, inside-out  growth	recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshiftare much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. here wecompare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sampleof massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. weconfirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within theeffective radius, rho(&lt;r_e), are two orders of magnitude higher than those oflocal elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. however, we also find thatthe densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, rho(&lt;1 kpc),are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. this suggests that inside-out growthscenarios are plausible, in which the compact high redshift galaxies make upthe centers of normal nearby ellipticals. the compact galaxies are common athigh redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution byrequiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceedconstraints imposed by the z=0 galaxy mass function. we infer that size growthmust be efficient, with (r_{1+2}/r_1) ~ (m_{1+2}/m_1)^2. a simple model wherecompact galaxies with masses ~ 10^11 msun primarily grow through minor mergersproduces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and numberdensity of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 x10^11 msun in the localuniverse. we note that this model also predicts evolution in the m_bh - sigmarelation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower blackhole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. the main observational uncertainty isthe conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed tocalibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high redshift galaxies.

0905.1692	an ultra-deep near-infrared spectrum of a compact quiescent galaxy at  z=2.2	several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies atz~2 are in a quiescent phase. moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to beultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. we have obtained a ~29 hrspectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the gemininear-infrared spectrograph. the spectrum exhibits a strong optical break andseveral absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z&gt;2quiescent galaxies. comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellarpopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (sfr) of 1-3msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 msol. we detectseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [nii]/halpha,[sii]/halpha and [oii]/[oiii] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-lineregions. thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission impliesactive star formation. the current sfr is &lt;1% of the past average sfr. if thisgalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it impliesthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates thatlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) could be common in these objects.nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. however, weshow that the agn contributes &lt;8% to the rest-frame optical emission. apossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;although a 0.5 gyr old stellar population can make up &lt;10% of the total stellarmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. nevertheless, thisspectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellarpopulation.

0905.2411	color distributions, number and mass densities of massive galaxies at  1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3: comparing observations with merger simulations	we present a comparison between the observed color distribution, number andmass density of massive galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 and a model by hopkins et al.that relates the quasar and galaxy population on the basis of gas-rich mergers.in order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after agas-rich merger involving quasar activity, we confront photometry of massive (m&gt; 4x10^10 msun) galaxies extracted from the fires, goods-south, and musycsurveys, together spanning an area of 496 arcmin^2, with synthetic photometryfrom hydrodynamical merger simulations. as in the hopkins et al. (2006b) model,we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. wefind that the synthetic u-v and v-j colors of galaxies that had a quasar phasein their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterizedby a quiescent stellar population. at z ~ 2.6, the observed number and massdensity of quiescent red galaxies with m &gt; 4x10^10 msun is consistent with themodel in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in thepast. at z ~ 1.9, 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predictedby the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars. the merger model alsopredicts a large number of galaxies undergoing merger-driven star formation. wefind that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30-50% of theobserved massive star-forming galaxies. however, their colors do not matchthose of observed star-forming galaxies. in particular, the colors of dusty redgalaxies are not reproduced by the simulations. several possible origins ofthis discrepancy are discussed. the observational constraints on the validityof the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties instellar population synthesis and radiative transfer.

0905.4503	the rest-frame optical luminosity function of cluster galaxies at z&lt;0.8  and the assembly of the cluster red sequence	we present the rest-frame optical luminosity function (lf) of red sequencegalaxies in 16 clusters at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 drawn from the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs). we compare our clusters to an analogous sample from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) and match the ediscs clusters to their most likelydescendants. we measure all lfs down to m m* + (2.5 - 3.5). at z&lt;0.8, thebright end of the lf is consistent with passive evolution but there is asignificant build-up of the faint end of the red sequence towards lowerredshift. there is a weak dependence of the lf on cluster velocity dispersionfor ediscs but no such dependence for the sdss clusters. we find tentativeevidence that red sequence galaxies brighter than a threshold magnitude arealready in place, and that this threshold evolves to fainter magnitudes towardlower redshifts. we compare the ediscs lfs with the lf of co-eval red sequencegalaxies in the field and find that the bright end of the lfs agree. however,relative to the number of bright red galaxies, the field has more faint redgalaxies than clusters at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8 but fewer at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6, implyingdifferential evolution. we compare the total light in the ediscs cluster redsequences to the total red sequence light in our sdss cluster sample. clustersat 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 must increase their luminosity on the red sequence (and thereforestellar mass in red galaxies) by a factor of 1-3 by z=0. the necessaryprocesses that add mass to the red sequence in clusters predict local clustersthat are over-luminous as compared to those observed in the sdss. the predictedcluster luminosities can be reconciled with observed local cluster luminositiesby combining multiple previously known effects.

0906.2012	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3:  comparison of stellar population synthesis codes and constraints from the  rest-frame nir	we present sed modeling of a sample of 34 k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3.these galaxies have nir spectroscopy that samples the rest-frame balmer/4000abreak as well as deep photometry in thirteen broadband filters. new to ouranalysis is irac data that extend the seds into the rest-frame nir. comparingparameters determined from sed fits with and without the irac data we find thatthe irac photometry significantly improves the confidence intervals of tau,a_v, stellar mass, and sfr for individual galaxies, but does not systematicallyalter the mean parameters of the sample. we use the irac data to assess howwell current stellar population synthesis codes describe the rest-frame nirseds of young galaxies where discrepancies between treatments of the tp-agbphase of stellar evolution are most pronounced. the models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), maraston (2005), and charlot &amp; bruzual (2008) all successfullyreproduce the seds of our galaxies with &lt; 5% differences in the quality of fit;however, the best-fit masses from each code differ systematically by as much asa factor of 1.5, and other parameters vary more, up to factors of 2-3. acomparison of best-fit stellar population parameters from different sps codes,dust laws, and metallicities shows that the choice of sps code is the largestsystematic uncertainty in most parameters, and that systematic uncertaintiesare typically larger than the formal random uncertainties. the sed fittingconfirms our previous result that galaxies with strongly suppressed starformation account for ~ 50% of the k-bright population at z ~ 2.3; however, theuncertainty in this fraction is large due to systematic differences in thessfrs derived from the three sps models.

0909.5182	how massive are massive compact galaxies?	using a sample of nine massive compact galaxies at z ~ 2.3 with rest-frameoptical spectroscopy and comprehensive u through 8um photometry we investigatehow assumptions in sed modeling change the stellar mass estimates of thesegalaxies, and how this affects our interpretation of their size evolution. theseds are fit to tau-models with a range of metallicities, dust laws, as well asdifferent stellar population synthesis codes. these models indicate massesequal to, or slightly smaller than our default masses. the maximum differenceis 0.16 dex for each parameter considered, and only 0.18 dex for the mostextreme combination of parameters. two-component populations with a maximallyold stellar population superposed with a young component provide reasonablefits to these seds using the models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003); however, usingmodels with updated treatment of tp-agb stars the fits are poorer. thetwo-component models predict masses that are 0.08 to 0.22 dex larger than thetau-models. we also test the effect of a bottom-light imf and find that itwould reduce the masses of these galaxies by 0.3 dex. considering the range ofallowable masses from the tau-models, two-component fits, and imf, we concludethat on average these galaxies lie below the mass-size relation of galaxies inthe local universe by a factor of 3-9, depending on the sed models used.

0912.0514	the growth of massive galaxies since z=2	we study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using datafrom the newfirm medium band survey. the sample is selected at a constantnumber density of n=2x10^-4 mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can becompared in a meaningful way. we show that the stellar mass of galaxies at thisnumber density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following therelation log(m)=11.45-0.15z. in order to determine at what physical radii thismass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame r-band images atredshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. these image stacks of typically 70-80galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surfacebrightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. we find that massive galaxiesgradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 gyr. the mass within aradius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpchas increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. parameterizing the surfacebrightness profiles we find that the effective radius and sersic n parameterevolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. the data demonstratethat massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extendedstellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radialdensity distributions. comparing the observed mass evolution to the averagestar formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likelydominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% ofthe mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. the main uncertainties in this study arepossible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses andthe conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.

1003.1706	z~7 galaxy candidates from nicmos observations over the hdf south and  the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields	we use ~88 arcmin**2 of deep (&gt;~26.5 mag at 5 sigma) nicmos data over the twogoods fields and the hdf south to conduct a search for bright z&gt;~7 galaxycandidates. this search takes advantage of an efficient preselection over 58arcmin**2 of nicmos h-band data where only plausible z&gt;~7 candidates arefollowed up with nicmos j-band observations. ~248 arcmin**2 of deepground-based near-infrared data (&gt;~25.5 mag, 5 sigma) is also considered in thesearch. in total, we report 15 z-dropout candidates over this area -- 7 ofwhich are new to these search fields. two possible z~9 j-dropout candidates arealso found, but seem unlikely to correspond to z~9 galaxies. the present z~9search is used to set upper limits on the prevalence of such sources. rigoroustesting is undertaken to establish the level of contamination of our selectionsby photometric scatter, low mass stars, supernovae (sne), and spurious sources.the estimated contamination rate of our z~7 selection is ~24%. through carefulsimulations, the effective volume available to our z&gt;~7 selections is estimatedand used to establish constraints on the volume density of luminous (l*(z=3),or -21 mag) galaxies from these searches. we find that the volume density ofluminous star-forming galaxies at z~7 is 13_{-5}^{+8}x lower than at z~4 and&gt;25x lower (1 sigma) at z~9 than at z~4. this is the most stringent constraintyet available on the volume density of &gt;~l* galaxies at z~9. the presentwide-area, multi-field search limits cosmic variance to &lt;20%. the evolution wefind at the bright end of the uv lf is similar to that found from recent subarusuprime-cam, hawk-i or ers wfc3/ir searches. the present paper also includes acomplete summary of our final z~7 z-dropout sample (18 candidates) identifiedfrom all nicmos observations to date (over the two goods fields, the hudf,galaxy clusters).

1003.3479	well-sampled far-infrared spectral energy distributions of z ~ 2  galaxies: evidence for scaled up cool galaxies	we present an analysis of the far-infrared (fir) spectral energydistributions (seds) of two massive k-selected galaxies at z = 2.122 and z =2.024 detected at 24um, 70um, 160um by spitzer, 250um, 350um, 500um by blast,and 870um by apex. the large wavelength range of these observations and theavailability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify thepeak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at ~ 300um. the seds of bothgalaxies are reasonably well fit by synthetic templates of local galaxies withl_ir ~ 10^{11} l_{sun} -- 10^{12} l_{sun} yet both galaxies have l_{ir} ~10^{13} l_{sun}. this suggests that these galaxies are not high redshiftanalogues of the hyper-lirgs/ulirgs used in local templates, but are instead"scaled up" versions of local ulirgs/lirgs. for both galaxies the starformation rate determined from the best-fit fir seds (sfr(l_{ir})) agrees withthe sfr determined from the dust corrected h-alpha luminosity (sfr(h-alpha)) towithin a factor of ~ 2; however, when the sfr of these galaxies is estimatedusing only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependenttemplate method (sfr(24um)), it systematically overestimates the sfr by as muchas a factor of 6. a larger sample of 24 k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3 drawnfrom the kriek et al. (2008) gnirs sample shows the same trend betweensfr(24um) and sfr(h-alpha). using that sample we show that sfr(24um) andsfr(h-alpha) are in better agreement when sfr(24um) is estimated using the logaverage of local templates rather than selecting a single luminosity-dependenttemplate, because this incorporates lower luminosity templates. the betteragreement between sfrs from lower luminosity templates suggests that the firseds of the blast-detected galaxies may be typical for massive galaxies at z ~2, and that the majority are scaled up versions of lower luminosity localgalaxies.

1008.4357	the spectral energy distribution of post-starburst galaxies in the  newfirm medium-band survey: a low contribution from tp-agb stars	stellar population synthesis (sps) models are a key ingredient of many galaxyevolution studies. unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated forcertain stellar evolution stages. of particular concern is the treatment of thethermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase, as differentimplementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as tp-agb stars arethought to be most prominently visible during this phase. here, we usepost-starburst galaxies in the newfirm medium-band survey to assess differentsps models. the available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous andwell-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0, from which weconstruct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (sed) over therange 1200-40 000 angstrom. the sed is well-fit by the bruzual &amp; charlot spsmodels, while the maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical andnear-infrared parts of the sed simultaneously. when the fitting is restrictedto lambda &lt; 6000 angstrom, the maraston models overpredict the near-infraredluminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to tp-agb stars.using the flexible sps models by conroy et al, and assuming solar metallicity,we find that the contribution of tp-agb stars to the integrated sed is a factorof ~3 lower than predicted by the latest padova tp-agb models. whether this isdue to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dustobscuration of tp-agb stars remains to be addressed. altogether, our datademand a low contribution from tp-agb stars to the sed of post-starburstgalaxies.

1009.0269	the most massive galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 in the newfirm medium-band  survey: properties and improved constraints on the stellar mass function	[abridged] we use the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) to characterize theproperties of a mass-complete sample of 14 galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 withm_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun, and to derive more accurate measurements of thehigh-mass end of the stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies at z=3.5, withsignificantly reduced contributions from photometric redshift errors and cosmicvariance to the total error budget of the smf. the typical very massive galaxyat z=3.5 is red and faint in the observer's optical, with median r=26.1, andrest-frame u-v=1.6. about 60% of the sample have optical colors satisfyingeither the u- or the b-dropout color criteria, although ~50% of these galaxieshave r&gt;25.5. about 30% of the sample has sfrs from sed modeling consistent withzero. however, &gt;80% of the sample is detected at 24 micron, with total infraredluminosities in the range (0.5-4.0)x10^13 lsun. this implies the presence ofeither dust-enshrouded starburst activity (with sfrs of 600-4300 msun/yr)and/or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). the contribution ofgalaxies with m_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun to the total stellar mass budget at z=3.5is ~8%. we find an evolution by a factor of 2-7 and 3-22 from z~5 and z~6,respectively, to z=3.5. the previously found disagreement at the high-mass endbetween observed and model-predicted smfs is now significant at the 3sigmalevel. however, systematic uncertainties dominate the total error budget, witherrors up to a factor of ~8 in the densities, bringing the observed smf inmarginal agreement with the predicted smf. additional systematic uncertaintieson the high-mass end could be introduced by either 1) the intensestar-formation and/or the very common agn activities as inferred from the mips24 micron detections, and/or 2) contamination by a significant population ofmassive, old, and dusty galaxies at z~2.6.

1104.2595	the number density and mass density of star-forming and quiescent  galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.2	we study the build-up of the bimodal galaxy population using the newfirmmedium-band survey, which provides excellent redshifts and well-sampledspectral energy distributions of ~27,000 galaxies with k&lt;22.8 at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.2.we first show that star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies can be robustlyseparated with a two-color criterion over this entire redshift range. we thenstudy the evolution of the number density and mass density of quiescent andstar-forming galaxies, extending the results of the combo-17, deep2, and othersurveys to z=2.2. the mass density of quiescent galaxies with m &gt; 3 10^11 solarmasses increases by a factor of ~10 from z=2 to the present day, whereas themass density in star-forming galaxies is flat or decreases over the same timeperiod. modest mass growth by a factor of 2 of individual quiescent galaxiescan explain roughly half of the strong density evolution at m&gt;10^11 solarmasses, due to the steepness of the exponential tail of the mass function. therest of the density evolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is likely due totransformation (e.g. quenching) of the massive star-forming population, aconclusion which is consistent with the density evolution we observe for thestar-forming galaxies themselves, which is flat or decreasing with cosmic time.modest mass growth does not explain the evolution of less massive quiescentgalaxies (~10^10.5 solar masses), which show a similarly steep increase intheir number densities. the less massive quiescent galaxies are thereforecontinuously formed by transforming galaxies from the star-forming population

1105.5642	the evolution of early-type galaxies selected by their spatial  clustering	aims: we present a new method that uses luminosity or stellar mass functionscombined with clustering measurements to select samples of galaxies atdifferent redshifts likely to follow a progenitor-to-descendant relationship.as the method uses clustering information, we refer to galaxy samples selectedthis way as clustering-selected samples. we apply this method to infer thenumber of mergers during the evolution of musyc early-type galaxies (etgs) fromz~1 to the present-day. methods: the method consists in using clusteringinformation to infer the typical dark-matter halo mass of the hosts of theselected progenitor galaxies. using lambdacdm predictions, it is then possibleto follow these haloes to a later time where the sample of descendants will bethat with the clustering of these descendant haloes. results: this techniqueshows that etgs at a given redshift evolve into brighter galaxies at lowerredshifts (considering rest-frame, passively evolved optical luminosities).this indicates that the stellar mass of these galaxies increases with time andthat, in principle, a stellar mass selection at different redshifts does notprovide samples of galaxies in a progenitor-descendant relationship.conclusions: the comparison between high redshift etgs and their likelydescendants at z=0 points to a higher number density for the progenitors by afactor 5.5+-4.0, implying the need for mergers to decrease their number densityby today. because the luminosity densities of progenitors and descendants areconsistent, our results show no need for significant star-formation in etgssince z=1, which indicates that the needed mergers are dry, i.e. gas free.

1112.0006	the evolution of the rest-frame j- and h-band luminosity function of  galaxies to z=3.5	we present the rest-frame j- and h-band luminosity function (lf) of fieldgalaxies, based on a deep multi-wavelength composite sample from the musyc,fires and fireworks survey public catalogues, covering a total area of 450arcmin^2. the availability of flux measurements in the spitzer irac 3.6, 4.5,5.8, and 8 um channels allows us to compute absolute magnitudes in therest-frame j and h bands up to z=3.5 minimizing the dependence on the stellarevolution models. we compute the lf in the four redshift bins 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.0,2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5, 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.0 and 3.0&lt;z&lt;3.5. combining our results with those alreadyavailable at lower redshifts, we find that (1) the faint end slope isconsistent with being constant up to z=3.5, with alpha=-1.05+/-0.03 for therest-frame j band and alpha=-1.15+/-0.02 for the rest-frame h band; (2) thenormalization phi* decreases by a factor of 6 between z=0 and z~1.75 and by afactor 3 between z~1.75 and z=3.25; (3) the characteristic magnitude m* shows abrightening from z=0 to z~2 followed by a slow dimming to z=3.25. we finallycompute the luminosity density (ld) in both rest-frame j and h bands. theanalysis of our results together with those available in the literature showsthat the ld is approximately constant up to z~1, and it then decreases by afactor of 6 up to z=3.5.

1204.2829	3d-hst: a wide-field grism spectroscopic survey with the hubble space  telescope	we present 3d-hst, a near-infrared spectroscopic treasury program with thehubble space telescope for studying the processes that shape galaxies in thedistant universe. 3d-hst provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of~7000 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, the epoch when 60% of all star formation took place,the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars,and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged.3d-hst will cover 3/4 (625 sq.arcmin) of the candels survey area with twoorbits of primary wfc3/g141 grism coverage and two to four parallel orbits withthe acs/g800l grism. in the ir these exposure times yield a continuumsignal-to-noise of ~5 per resolution element at h~23.1 and a 5sigma emissionline sensitivity of 5x10-17 erg/s/cm2 for typical objects, improving by afactor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. thewfc3/g141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1-1.6 um at aspatial resolution of ~0."13, which, combined with their depth, makes them aunique resource for studying galaxy evolution. we present the preliminaryreduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission line andredshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra andphotometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. the present analysisyields redshift estimates with a precision of sigma(z)=0.0034(1+z), orsigma(v)~1000 km/s. we illustrate how the generalized nature of the surveyyields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types ofobjects, including a quasar at z=4.7, quiescent galaxies at z~2, and the mostdistant t-type brown dwarf star known. the candels and 3d-hst surveys combinedwill provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic dataset for studies ofthe 1&lt;z&lt;3.5 universe until the launch of the james webb space telescope.

1207.3795	3d-hst grism spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed, low-metallicity  starburst galaxy at z=1.847	we present hubble space telescope (hst) imaging and spectroscopy of thegravitational lens sl2sj02176-0513, a cusp arc at z=1.847. the uv continuum ofthe lensed galaxy is very blue, which is seemingly at odds with its redderoptical colors. the 3d-hst wfc3/g141 near-infrared spectrum of the lens revealsthe source of this discrepancy to be extremely strong [oiii]5007 and h-betaemission lines with rest-frame equivalent widths of 2000 +/- 100 and 520 +/- 40angstroms, respectively. the source has a stellar mass ~10^8 msun, ssfr \sim100/gyr, and detection of [oiii]4363 yields a metallicity of 12 + log(o/h) =7.5 +/- 0.2. we identify local blue compact dwarf analogs to sl2sj02176-0513,which are among the most metal-poor galaxies in the sdss. the local analogsresemble the lensed galaxy in many ways, including uv/optical sed, spatialmorphology and emission line equivalent widths and ratios. common tosl2sj02176-0513 and its local counterparts is an upturn at mid-ir wavelengthslikely arising from hot dust heated by starbursts. the emission lines ofsl2sj02176-0513 are spatially resolved owing to the combination of the lens andthe high spatial resolution of hst. the lensed galaxy is composed of two clumpswith combined size r_e \sim 300 pc, and we resolve significant differences inuv color and emission line equivalent width between them. though it hascharacteristics occasionally attributed to active galactic nuclei, we concludethat sl2sj02176-0513 is a low-metallicity star-bursting dwarf galaxy. suchgalaxies will be found in significant numbers in the full 3d-hst grism survey.

1208.0341	hst/wfc3 confirmation of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies at  0&lt;z&lt;2 and identification of their star forming progenitors at z~3	we study the structural evolution of massive galaxies by linking progenitorsand descendants at a constant cumulative number density of n_c=1.4x10^{-4}mpc^{-3} to z~3. structural parameters were measured by fitting sersic profilesto high resolution candels hst wfc3 j_{125} and h_{160} imaging in theukidss-uds at 1&lt;z&lt;3 and acs i_{814} imaging in cosmos at 0.25&lt;z&lt;1. at a givenredshift, we selected the hst band that most closely samples a commonrest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients ingalaxies. at fixed n_c, galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 fromz~3 to z~0. the size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant insize from z~3 to z~2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. the evolution inthe surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r&lt;2 kpcwas in place by z~2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at largerradii. this inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the largersizes and higher sersic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. at z&lt;2,the effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r_e m^{2.0}, consistentwith scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver ofsize evolution. the progenitors at z~3 were likely star-forming disks withr_e~2 kpc, based on their low sersic index of n~1, low median axis ratio ofb/a~0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the u-v versus v-jdiagram. by z~1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise tocompact quiescent galaxies. toward lower redshifts, these galaxies continued toassemble mass at larger radii and became the local ellipticals that dominatethe high mass end of the mass function at the present epoch.

1211.0280	a strongly-lensed massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy at z ~ 2.4 in  the cosmos/ultravista field	we report the discovery of a massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy that hasbeen strongly-lensed into multiple images by a foreground galaxy at z = 0.960.this system was serendipitously discovered as a set of extremely ks-brighthigh-redshift galaxies with red j - ks colors using new data from theultravista yjhks near-infrared survey. the system was also previouslyidentified as an optically-faint lens/source system using the cosmos acsimaging by faure et al. (2008, 2011). photometric redshifts for the threebrightest images of the source galaxy determined from twenty-seven bandphotometry place the source at z = 2.4 +/- 0.1. we provide an updated lensmodel for the system which is a good fit to the positions and morphologies ofthe galaxies in the acs image. the lens model implies that the magnification ofthe three brightest images is a factor of 4 - 5. we use the lens model,combined with the ks-band image to constrain the size and sersic profile of thegalaxy. the best-fit model is an ultra-compact galaxy (re =0.64^{+0.08}_{-0.18} kpc, lensing-corrected), with a sersic profile that isintermediate between a disk and bulge profile (n = 2.2^{+2.3}_{-0.9}). wepresent aperture photometry for the source galaxy images which have beencorrected for flux contamination from the central lens. the best-fit stellarpopulation model is a massive galaxy (log(m_{star}/m_{sol}) =10.8^{+0.1}_{-0.1}, lensing-corrected) with an age of 1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.4} gyr,moderate dust extinction (av = 0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6}), and a low specific starformation rate (log(ssfr) &lt; -11.0 yr^{-1}). this is typical of massive"red-and-dead" galaxies at this redshift and confirms that this source is thefirst bona fide strongly-lensed massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy to bediscovered. we conclude with a discussion of the prospects of finding a largersample of these galaxies.

1304.2391	the assembly of milky way-like galaxies since z~2.5	galaxies with the mass of the milky way dominate the stellar mass density ofthe universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. here westudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3d-hstand candels treasury surveys. we find that galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of log(m)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with mostof the star formation occurring before z=1. in marked contrast to the assemblyhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to largeradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. we therefore rule out simple models in whichbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed aroundthem. instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. we find that afterz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continuedto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

1304.5525	the environmental dependence of the stellar mass function at z~1:  comparing cluster and field between the gclass and ultravista surveys	we present the stellar mass functions (smfs) of star-forming and quiescentgalaxies from observations of 10 rich clusters in the gemini clusterastrophysics spectroscopic survey (gclass) in the redshift range 0.86&lt;z&lt;1.34.we compare our results with field measurements at similar redshifts using datafrom a ks-band selected catalogue of the cosmos/ultravista field. we constructa ks-band selected multi-colour catalogue for the clusters in 11 photometricbands covering u-8um, and estimate photometric redshifts and stellar massesusing sed fitting techniques. to correct for interlopers in our cluster sample,we use the deep spectroscopic component of gclass, which contains spectra for1282 identified cluster and field galaxies taken with gemini/gmos. both thephotometric and spectroscopic samples are sufficiently deep that we can probethe smf down to masses of 10^10 msun. we distinguish between star-forming andquiescent galaxies using the rest-frame u-v versus v-j diagram, and find thatthe best-fitting schechter parameters alpha and m* are similar within theuncertainties for these galaxy types within the different environments.however, there is a significant difference in the shape and normalisation ofthe total smf between the clusters and the field sample. this difference in thetotal smf is primarily a reflection of the increased fraction of quiescentgalaxies in high-density environments. we apply a simple quenching model thatincludes components of mass- and environment-driven quenching, and find that inthis picture 45% of the star-forming galaxies, which normally would be formingstars in the field, are quenched by the cluster. if galaxies in clusters andthe field quench their star formation via different mechanisms, these processeshave to conspire in such a way that the shapes of the quiescent andstar-forming smf remain similar in these different environments.

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1306.2496	vlt/x-shooter near-infrared spectroscopy and hst imaging of  gravitationally-lensed z~2 compact quiescent galaxies	quiescent massive galaxies at z~2 are thought to be the progenitors ofpresent-day massive ellipticals. observations revealed them to beextraordinarily compact. the determination of stellar ages, star formationrates and dust properties via spectroscopic measurements has up to now onlybeen feasible for the most luminous and massive specimens (~3x m*). here wepresent a spectroscopic study of two near-infrared selected galaxies which areclose to the characteristic stellar mass m* (~0.9x m* and ~1.3x m*) and whoseobserved brightness has been boosted by the gravitational lensing effect. wemeasure the redshifts of the two galaxies to be z=1.71\pm0.02 andz=2.15\pm0.01. by fitting stellar population synthesis models to theirspectro-photometric seds we determine their ages to be 2.4^{+0.8}_{-0.6} gyrand 1.7\pm0.3 gyr, respectively, which implies that the two galaxies havehigher mass-to-light ratios than most quiescent z~2 galaxies in other studies.we find no direct evidence for active star-formation or agn activity in eitherof the two galaxies, based on the non-detection of emission lines. based on thederived redshifts and stellar ages we estimate the formation redshifts to bez=4.3^{+3.4}_{-1.2} and z=4.3^{+1.0}_{-0.6}, respectively. we use the increasedspatial resolution due to the gravitational lensing to derive constraints onthe morphology. fitting sersic profiles to the de-lensed images of the twogalaxies confirms their compactness, with one of them being spheroid-like, andthe other providing the first confirmation of a passive lenticular galaxy at aspectroscopically derived redshift z~2.

1306.4406	on the formation time scale of massive cluster ellipticals based on deep  near-ir spectroscopy at z~2	we present improved constraints on the formation time scale of massivecluster galaxies based on rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies in a formingcluster located at z=2.16. the spectra are obtained with moircs on the subarutelescope with an integration time of ~7 hours. we achieve accurate redshiftmeasurements by fitting seds using the spectra and broad-band photometrysimultaneously, allowing us to identify probable cluster members. clusters atlow redshifts are dominated by quiescent galaxies, but we find that quiescentgalaxies and star forming galaxies co-exist in this z=2 system. interestingly,the quiescent galaxies form a weak red sequence in the process of forming. bystacking the spectra of star forming galaxies, we observe strong emission linessuch as [oii] and [oiii] and we obtain a tentative hint of agn activities inthese galaxies. on the other hand, the stacked spectrum of the quiescentgalaxies reveals a clear 4000a break with a possible caii h+k absorptionfeature and strong emission lines such as [oii] are absent in the spectrum,confirming the quiescent nature of these galaxies. we then perform detailedspectral analyses of the stacked spectrum, which suggest that these massivequiescent galaxies formed at redshifts between 3 and 4 on a time scale of &lt;~0.5gyr. this short formation time scale is not reproduced in recent numericalsimulations. we discuss possible mechanisms for how these galaxies form 10^11msun stellar mass on a short time scale and become red and quiescent by z=2.

1308.3232	using cumulative number densities to compare galaxies across cosmic time	comparing galaxies across redshifts at fixed cumulative number density is apopular way to estimate the evolution of specific galaxy populations. thismethod ignores scatter in mass accretion histories and galaxy-galaxy mergers,which can lead to errors when comparing galaxies over large redshift ranges(delta z &gt; 1). we use abundance matching in the lcdm paradigm to estimate themedian change in number density with redshift and provide a simple fit (+0.16dex per unit delta z) for progenitors of z = 0 galaxies. we find that galaxydescendants do not evolve in the same way as galaxy progenitors, largely due toscatter in mass accretion histories. we also provide estimates for the 1-sigmarange of number densities corresponding to galaxy progenitors and descendants.finally, we discuss some limits on number density comparisons, which arise dueto difficulties measuring physical quantities (e.g., stellar mass) consistentlyacross redshifts. a public tool to calculate number density evolution forgalaxies, as well as approximate halo masses, is available online.

1308.4132	how dead are dead galaxies? mid-infrared fluxes of quiescent galaxies at  redshift 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5: implications for star formation rates and dust  heating	we investigate the star formation rates of quiescent galaxies at highredshift (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5) using 3d-hst wfc3 grism spectroscopy and spitzermid-infrared data. we select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely useduvj color-color criteria. spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frameoptical and near-ir) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescentgalaxies (ssfr ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). however, sed fitting can miss star formation ifit is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emittedin the mid-infrared. it is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscuredsfrs with a mid-ir indicator. we stack the mips-24um images of quiescentobjects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 andperform aperture photometry. including direct 24um detections, we find ssfr ~10^-11.9 * (1+z)^4 yr^-1. these values are higher than those indicated by sedfitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typicalstar forming galaxies. the true sfrs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower,as we show that the mid-ir fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoingstar formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations andcircumstellar dust. our measurements show that star formation quenching is veryefficient at every redshift. the measured sfr values are at z &gt; 1.5 marginallyconsistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass lossfrom evolved stars refuels star formation) and well above that at lowerredshifts.

1402.0003	the progenitors of local ultra-massive galaxies across cosmic time: from  dusty star-bursting to quiescent stellar populations	using the ultravista catalogs, we investigate the evolution in the 11.4~gyrsince $z=3$ of the progenitors of local ultra-massive galaxies ($\log{(m_{\rmstar}/m_{\odot})}\approx11.8$; umgs), providing a complete and consistentpicture of how the most massive galaxies at $z=0$ have assembled. by selectingthe progenitors with a semi-empirical approach using abundance matching, weinfer a growth in stellar mass of 0.56$^{+0.35}_{-0.25}$ dex,0.45$^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$~dex, and 0.27$^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$ dex from $z=3$, $z=2$,and $z=1$, respectively, to $z=0$. at $z&lt;1$, the progenitors of umgs constitutea homogeneous population of only quiescent galaxies with old stellarpopulations. at $z&gt;1$, the contribution from star-forming galaxiesprogressively increases, with the progenitors at $2&lt;z&lt;3$ being dominated bymassive ($m_{\rm star} \approx 2 \times 10^{11}$m$_{\odot}$), dusty ($a_{\rmv}\sim$1--2.2 mag), star-forming (sfr$\sim$100--400~m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$)galaxies with a large range in stellar ages. at $z=2.75$, $\sim$15\% of theprogenitors are quiescent, with properties typical of post-starburst galaxieswith little dust extinction and strong balmer break, and showing a largescatter in color. our findings indicate that at least half of the stellarcontent of local umgs was assembled at $z&gt;1$, whereas the remaining wasassembled via merging from $z\sim 1$ to the present. most of the quenching ofthe star-forming progenitors happened between $z=2.75$ and $z=1.25$, in goodagreement with the typical formation redshift and scatter in age of $z=0$ umgsas derived from their fossil records. the progenitors of local umgs, includingthe star-forming ones, never lived on the blue cloud since $z=3$. we propose analternative path for the formation of local umgs that refines previouslyproposed pictures and that is fully consistent with our findings.

0802.4094	confirmation of the remarkable compactness of massive quiescent galaxies  at z~2.3: early-type galaxies did not form in a simple monolithic collapse	using deep near-infrared spectroscopy kriek et al. (2006) found that ~45% ofmassive galaxies at z~2.3 have evolved stellar populations and little or noongoing star formation. here we determine the sizes of these quiescent galaxiesusing deep, high-resolution images obtained with hst/nic2 and laser guidestar-assisted keck/ao. considering that their median stellar mass is 1.7x10^11solar masses the galaxies are remarkably small, with a median effective radiusof 0.9 kpc. galaxies of similar mass in the nearby universe have sizes of ~5kpc and average stellar densities which are two orders of magnitude lower thanthe z~2.3 galaxies. these results extend earlier work at z~1.5 and confirmprevious studies at z&gt;2 which lacked spectroscopic redshifts and imaging ofsufficient resolution to resolve the galaxies. our findings demonstrate thatfully assembled early-type galaxies make up at most ~10% of the population ofk-selected quiescent galaxies at z~2.3, effectively ruling out simplemonolithic models for their formation. the galaxies must evolve significantlyafter z~2.3, through dry mergers or other processes, consistent withpredictions from hierarchical models.

1404.4874	dense cores in galaxies out to z=2.5 in sdss, ultravista, and the five  3d-hst/candels fields	the dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguingenvironments in the universe. in this paper we ask when these dense cores wereformed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. we selectgalaxies that have a stellar mass &gt;3x10^10 msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,using the 3d-hst survey and data at low redshift. remarkably, the numberdensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 tothe present. this decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and theresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. we inferthat dense cores were mostly formed at z&gt;2.5, consistent with their largelyquiescent stellar populations. while the cores appear to form early, thegalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total massesincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radiiincrease by a factor of 5-6. as a result, the contribution of dense cores tothe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% atz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. because of their early formation, the contribution ofdense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strongfunction of redshift. the stars in cores with m_1kpc&gt;3x10^10 msun make up ~0.1%of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, dependingon their imf. the formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11msun of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant starformation at larger radii.

0803.0763	the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc): wide k-band imaging,  photometric catalogs, clustering and physical properties of galaxies at z~2	we present k-band imaging of two ~30'x30' fields covered by the musyc widenir survey. the 1030 and 1255 fields were imaged with ispi on the 4m blancotelescope at ctio to a 5 sigma point-source limiting depth of k~20 (vega).combining this data with the musyc optical ubvriz imaging, we createdmulti-band k-selected source catalogs for both fields. these catalogs, togetherwith the musyc k-band catalog of the ecdf-s field, were used to select k&lt;20 bzkgalaxies over an area of 0.71 deg^2. this is the largest area ever surveyed forbzk galaxies. we present number counts, redshift distributions and stellarmasses for our sample of 3261 bzk galaxies (2502 star-forming (sbzk) and 759passively evolving (pbzk)), as well as reddening and star formation rateestimates for the star-forming bzk systems. we also present 2-point angularcorrelation functions and spatial correlation lengths for both sbzk and pbzkgalaxies and show that previous estimates of the correlation function of thesegalaxies were affected by cosmic variance due to the small areas surveyed. wehave measured correlation lengths r_0 of 8.89+/-2.03 mpc and 10.82+/-1.72 mpcfor sbzk and pbzk galaxies respectively. this is the first reported measurementof the spatial correlation function of passive bzk galaxies. in the lambdacdmscenario of galaxy formation, these correlation lengths at z~2 translate intominimum masses of ~4x10^{12} m_sun and ~9x10^{12} m_sun for the dark matter(dm) halos hosting sbzk and pbzk galaxies respectively. the clusteringproperties of the galaxies in our sample are consistent with them being thedescendants of bright lbg at z~3, and the progenitors of present-day &gt;1l*galaxies.

1406.0002	spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra massive and compact galaxy at  z=3.35: a detailed look at an early progenitor of local most massive  ellipticals	we present the first spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy atredshift z&gt;3 using data from keck-nirspec, vlt-xshooter, and gtc-osiris. wedetect strong [oiii] and ly$\alpha$ emission, and weak [oii], civ, and heii,placing c1-23152 at a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{spec}$=3.351. the modelingof the emission-line corrected spectral energy distribution results in abest-fit stellar mass of $m_{*}=3.1^{+0.6}_{-0.7}\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$, astar-formation rate of &lt;7 $m_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, and negligible dust extinction.the stars appear to have formed in a short intense burst ~300-500 myr prior tothe observation epoch, setting the formation redshift of this galaxy at z~4.1.from the analysis of the line ratios and widths, and the observed flux at24$\mu$m, we confirm the presence of a luminous hidden active galactic nucleus(agn), with bolometric luminosity of ~$10^{46}erg s^{-1}$. potentialcontamination to the observed sed from the agn continuum is constrained,placing a lower limit on the stellar mass of $2\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$.hst/wfc3 $h_{160}$ and acs $i_{814}$ images are modeled, resulting in aneffective radius of $r_{e}$~1 kpc in the $h_{160}$ band and a sersic indexn~4.4. this object may be a prototype of the progenitors of local most massiveelliptical galaxies in the first 2 gyr of cosmic history, having formed most ofits stars at z&gt;4 in a highly dissipative, intense, and short burst of starformation. c1-23152 is completing its transition to a post-starburst phasewhile hosting a powerful agn, potentially responsible for the quenching of thestar formation activity.

1408.3416	stellar mass functions of galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;7 from an irac-selected sample  in cosmos/ultravista: limits on the abundance of very massive galaxies	we build a spitzer irac complete catalog of objects, obtained bycomplementing the $k_\mathrm{s}$-band selected ultravista catalog with objectsdetected in irac only. with the aim of identifying massive (i.e.,$\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$) galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;7$, we consider the systematic effectson the measured photometric redshifts from the introduction of an old and dustysed template and from the introduction of a bayesian prior taking into accountthe brightness of the objects, as well as the systematic effects from differentstar formation histories (sfhs) and from nebular emission lines in the recoveryof stellar population parameters. we show that our results are most affected bythe bayesian luminosity prior, while nebular emission lines and sfhs onlyintroduce a small dispersion in the measurements. specifically, the number of$4&lt;z&lt;7$ galaxies ranges from 52 to 382 depending on the adopted configuration.using these results we investigate, for the first time, the evolution of themassive end of the stellar mass functions (smfs) at $4&lt;z&lt;7$. given the rarityof very massive galaxies in the early universe, major contributions to thetotal error budget come from cosmic variance and poisson noise. the smfobtained without the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior does notshow any evolution from $z\sim6.5$ to $z\sim 3.5$, implying that massivegalaxies could already be present when the universe was $\sim0.9$~gyr old.however, the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior reduces the numberof $z&gt;4$ galaxies with best fit masses $\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$ by 83%, implyinga rapid growth of very massive galaxies in the first 1.5 gyr of cosmic history.from the stellar-mass complete sample, we identify one candidate of a verymassive ($\log(m_*/m_\odot)\sim11.5$), quiescent galaxy at $z\sim5.4$, withmips $24\mu$m detection suggesting the presence of a powerful obscured agn.

1411.2597	on the intermediate-redshift central stellar mass-halo mass relation,  and implications for the evolution of the most massive galaxies since z~1	the stellar mass-halo mass relation is a key constraint in all semi-analytic,numerical, and semi-empirical models of galaxy formation and evolution.however, its exact shape and redshift dependence remain debated. several recentworks support a relation in the local universe steeper than previously thought.based on the comparisons with a variety of data on massive central galaxies, weshow that this steepening holds up to z~1, for stellar masses mstar&gt;2e11 msun.specifically, we find significant evidence for a high-mass end slope of\beta&gt;0.35-0.70, instead of the usual \beta~0.20-0.30 reported by a number ofprevious results. when including the independent constraints from the recentboss clustering measurements, the data, independent of any systematic errors instellar masses, tend to favor a model with a very small scatter (&lt; 0.15 dex) instellar mass at fixed halo mass, in the redshift range z &lt; 0.8 and formstar&gt;3e11 msun, suggesting a close connection between massive galaxies andhost halos even at relatively recent epochs. we discuss the implications of ourresults with respect to the evolution of the most massive galaxies since z~1.

1509.00486	mergers and star formation: the environment and stellar mass growth of  the progenitors of ultra-massive galaxies since z = 2	the growth of galaxies is a key problem in understanding the structure andevolution of the universe. galaxies grow their stellar mass by a combination ofstar formation and mergers, with a relative importance that is redshiftdependent. theoretical models predict quantitatively different contributionsfrom the two channels; measuring these from the data is a crucial constraint.exploiting the ultravista catalog and a unique sample of progenitors of localultra massive galaxies selected with an abundance matching approach, wequantify the role of the two mechanisms from z=2 to 0. we also compare ourresults to two independent incarnations of semi-analytic models. at allredshifts, progenitors are found in a variety of environments, ranging frombeing isolated to having 5-10 companions with mass ratio at least 1:10 within aprojected radius of 500 kpc. in models, progenitors have a systematicallylarger number of companions, entailing a larger mass growth for mergers than inobservations, at all redshifts. generally, in both observations and models, theinferred and the expected mass growth roughly agree, within the uncertainties.overall, our analysis confirms the model predictions, showing how the growthhistory of massive galaxies is dominated by in situ star formation at z~2, bothstar-formation and mergers at 1&lt;z&lt;2, and by mergers alone at z&lt;1. nonetheless,detailed comparisons still point out to tensions between the expected massgrowth and our results, which might be due to either an incorrectprogenitors-descendants selection, uncertainties on star formation rate andmass estimates, or the adopted assumptions on merger rates.

(2014)photometric catalogs. the 2d spectra and the multi-band photometry were fitsimultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking themorphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. the resulting catalog has98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to $jh_{ir}\leq 26$ and22,548 with $jh_{ir}\leq 24$, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.of this sample 5,459 galaxies are at $z&gt;1.5$ and 9,621 are at $0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5$,where h$\alpha$ falls in the g141 wavelength coverage. based on comparisonswith ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxiesand repeat observations, the typical redshift error for $jh_{ir}\leq 24$galaxies in our catalog is $\sigma_z \approx 0.003 \times (1+z)$, i.e., onenative wfc3 pixel. the $3\sigma$ limit for emission line fluxes of pointsources is $1.5\times10^{-17}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. we show variousrepresentations of the full dataset, as well as individual examples thathighlight the range of spectra that we find in the survey.

astro-ph;0412388	probing the nuclear obscuration in radio-galaxies with near infrared  imaging	we present the first near-infrared (k'-band) homogeneous observations of acomplete sub-sample of the 3cr radio catalogue comprising all high excitationgalaxies (hegs) at z&lt;0.3. after showing that the surface brightnessdecomposition technique to measure central point-like sources is affected bysignificant uncertainties for the objects in the studied sample, we present anew, more accurate method based on the r-k' color profile. via this method wefind a substantial nuclear k'-band excess in all but two hegs -- most likelydirectly associated to their nuclear emission -- and we measure thecorresponding 2.12 $\mu$m nuclear luminosities. within the frame of theunification scheme for radio-loud active galactic nuclei, it appears thatobscuration alone is not able to account for the different nuclear propertiesof the majority of the hegs and broad line radio galaxies (blrgs), and alsoscattering of the (optically) hidden nuclear light from a compact region mustbe invoked. more precisely, for ~70% of the hegs the observed point-likeoptical emission is dominated by the scattered component, while in the k'-bandboth scattered and direct light passing through the torus contribute to theobserved nuclear luminosity. the estimated fraction of scattered light rangesfrom a few tenths to a few percent, while the torus extinction is between15&lt;a_{v,torus}&lt;50 mag with only a few exceptions with lower obscuration.

astro-ph;0603063	direct measurements of the stellar continua and balmer/4000 angstrom  breaks of red z&gt;2 galaxies: redshifts and improved constraints on stellar  populations	we use near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy obtained with gnirs on gemini,nirspec on keck, and isaac on the vlt to study the rest-frame optical continuaof three `distant red galaxies' (having js - ks &gt; 2.3) at z&gt;2. all three galaxyspectra show the balmer/4000 angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. thespectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum withan estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. these redshifts agree well withthe emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with halpha emission. thistechnique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in therest-frame uv, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selectedin optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. furthermore, weuse the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of halpha together withevolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,dust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. inclusionof the nir spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range ofpossible solutions for stellar population properties. we find that the stellarpopulations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dustystarburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxywith a strong break and no detected line emission. the dusty starburst galaxyhas an age of 0.3 gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11 msun. the spectra of thetwo most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3-1.4 gyr and stellar masses of4*10^11 msun. the large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthensour previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry. largersamples are required to determine the relative frequency of dusty starburstsand (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.

0811.1773	the evolution of the stellar mass function of galaxies from z=4.0 and  the first comprehensive analysis of its uncertainties: evidence for  mass-dependent evolution	[abridged] we present the evolution of the stellar mass function (smf) ofgalaxies from z=4.0 to z=1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deepnir musyc, the fires, and the goods-cdfs surveys, all having very high-qualityoptical to mid-infrared data. this sample, unique in that it combines data fromsurveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way,allowed us to 1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance andempirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; 2)simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to ~0.05times the characteristic stellar mass) of the smf with good statistics; and 3)empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass.we provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random andsystematic uncertainties affecting the derived smfs. we find that the massdensity evolves by a factor of ~17(+7,-10) since z=4.0, mostly driven by achange in the normalization phi*. if only random errors are taken into account,we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolvingmore rapidly than the high-mass end. however, we show that this result is nolonger robust when systematic uncertainties due to the sed-modeling assumptionsare taken into account. taking our results at face value, we find that they arein conflict with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. the models predictsmfs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too fewhigh-mass galaxies. the discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible touncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-massend may be more difficult to explain.
