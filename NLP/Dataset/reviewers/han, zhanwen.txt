0903.3776	primordial binary evolution and blue stragglers	in this paper, we systematically studied blue stragglers produced fromprimordial binary evolution via a binary population synthesis approach, andexamined their contribution to the integrated spectral energy distributions ofthe host clusters. the mass transfer efficiency, $\beta$, is an importantparameter for the final products (then blue stragglers) after mass transfer,and it is set to be 0.5 except for case a binary evolution. the study showsthat primordial binary evolution may produce blue stragglers at any given timesand that different evolutionary channels are corresponding for blue stragglersin different visual magnitude regions (in v band) on the colour-magnitudediagram (cmd) of clusters. the specific frequency of blue stragglers obtainedfrom primordial binary evolution decreases with time first, and then increasesagain when the age is larger than 10gyr, while that from angular momentum lossinduced by magnetic braking in low-mass binaries increases with time andexceeds that of primordial binary evolution in a population older than 3 gyr.meanwhile, blue stragglers resulting from primordial binary evolution aredominant contributors to the iseds in ultraviolet and blue bands in apopulation between 0.3 and 2.0 gyr. the value of $\beta$ significantly affectson the final results. for old open clusters, the assumption of $\beta =1$ whenthe primary is in hg at the onset of mass transfer matches the observationsbetter than that of $\beta =0.5$ from the locations of bss on the cmds. ourstudy also shows that, for most galactic open clusters, the specific frequencyof blue stragglers obtained from our simulations is lower than that ofobservations, which is puzzling.

0904.0502	the energy transfer and its effects on the secondaries in w ursae  majoris-type contact binaries	the energy transfer of w uma contact binaries and its effects on thesecondary in w uma contact binaries are investigated. relations are givenbetween the mass ratio (q) and the relative energy transfer rates, i.e. u1, theratio of the transferred luminosity to the surface luminosity of the primaryand u2, the ratio of the transferred luminosity to the nuclear luminosity ofthe secondary. the theoretical curves(u1 vs q and u2 vs q) are derived.although these curves can reflect the distribution of u1 vs q and u2 vs q, someobservational systems are significantly deviated from these curves. it ismainly resulted from the difference in the effective temperatures of thecomponents in w uma systems.the radius and the density of the secondary arerelated to the relative energy tran-sfer rate u2: the higher is u2, the greateris the expansion and the lower is the density of the secondaries in w umasystems. the temperature difference of w uma binary components is correlatedwith the relative energy transfer rate u1 and decreases with increasing u1.this might suggest that there is a thermal coupling between two components in wuma contact binaries, and that the classif-ication of w uma contact binariesinto a- or w-types depends on the energy tran-sfer from the primary to thesecondary. the temperature difference of w uma bin-ary components is poorlycorrelated with the mass of the primary. this suggests that the properties ofthe common envelope of w uma contact binaries might not have a significanteffect on the energy transfer between two components.

0704.1202	colour pairs for constraining the age and metallicity of stellar  populations	using a widely used stellar population synthesis model, we study the abilityof using pairs of ab system colours to break the well-known stellarage--metallicity degeneracy and give constraints on the two stellar-populationparameters (age and metallicity). the relative age and metallicitysensitivities of ab system colours that relate to u, b, g, v, r, r, i, i, z, j,h, and k bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs forbreaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertaintyparameter (up) method. our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can beused to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. this will bevery useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. indetail, colour pairs [(r-k), (u-r)] and [(r-k), (u-r)] are shown to be the bestpairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. they can constrain twostellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertaintiesin colours. some other colour pairs, such as [(r-k), (u-r)], [(i-k), (u-r)],[(r-k), (u-r)] and [(i-j), (u-r)], can possibly be used for constraining thetwo parameters, too. as a whole, our results suggest that colours relating toboth ubvrijhk and ugriz magnitudes are much better than either ubvrijhk coloursor ugriz colours for breaking the well-known degeneracy. the results also showthat the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies observed by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) and the two-micron all-sky survey (2mass) can beestimated via photometry data. it is also shown that the colours can be used inconjunction with line indices to measure stellar-population parameters.

0706.3426	distribution of $^{56}$ni yields of type ia supernovae and its  implication for progenitors	the amount of $^{56}$ni produced in type ia supernova (sn ia) explosion isprobably the most important physical parameter underlying the observedcorrelation of sn ia luminosities with their light curves. based on anempirical relation between the $^{56}$ni mass and the light curve parameter$\triangle m_{15}$, we obtained rough estimates of the $^{56}$ni mass for alarge sample of nearby sne ia with the aim of exploring the diversity in sn ia.we found that the derived $^{56}$ni masses for different sne ia could vary by afactor of ten (e.g., $m_{\rm ni}=0.1 - 1.3$ $m_{\odot}$), which cannot beexplained in terms of the standard chandrasekhar-mass model (with a $^{56}$nimass production of 0.4 -- 0.8 $m_{\odot}$). different explosion and/orprogenitor models are clearly required for various sne ia, in particular, forthose extremely nickel-poor and nickel-rich producers. the nickel-rich (with$m_{\rm ni}$ $&gt;$ 0.8 $m_{\odot}$) sne ia are very luminous and may have massiveprogenitors exceeding the chandrasekhar-mass limit since extra progenitor fuelis required to produce more $^{56}$ni to power the light curve. this is alsoconsistent with the finding that the intrinsically bright sne ia prefer tooccur in stellar environments of young and massive stars. for example, 75% sneia in spirals have $\delta m_{15} &lt; 1.2$ while this ratio is only 18% in e/s0galaxies. on the other hand, the nickel-poor sne ia (with $m_{\rm ni}$ $&lt;$ 0.2$m_{\odot}$) may invoke the sub-chandrasekhar model, as most of them were foundin early-type e/s0 galaxies dominated by the older and low-mass stellarpopulations. this indicates that sne ia in spiral and e/s0 galaxies haveprogenitors of different properties.

1001.4539	observations of doppler boosting in kepler lightcurves	among the initial results from kepler were two striking lightcurves, for koi74 and koi 81, in which the relative depths of the primary and secondaryeclipses showed that the more compact, less luminous object was hotter than itsstellar host. that result became particularly intriguing because a substellarmass had been derived for the secondary in koi 74, which would make the hightemperature challenging to explain; in koi 81, the mass range for the companionwas also reported to be consistent with a substellar object. we re-analyze thekepler data and demonstrate that both companions are likely to be white dwarfs.we also find that the photometric data for koi 74 show a modulation inbrightness as the more luminous star orbits, due to doppler boosting. themagnitude of the effect is sufficiently large that we can use it to infer aradial velocity amplitude accurate to 1 km/s. as far as we are aware, this isthe first time a radial-velocity curve has been measured photometrically.combining our velocity amplitude with the inclination and primary mass derivedfrom the eclipses and primary spectral type, we infer a secondary mass of0.22+/-0.03 msun. we use our estimates to consider the likely evolutionarypaths and mass-transfer episodes of these binary systems.

1003.1207	habitable zones of host stars during the post-ms phase	a star will become brighter and brighter with stellar evolution, and thedistance of its habitable zone will become farther and farther. some planetsoutside the habitable zone of a host star during the main sequence phase mayenter the habitable zone of the host star during other evolutionary phases. aterrestrial planet within the habitable zone of its host star is generallythought to be suited to life existence. furthermore, a rocky moon around agiant planet may be also suited to life survive, provided that the planet-moonsystem is within the habitable zone of its host star. using eggleton's code andthe boundary flux of habitable zone, we calculate the habitable zone of oursolar after the main sequence phase. it is found that mars' orbit and jupiter'sorbit will enter the habitable zone of solar during the subgiant branch phaseand the red giant branch phase, respectively. and the orbit of saturn willenter the habitable zone of solar during the he-burning phase for about 137million years. life is unlikely at any time on saturn, as it is a giant gaseousplanet. however, titan, the rocky moon of saturn, may be suitable forbiological evolution and become another earth during that time. for low-massstars, there are similar habitable zones during the he-burning phase as oursolar, because there are similar core masses and luminosities for these starsduring that phase.

1003.4050	the helium star donor channel for the progenitors of type ia supernovae  with different metallicities	context: the nature of type ia supernovae (sne ia) is still unclear.metallicities may have an important effect on their properties.  aims: in this paper, we study the he star donor channel towards sne iacomprehensively and systematically at various metallicities.  methods: employing eggleton's stellar evolution code with the optically thickwind assumption, we calculated about 10 000 wd + he star systems and obtainedsn ia production regions of the he star donor channel with metallicitiesz=0.03, 0.02, 0.004 and 0.0001. according to a detailed binary populationsynthesis approach, we also obtained sn ia birthrates at various metallicities.  results: our study shows that both the initial mass of the he donor star andthe initial orbital period for sne ia increase with metallicity, while theminimum initial mass of the carbon--oxygen white dwarfs producing sne iadecreases with metallicity. for a constant star-formation galaxy, sn iabirthrates increase with metallicity. if a single starburst is assumed, sne iaoccur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birthrate is larger for ahigh z, and the he star donor channel with different metallicities can producethe young sne ia with delay times $\sim$45-220myr.

1003.4568	wd+rg systems as the progenitors of type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae (sne ia) play an important role in the study of cosmicevolution, especially in cosmology. there are several progenitor models for sneia proposed in the past years. in this paper, by considering the effect ofaccretion disk instability on the evolution of white dwarf (wd) binaries, weperformed detailed binary evolution calculations for the wd + red-giant (rg)channel of sne ia, in which a carbon-oxygen wd accretes material from a rg starto increase its mass to the chandrasekhar mass limit. according to thesecalculations, we mapped out the initial and final parameters for sne ia in theorbital period--secondary mass plane for various wd masses for this channel. wediscussed the influence of the variation of the duty cycle value on the regionsfor producing sne ia. similar to previous studies, this work also indicatesthat the long-period dwarf novae offer a possible ways for producing sne ia.meanwhile, we find that the surviving companion stars from this channel have alow mass after sn explosion, which may provide a means for the formation of thepopulation of single low-mass wds (&lt;0.45msun).

0708.1204	an isochrone database and a rapid model for stellar population synthesis	we first presented an isochrone database that can be widely used for stellarpopulation synthesis studies and colour-magnitude diagram (cmd) fitting. thedatabase consists of the isochrones of both single star and binary star simplestellar populations (ss-ssps and bs-ssps). the ranges for the age andmetallicity of populations are 0--15 gyr and 0.0001--0.03, respectively. alldata are available for populations with salpeter imf and chabrier imf. thenbased on the isochrone database, we built a rapid stellar population synthesis(rps) model and calculated the high-resolution (0.3 aa) integrated spectralenergy distributions (seds), lick indices and colour indices for bs-ssps andss-ssps. in particular, we calculated the ubvrijhklm colours, ugriz colours andsome composite colours that consist of magnitudes on different systems. as anexample for applying the isochrone database for cmd fitting, we fitted the cmdsof star clusters m67 and ngc1868 and obtained their distance moduli, colourexcesses, stellar metallicities and ages. the results showed that theisochrones of bs-ssps are closer to those of real star clusters. the isochronedatabase, colours, lick indices of populations can be downloaded viahttp://www.ynao.ac.cn/~bps/zhongmu/download.htm

1008.1584	on the formation of single and binary helium-rich sdo stars	we propose a formation channel for the previously unexplained helium-richsubdwarf o (he-rich sdo) stars in which post-subdwarf b (sdb) stars (i.e.hybrid cohe white dwarfs) reignite helium burning in a shell after gainingmatter from their helium white-dwarf (wd) companions. such short-periodbinaries containing post-sdb wds and helium wds are predicted by one of themajor binary formation channels for sdb stars. in the majority of cases, masstransfer is expected to lead to a dynamically unstable merger event, leaving asingle-star remnant. calculations of the evolution of these stars show thattheir properties are consistent with the observed he-rich sdo stars. theluminosity of these stars is about an order of magnitude higher than that ofcanonical sdb stars. we also suggest that binary systems such as pg 1544+488(ahmad et al. 2004) and he 0301-3039 (lisker et al. 2004), which each containtwo hot subdwarfs, could be the outcome of a double-core common-envelope phase.since this favours intermediate-mass progenitors, this may also explain why thesubdwarfs in these systems are he-rich.

1009.1433	the helium star donor channel for the progenitors of type ia supernovae  and their surviving companion stars	the nature of type ia supernovae (sne ia) is still unclear. employingeggleton's stellar evolution code with the optically thick wind assumption, wesystematically studied the he star donor channel of sne ia, in which acarbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes material from a he main-sequence star or ahe subgiant to increase its mass to the chandrasekhar mass. we mapped out theinitial parameters for producing sne ia in the orbital period--secondary massplane for various wd masses from this channel. according to a detailed binarypopulation synthesis approach, we find that this channel can produce sne iawith short delay times (~100myr) implied by recent observations. we obtainedmany properties of the surviving companions of this channel after sn explosion,which can be verified by future observations. we also find that the survivingcompanions from the sn explosion scenario have a high spatial velocity(&gt;400km/s), which could be an alternative origin for hypervelocity stars(hvss), especially for hvss such as us 708.

1112.0466	the short-period limit of contact binaries	the stability of mass transfer is important in the formation of contactbinaries from detached binaries when the primaries of the initially detachedbinaries fill their roche lobes. using eggleton's stellar evolution code, weinvestigate the formation and the short-period limit of contact binaries byconsidering the effect of the instability of mass transfer. it is found thatwith decreasing initial primary mass from 0.89m$_{\rm \odot}$ to 0.63m$_{\rm\odot}$, the range of the initial mass ratio decreases for detached binariesthat experience stable mass transfer and evolve into contact. if the initialprimary mass is less than 0.63m$_{\rm \odot}$, detached binaries wouldexperience dynamically unstable mass transfer when the primaries of detachedbinaries fill their roche lobes. these systems would evolve into a commonenvelope situation and probably then to a complete merger of two components ona quite short timescale. this results in a low mass limit at about 0.63m$_{\rm\odot}$ for the primary mass of contact binaries, which might be a main reasonwhy the period distribution of contact binaries has a short limit of about 0.22days. by comparing the theoretical period distribution of contact binaries withthe observational data, it is found that the observed contact binaries areabove the low mass limit for the primary mass of contact binaries and noobserved contact binaries are below this limit. this suggests that theshort-period limit of contact binaries can be explained by the instability ofthe mass transfer that occurs when the primaries of the initially detachedbinaries fill their roche lobes.

0710.4601	binary coalescence from case a evolution -- mergers and blue stragglers	we constructed some main-sequence mergers from case a binary evolution andstudied their characteristics via eggleton's stellar evolution code. both totalmass and orbital angular momentum are conservative in our binary evolutions.some mergers might be on the left of the zams as defined by normal surfacecomposition on a cmd because of enhanced surface helium content. the study alsoshows that central hydrogen content of the mergers is independent of mass. as aconsequence, we fit the formula of magnitude and b-v of the mergers when theyreturn back to thermal equilibrium with maximum error 0.29 and 0.037,respectively. employing the consequences above, we performed monte carlosimulations to examine our models in ngc 2682 and ngc 2660. in ngc 2682, binarymergers from our models cover the region with high luminosity, but itsimportance is much less than that of aml. our results are well-matched to theobservations of ngc2660 if there is about 0.5mo of mass loss in the mergerprocess.

1202.6203	decoding spectral energy distributions of dust-obscured starburst-agn	we present bayesed, a general purpose tool for doing bayesian analysis ofseds by using whatever pre-existing model sed libraries or their linearcombinations. the artificial neural networks (anns), principal componentanalysis (pca) and multimodal nested sampling (multinest) techniques areemployed to allow a highly efficient sampling of posterior distribution and thecalculation of bayesian evidence. as a demonstration, we apply this tool to asample of hyperluminous infrared galaxies (hlirgs). the bayesian evidencesobtained for a pure starburst, a pure agn, and a linear combination ofstarburst+agn models show that the starburst+agn model have the highestevidence for all galaxies in this sample. the bayesian evidences for the threemodels and the estimated contributions of starburst and agn to infraredluminosity show that hlirgs can be classified into two groups: one dominated bystarburst and the other dominated by agn. other parameters and correspondinguncertainties about starburst and agn are also estimated by using the modelwith the highest bayesian evidence. we found that the starburst region of thehlirgs dominated by starburst tends to be more compact and has a higherfraction of ob star than that of hlirgs dominated by agn. meanwhile, the agntorus of the hlirgs dominated by agn tend to be more dusty than that of hlirgsdominated by starburst. these results are consistent with previous researches,but need to be tested further with larger samples. overall, we believe thatbayesed could be a reliable and efficient tool for exploring the nature ofcomplex systems such as dust-obscured starburst-agn composite systems fromdecoding their seds.

0711.2362	how binary interactions affect spectral stellar population synthesis	single-star stellar population (ssssp) models are usually used for stellarpopulation studies. however, more than 50% of stars are in binaries and evolvedifferently from single stars. this suggests that the effects of binaryinteractions should be considered when modeling the stellar populations ofgalaxies and star clusters. via a rapid spectral stellar population synthesis(rps) model, we give detailed studies of the effects of binary interactions onthe lick indices and colours of stellar populations, and on the determinationof the stellar ages and metallicities of populations.  the results show that binary interactions make stellar populations lessluminous, bluer, with larger age-sensitive lick index (hbeta) and lessmetallicity-sensitive indices (e.g., mgb, fe5270 and fe5335) compared tossssps. it also shows that when ssssp models are used to determine the ages andmetallicities of stellar populations, lower ages or metallicities will beobtained, taking two line indices (hbeta and [mgfe]) and two colours (e.g., u-rand r-k), respectively. some relations for linking the stellar-populationparameters obtained by ssssps to those obtained by binary-star stellarpopulations (bsssps) are presented in the work. this can help us to get someabsolute values for stellar-population parameters and is useful for absolutestudies. however, it is found that the relative luminosity-weighted stellarages and metallicities obtained via ssssps and bsssps are similar. thissuggests that ssssps can be used for most stellar population studies, except insome special cases.

1207.2519	some constraints on the lower mass limit for double-degenerate  progenitors of type ia supernovae	recent theoretical and observational studies both argue that the merging ofdouble carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (wds) is responsible for at least some typeia supernovae (sne ia). previous (standard) studies of the anticipated snbirthrate from this channel have assumed that the merger process isconservative and that the primary criterion for explosion is that the mergedmass exceeds the chandrasekhar mass. han &amp; webbink (1999) demonstrated thatmass transfer and merger in close double wds will in many cases benon-conservative. pakmor et al. (2011) further suggested that the mergerprocess should be violent in order to initiate an explosion. we have thereforeinvestigated how the sn ia birthrate from the double-degenerate (dd) channel isaffected by these constraints. using the binary-star population-synthesismethod, we have calculated the dd sn ia birthrate under conservative andnon-conservative approximations, and including lower mass and mass-ratio limitsindicated by recent smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic calculations. the predicteddd sn ia rate is significantly reduced by all of these constraints. withdynamical mass loss alone (violent merger) the birthrate is reduced to 56% ofthe conservative rate. requiring that the mass ratio $q&gt;2/3$ further reducesthe birthrate to 18% that of the standard assumption. an upper limit of 0.0061snum, or a galactic rate of $4.6 \times 10^{-4}{\rm yr}^{-1}$, might berealistic.

1207.5280	the evolution and star formation history of m33	we construct a parameterized model to explore the main properties of the starformation history of m33. we assume that the disk originates and grows by theprimordial gas infall and adopt the simple form of gas accretion rate with onefree parameter, the infall time-scale. we also include the contribution of gasoutflow process. a major update of the model is that we adopt a molecularhydrogen correlated star formation law and calculate the evolution of theatomic and molecular gas separately. comparisons between the model predictionsand the observational data show that the model predictions are very sensitiveto the adopted infall time-scale, while the gas outflow process mainlyinfluences the metallicity profile. the model adopting a moderate outflow rateand an inside-out formation scenario can be in good agreement with most ofobserved constraints of m33 disk. we also compare the model predictions basedon the molecular hydrogen correlated star formation law and that based on thekennicutt star formation law. our results imply that the molecular hydrogencorrelated star formation law should be preferred to describe the evolution ofthe m33 disk, especially the radial distributions of both the cold gas and thestellar population.

1211.0265	uncertainties in the calibrations of star formation rate	the calibrations of star formation rate (sfr) are prone to be affected bymany factors, such as metallicity, initial mass function (imf), evolutionarypopulation synthesis (eps) models and so on. in this paper we will discuss theeffects of binary interactions, metallicity, eps models and imf on severalwidely used sfr calibrations based on the eps models of yunnan with and withoutbinary interactions, bc03, sb99, pegase and popstar. the inclusion of binaryinteractions makes these sfr conversion coefficients smaller (less than0.2dex), and these differences increase with metallicity. the differences inthe calibration coefficient between sfr and the luminosity of $\rm h\alpha$recombination line (c$_{\rm h\alpha}$) and that between sfr and the ultraviolet(uv) fluxes at 1500 and 2800\,$\rm \aa$ (c$_{i, {\rm uv}}$), caused by imf, areindependent of metallicity (0.03-0.33\,dex) except $\delta$c$_{\rm h\alpha,imf}$ when using the popstar and $\delta$c$_{i, {\rm uv, imf}}$ when using thepegase models. moreover, we find that $l_{\rm 2800}$ is not suitable to thelinear calibration of sfr at low metallicities.  at last, we compare the effects of these several factors on the sfrcalibrations considered in this paper. the effects of metallicity/imf and epsmodels on the c$_{\rm h\alpha}$ and c$_{\rm fir}$ (the conversion coefficientbetween sfr and the far-infrared flux) are the largest among these factors,respectively. for the calibration between sfr and c$_{i, {\rm uv}}$, theeffects of these several factors are comparable.

1301.1047	double-detonation explosions as progenitors of type iax supernovae	it has recently been proposed that one sub-class of type ia supernovae (sneia) is sufficiently both distinct and common to be classified separately fromthe bulk of sne ia, with a suggested class name of "type iax supernovae" (sneiax), after sn 2002cx. we show that the population properties of this class canbe understood if the events originate from helium double-detonationsub-chandrasekhar mass explosions, in which a carbon--oxygen white dwarf (cowd) accumulates a helium layer from a non-degenerate helium star. we haveincorporated detailed binary evolution calculations for the progenitor systemsinto a binary population synthesis model to obtain birthrates and delay timesfor such events. the predicted galactic event rate is $\sim$$0.6-1.8\times10^{-3}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, in good agreement with the measured rates of sne iax.in addition, predicted delay times are $\sim$70\,myr$-$710\,myr, consistentwith the fact that sne iax have so far only been discovered in late-typegalaxies. based on the co wd mass at explosion and previous detonation models,we also estimate the distribution of resulting sn brightness ($-13 \gtrsimm_{\rm bol} \gtrsim -19$ mag), which can reproduce the empirical diversity ofsne iax. we speculate on why binaries with non-degenerate donor stars mightlead to sne iax if similar systems with degenerate donors do not and suggestthat the higher mass of the helium layer necessary for ignition at the loweraccretion rates typically delivered from non-degenerate donors might providethe explanation.

1302.6296	the binary merger channel for the progenitor of the fastest rotating  o-type star vfts102	vfts102 has a projected rotational velocity ($&gt;$500\,km s$^{-1}$) and wouldappear to be the fastest rotating o-type star. we show that its high rotationalvelocity could be understood within the framework of the binary merger. in thebinary merger channel, the progenitor binary of vfts102 would evolve intocontact while two components are still on the main sequence, and then mergeinto a rapidly rotating single star. employing eggleton's stellar evolutioncode, we performed binary stellar evolution calculations and mapped out theinitial parameters of the progenitor of vfts102 in the orbital period-massratio ($p-q$) plane. we found that the progenitor binary of vfts102 withinitial mass ratio $q_0 \la 0.7$ should have an initial orbital period shorterthan $3.76-4.25$\,days, while above this mass ratio it should have an initialorbital period shorter than $1.44-1.55$\,days. the progenitor of vfts102 wouldevolve into contact during the rapid mass transfer phase or during thesubsequent slow mass transfer phase, and might ultimately merge into a rapidlyrotating massive star. in addition, we performed monte carlo simulations toinvestigate the binary merger channel. we estimated the fraction of binariesthat would merge into single stars and the fraction of single stars that mightbe produced from the binary merger channel. it is found that about 8.7% ofbinaries would evolve into contact and merge into rapidly rotating singlestars, and about 17.1% of single stars might be produced from the binary mergerchannel and should have similar properties to vfts102. this suggests that thebinary merger channel might be one of the main channels for the formation ofrapidly rotating massive stars like vfts102.

1303.0681	on the minimum mass ratio of w uma binaries	using eggleton's stellar evolution code, we study the minimum mass ratio($q_{\rm min}$) of w ursae majoris (w uma) binaries that have different primarymasses. it is found that the minimum mass ratio of w uma binaries decreaseswith increasing mass of the primary if the primary's mass is less than about1.3$m_{\rm \odot}$, and above this mass the ratio is roughly constant. bycomparing the theoretical minimum mass ratio with the observational data, it isfound that the existence of low-$q$ systems can be explained by the differentstructure of the primaries with different masses. this suggests that thedimensionless gyration radius ($k_1^2$) and thus the structure of the primaryis very important in determining the minimum mass ratio. in addition, weinvestigate the mass loss during the merging process of w uma systems andcalculate the rotation velocities of the single stars formed by the merger of wuma binaries due to tidal instability. it is found that in the case of theconservation of mass and angular momentum, the merged single stars rotate witha equatorial velocity of about $588\sim819$ km s$^{-1}$, which is much largerthan their break-up velocities ($v_{\rm b}$). this suggests that the mergedstars should extend to a very large radius (3.7$\sim$5.3 times the radii of theprimaries) or w uma systems would lose a large amount of mass (21$\sim$33 percent of the total mass) during the merging process. if the effect of magneticbraking is considered, the mass loss decreases to be 12$\sim$18 per cent oftheir total masses. this implies that the significant angular momentum and massmight be lost from w uma systems in the course of the merging process, and thiskind of mass and angular momentum loss might be driven by the release oforbital energy of the secondaries, which is similar to common-envelopeevolution.

1306.3281	the orbital periods of subdwarf b binaries produced by the first stable  roche overflow channel	long-orbital-period subdwarf b (sdb) stars with main-sequence companions arebelieved to be the product of stable roche lobe overflow (rlof), a scenariochallenged by recent observations. here we represent the results of asystematic study of the orbital-period distribution of sdb binaries in thischannel using detailed binary evolution calculations. we show that the observedorbital-period distribution of long-period sdb binaries can be well explainedby this scenario. furthermore, we find that, if the progenitors of the sdbstars have initial masses below the helium flash mass, the sdb binariesproduced from stable rlof follow a unique mass -- orbital period relation for agiven metallicity $z$; increasing the orbital period from $\sim 400$ to $\sim1100$\,d corresponds to increasing the mass of the sdb star from $\sim 0.40$ to$\sim 0.49\,m_\odot$ for $z=0.02$. we suggest that the longest sdb binaries(with orbital period $&gt; 1100$\,d) could be the result of atmospheric rlof. themass -- orbital period relation can be tested observationally if the mass ofthe sdb star can be determined precisely, e.g.\ from asteroseismology. usingthis relation, we revise the orbital period distribution of sdb binariesproduced by the first stable rlof channel for the best fitting model of han etal (2003), and show that the orbital period has a peak around 830\,d.

1307.5579	the impact of type ia supernova explosions on helium companions in the  chandrasekhar-mass explosion scenario	in the version of the sd scenario of sne ia studied here, a co wd explodesclose to the chandrasekhar limit after accreting material from a non-degeneratehe companion. in the present study, we employ the stellar gadget code toperform 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of the sn ia ejectawith the he companion taking into account its orbital motion and spin. it isfound that only 2%--5% of the initial companion mass are stripped off from theouter layers of he companions due to the sn impact. the dependence of theunbound mass (or the kick velocity) on the orbital separation can be fitted ingood approximation by a power law for a given companion model. after the snimpact, the outer layers of a he donor star are significantly enriched withheavy elements from the low-expansion-velocity tail of sn ia ejecta. the totalmass of accumulated sn-ejecta material on the companion surface reaches about &gt;10e-3 m_sun for different companion models. this enrichment with heavy elementsprovides a potential way to observationally identify the surviving companionstar in sn remnants. finally, by artificially adjusting the explosion energy ofthe w7 explosion model, we find that the total accumulation of sn ejecta on thecompanion surface is also dependent on the explosion energy with a power lawrelation in good approximation.

1307.7730	a super-eddington wind scenario for the progenitors of type ia  supernovae	the accretion of hydrogen-rich material onto carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (cowds) is crucial for understanding type ia supernova (sn ia) from thesingle-degenerate model, but this process has not been well understood due tothe numerical difficulties in treating h and he flashes during the accretion.for the co wd masses from 0.5 to $1.378\,{m}_\odot$ and accretion rates in therange from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}\,{m}_\odot\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, we simulated theaccretion of solar-composition material onto co wds using the state-of-the-artstellar evolution code of {\sc mesa}. for comparison with the steady-statemodels (e.g \citet{nskh07}), we firstly ignored the contribution from nuclearburning to the luminosity when determining the eddington accretion rate andfound that the properties of h burning in our accreting co wd models aresimilar to those from the steady-state models, except that the criticalaccretion rates at which the wds turn into red giants or h-shell flashes occuron their surfaces are slightly higher than those from the steady-state models.however, the super-eddington wind is triggered at much lower accretion rates,than previously thought, when the contribution of nuclear burning to the totalluminosity is included. this super-eddington wind naturally prevents the co wdswith high accretion rates from becoming red giants, thus presenting analternative to the optically thick wind proposed by \cite{hkn96}. furthermore,the super-eddington wind works in low-metallicity environments, which mayexplain sne ia observed at high redshifts.

1308.4107	formation of black widows and redbacks -- two distinct populations of  eclipsing binary millisecond pulsars	eclipsing binary millisecond pulsars (the so-called black widows andredbacks) can provide important information about accretion history, pulsarirradiation of their companion stars and the evolutionary link betweenaccreting x-ray pulsars and isolated millisecond pulsars. however, theformation of such systems is not well understood, nor the difference inprogenitor evolution between the two populations of black widows and redbacks.whereas both populations have orbital periods between $0.1-1.0\;{\rm days}$their companion masses differ by an order of magnitude. in this paper, weinvestigate the formation of these systems via evolution of converging low-massx-ray binaries by employing the mesa stellar evolution code. our resultsconfirm that one can explain the formation of most of these eclipsing binarymillisecond pulsars using this scenario. more notably, we find that thedetermining factor for producing either black widows or redbacks is theefficiency of the irradiation process, such that the redbacks absorb a largerfraction of the emitted spin-down energy of the radio pulsar (resulting in moreefficient mass loss via evaporation) compared to that of the black widowsystems. we argue that geometric effects (beaming) is responsible for thestrong bimodality of these two populations. finally, we conclude that redbacksystems do not evolve into black widow systems with time.

(2013a, 2013b) studied the effect of this kind ofwind on hb morphology in details, and their results indicated that binary is apossible secondparameter (2p) candidate in gcs. binary fraction is an veryimportant fact in the tidally-enhanced-stellar-wind model. in this paper, westudied the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology by removing the effectsof metallicity and age. five different binary fractions (i.e., 10%, 15%, 20%,30% and 50%) are adopted in our model calculations. the synthetic hbmorphologies with different binary fractions are obtained at differentmetallicities and ages. we found that, due to the great influence ofmetallicity and age, the effect of binary fraction on hb morphology may bemasked by these two parameters. however, when the effects of metallicity andage are removed, the tendency that hb morphologies become bluer with increasingof binary fractions is clearly presented. furthermore, we compared our resultswith the observation by milone et al. (2012). our results are consistent wellwith the observation at metalrich and metal-poor gcs. for the gcs withintermediate metallicity, when the effect of age on hb morphology is removed, aweak tendency that hb morphologies become bluer with increasing of binaryfractions is presented in all regions of gcs, which is consistent with ourresults obtained in this metallicity range.

0803.2512	stellar age versus mass of early-type galaxies in the virgo cluster	the flux excess of elliptical galaxies in the far-ultraviolet can bereproduced by population synthesis models when accounting for the population ofold hot helium-burning subdwarf stars. this has been achieved by han andcoworkers through a quantitative model of binary stellar evolution. here, wecompare the resulting evolutionary population synthesis model to the galexfar-near ultraviolet colors (fuv-nuv) of virgo cluster early-type galaxies thatwere published by boselli and coworkers. fuv-nuv is reddest at about thedividing luminosity of dwarf and giant galaxies, and becomes increasingly bluefor both brighter and fainter luminosities. this behavior can be easilyexplained by the binary model with a continuous sequence of longer duration andlater truncation of star formation at lower galaxy masses. thus, in contrast toprevious conclusions, the galex data do not require a dichotomy between thestellar population properties of dwarfs and giants. their apparently oppositebehavior in fuv-nuv occurs naturally when the formation of hot subdwarfsthrough binary evolution is taken into account.

1409.2896	on the evolution of rotating accreting white dwarfs and type ia  supernovae	the potential importance of the angular momentum which is gained by accretingwhite dwarfs (wds) has been increasingly recognized in the context of type iasupernova (sn ia) single-degenerate model. the expectation that the spin of thewd can delay the explosion should help the single-degenerate model to beconsistent with the observed properties of most sne ia, in particular byavoiding hydrogen contamination. in this article, we attempt to study the mostprominent single-degenerate supersoft (wd + ms) channel when the rotation ofaccreting wds is considered. we present a detailed binary population synthesisstudy to examine the predicted population of sne ia for this channel. for ourstandard model, we find that 77% of these sne ia explode with wd masses whichare low enough to be supported by solid-body rotation (1.378-1.5msun); this isa substantially higher proportion than found by previous work. only 2% have wdexplosion masses &gt;2.0msun; these require the initial wd mass to be larger than1.0 msun. we further discuss the possible origin of the diversity of sne iafrom the pre- and post- accretion properties of the wds in this population. wealso suggest that some sn ia progenitors with substantial circumstellarhydrogen, including some apparent type iin sne, might be related to wds whichrequired support from differential rotation to avoid explosion, since these canstill be accreting from hydrogen-rich donors with a relatively highmass-transfer rate at the time of the sn explosion.

0804.2294	mass transfer from a giant star to a main sequence companion and its  contribution to long-orbital-period blue stragglers	binary population synthesis shows that mass transfer from a giant star to amain-sequence (ms) companion may account for some observed long-orbital periodblue stragglers. however, little attention {\bf is paid to this blue stragglerformation scenario} as dynamical instability often happens when the mass donoris a giant star. in this paper, we have studied the critical mass ratio,$q_{\rm c}$, for dynamically stable mass transfer from a giant star to a mscompanion using detailed evolution calculations. the results show that a moreevolved star is generally less stable for roche lobe overflow. meanwhile,$q_{\rm c}$ almost linearly increases with the amount of the mass and angularmomentum {\bf lost} during mass transfer, but has little dependance on stellarwind. to conveniently use the result, we give a fit of $q_{\rm c}$ as afunction of the stellar radius at the onset of roche lobe overflow and of themass transfer efficiency during the roche lobe overflow.  to examine the formation of blue stragglers from mass transfer between giantsand ms stars, we have performed monte carlo simulations with various $q_{\rmc}$. {\bf the simulations show that some binaries with the mass donor on thefirst giant branch may contribute to blue stragglers with $q_{\rm c}$ obtainedin this paper but will not from previous $q_{\rm c}$. meanwhile, from our$q_{\rm c}$, blue stragglers from the mass transfer between an agb star and ams companion may be more numerous and have a wider range of orbital periodsthan those from the other $q_{\rm c}$.

1502.06307	a super-eddington wind scenario for the progenitors of type ia  supernovae: binary population synthesis calculations	the super-eddington wind scenario has been proposed as an alternative way forproducing type ia supernovae (sne ia). the super-eddington wind can naturallyprevent the carbon--oxygen white dwarfs (co wds) with high mass-accretion ratesfrom becoming red-giant-like stars. furthermore, it works in low-metallicityenvironments, which may explain sne ia observed at high redshifts. in thisarticle, we systematically investigated the most prominent single-degeneratewd+ms channel based on the super-eddington wind scenario. we combined theeggleton stellar evolution code with a rapid binary population synthesis (bps)approach to predict sn ia birthrates for the wd+ms channel by adopting thesuper-eddington wind scenario and detailed mass-accumulation efficiencies ofh-shell flashes on the wds. our bps calculations found that the estimated sn iabirthrates for the wd+ms channel are ~0.009-0.315*10^{-3}{yr}^{-1} if we adoptthe eddington accretion rate as the critical accretion rate, which are muchlower than that of the observations (&lt;10% of the observed sn ia birthrates).this indicates that the wd+ms channel only contributes a small proportion ofall sne ia. the birthrates in this simulation are lower than previous studies,the main reason of which is that new mass-accumulation efficiencies of h-shellflashes are adopted. we also found that the critical mass-accretion rate has asignificant influence on the birthrates of sne ia. meanwhile, the results ofour bps calculations are sensitive to the values of the common-envelopeejection efficiency.

1503.08885	a possible formation channel for blue hook stars in globular cluster	the formation mechanism for blue hook (bhk) stars in globular clusters (gcs)is still unclear. following one of the possible scenario, named late hot flashscenario, we proposed that tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolutionmay provide the huge mass loss on the red giant branch (rgb) and produce bhkstars. employing the detailed stellar evolution code, modules for experimentsin stellar astrophysics (mesa), we investigated the contributions of tidallyenhanced stellar wind as a possible formation channel for bhk stars in gcs. weevolved the primary stars with different initial orbital periods using thebinary module in mesa (version 6208) from zero age main-sequence (zams) to posthorizontal branch (hb) stage, and obtained their evolution parameters which arecompared with the observation. the results are consistent with observation inthe color-magnitude diagram (cmd) and the logg-teff plane for ngc 2808, whichis an example gc hosting bhk stars. however, the helium abundance in thesurface for our models is higher than the one obtained in bhk stars. thisdiscrepancy between our models and observation is possibly due to the fact thatgravitational settling and radiative levitation which are common processes inhot hb stars are not considered in the models as well as the fact that theflash mixing efficiency may be overestimated in the calculations. our resultssuggested that tidally enhanced stellar wind in binary evolution is able tonaturally provide the huge mass loss on the rgb needed for late hot flashscenario and it is a possible and reasonable formation channel for bhk stars ingcs.

1507.04843	adiabatic mass loss in binary stars. ii. from zero-age main sequence to  the base of the giant branch	in the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor starin an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. wesurvey here adiabatic mass loss from population i stars of mass 0.10 msun to100 msun from the zero age main sequence to the base of the giant branch, or tocentral hydrogen exhaustion for lower main sequence stars. for intermediate-and high-mass stars, dynamical mass transfer is preceded by an extended phaseof thermal time scale mass transfer as the star is stripped of most of itsenvelope mass. the critical mass ratio qad above which this delayed dynamicalinstability occurs increases with advancing evolutionary age of the donor star,by ever-increasing factors for more massive donors. most intermediate- orhigh-mass binaries with nondegenerate accretors probably evolve into contactbefore manifesting this instability. as they approach the base of the giantbranch, however, and begin developing a convective envelope, qad plummetsdramatically among intermediate-mass stars, to values of order unity, and aprompt dynamical instability occurs. among low-mass stars, the promptinstability prevails throughout main sequence evolution, with q_ad decliningwith decreasing mass. our calculated qad agree well with the behavior oftimedependent models by chen &amp; han (2003) of intermediate-mass stars initiatingmass transfer in the hertzsprung gap. application of our results to cataclysmicvariables, as systems which must be stable against rapid mass transfer, nicelycircumscribes the range in qad as a function of orbital period in which theyare found. these results are intended to advance the verisimilitude ofpopulation synthesis models of close binary evolution.

0805.3855	the single degenerate channel for the progenitor of type ia supernovae	we have carried out a detailed study of the single-degenerate channel for theprogenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia). in the model, a carbon-oxygen whitedwarf (co wd) accretes hydrogen-rich material from an unevolved or a slightlyevolved non-degenerate companion to increase its mass to chandrasekhar masslimit. incorporating the prescription of \cite{hac99a} for the accretionefficiency into eggleton's stellar evolution code and assuming that theprescription is valid for all metallicities, we performed binary stellarevolution calculations for more than 25,000 close wd binary systems withvarious metallicities. the initial parameter spaces for sne ia are presented inan orbital period-secondary mass ($\log p_{\rm i}, m_{\rm 2}^{\rm i}$) planefor each $z$.  adopting the results above, we studied the birth rate of sne ia for various$z$ via binary population synthesis. from the study, we see that for a high$z$, sne ia occur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birth rate islarger if a single starburst is assumed. the galactic birth rate from thechannel is lower than (but comparable to) that inferred from observations.  we also showed the distributions of the parameters of the binary systems atthe moment of supernova explosion and the distributions of the properties ofcompanions after supernova explosion. the former provides physics input tosimulate the interaction between supernova ejecta and its companion, and thelatter is helpful to search for the companions in supernova remnants.

0805.4040	the evolutionary status of w ursae majoris-type systems	well-determined physical parameters of 130 w uma systems have been collectedfrom the literature. based on these data, the evolutionary status and dynamicalevolution of w uma systems are investigated. it is found that there is noevolutionary difference between w- and a-type systems in $m-j$ diagram which isconsistent with the results derived from the analysis of observed spectraltype, $m-r$ and $m-l$ diagrams of w uma systems. $m-r$ and $m-l$ diagrams of w-and a-type systems indicate that a large amount of energy should be transferredfrom the more massive to the less massive component so that they are not inthermal equilibrium and undergo thermal relaxation oscillation (tro).meanwhile, the distribution of angular momentum, together with the distributionof mass ratio, suggests that the mass ratio of the observed w uma systems isdecreased with the decrease of their total mass. this could be the result ofthe dynamical evolution of w uma systems which suffer angular momentum loss(aml) and mass loss due to magnetic stellar wind (msw). consequently, the tidalinstability forces these systems towards the lower q values and finally to fastrotating single stars.

1510.03485	super-eddington wind scenario for the progenitors of type ia supernovae:  accreting he-rich matter onto white dwarfs	supernovae of type ia (sne ia) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions ofcarbon-oxygen white dwarfs (co wds). however, the mass accretion process ontoco wds is still not completely understood. in this paper, we study theaccretion of he-rich matter onto co wds and explore a scenario in which astrong wind forms on the surface of the wd if the total luminosity exceeds theeddington limit. using a stellar evolution code called modules for experimentsin stellar astrophysics (mesa), we simulated the he accretion process onto cowds for wds with masses of 0.6-1.35msun and various accretion rates of10^{-8}-10^{-5}msun/yr. if the contribution of the total luminosity is includedwhen determining the eddington accretion rate, then a super-eddington windcould be triggered at relatively lower accretion rates than those of previousstudies based on steady-state models. the super-eddington wind can prevent thewds with high accretion rates from evolving into red-giant-like he stars. wefound that the contributions from thermal energy of the wd are non-negligible,judging by our simulations, even though the nuclear burning energy is thedominating source of luminosity. we also provide the limits of the steadyhe-burning regime in which the wds do not lose any accreted matter and increasetheir mass steadily, and calculated the mass retention efficiency during helayer flashes for various wd masses and accretion rates. these obtained resultscan be used in future binary population synthesis computations.

astro-ph;0010269	low and intermediate-mass close binary evolution and the initial - final  mass relation	using eggleton's stellar evolution code, we carry out 150 runs of pop ibinary evolution calculations, with the initial primary mass between 1 and 8solar masses the initial mass ratio between 1.1 and 4, and the onset of rochelobe overflow (rlof) at an early, middle, or late hertzsprung-gap stage. weassume that rlof is conservative in the calculations, and find that the remnantmass of the primary may change by more than 40 per cent over the range ofinitial mass ratio or orbital period, for a given primary mass. this iscontrary to the often-held belief that the remnant mass depends only on theprogenitor mass if mass transfer begins in the hertzsprung gap. we fit aformula, with an error less than 3.6 per cent, for the remnant (white dwarf)mass as a function of the initial mass of the primary, the initial mass ratio,and the radius of the primary at the onset of rlof. we also find that acarbon-oxygen white dwarf with mass as low as 0.33 solar masses may be formedif the primary's initial mass is around 2.5 solar masses.

astro-ph;0206130	the origin of subdwarf b star (i): the formation channels	subdwarf b (sdb) stars (and related sdo/sdob stars) are believed to be heliumcore-burning objects with very thin hydrogen-rich envelopes. in recent years ithas become increasingly clear from observational surveys that a large fractionof these objects are members of binary systems. to better understand theirformation, we here present the results of a detailed investigation of the threemain binary evolution channels that can lead to the formation of sdb stars: thecommon envelope (ce) ejection channel, the stable roche lobe overflow (rlof)channel and the double helium white dwarfs (wds) merger channel. we obtainedthe conditions for the formation of sdb stars from each of these channels usingdetailed stellar and binary evolution calculations where we modelled thedetailed evolution of sdb stars and carried out simplified binary populationsynthesis simulations. the observed period distribution of sdb stars in compactbinaries strongly constrains the ce ejection parameters. we also present thedistribution of sdb stars in the $t_{\rm eff}$ - $\log g$ diagram, thehertzsprung-russell diagram and the distribution of mass functions.

astro-ph;0207153	on the formation and evolution of black-hole binaries	we present the results of a systematic study of the formation and evolutionof binaries containing black holes and normal-star companions with a wide rangeof masses. we first reexamine the standard formation scenario for closeblack-hole binaries, where the spiral-in of the companion in the envelope of amassive star causes the ejection of the envelope. we estimate the formationrates for different companion masses and different assumptions about thecommon-envelope structure and other model parameters. we find that black-holebinaries with intermediate- and high-mass secondaries can form for a wide rangeof assumptions, while black-hole binaries with low-mass secondaries can onlyform with apparently unrealistic assumptions (in agreement with previousstudies). we then present detailed binary evolution sequences for black-holebinaries with secondaries of 2 to 17 msun and demonstrate that in these systemsthe black hole can accrete appreciably even if accretion is eddington limited(up to 7 msun for an initial black-hole mass of 10 msun) and that the blackholes can be spun up significantly in the process. we discuss the implicationsof these calculations for well-studied black-hole binaries (in particular grs1915+105), ultra-luminous x-ray sources and cygnus x-1. finally, we discuss howsome of the assumptions in the standard model could be relaxed to allow theformation of low-mass, short-period black-hole binaries which appear to be veryabundant in nature.

astro-ph;0301380	the origin of sdb stars (ii)	we have carried out a detailed binary populations synthesis (bps) study ofthe formation of subdwarf b (sdb) stars and related objects (sdo, sdob stars)using the latest version of the bps code developed by han et al.(1994, 1995a,1995b, 1998, 2001). we systematically investigate the importance of the fivemain evolutionary channels in which the sdb stars form after one or twocommon-envelope (ce) phases, one or two phases of stable roche-lobe overflow(rlof) or as the result of the merger of two helium white dwarfs (wd) (see hanet al. 2002, paper i). our best bps model can satisfactorily explain the mainobservational characteristics of sdb stars, in particular their distributionsin the orbital period - minimum companion mass diagram and in the effectivetemperature - surface gravity diagram, their distributions of orbital period,log (g theta^4), and mass function, their binary fraction and the fraction ofsdb binaries with wd companions, their birthrates and their space density. weobtain a galactic formation rate, a total number in the galaxy, the intrinsicbinary fraction for sdb stars. we also predict a distribution of masses for sdbstars that is wider than is commonly assumed and that some sdb stars havecompanions of spectral type as early as b. the percentage of a type stars withsdb companions can in principle be used to constrain some of the importantparameters in the binary evolution model. we conclude that (a) the first rlofphase needs to be more stable than is commonly assumed; (b) mass transfer inthe first stable rlof phase is non-conservative, and the mass lost from thesystem takes away a specific angular momentum similar to that of the system;(c) common-envelope ejection is very efficient.

astro-ph;0309618	the single degenerate channel for the progenitors of type ia supernovae	we have carried out a detailed study of one of the most popular evolutionarychannels for the production of type ia supernova (sn ia) progenitors, thesemi-degenerate channel (co+ms), where a carbon/oxygen (co) white dwarf (wd)accretes matter from an unevolved or slightly evolved non-degenerate star untilit reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit. employing eggleton's stellar evolutioncode and adopting the prescription of hachisu et al. (1999) for the accretionefficiency, we have carried out full binary evolution calculations for about2300 close wd binary systems and mapped out the initial parameters in theorbital period -- secondary mass ($p$--$m_2$) plane (for a range of wd masses)which lead to a successful type ia supernova. we obtained accurate, analyticalfitting formulae to describe this parameter range which can be used for binarypopulation synthesis (bps) studies. the contours in the $p$--$m_2$ plane differfrom those obtained by hachisu et al. (1999) for low-mass co wds, which aremore common than massive co wds. we show that white dwarfs with a mass as lowas $0.67m_\odot$ can accrete efficiently and reach the chandrasekhar limit. wehave implemented these results in a bps study to obtain the birthrates for sneia and the evolution of birthrates with time of sne ia for both a constant starformation rate and a single star burst. the birthrates are somewhat lower than(but comparable to) those inferred observationally.

astro-ph;0611158	potential of colors for determining age and metallicity of stellar  populations	colors are usually not used for constraining stellar populations because theyare thought to have the well-known agemetallicity degeneracy, but some recentworks show that colors can also be used. a simple stellar population synthesismodel is widely used, but there is no analysis for its colors. we try to findcolors that can potentially be used to determine the age and metallicity ofstellar populations by the standard model. principal component analysis andrelative sensitive parameter techniques are used in this work. as a result,u-k, u-h, u-j, b-k, b-h, u-i, b-j, and v-k are found to be more important forstudying populations than others. pairs of colors such as b-k and b-v are foundto be able to disentangle the stellar age-metallicity degeneracy via thehigh-resolution model, while pairs such as u-k and r-i may be used instead whenthe low-resolution model is used. furthermore, the u-g and r-i colors of thelow-resolution model seem to have the same potential, but there are no suchcolors for the high-resolution one. in conclusion, some colors have been shownto have the potential to determine the age and metallicity of stellarpopulations, but relative metallicity and age sensitivities of colors indifferent stellar population synthesis models are usually different. inaddition, minor star formations will make star systems look younger and moremetal rich than their dominating populations.

0811.2633	on type ia supernovae and the formation of single low-mass white dwarfs	there is still considerable debate over the progenitors of type ia supernovae(sne ia). likewise, it is not agreed how single white dwarfs with masses lessthan ~0.5 msun can be formed in the field, even though they are known to exist.we consider whether single low-mass white dwarfs (lmwds) could have been formedin binary systems where their companions have exploded as a sn ia. in thismodel, the observed single lmwds are the remnants of giant-branch donor starswhose envelopes have been stripped off by the supernova explosion. weinvestigate the likely remnants of sne ia, including the effects of theexplosion on the envelope of the donor star. we also use evolutionary argumentsto examine alternative formation channels for single lmwds. in addition, wecalculate the expected kinematics of the potential remnants of sne ia. sn ia insystems with giant-branch donor stars can naturally explain the production ofsingle lmwds. it seems difficult for any other formation mechanism to accountfor the observations, especially for those single lmwds with masses less than~0.4 msun. independent of those results, we find that the kinematics of onepotentially useful population containing single lmwds is consistent with ourmodel. studying remnant white-dwarf kinematics seems to be a promising way toinvestigate sn ia progenitors. the existence of single lmwds appears toconstitute evidence for the production of sne ia in binary systems with ared-giant donor star. other single white dwarfs with higher space velocitiessupport a second, probably dominant, population of sn ia progenitors whichcontained main-sequence or subgiant donor stars at the time of explosion. therunaway stars lp400-22 and us 708 suggest the possibility of a third formationchannnel for some sne ia in systems where the donor stars are hot subdwarfs.
