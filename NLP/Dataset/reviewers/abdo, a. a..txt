0902.1559	bright agn source list from the first three months of the fermi large  area telescope all-sky survey	the first three months of sky-survey operation with the fermi gamma ray spacetelescope (fermi) large area telescope (lat) reveals 132 bright sources at|b|&gt;10 deg with test statistic greater than 100 (corresponding to about 10sigma). two methods, based on the cgrabs, crates and bzcat catalogs, indicatehigh-confidence associations of 106 of these sources with known agns. thissample is referred to as the lat bright agn sample (lbas). it contains tworadio galaxies, namely centaurus a and ngc 1275, and 104 blazars consisting of57 flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), 42 bl lac objects, and 5 blazars withuncertain classification. four new blazars were discovered on the basis of thelat detections. remarkably, the lbas includes 10 high-energy peaked bl lacs(hbls), sources which were so far hard to detect in the gev range. another 10lower-confidence associations are found. only thirty three of the sources, plustwo at |b|&gt;10 deg, were previously detected with egret, probably due to thevariable nature of these sources. the analysis of the gamma-ray properties ofthe lbas sources reveals that the average gev spectra of bl lac objects aresignificantly harder than the spectra of fsrqs. no significant correlationbetween radio and peak gamma-ray fluxes is observed. blazar log n - log s andluminosity functions are constructed to investigate the evolution of thedifferent blazar classes, with positive evolution indicated for fsrqs but nonefor bllacs. the contribution of lat-blazars to the total extragalacticgamma-ray intensity is estimated.

0904.1018	milagro observations of multi-tev emission from galactic sources in the  fermi bright source list	we present the result of a search of the milagro sky map for spatialcorrelations with sources from a subset of the recent fermi bright source list(bsl). the bsl consists of the 205 most significant sources detected above 100mev by the fermi large area telescope. we select sources based on theircategorization in the bsl, taking all confirmed or possible galactic sources inthe field of view of milagro. of the 34 fermi sources selected, 14 are observedby milagro at a significance of 3 standard deviations or more. we conduct thissearch with a new analysis which employs newly-optimized gamma-hadronseparation and utilizes the full 8-year milagro dataset. milagro is sensitiveto gamma rays with energy from 1 to 100 tev with a peak sensitivity from 10-50tev depending on the source spectrum and declination. these results extend theobservation of these sources far above the fermi energy band. with the newanalysis and additional data, multi-tev emission is definitively observedassociated with the fermi pulsar, j2229.0+6114, in the boomerang pulsar windnebula (pwn). furthermore, an extended region of multi-tev emission isassociated with the fermi pulsar, j0634.0+1745, the geminga pulsar.

0904.1904	fermi discovery of gamma-ray emission from ngc 1275	we report the discovery of high-energy (e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray emission fromngc 1275, a giant elliptical galaxy lying at the center of the perseus clusterof galaxies, based on observations made with the large area telescope (lat) ofthe fermi gamma ray space telescope. the positional center of the gamma-raysource is only ~3' away from the ngc 1275 nucleus, well within the 95% laterror circle of ~5'.the spatial distribution of gamma-ray photons is consistentwith a point source. the average flux and power-law photon index measured withthe lat from 2008 august 4 to 2008 december 5 are f_gamma = (2.10+-0.23)x10^{-7} ph (&gt;100 mev) cm^{-2} s^{-1} and gamma = 2.17+-0.05, respectively. themeasurements are statistically consistent with constant flux during thefour-month lat observing period.previous egret observations gave an upper limitof f_gamma &lt; 3.72x 10 ^{-8} ph (&gt;100 mev) cm^{-2} s^{-1} to the gamma-ray fluxfrom ngc 1275. this indicates that the source is variable on timescales ofyears to decades, and therefore restricts the fraction of emission that can beproduced in extended regions of the galaxy cluster. contemporaneous andhistorical radio observations are also reported. the broadband spectrum of ngc1275 is modeled with a simple one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-comptonmodel and a model with a decelerating jet flow.

0904.4280	early fermi gamma-ray space telescope observations of the quasar 3c  454.3	this is the first report of fermi gamma-ray space telescope observations ofthe quasar 3c 454.3, which has been undergoing pronounced long-term outburstssince 2000. the data from the large area telescope (lat), covering 2008 july 7- october 6, indicate strong, highly variable gamma-ray emission with anaverage flux of ~3 x 10^{-6} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, for energies above 100mev. the gamma-ray flux is variable, with strong, distinct,symmetrically-shaped flares for which the flux increases by a factor of severalon a time scale of about three days. this variability indicates a compactemission region, and the requirement that the source is optically thin topair-production implies relativistic beaming with doppler factor delta &gt; 8,consistent with the values inferred from vlbi observations of superluminalexpansion (delta ~ 25). the observed gamma-ray spectrum is not consistent witha simple power-law, but instead steepens strongly above ~2 gev, and is welldescribed by a broken power-law with photon indices of ~2.3 and ~3.5 below andabove the break, respectively. this is the first direct observation of a breakin the spectrum of a high luminosity blazar above 100 mev, and it is likelydirect evidence for an intrinsic break in the energy distribution of theradiating particles. alternatively, the spectral softening above 2 gev could bedue to gamma-ray absorption via photon-photon pair production on the soft x-rayphoton field of the host agn, but such an interpretation would require thedissipation region to be located very close (less than 100 gravitational radii)to the black hole, which would be inconsistent with the x-ray spectrum of thesource.

0905.4400	pulsed gamma-rays from psr j2021+3651 with the fermi large area  telescope	we report the detection of pulsed gamma-rays from the young, spin-poweredradio pulsar psr j2021+3651 using data acquired with the large area telescope(lat) on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (formerly glast). the light curveconsists of two narrow peaks of similar amplitude separated by 0.468 +/- 0.002in phase. the first peak lags the maximum of the 2 ghz radio pulse by 0.162 +/-0.004 +/- 0.01 in phase. the integral gamma-ray photon flux above 100 mev is(56 +/- 3 +/- 11) x 10^{-8} /cm2/s. the photon spectrum is well-described by anexponentially cut-off power law of the form df/de = ke^{-\gamma} e^(-e/e_c)where the energy e is expressed in gev. the photon index is \gamma = 1.5 +/-0.1 +/- 0.1 and the exponential cut-off is e_c = 2.4 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.5 gev. thefirst uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. the integralphoton flux of the bridge is approximately 10% of the pulsed emission, and theupper limit on off-pulse gamma-ray emission from a putative pulsar wind nebulais &lt;10% of the pulsed emission at the 95% confidence level. radio polarizationmeasurements yield a rotation measure of rm = 524 +/- 4 rad/m^2 but a poorlyconstrained magnetic geometry. re-analysis of chandra data enhanced thesignificance of the weak x-ray pulsations, and the first peak is roughlyphase-aligned with the first gamma-ray peak. we discuss the emission region andbeaming geometry based on the shape and spectrum of the gamma-ray light curvecombined with radio and x-ray measurements, and the implications for the pulsardistance. gamma-ray emission from the polar cap region seems unlikely for thispulsar.

0905.4558	fermi/lat discovery of gamma-ray emission from a relativistic jet in the  narrow-line quasar pmn j0948+0022	we report the discovery by the large area telescope (lat) onboard the fermigamma-ray space telescope of high-energy gamma-ray emission from the peculiarquasar pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.5846). the optical spectrum of this object exhibitsrather narrow hbeta (fwhm(hbeta) ~ 1500 km s^-1), weak forbidden lines and istherefore classified as a narrow-line type i quasar. this class of objects isthought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at higheddington ratio. the radio loudness and variability of the compact radio coreindicates the presence of a relativistic jet. quasi simultaneousradio-optical-x-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. both radio andgamma-ray emission (observed over 5-months) are strongly variable. thesimultaneous optical and x-ray data from swift show a blue continuum attributedto the accretion disk and a hard x-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. theresulting broad band spectral energy distribution (sed) and, in particular, thegamma-ray spectrum measured by fermi are similar to those of more powerfulfsrq. a comparison of the radio and gamma-ray characteristics of pmn j0948+0022with the other blazars detected by lat shows that this source has a relativelylow radio and gamma-ray power, with respect to other fsrq. the physicalparameters obtained from modelling the sed also fall at the low power end ofthe fsrq parameter region discussed in celotti &amp; ghisellini (2008). we suggestthat the similarity of the sed of pmn j0948+0022 to that of more massive andmore powerful quasars can be understood in a scenario in which the sedproperties depend on the eddington ratio rather than on the absolute power.

0907.4307	fermi lat observations of ls i +61 303: first detection of an orbital  modulation in gev gamma rays	this letter presents the first results from the observations of lsi +61 303using large area telescope data from the fermi gamma-ray space telescopebetween 2008 august and 2009 march. our results indicate variability that isconsistent with the binary period, with the emission being modulated at 26.6+/- 0.5 days. this constitutes the first detection of orbital periodicity inhigh-energy gamma rays (20 mev-100 gev, he). the light curve is characterizedby a broad peak after periastron, as well as a smaller peak just beforeapastron. the spectrum is best represented by a power law with an exponentialcutoff, yielding an overall flux above 100 mev of 0.82 +/- 0.03(stat) +/-0.07(syst) 10^{-6} ph cm^{-2} s^{-1}, with a cutoff at 6.3 +/- 1.1(stat) +/-0.4(syst) gev and photon index gamma = 2.21 +/- 0.04(stat) +/- 0.06(syst).there is no significant spectral change with orbital phase. the phase ofmaximum emission, close to periastron, hints at inverse compton scattering asthe main radiation mechanism. however, previous very high-energy gamma ray(&gt;100 gev, vhe) observations by magic and veritas show peak emission close toapastron. this and the energy cutoff seen with fermi suggest the link betweenhe and vhe gamma rays is nontrivial.

0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

0910.1608	the first fermi large area telescope catalog of gamma-ray pulsars	the dramatic increase in the number of known gamma-ray pulsars since thelaunch of the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (formerly glast) offers the firstopportunity to study a population of these high-energy objects. this catalogsummarizes 46 high-confidence pulsed detections using the first six months ofdata taken by the large area telescope (lat), fermi's main instrument. sixteenpreviously unknown pulsars were discovered by searching for pulsed signals atthe positions of bright gamma-ray sources seen with the lat, or at thepositions of objects suspected to be neutron stars based on observations atother wavelengths. pulsed gamma-ray emission was discovered from twenty-fourknown pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions) derived from monitoringradio pulsars. eight of these new gamma-ray pulsars are millisecond pulsars.the pulsed energy spectra can be described by a power law with an exponentialcutoff, with cutoff energies in the range 1 to 5 gev. the rotational energyloss rate (\dot{e}) of these neutron stars spans 5 decades, from ~3x10^{33}erg/s to 5x10^{38} erg/s, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion togamma-ray emission range from ~0.1% to unity, although distance uncertaintiescomplicate efficiency estimates. the pulse shapes show substantial diversity,but roughly 75% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles have two peaks, separated by&gt;0.2 of rotational phase. for most of the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appearsto come mainly from the outer magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remainsplausible for a remaining few. finally, these discoveries suggest thatgamma-ray-selected young pulsars are born at a rate comparable to that of theirradio-selected cousins and that the birthrate of all young gamma-ray-detectedpulsars is a substantial fraction of the expected galactic supernova rate.

0910.3565	fermi large area telescope gamma-ray detection of the radio galaxy m87	we report the fermi-lat discovery of high-energy (mev/gev) gamma-ray emissionpositionally consistent with the center of the radio galaxy m87, at a sourcesignificance of over 10 sigma in ten-months of all-sky survey data. followingthe detections of cen a and per a, this makes m87 the third radio galaxy seenwith the lat. the faint point-like gamma-ray source has a &gt;100 mev flux of 2.45(+/- 0.63) x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (photon index = 2.26 +/- 0.13) with nosignificant variability detected within the lat observation. this flux iscomparable with the previous egret upper limit (&lt; 2.18 x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1, 2sigma), thus there is no evidence for a significant mev/gev flare on decadetimescales. contemporaneous chandra and vlba data indicate low activity in theunresolved x-ray and radio core relative to previous observations, suggestingm87 is in a quiescent overall level over the first year of fermi-latobservations. the lat gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as synchrotron self-compton(ssc) emission from the electron population producing the radio-to-x-rayemission in the core. the resultant ssc spectrum extrapolates smoothly from thelat band to the historical-minimum tev emission. alternative models for thecore and possible contributions from the kiloparsec-scale jet in m87 areconsidered, and can not be excluded.

1001.3298	observations of the large magellanic cloud with fermi	context: the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is to date the only normal externalgalaxy that has been detected in high-energy gamma rays. high-energy gamma raystrace particle acceleration processes and gamma-ray observations allow thenature and sites of acceleration to be studied. aims: we characterise thedistribution and sources of cosmic rays in the lmc from analysis of gamma-rayobservations. methods: we analyse 11 months of continuous sky-surveyobservations obtained with the large area telescope aboard the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope and compare it to tracers of the interstellar medium and modelsof the gamma-ray sources in the lmc. results: the lmc is detected at 33 sigmasignificance. the integrated &gt;100 mev photon flux of the lmc amounts to (2.6+/- 0.2) * 10^-7 ph/cm2/s which corresponds to an energy flux of (1.6 +/- 0.1)* 10^-10 erg/cm2/s, with additional systematic uncertainties of ~16%. theanalysis reveals the massive star forming region 30 doradus as a bright sourceof gamma-ray emission in the lmc in addition to fainter emission regions foundin the northern part of the galaxy. the gamma-ray emission from the lmc showsvery little correlation with gas density and is rather correlated to tracers ofmassive star forming regions. the close confinement of gamma-ray emission tostar forming regions suggests a relatively short gev cosmic-ray protondiffusion length. conclusions: the close correlation between cosmic-ray densityand massive star tracers supports the idea that cosmic rays are accelerated inmassive star forming regions as a result of the large amounts of kinetic energythat are input by the stellar winds and supernova explosions of massive starsinto the interstellar medium.

1002.2198	observation of supernova remnant ic443 with the fermi large area  telescope	we report observation of the supernova remnant ic443 (g189.1+3.0) with thefermi gamma-ray space telescope large area telescope (lat) in the energy bandbetween 200mev and 50gev. ic443 is a shell-type supernova remnant with mixedmorphology located off the outer galactic plane where high-energy emission hasbeen detected in the x-ray, gev and tev gamma-ray bands. past observationssuggest ic443 has been interacting with surrounding interstellar matter.proximity between dense shocked molecular clouds and gev-tev gamma-ray emissionregions detected by egret, magic and veritas suggests an interpretation thatcosmic-ray (cr) particles are accelerated by the snr. with the high gamma-raystatistics and broad energy coverage provided by the lat, we accuratelycharacterize the gamma-ray emission produced by the crs accelerated at ic443.the emission region is extended in the energy band with theta_68 = 0.27 deg +/-0.01 deg (stat) +/- 0.03 deg (sys) for an assumed 2-dimensional gaussianprofile and overlaps almost completely with the extended source region ofveritas. its centroid is displaced significantly from the known pulsar windnebula (pwn) which suggests the pwn is not the major contributor in the presentenergy band. the observed spectrum changes its power-law slope continuously andcontinues smoothly to the magic and veritas data points. the combined gamma-rayspectrum (200mev &lt;e&lt; 2tev) is reproduced well by decays of neutral pionsproduced by a broken power-law proton spectrum with a break around 70gev.

1002.4050	the vela pulsar: results from the first year of fermi lat observations	we report on analysis of timing and spectroscopy of the vela pulsar usingeleven months of observations with the large area telescope on the fermigamma-ray space telescope. the intrinsic brightness of vela at gev energiescombined with the angular resolution and sensitivity of the lat allow us tomake the most detailed study to date of the energy-dependent light curves andphase-resolved spectra, using a lat-derived timing model. the light curveconsists of two peaks (p1 and p2) connected by bridge emission containing athird peak (p3). we have confirmed the strong decrease of the p1/p2 ratio withincreasing energy seen with egret and previous fermi lat data, and observe thatp1 disappears above 20 gev. the increase with energy of the mean phase of thep3 component can be followed with much greater detail, showing that p3 and p2are present up to the highest energies of pulsation. we find significant pulsedemission at phases outside the main profile, indicating that magnetosphericemission exists over 80% of the pulsar period. with increased high-energycounts the phase-averaged spectrum is seen to depart from a power- law withsimple exponential cutoff, and is better fit with a more gradual cutoff. thespectra in fixed-count phase bins are well fit with power-laws with exponentialcutoffs, revealing a strong and complex phase dependence of the cutoff energy,especially in the peaks. by combining these results with predictions of theouter magnetosphere models that map emission characteristics to phase, it willbe possible to probe the particle acceleration and the structure of the pulsarmagnetosphere with unprecedented detail.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1004.0348	gamma-ray light curves and variability of bright fermi-detected blazars	this paper presents light curves and the first systematic characterization ofvariability of the 106 objects in the fermi large area telescope (lat) brightagn sample (lbas). weekly light curves obtained during the first 11 months ofsurvey (august 04, 2008 - july 04, 2009), are tested for variability, and theirproperties are quantified through autocorrelation and structure functionanalysis. for the brightest sources power density spectra (pds) and fit of thetemporal structure of major flares is performed. more than 50% of the sourcesare variable, where high states do not exceed 1/4 of the total observationrange. variation amplitudes are larger for fsrqs and low/intermediatesynchrotron peaked (lsp/isp) bl lac objects. autocorrelation time scales varyfrom 4 to a dozen of weeks. variable sources of the sample have 1/(f^{a}) pdsand show two modes: (1) rather constant baseline with sporadic flaring activitycharacterized by flatter pds slopes resembling flickering and red-noise withoccasional intermittence, and (2) - measured for a few blazars showing strongactivity - complex and structured temporal profiles characterized bylonger-term memory and steeper pds slopes typical of a random-walk underlyingmechanism. the average pds slope of the brightest 22 fsrqs and the 6 brightestbl lacs is 1.5 and 1.7 respectively. the study of temporal profiles of wellresolved flares shows that they generally have symmetric profiles and thattheir total duration vary between 10 and 100 days.

1004.2857	suzaku observations of luminous quasars: revealing the nature of  high-energy blazar emission in quiescent states	we present the results from the suzaku x-ray observations of fiveflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), namely pks0208-512, q0827+243,pks1127-145, pks1510-089 and 3c 454.3. all these sources were additionallymonitored simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously by the fermi satellite ingamma-rays and the swift uvot in the uv and optical bands, respectively. weconstructed their broad-band spectra covering the frequency range from 10^14 hzup to 10^25 hz, and those reveal the nature of high-energy emission of luminousblazars in their low-activity states. the analyzed x-ray spectra are wellfitted by a power-law model with photoelectric absorption. in the case ofpks0208-512, pks1127-145, and 3c 454.3, the x-ray continuum showed indicationof hard-ening at low-energies. moreover, when compared with the previous x-rayobservations, we see a significantly increasing contribution of low-energyphotons to the total x-ray fluxes when the sources are getting fainter. thesame behavior can be noted in the suzaku data alone. a likely explanationinvolves a variable, flat-spectrum component produced via inverse-compton (ic)emission, plus an additional, possibly steady soft x-ray component prominentwhen the source gets fainter. this soft x-ray excess is represented either by asteep powerlaw (photon indices gamma ~ 3 - 5) or a blackbody-type emission withtemperatures kt ~ 0.1-0.2 kev. we model the broad-band spectra spectra of thefive observed fsrqs using synchrotron self-compton (ssc) and/orexternal-compton radiation (ecr) models. our modeling suggests that thedifference between the low and high-activity states in luminous blazars is dueto the different total kinetic power of the jet, most likely related to varyingbulk lorentz factor of the outflow within the blazar emission zone.

1005.0996	fermi large area telescope constraints on the gamma-ray opacity of the  universe	the extragalactic background light (ebl) includes photons with wavelengthsfrom ultraviolet to infrared, which are effective at attenuating gamma rayswith energy above ~10 gev during propagation from sources at cosmologicaldistances. this results in a redshift- and energy-dependent attenuation of thegamma-ray flux of extragalactic sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts(grbs). the large area telescope onboard fermi detects a sample of gamma-rayblazars with redshift up to z~3, and grbs with redshift up to z~4.3. usingphotons above 10 gev collected by fermi over more than one year of observationsfor these sources, we investigate the effect of gamma-ray flux attenuation bythe ebl. we place upper limits on the gamma-ray opacity of the universe atvarious energies and redshifts, and compare this with predictions fromwell-known ebl models. we find that an ebl intensity in the optical-ultravioletwavelengths as great as predicted by the "baseline" model of stecker et al.(2006) can be ruled out with high confidence.

1006.2134	eight gamma-ray pulsars discovered in blind frequency searches of fermi  lat data	we report the discovery of eight gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequencysearches using the lat, onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. five ofthe eight pulsars are young (tau_c&lt;100 kyr), energetic (edot&gt;10^36 erg/s), andlocated within the galactic plane (|b|&lt;3 deg). the remaining three are older,less energetic, and located off the plane. five pulsars are associated withsources included in the lat bright gamma-ray source list, but only one, psrj1413-6205, is clearly associated with an egret source. psr j1023-5746 has thesmallest characteristic age (tau_c=4.6 kyr) and is the most energetic(edot=1.1e37 erg/s) of all gamma-ray pulsars discovered so far in blindsearches. psrs j1957+5033 and j2055+25 have the largest characteristic ages(tau_c~1 myr) and are the least energetic (edot~5e33 erg/s) of thenewly-discovered pulsars. we present the timing models, light curves, anddetailed spectral parameters of the new pulsars. we used recent xmmobservations to identify the counterpart of psr j2055+25 as xmmuj205549.4+253959. in addition, publicly available archival chandra x-ray dataallowed us to identify the likely counterpart of psr j1023-5746 as a faint,highly absorbed source, cxou j102302.8-574606. the large x-ray absorptionindicates that this could be among the most distant gamma-ray pulsars detectedso far. psr j1023-5746 is positionally coincident with the tev source hessj1023-575, located near the young stellar cluster westerlund 2, while psrj1954+2836 is coincident with a 4.3 sigma excess reported by milagro at amedian energy of 35 tev. deep radio follow-up observations of the eight pulsarsresulted in no detections of pulsations and upper limits comparable to thefaintest known radio pulsars, indicating that these can be included among thegrowing population of radio-quiet pulsars in our galaxy being uncovered by thelat, and currently numbering more than 20.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1202.0846	spectrum and morphology of the two brightest milagro sources in the  cygnus region: mgro j2019+37 and mgro j2031+41	the cygnus region is a very bright and complex portion of the tev sky, hostto unidentified sources and a diffuse excess with respect to conventionalcosmic-ray propagation models. two of the brightest tev sources, mgro j2019+37and mgro j2031+41, are analyzed using milagro data with a new technique, andtheir emission is tested under two different spectral assumptions: a power lawand a power law with an exponential cutoff. the new analysis technique is basedon an energy estimator that uses the fraction of photomultiplier tubes in theobservatory that detect the extensive air shower. the photon spectrum ismeasured in the range 1 to 200 tev using the last 3 years of milagro data(2005-2008), with the detector in its final configuration. mgro j2019+37 isdetected with a significance of 12.3 standard deviations ($\sigma$), and isbetter fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff than by a simple powerlaw, with a probability $&gt;98$% (f-test). the best-fitting parameters for thepower law with exponential cutoff model are a normalization at 10 tev of$7^{+5}_{-2}\times10^{-10}$ $\mathrm{s^{-1}\: m^{-2}\: tev^{-1}}$, a spectralindex of $2.0^{+0.5}_{-1.0}$ and a cutoff energy of $29^{+50}_{-16}$ tev. mgroj2031+41 is detected with a significance of 7.3$\sigma$, with no evidence of acutoff. the best-fitting parameters for a power law are a normalization of$2.4^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\times10^{-10}$ $\mathrm{s^{-1}\: m^{-2}\: tev^{-1}}$ and aspectral index of $3.08^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. the overall flux is subject to an$\sim$30% systematic uncertainty. the systematic uncertainty on the power lawindices is $\sim$0.1. a comparison with previous results from tev j2032+4130,mgro j2031+41 and mgro j2019+37 is also presented.

1205.3089	radio searches of fermi lat sources and blind search pulsars: the fermi  pulsar search consortium	we present a summary of the fermi pulsar search consortium (psc), aninternational collaboration of radio astronomers and members of the large areatelescope (lat) collaboration, whose goal is to organize radio follow-upobservations of fermi pulsars and pulsar candidates among the lat gamma-raysource population. the psc includes pulsar observers with expertise using theworld's largest radio telescopes that together cover the full sky. we haveperformed very deep observations of all 35 pulsars discovered in blindfrequency searches of the lat data, resulting in the discovery of radiopulsations from four of them. we have also searched over 300 lat gamma-raysources that do not have strong associations with known gamma-ray emittingsource classes and have pulsar-like spectra and variability characteristics.these searches have led to the discovery of a total of 43 new radio millisecondpulsars (msps) and four normal pulsars. these discoveries greatly increase theknown population of msps in the galactic disk, more than double the knownpopulation of so-called `black widow' pulsars, and contain many promisingcandidates for inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.

1401.1386	multi-wavelength observations of the binary system psr b1259-63/ls 2883  around the 2010-2011 periastron passage	we report on broad multi-wavelength observations of the 2010-2011 periastronpassage of the gamma-ray loud binary system psr b1259-63. high resolutioninterferometric radio observations establish extended radio emission trailingthe position of the pulsar. observations with the fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope reveal gev gamma-ray flaring activity of the system, reaching thespin-down luminosity of the pulsar, around 30 days after periastron. there areno clear signatures of variability at radio, x-ray and tev energies at the timeof the gev flare. variability around periastron in the h$\alpha$ emission line,can be interpreted as the gravitational interaction between the pulsar and thecircumstellar disk. the equivalent width of the h$\alpha$ grows from a few daysbefore periastron until a few days later, and decreases again between 18 and 46days after periastron. in near infrared we observe the similar decrease of theequivalent width of br$\gamma$ line between the 40th and 117th day after theperiastron. for the idealized disk, the variability of the h$\alpha$ linerepresents the variability of the mass and size of the disk. we discusspossible physical relations between the state of the disk and gev emissionunder assumption that gev flare is directly related to the decrease of the disksize.

1401.2161	the study of tev variability and duty cycle of mrk 421 from 3 years of  observations with the milagro observatory	tev flaring activity with time scales as short as tens of minutes and anorphan tev flare have been observed from the blazar markarian 421 (mrk 421).the tev emission from mrk 421 is believed to be produced by leptonicsynchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission. in this scenario, correlations betweenthe x-ray and the tev fluxes are expected, tev orphan flares are hardlyexplained and the activity (measured as duty cycle) of the source at tevenergies is expected to be equal or less than that observed in x-rays if onlyssc is considered. to estimate the tev duty cycle of mrk 421 and to establishlimits on its variability at different time scales, we continuously observedmrk 421 with the milagro observatory. mrk 421 was detected by milagro with astatistical significance of 7.1 standard deviations between 2005 september 21and 2008 march 15. the observed spectrum is consistent with previousobservations by veritas. we estimate the duty cycle of mrk 421 for energiesabove 1 tev for different hypothesis of the baseline flux and for differentflare selections and we compare our results with the x-ray duty cycle estimatedby resconi et al. 2009. the robustness of the results is discussed.

1403.0161	milagro observations of potential tev emitters	this paper reports the results from three targeted searches of milagro tevsky maps: two extragalactic point source lists and one pulsar source list. thefirst extragalactic candidate list consists of 709 candidates selected from thefermi-lat 2fgl catalog. the second extragalactic candidate list contains 31candidates selected from the tevcat source catalog that have been detected byimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts). in both extragalacticcandidate lists mkn 421 was the only source detected by milagro. this paperpresents the milagro tev flux for mkn 421 and flux limits for the brighterfermi-lat extragalactic sources and for all tevcat candidates. the pulsar listextends a previously published milagro targeted search for galactic sources.with the 32 new gamma-ray pulsars identified in 2fgl, the number of pulsarsthat are studied by both fermi-lat and milagro is increased to 52. in thissample, we find that the probability of milagro detecting a tev emissioncoincident with a pulsar increases with the gev flux observed by the fermi-latin the energy range from 0.1 gev to 100 gev.

1407.1686	milagro limits and hawc sensitivity for the rate-density of evaporating  primordial black holes	primordial black holes (pbhs) are gravitationally collapsed objects that mayhave been created by density fluctuations in the early universe and could havearbitrarily small masses down to the planck scale. hawking showed that due toquantum effects, a black hole has a temperature inversely proportional to itsmass and will emit all species of fundamental particles thermally. pbhs withinitial masses of ~5.0 x 10^14 g should be expiring in the present epoch withbursts of high-energy particles, including gamma radiation in the gev - tevenergy range. the milagro high energy observatory, which operated from 2000 to2008, is sensitive to the high end of the pbh evaporation gamma-ray spectrum.due to its large field-of-view, more than 90% duty cycle and sensitivity up to100 tev gamma rays, the milagro observatory is well suited to perform a searchfor pbh bursts. based on a search on the milagro data, we report new pbh burstrate density upper limits over a range of pbh observation times. in addition,we report the sensitivity of the milagro successor, the high altitude watercherenkov (hawc) observatory, to pbh evaporation events.

0705.1554	milagro constraints on very high energy emission from short duration  gamma-ray bursts	recent rapid localizations of short, hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) by theswift and hete satellites have led to the observation of the first afterglowsand the measurement of the first redshifts from this type of burst. detectionof &gt;100 gev counterparts would place powerful constraints on grb mechanisms.seventeen short duration (&lt; 5 s) grbs detected by satellites occurred withinthe field of view of the milagro gamma-ray observatory between 2000 january and2006 december. we have searched the milagro data for &gt;100 gev counterparts tothese grbs and find no significant emission correlated with these bursts. dueto the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by the extragalactic backgroundlight (ebl), detections are only expected for redshifts less than ~0.5. whilemost long duration grbs occur at redshifts higher than 0.5, the opposite isthought to be true of short grbs. lack of a detected vhe signal thus allowssetting meaningful fluence limits. one grb in the sample (050509b) has a likelyassociation with a galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, while another (051103) hasbeen tentatively linked to the nearby galaxy m81. fluence limits are correctedfor ebl absorption, either using the known measured redshift, or computing thecorresponding absorption for a redshift of 0.1 and 0.5, as well as for the caseof z=0.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

0805.0417	a measurement of the spatial distribution of diffuse tev gamma ray  emission from the galactic plane with milagro	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission produced by the interaction of cosmic-rayparticles with matter and radiation in the galaxy can be used to probe thedistribution of cosmic rays and their sources in different regions of thegalaxy. with its large field of view and long observation time, the milagrogamma ray observatory is an ideal instrument for surveying large regions of thenorthern hemisphere sky and for detecting diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission at veryhigh energies. here, the spatial distribution and the flux of the diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission in the tev energy range with a median energy of 15 tevfor galactic longitudes between 30$^\circ$ and 110$^\circ$ and between136$^\circ$ and 216$^\circ$ and for galactic latitudes between -10$^\circ$ and10$^\circ$ are determined. the measured fluxes are consistent with predictionsof the galprop model everywhere except for the cygnus region($l\in[65^\circ,85^\circ]$). for the cygnus region, the flux is twice thepredicted value. this excess can be explained by the presence of active cosmicray sources accelerating hadrons which interact with the local denseinterstellar medium and produce gamma rays through pion decay.

astro-ph;0611691	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the cygnus region of the galaxy	the diffuse gamma radiation arising from the interaction of cosmic rayparticles with matter and radiation in the galaxy is one of the few probesavailable to study the origin of the cosmic rays. milagro is a water cherenkovdetector that continuously views the entire overhead sky. the largefield-of-view combined with the long observation time makes milagro the mostsensitive instrument available for the study of large, low surface brightnesssources such as the diffuse gamma radiation arising from interactions of cosmicradiation with interstellar matter. in this paper we present spatial and fluxmeasurements of tev gamma-ray emission from the cygnus region. the tev imageshows at least one new source mgro j2019+37 as well as correlations with thematter density in the region as would be expected from cosmic-ray protoninteractions. however, the tev gamma-ray flux as measured at ~12 tev from thecygnus region (after excluding mgro j2019+37) exceeds that predicted from aconventional model of cosmic ray production and propagation. this observationindicates the existence of either hard-spectrum cosmic-ray sources and/or othersources of tev gamma rays in the region.
