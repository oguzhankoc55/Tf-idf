0902.0450	evolution of the barium abundance in the early galaxy from a nlte  analysis of the ba lines in a homogeneous sample of emp stars	barium is a key element in constraining the evolution of the (not wellunderstood) r-process in the first galactic stars and currently the baabundances in these very metal-poor stars were mostly measured under the localthermodynamical equilibrium (lte) assumption, which may lead in general to anunderestimation of ba. we present here determinations of the barium abundancetaking into account the non-lte (nlte) effects in a sample of extremelymetal-poor stars (emp stars): 6 turnoff stars and 35 giants. the nlte profilesof the three unblended ba ii lines (455.4, 585.3, 649.6nm) have been computed.the computations were made with a modified version of the multi code, appliedto an atomic model of the ba atom with 31 levels of ba i, 101 levels of ba ii,and compared to the observations. the ratios of the nlte abundances of bariumrelative to fe are slightly shifted towards the solar ratio. in the plot of[ba/fe] versus [fe/h], the slope of the regression line is slightly reduced asis the scatter. in the interval -3.3 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; -2.6, [ba/fe] decreases with aslope of about 1.4 and a scatter close to 0.44. for [fe/h] &lt;-3.3 the number ofstars is not sufficient to decide whether [ba/fe] keeps decreasing (and thencd-38:245 should be considered as a peculiar "barium-rich star") or if aplateau is reached as soon as [ba/fe] ~ -1. in both cases the scatter remainsquite large, larger than what can be accounted for by the measurement anddetermination errors, suggesting the influence of a complex process of baproduction, and/or inefficient mixing in the early galaxy.

0903.4174	first stars xii. abundances in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars,and  comparison with the giants	context:the detailed chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor (emp) starsare key guides to understanding the early chemical evolution of the galaxy.most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experiencedinternal mixing later. aims: we aim to compare the results for giants with new,accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 emp turnoff stars.methods:vlt/uves spectra at r ~45,000 and s/n~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) areanalysed with osmarcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrum code to deriveabundances for c, mg, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, co, ni, zn, sr, and ba. results:for ca, ni, sr, and ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sampleof emp giants, at all metallicities. however, our abundances of c, sc, ti, cr,mn and co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. mg and siabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [mg/fe] values are slightly revised),while zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [fe/h] (6 starsonly). conclusions:for c, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have anastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomingsin the analysis. approximate computations of granulation (3d) effects yieldsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is anunlikely explanation, except perhaps for c, cr, and mn. nlte computations forna and al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike thelte results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements aswell. meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data forgalactic chemical evolution models.

0904.4307	chemical composition of extremely metal-poor stars in the sextans dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	chemical abundances of six extremely metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-2.5) stars in thesextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy are determined based on high resolutionspectroscopy (r=40,000) with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph.(1) the fe abundances derived from the high resolution spectra are in goodagreement with the metallicity estimated from the ca triplet lines in lowresolution spectra. the lack of stars with [fe/h]=&lt;-3 in sextans, found byprevious estimates from the ca triplet, is confirmed by our measurements,although we note that high resolution spectroscopy for a larger sample of starswill be necessary to estimate the true fraction of stars with such lowmetallicity. (2) while one object shows an overabundance of mg (similar togalactic halo stars), the mg/fe ratios of the remaining five stars are similarto the solar value. this is the first time that low mg/fe ratios at such lowmetallicities have been found in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. no evidence forover-abundances of ca and ti are found in these five stars, though themeasurements for these elements are less certain. possible mechanisms toproduce low mg/fe ratios, with respect to that of galactic halo stars, arediscussed. (3) ba is under-abundant in four objects, while the remaining twostars exhibit large and moderate excesses of this element. the abundancedistribution of ba in this galaxy is similar to that in the galactic halo,indicating that the enrichment of heavy elements, probably by the r-process,started at metallicities [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, as found in the galactic halo.

0904.4505	star formation histories, abundances and kinematics of dwarf galaxies in  the local group	within the local universe galaxies can be studied in great detail star bystar, and here we review the results of quantitative studies in nearby dwarfgalaxies. the color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established asthe most accurate way to determine star formation history of galaxies back tothe earliest times. this approach received a large boost from the exceptionaldata sets that wide field ccd imagers on the ground and the hubble spacetelescope could provide. spectroscopic studies using large ground basedtelescopes such as vlt, magellan, keck and het have allowed the determinationof abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarfgalaxies. these studies have shown how the properties of stellar populationscan vary spatially and temporally. this leads to important constraints totheories of galaxy formation and evolution. the combination of spectroscopy andimaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolutionis the aim of this review.

0904.4636	the dynamical and chemical evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies	we present a large sample of fully self-consistent hydrodynamicalnbody/tree-sph simulations of isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). ithas enabled us to identify the key physical parameters and mechanisms at theorigin of the observed variety in the local group dsph properties. the initialtotal mass (gas + dark matter) of these galaxies is the main driver of theirevolution. star formation (sf) occurs in series of short bursts. in massivesystems, the very short intervals between the sf peaks mimic a continuous starformation rate, while less massive systems exhibit well separated sf bursts, asidentified observationally. the delay between the sf events is controlled bythe gas cooling time dependence on galaxy mass. the observed global scalingrelations, luminosity-mass and luminosity-metallicity, are reproduced with lowscatter. we take advantage of the unprecedentedly large sample size and datahomogeneity of the eso large programme dart, and add to it a few independentstudies, to constrain the star formation history of five milky way dsphs,sextans, leoii, carina, sculptor and fornax. for the first time, [mg/fe] vs[fe/h] diagrams derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds ofindividual stars are confronted with model predictions. we find that thediversity in dsph properties may well result from intrinsic evolution. we note,however, that the presence of gas in the final state of our simulations, of theorder of what is observed in dwarf irregulars, calls for removal by externalprocesses.

0907.4372	li-rich rgb stars in the galactic bulge	we present lithium abundance determination for a sample of k giant stars inthe galactic bulge. the stars presented here are the only 13 stars withdetectable lithium line (6767.18 a) among ~400 stars for which we have spectrain this wavelength range, half of them in baade's window (b=-4) and half in afield at b=-6. the stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph offlames@vlt, with a spectral resolution of r~20,000. abundances were derived viaspectral synthesis and the results are compared with those for stars withsimilar parameters, but no detectable li line. we find 13 stars with adetectable li line, among which 2 have abundances a(li)&gt;2.7. no clearcorrelations were found between the li abundance and those of other elements.with the exception of the two most li rich stars, the others follow a fairlytight a(li)-t_eff correlation. it would seems that there must be a liproduction phase during the red giant branch (rgb), acting either on a veryshort timescale, or selectively only in some stars. the proposed li productionphase associated with the rgb bump cannot be excluded, although our targets aresignificantly brighter than the predicted rgb bump magnitude for a populationat 8 kpc

0908.3603	vlt-flames analysis of 8 giants in the bulge metal-poor globular cluster  ngc 6522: oldest cluster in the galaxy?	ngc 6522 has been the first metal-poor globular cluster identified in thebulge by w. baade. despite its importance, very few high resolution abundanceanalyses of stars in this cluster are available in the literature. the bulgemetal-poor clusters may be important tracers of the early chemical enrichmentof the galaxy. the main purpose of this study is the determination ofmetallicity and elemental ratios in individual stars of ngc 6522. highresolution spectra of 8 giants of the bulge globular cluster ngc 6522 wereobtained at the 8m vlt ut2-kueyen telescope with the flames+giraffespectrograph. multiband v,i,j,ks} photometry was used to derive effectivetemperatures as reference values. spectroscopic parameters are derived from feiand feii lines, and adopted for the derivation of abundance ratios. the presentanalysis provides a metallicity [fe/h] = -1.0+-0.2. the alpha-elements oxygen,magnesium and silicon show [o/fe]=+0.4, [mg/fe]=[si/fe]= +0.25, whereas calciumand titanium show shallower ratios of [ca/fe]=[ti/fe]=+0.15. theneutron-capture r-process element europium appears to be overabundant by[eu/fe]=+0.4. the neutron-capture s-elements la and ba are enhanced by[la/fe]=+0.35 and [ba/fe]=+0.5. the large internal errors, indicating the largestar-to-star variationin the ba and eu abundances, are also discussed. themoderate metallicity combined to a blue horizontal branch (bhb), arecharacteristics similar to those of hp~1 and ngc 6558, pointing to a populationof very old globular clusters in the galactic bulge. also, the abundance ratiosin ngc 6522 resemble those in hp 1 and ngc 6558. the ultimate conclusion isthat the bulge is old, and went through an early prompt chemical enrichment.

0910.0448	chemical abundances for 11 bulge stars from high-resolution, near-ir  spectra	it is debated whether the milky way bulge has the characteristics of aclassical bulge sooner than those of a pseudobulge. detailed abundance studiesof bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classificationof the bulge. the aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulgeand to study detailed abundances determined from near-ir spectra for bulgegiants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing thestellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the presentstudy. especially, the important cno elements are better determined in thenear-ir. high-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the h band are recordedusing the crires spectrometer on the very large telescope. the cno abundancescan all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength rangeobserved. abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-irspectra. [o/fe], [si/fe] and [s/fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of atleast [fe/h]=-0.3, after which they decline. this suggests that the milky waybulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of aclassical bulge. however, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend ofthe local thick disk seems present. such a similarity could suggest that thebulge has a pseudobulge origin. our [c/fe] trend does not show any increasewith [fe/h] which could have been expected if w-r stars have contributedsubstantially to the c abundances. no "cosmic scatter" can be traced around ourobserved abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given theobservational uncertainties.

0910.0707	the hamburg/eso r-process enhanced star survey (heres) iv. detailed  abundance analysis and age dating of the strongly r-process enhanced stars cs  29491-069 and he 1219-0312	we report on a detailed abundance analysis of two strongly r-processenhanced, very metal-poor stars newly discovered in the heres project, cs29491-069 ([fe/h]=-2.51, [r/fe]=+1.1) and he 1219-0312 ([fe/h]=-2.96,[r/fe]=+1.5). the analysis is based on high-quality vlt/uves spectra and marcsmodel atmospheres. we detect lines of 15 heavy elements in the spectrum of cs29491-069, and 18 in he 1219-0312; in both cases including the th ii 4019 {\aa}line. the heavy-element abundance patterns of these two stars are mostlywell-matched to scaled solar residual abundances not formed by the s-process.we also compare the observed pattern with recent high-entropy wind (hew)calculations, which assume core-collapse supernovae of massive stars as theastrophysical environment for the r-process, and find good agreement for mostlanthanides. the abundance ratios of the lighter elements strontium, yttrium,and zirconium, which are presumably not formed by the main r-process, arereproduced well by the model. radioactive dating for cs 29491-069 with theobserved thorium and rare-earth element abundance pairs results in an averageage of 9.5 gyr, when based on solar r-process residuals, and 17.6 gyr, whenusing hew model predictions. chronometry seems to fail in the case of he1219-0312, resulting in a negative age due to its high thorium abundance. he1219-0312 could therefore exhibit an overabundance of the heaviest elements,which is sometimes called an "actinide boost".

1003.3571	the hamburg/eso r-process enhanced star survey (heres). v. detailed  abundance analysis of the r-process enhanced star he 2327-5642	we report on a detailed abundance analysis of the strongly r-process enhancedgiant star, he 2327-5642 ([fe/h] = -2.78, [r/fe] = +0.99). determination ofstellar parameters and element abundances was based on analysis of high-qualityvlt/uves spectra. the surface gravity was calculated from the nlte ionizationbalance between fe i and fe ii, and ca i and ca ii. accurate abundances for atotal of 40 elements and for 23 neutron-capture elements beyond sr and up to thwere determined. the heavy element abundance pattern of he 2327-5642 is inexcellent agreement with those previously derived for other strongly r-processenhanced stars. elements in the range from ba to hf match the scaled solarr-process pattern very well. no firm conclusion can be drawn with respect to arelationship between the fisrt neutron-capture peak elements, sr to pd, in he2327-5642 and the solar r-process, due to the uncertainty of the latter. aclear distinction in sr/eu abundance ratios was found between the halo starswith different europium enhancement. the strongly r-process enhanced starsreveal a low sr/eu abundance ratio at [sr/eu] = -0.92+-0.13, while the starswith 0 &lt; [eu/fe] &lt; 1 and [eu/fe] &lt; 0 have 0.36 dex and 0.93 dex larger sr/euvalues, respectively. radioactive dating for he 2327-5642 with the observedthorium and rare-earth element abundance pairs results in an average age of13.3 gyr, when based on the high-entropy wind calculations, and 5.9 gyr, whenusing the solar r-residuals. he 2327-5642 is suspected to be radial-velocityvariable based on our high-resolution spectra, covering ~4.3 years.

1003.4510	the metal-poor end of the spite plateau. 1: stellar parameters,  metallicities and lithium abundances	we present vlt-uves li abundances for 28 halo dwarf stars between [fe/h]=-2.5and -3.5, 10 of which have [fe/h]&lt;-3. four different t_eff scales have beenused. direct infrared flux method (irfm) has been used on the basis of 2massinfrared photometry. h_alpha wings have been fitted against synthetic gridscomputed by means of 1d lte atmosphere models, assuming differentself-broadening theories. finally, a grid of h_alpha profiles has been computedby means of 3d hydrodynamical atmosphere models. the li i doublet at 670.8 nmhas been used to measure a(li) by means of 3d hydrodynamical nlte spectralsyntheses. an analytical fit of a(li)(3d, nlte) as a function of equivalentwidth, t_eff, log g, and [fe/h] has been derived and is made available. a(li)does not exhibit a plateau below [fe/h]=-3. a strong positive correlation with[fe/h] appears, not influenced by the choice of the t_eff estimator. from alinear fit, we obtain a strong slope of about 0.30 dex in a(li) per dex in[fe/h], significant to 2-3 sigma, and consistent among all the four t_effestimators. a significant slope is also detected in the a(li)--t_eff plane,driven mainly by the coolest stars in the sample which appear li-poor. removingsuch stars does not alter the behavior in the a(li)-[fe/h] plane. the scatterin a(li) increases by a factor of 2 towards lower metallicities, while theplateau appears very thin above [fe/h]=-2.8. the meltdown of the spite plateaubelow [fe/h]\sim-3 is established, but its cause is unclear. if the primordiala(li) is the one derived from wmap, it appears difficult to envision a singledepletion phenomenon producing a thin, metallicity independent plateau above[fe/h]=-2.8, and a highly scattered, metallicity dependent distribution below.the fact that no star below [fe/h]=-3 lies above the plateau suggests that theyformed at plateau level and underwent subsequent depletion.

1005.3919	insights on the milky way bulge formation from the correlations between  kinematics and metallicity	two main scenarios for the formation of the galactic bulge are invoked, thefirst one through gravitational collapse or hierarchical merging of subclumps,the second through secular evolution of the galactic disc. we aim to constrainthe formation of the galactic bulge through studies of the correlation betweenkinematics and metallicities in baade's window (l=1, b=-4) and two other fieldsalong the bulge minor axis (l=0, b=-6 and b=-12). we combine the radialvelocity and the [fe/h] measurements obtained with flames/giraffe at the vltwith a spectral resolution of r=20000, plus for the baade's window field theogle-ii proper motions, and compare these with published n-body simulations ofthe galactic bulge. we confirm the presence of two distinct populations inbaade's window found in hill et al. 2010: the metal-rich population presentsbar-like kinematics while the metal-poor population shows kinematicscorresponding to an old spheroid or a thick disc one. in this context themetallicity gradient along the bulge minor axis observed by zoccali et al.(2008), visible also in the kinematics, can be related to a varying mix ofthese two populations as one moves away from the galactic plane, alleviatingthe apparent contradiction between the kinematic evidence of a bar and theexistence of a metallicity gradient. we show evidences that the two mainscenarios for the bulge formation co-exist within the milky way bulge.

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

1104.0476	nlte strontium abundance in a sample of extremely metal poor stars and  the sr/ba ratio in the early galaxy	heavy element abundances in extremely metal-poor stars provide strongconstraints on the processes of forming these elements in the first stars. weattempt to determine precise abundances of strontium in a homogeneous sample ofextremely metal-poor stars. the abundances of strontium in 54 very or extremelymetal-poor stars, was redetermined by abandoning the local thermodynamicequilibrium (lte) hypothesis, and fitting non-lte (nlte) profiles to theobserved spectral lines. the corrected sr abundances and previously obtainednlte ba abundances are compared to the predictions of several hypotheticalformation processes for the lighter neutron-capture elements. our nlteabundances confirm the previously determined huge scatter of the strontiumabundance in low metallicity stars. this scatter is also found (and is evenlarger) at very low metallicities (i. e. early in the chemical evolution). thesr abundance in the extremely metal-poor (emp) stars is compatible with themain r-process involved in other processes (or by variations of the r-process),as we briefly discuss.

0709.3454	first stars viii -- enrichment of the neutron-capture elements in the  early galaxy	our aim is to measure accurate, homogeneous neutron-capture elementabundances for the sample of 32 emp giant stars studied earlier in this series,including 22 stars with [fe/h] $&lt; -$3.0. based on high-resolution, high s/nspectra from the eso vlt/uves, 1d, lte model atmospheres, and syntheticspectrum fits, we determine abundances or upper limits for the 16 elements sr,y, zr, ba, la, ce, pr, nd, sm, eu, gd, dy, ho, er, tm, and yb in all stars. asfound earlier, [sr/fe], [y/fe], [zr/fe] and [ba/fe] are below solar in the empstars, with very large scatter. however, we find a tight anti-correlation of[sr/ba], [y/ba], and [zr/ba] with [ba/h] for $-4.5 &lt;$ [ba/h] $&lt; -2.5$, alsowhen subtracting the contribution of the main $r$-process as measured by[ba/h]. the huge, well-characterised scatter of the [n-capture/fe] ratios inour emp stars is in stark contrast to the negligible dispersion in the[$\alpha$/fe] and [fe-peak/fe] ratios for the same stars found in paper v.these results demonstrate that a second (``weak'' or lepp) $r$-processdominates the production of the lighter neutron-capture elements for [ba/h] $&lt;-2.5$. the combination of very consistent [$\alpha$/fe] and erratic[n-capture/fe] ratios indicates that inhomogeneous models for the earlyevolution of the halo are needed. our accurate data provide strong constraintson future models of the production and mixing of the heavy elements in theearly galaxy.

1107.5199	the metallicity distribution of bulge clump giants in baade's window	we seek to constrain the formation of the galactic bulge by means ofanalysing the detailed chemical composition of a large sample of red clumpstars in baade's window. we measure [fe/h] in a sample of 219 bulge red clumpstars from r=20000 resolution spectra obtained with flames/giraffe at the vlt,using an automatic procedure, differentially to the metal-rich local referencestar muleo. for a subsample of 162 stars, we also derive [mg/h] from spectralsynthesis around the mgi triplet at 6319a. the fe and mg metallicitydistributions are both asymmetric, with median values of +0.16 and +0.21respectively. the iron distribution is clearly bimodal, as revealed both by adeconvolution (from observational errors) and a gaussian decomposition. thedecomposition of the observed fe and mg metallicity distributions into gaussiancomponents yields two populations of equal sizes (50% each): a metal-poorcomponent centred around [fe/h]=-0.30 and [mg/h]=-0.06 with a large dispersionand a narrow metal-rich component centred around [fe/h]=+0.32 and [mg/h]=+0.35.the metal poor component shows high [mg/fe] ratios (around 0.3) whereas starsin the metal rich component are found to have near solar ratios. babusiaux etal. (2010) also find kinematical differences between the two components: themetal poor component shows kinematics compatible with an old spheroid whereasthe metal rich component is consistent with a population supporting a bar. inview of their chemical and kinematical properties, we suggest differentformation scenarios for the two populations: a rapid formation timescale as anold spheroid for the metal poor component (old bulge) and for the metal richcomponent, a formation over a longer time scale driven by the evolution of thebar (pseudo-bulge).

1109.0992	x-shooter gto: chemical analysis of a sample of emp candidates	context: extremely metal-poor stars (emp) are very rare objects that hold intheir atmospheres the fossil record of the chemical composition of the earlyphases of galactic evolution. finding these objects and determining theirchemical composition provides important constraints on these early phases.aims: using a carefully designed selection method, we chose a sample ofcandidate emp stars from the low resolution spectra of the sloan digital skysurvey and observed them with x-shooter at the vlt to confirm theirmetallicities and determine abundances for as many elements as possible.method: the x-shooter spectra are analysed by means of one-dimensional,plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. corrections for the granulationeffects are computed using co5bold hydrodynamical simulations. results: all thecandidates are confirmed to be emp stars, proving the efficiency of ourselection method within about 0.5 dex. the chemical composition of this sampleis compatible with those of brighter samples, suggesting that the stars in thegalactic halo are well mixed. conclusions these observations show that it isfeasible to observe, in a limited amount of time, a large sample of about onehundred stars among emp candidates selected from the sdss. such a size ofsample will allow us, in particular, to confirm or refute the existence of avertical drop in the galactic halo metallicity distribution function around[fe/h] ~ -3.5.

1109.6237	automatic stellar spectra parameterisation in the ir caii triplet region	(abridged) galactic archaeology aims to determine the evolution of the galaxyfrom the chemical and kinematical properties of its stars. the analysis ofcurrent large spectroscopic surveys (thousands of stars) and future ones(millions of stars) require automated analysis techniques to obtain robustestimates of the stellar parameters. several on-going and planned spectroscopicsurveys have selected their wavelength region to contain the ir caii tripletand this paper focuses on the automatic analysis of such spectra.  we investigated two algorithms, matisse and degas, both of which compare theobserved spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra, but each uses a differentmathematical approach for finding the optimum match and hence the best stellarparameters.  we identified degeneracies in different regions of the hr diagram: hot dwarfsand giants share the same spectral signatures. furthermore, the surface gravityof cooler dwarfs is difficult to determine accurately. these effects areintensified when the information decreases (e.g. metal-poor stars or low snrspectra). our results show that the local projection method matisse ispreferred for high snr spectra, whereas the decision-tree method degas ispreferred for noisier spectra. we therefore propose a hybrid approach of bothmethods and show that sufficiently accurate results for the purposes ofgalactic archaeology are retrieved down to snr~20 for typical thin or thickdisc stars, and down to snr~50 for the more metal-poor halo giants.  if unappreciated, degeneracies in stellar parameters can introduce biases inderived quantities for target stars such as distances and full space motions.these biases can be minimised using the knowledge gained by thorough testing ofthe proposed algorithm, which in turn lead to robust automated methods for thecoming extensive stellar spectroscopic surveys in the local group.

1110.5221	a spectroscopic survey of thick disc stars outside the solar  neighbourhood	we performed a spectroscopic survey of nearly 700 stars probing the galacticthick disc far from the solar neighbourhood towards the galactic coordinates(l~277, b~47). the derived effective temperatures, surface gravities andoverall metallicities were then combined with stellar evolution isochrones,radial velocities and proper motions to derive the distances, kinematics andorbital parameters of the sample stars. the targets belonging to each galacticcomponent (thin disc, thick disc, halo) were selected either on theirkinematics or according to their position above the galactic plane, and thevertical gradients were also estimated. we present here atmospheric parameters,distances and kinematics for this sample, and a comparison of our kinematic andmetallicity distributions with the besancon model of the milky way. the thickdisc far from the solar neighbourhood is found to differ only slightly from thethick disc properties as derived in the solar vicinity. for regions where thethick disc dominates, we measured vertical velocity and metallicity trends ofd(v_phi)/dz = 19 +/- 8 km/s/kpc and d[m/h]/dz = -0.14 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc,respectively. these trends can be explained as a smooth transition between thedifferent galactic components, although intrinsic gradients could not beexcluded. in addition, a correlation d(v_phi)/d[m/h] = -45 +/- 12 km/s/dexbetween the orbital velocity and the metallicity of the thick disc is detected.this gradient is inconsistent with the sdss photometric survey analysis, whichdid not detect any such trend, and challenges radial migration models of thickdisc formation. estimations of the scale heights and scale lengths fordifferent metallicity bins of the thick disc result in consistent values, withhr~3.4 \pm 0.7 kpc, and hz~694 \pm 45 pc, showing no evidence of relics ofdestroyed massive satellites.

1201.2408	the star formation &amp; chemical evolution history of the sculptor dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	we have combined deep photometry in the b,v and i bands from ctio/mosaic ofthe sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, going down to the oldest main sequenceturn-offs, with spectroscopic metallicity distributions of red giant branchstars. this allows us to obtain the most detailed and complete star formationhistory to date, as well as an accurate timescale for chemical enrichment. thestar formation history shows that sculptor is dominated by old ($&gt;$10 gyr),metal-poor stars, but that younger, more metal-rich populations are alsopresent. using star formation histories determined at different radii from thecentre we show that sculptor formed stars with an increasing centralconcentration with time. the old, metal-poor populations are present at allradii, while more metal-rich, younger stars are more centrally concentrated. wefind that within an elliptical radius of 1 degree, or 1.5 kpc from the centre,a total mass in stars of 7.8$\times10^{6}$ m$_{\odot}$ was formed, between 14and 7 gyr ago, with a peak at 13$-$14 gyr ago. we use the detailed starformation history to determine age estimates for individual red giant branchstars with high resolution spectroscopic abundances. thus, for the first time,we can directly determine detailed timescales for the evolution of individualchemical elements. we find that the trends in alpha-elements match what isexpected from an extended, relatively uninterrupted period of star formationcontinuing for 6$-$7 gyr. the knee in the alpha-element distribution occurs atan age of 10.9$\pm$1gyr, suggesting that sne ia enrichment began$\approx2\pm$1gyr after the start of star formation in sculptor.

1203.2612	an extremely primitive halo star	the early universe had a chemical composition consisting of hydrogen, heliumand traces of lithium1, almost all other elements were created in stars andsupernovae. the mass fraction, z, of elements more massive than helium, iscalled "metallicity". a number of very metal poor stars have been found some ofwhich, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen andoxygen. for theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of starswith metallicities lower than z=1.5e-5, it has been suggested that low massstars (m&lt;0.8m\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form untilthe interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated tolie in the range 1.5e-8\leqz\leq1.5e-6, although competing theories claimingthe contrary do exist. here we report the chemical composition of a star with avery low z\leq6.9e-7 (4.5e-5 of that of the sun) and a chemical pattern typicalof classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment ofcarbon, nitrogen and oxygen. this shows that low mass stars can be formed atvery low metallicity. lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicityextension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. lithiumdepletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperaturesabove two million k in its history, which points to rather particular formationcondition or internal mixing process, for low z stars.

1203.4491	manganese in dwarf spheroidal galaxies	we provide manganese abundances (corrected for the effect of the hyperfinestructure) for a large number of stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxiessculptor and fornax, and for a smaller number in the carina and sextans dsphgalaxies. abundances had already been determined for a number of other elementsin these galaxies, including alpha and iron-peak ones, which allowed us tobuild [mn/fe] and [mn/alpha] versus [fe/h] diagrams. the mn abundances implysub-solar [mn/fe] ratios for the stars in all four galaxies examined. insculptor, [mn/fe] stays roughly constant between [fe/h]\sim -1.8 and -1.4 anddecreases at higher iron abundance. in fornax, [mn/fe] does not vary in anysignificant way with [fe/h]. the relation between [mn/alpha] and [fe/h] for thedsph galaxies is clearly systematically offset from that for the milky way,which reflects the different star formation histories of the respectivegalaxies. the [mn/alpha] behavior can be interpreted as a result of themetal-dependent mn yields of type ii and type ia supernovae. we also computedchemical evolution models for star formation histories matching thosedetermined empirically for sculptor, fornax, and carina, and for the mn yieldsof sne ia, which were assumed to be either constant or variable withmetallicity. the observed [mn/fe] versus [fe/h] relation in sculptor, fornax,and carina can be reproduced only by the chemical evolution models that includea metallicity-dependent mn yield from the sne ia.

1206.6968	the star formation &amp; chemical evolution history of the fornax dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	we present deep photometry in the b,v and i filters from ctio/mosaic forabout 270.000 stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, out to a radius ofr_ell\sim0.8 degrees. by combining the accurately calibrated photometry withthe spectroscopic metallicity distributions of individual red giant branchstars we obtain the detailed star formation and chemical evolution history offornax. fornax is dominated by intermediate age (1-10 gyr) stellar populations,but also includes ancient (10-14 gyr), and young (&lt;1 gyr) stars. we show thatfornax displays a radial age gradient, with younger, more metal-richpopulations dominating the central region. this confirms results from previousworks. within an elliptical radius of 0.8 degrees, or 1.9 kpc from the centre,a total mass in stars of 4.3x10^7 msun was formed, from the earliest timesuntil 250 myr ago. using the detailed star formation history, age estimates aredetermined for individual stars on the upper rgb, for which spectroscopicabundances are available, giving an age-metallicity relation of the fornax dsphfrom individual stars. this shows that the average metallicity of fornax wentup rapidly from [fe/h]&lt;-2.5 dex to [fe/h]=-1.5 dex between 8-12 gyr ago, afterwhich a more gradual enrichment resulted in a narrow, well-defined sequencewhich reaches [fe/h]\sim-0.8 dex, \sim3 gyr ago. these ages also allow us tomeasure the build-up of chemical elements as a function of time, and thusdetermine detailed timescales for the evolution of individual chemicalelements. a rapid decrease in [mg/fe] is seen for the stars with [fe/h]&gt;-1.5dex, with a clear trend in age.

(2006), but our more detailed analysis provides robust estimates ofits location (|z|&lt;1kpc), metallicity (-2&lt;[m/h]&lt;-1 dex) and azimuthal orbitalvelocity (v_phi ~120 km/s).  given the chemo-dynamical properties of the over-density towards the carinaline-of-sight, we suggest that it represents the metal-poor tail of thecanonical thick disc. in spite of the small number of stars available, wesuggest that this metal-weak thick disc follows the often suggested thick discvelocity-metallicity correlation of dv_phi/d[m/h]~40-50km/s/dex.

1310.4108	manganese abundances in galactic bulge red giants	manganese is mainly produced in type ii sne during explosive silicon burning,in incomplete si-burning regions, and depends on several nucleosynthesisenvironment conditions, such as mass cut beween the matter ejected and fallingback onto the remnant, electron and neutron excesses, mixing fallback, andexplosion energy. manganese is also produced in type ia sne. the aim of thiswork is the study of abundances of the iron-peak element mn in 56 bulge giants,among which 13 are red clump stars. four bulge fields along the minor axis areinspected. the study of abundances of mn-over-fe as a function of metallicityin the galactic bulge may shed light on its production mechanisms.high-resolution spectra were obtained using the flames+uves spectrograph on thevery large telescope. the spectra were obtained within a program to observe 800stars using the giraffe spectrograph, together with the present uves spectra.we aim at identifying the chemical evolution of manganese, as a function ofmetallicity, in the galactic bulge. we find [mn/fe] ~-0.7 at [fe/h]~-1.3,increasing to a solar value at metallicities close to solar, and showing aspread around -0.7&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, in good agreement with other work on mn inbulge stars. there is also good agreement with chemical evolution models. wefind no clear difference in the behaviour of the four bulge fields. whereas[mn/fe] vs. [fe/h] could be identified with the behaviour of the thick discstars, [mn/o] vs. [o/h] has a behaviour running parallel, at highermetallicities, compared to thick disc stars, indicating that the bulgeenrichment might have proceeded differently from that of the thick disk.

1312.6472	the gaia-eso survey: abundance ratios in the inner-disk open clusters  trumpler 20, ngc 4815, ngc 6705	open clusters are key tools to study the spatial distribution of abundancesin the disk and their evolution with time. using the first release of stellarparameters and abundances of the gaia-eso survey, we analyse the chemicalproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely ngc6705, ngc 4815, and trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the galacticdisk at galactocentric radius r$_{gc}\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving theirhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. we study theabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosyntheticchannels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. the main results can besummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable[el/fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metalcontent [el/h], with ngc 4815 having the lowest metallicity. their [el/fe]ratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, bothin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing theabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and withfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of mg,ni, ca in ngc 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequentvariation of its r$_{gc}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbitdetermination. the full dataset of the gaia-eso survey will be a superlativetool to constrain the chemical evolution of our galaxy by disentanglingdifferent formation and evolution scenarios.

0802.1519	nlte determination of the aluminium abundance in a homogeneous sample of  extremely metal-poor stars	aims: aluminium is a key element to constrain the models of the chemicalenrichment and the yields of the first supernovae. but obtaining precise alabundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars requires that the non-lteeffects be carefully taken into account.  methods: the nlte profiles of the blue resonance aluminium lines have beencomputed in a sample of 53 extremely metal-poor stars with a modified versionof the program multi applied to an atomic model of the al atom with 78 levelsof al i and 13 levels of al ii, and compared to the observations.  results: with these new determinations, all the stars of the sample show aratio al/fe close to the solar value: [al/fe] =-0.06 +- 0.10 with a very smallscatter. these results are compared to the models of the chemical evolution ofthe halo using different models of sn ii and are compatible with recentcomputations. the sodium-rich giants are not found to be also aluminium-richand thus, as expected, the convection in these giants only brings to thesurface the products of the ne-na cycle.

1401.1925	metallicity and kinematics of the bar in-situ	constraints on the galactic bulge/bar structure and formation history fromstellar kinematics and metallicities mainly come from relatively high-latitudefields (|b|&gt;4) where a complex mix of stellar population is seen. we aim hereto constrain the formation history of the galactic bar by studying the radialvelocity and metallicity distributions of stars in-situ (|b|&lt;1). we observedred clump stars in four fields along the bar's major axis (l=10,6,-6 and b=0plus a field at l=0,b=1) with low-resolution spectroscopy from vlt/flames,observing around the caii triplet. we developed robust methods for extractingradial velocity and metallicity estimates from these low signal-to-noisespectra. we derived distance probability distributions using bayesian methodsrigorously handling the extinction law. we present radial velocities andmetallicity distributions, as well as radial velocity trends with distance. weobserve an increase in the radial velocity dispersion near the galactic plane.we detect the streaming motion of the stars induced by the bar in fields atl=+/-6, the highest velocity components of this bar stream being metal-rich([fe/h]~0.2 dex). our data is consistent with a bar inclined at 26+/-3 from thesun-galactic centre line. we observe a significant fraction of metal-poorstars, in particular in the field at l=0,b=1. we confirm the flattening of themetallicity gradient along the minor axis when getting closer to the plane,with a hint that it could actually be inverted. our stellar kinematicscorresponds to the expected behaviour of a bar issued from the secularevolution of the galactic disc. the mix of several populations, seen furtheraway from the plane, is also seen in the bar in-situ since our metallicitydistributions highlight a different spatial distribution between metal-poor andmetal-rich stars, the more metal-poor stars being more centrally concentrated.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1401.4878	the giraffe inner bulge survey (gibs). i. survey description and a  kinematical map of the milky way bulge	the galactic bulge is a massive, old component of the milky way. it is knownto host a bar, and it has recently been demonstrated to have a pronouncedboxy/peanut structure in its outer region. several independent studies suggestthe presence of more than one stellar populations in the bulge, with differentorigins and a relative fraction changing across the bulge area. this is thefirst of a series of papers presenting the results of the giraffe inner bulgesurvey, carried out at the eso-vlt with the multifibre spectrograph flames.spectra of ~5000 red clump giants in 24 bulge fields have been obtained atresolution r=6500, in the infrared calcium triplet wavelength region at 8500{\aa}. they are used to derive radial velocities and metallicities, based onnew calibration specifically devised for this project. radial velocities foranother ~1200 bulge red clump giants, obtained from similar archive data, havebeen added to the sample. higher resolution spectra have been obtained for 450additional stars at latitude b=-3.5, with the aim of investigating chemicalabundance patterns variations with longitude, across the inner bulge. in totalwe present here radial velocities for 6392 rc stars. we derive a radialvelocity, and velocity dispersion map of the milky way bulge, useful to becompared with similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expectedvelocities and dispersion at any line of sight. the k-type giants kinematics isconsistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of m-giants from the bravasurvey. our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b=-2, closer tothe galactic plane than probed by previous surveys. finally, we find strongevidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0,-1) and (0,-2), possiblyindicative of a high density peak in the central 250 pc of the bulge

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7451	the gaia-eso survey: properties of the intermediate age open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a populous ~500 myr open cluster at a galactocentric radius of 7kpc observed in the first six months of the gaia-eso survey. located in theinner galactic disk, ngc 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,where few intermediate age open clusters are found. we use the survey derivedradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elementalabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry outan analysis of cluster properties. the radial velocity distribution of stars inthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derivelikely cluster membership for stars observed by the gaia-eso survey. weinvestigate the distributions of fe and fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, andthe light elements na and al and characterize the cluster's internal chemicalhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram isanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,distance, and age. ngc 4815 is found to have a mean [fe/h]=+0.03. elementalabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, withinternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1403.7568	the gaia-eso survey: the galactic thick to thin disc transition	(abridged) we have used the atmospheric parameters, [alpha/fe] abundances andradial velocities, determined from the gaia-eso survey giraffe spectra offgk-type stars (idr1), to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation of thedisc stellar populations. we focuss on a subsample of 1016 stars with highquality parameters, covering the volume |z|&lt;4.5kpc and r in the range 2-13kpc.we have identified a thin to thick disc separation in the [alpha/fe] vs [m/h]plane, thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number densitydistribution. the thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layersabove the galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/fe] decreases.the thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to theplane at all metallicities. our data confirm the already known correlationsbetween v_phi and [m/h] for the two discs. for the thick disc sequence, a studyof the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to64km/s/dex. the distributions of v_phi, v_z, and orbital parameters areanalysed for the chemically separated samples. concerning the gradients withgalactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of v_phi, a[m/h] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/fe] gradient. forthe thick disc, flat gradients in [m/h] and [alpha/fe] are derived. ourchemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems tohave experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increasedprogressively, and, possibly, the v_phi dispersion decreased. at [m/h]-0.25dexand [alpha/fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance tothe galactic plane, v_phi, v_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with thoseof the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between thesepopulations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.

1404.0234	high-resolution abundance analysis of very metal-poor r-i stars	moderately r-process-enriched stars (r-i) are at least four times as commonas those that are greatly enriched in r-process elements (r-ii), and theabundances in their atmospheres are important tools for obtaining a betterunderstanding of the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the origin ofthe elements beyond the iron peak. the main aim of this work is to deriveabundances for a sample of seven metal-poor stars with classified as r-i stars,to understand the role of these stars for constraining the astrophysicalnucleosynthesis event(s) that is(are) responsible for the production of ther-process, and to investigate whether they differ, in any significant way, fromthe r-ii stars. we carried out a detailed abundance analysis based onhigh-resolution spectra obtained with the vlt/uves spectrograph. the osmarcslte 1d model atmosphere grid was employed, along with the spectrum synthesiscode turbospectrum. we have derived abundances of light elements li, c, and n,alpha-elements, odd-z elements, iron-peak elements, and the trans-iron elementsfrom the first peak, the second peak, the third peak, and the actinidesregions. the results are compared with values for these elements for r-ii andnormal very and extremely metal-poor stars reported in the literature, agesbased on radioactive chronometry are explored using different models, and anumber of conclusions about the r-process and the r-i stars are presented.hydrodynamical models were used for some elements, and general behaviors forthe 3d corrections were presented.

0802.4220	the kinematic status and mass content of the sculptor dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	we present vlt/flames spectroscopic observations (r~6500) in the caii tripletregion for 470 probable kinematic members of the sculptor (scl) dwarfspheroidal galaxy. the accurate velocities (+- 2 km/s) and large area coverageof scl allow us to measure a velocity gradient of 7.6_{-2.2}^{+3.0} km/sdeg^{-1} along the scl projected major axis, likely a signature of intrinsicrotation. we also use our kinematic data to measure the mass distributionwithin this system. by considering independently the kinematics of the distinctstellar components known to be present in scl, we are able to relieve knowndegeneracies, and find that the observed velocity dispersion profiles are bestfitted by a cored dark matter halo with core radius r_c= 0.5 kpc and massenclosed within the last measured point m(&lt; 1.8 kpc)=3.4 +- 0.7 x 10^8 m_sun,assuming an increasingly radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid. this resultsin a mass-to-light ratio of 158+-33 (m/l)_sun inside 1.8 kpc. an nfw profilewith concentration c=20 and mass m(&lt; 1.8 kpc) = 2.2_{-0.7}^{+1.0} x 10^8 m_sunis also statistically consistent with the observations, but it tends to yieldpoorer fits for the metal rich stars.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

1406.2548	the gaia-eso survey: metallicity of the chamaeleon i star forming region	context. recent metallicity determinations in young open clusters andstar-forming regions suggest that the latter may be characterized by a slightlylower metallicity than the sun and older clusters in the solar vicinity.however, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneousanalyses. the gaia-eso survey is observing and homogeneously analyzing largesamples of stars in several young clusters and star-forming regions, henceallowing us to further investigate this issue.  aims. we present a new metallicity determination of the chamaeleon istar-forming region, based on the products distributed in the first internalrelease of the gaia-eso survey.  methods. 48 candidate members of chamaeleon i have been observed with thehigh-resolution spectrograph uves. we use the surface gravity, lithium lineequivalent width and position in the hertzsprung-russell diagram to confirm thecluster members and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity ofthe region.  results. out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members.considering the metallicity measurements for 9 of them, we find that the ironabundance of chamaeleon i is slightly subsolar with a mean value[fe/h]=-0.08+/-0.04 dex. this result is in agreement with the metallicitydetermination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that thechemical pattern of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed moremetal-poor than the sun. we argue that this evidence may be related to thechemical distribution of the gould belt that contains most of the nearbystar-forming regions and young clusters.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1409.7703	vlt/flames spectroscopy of red giant branch stars in the fornax dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	fornax is one of the most massive dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the localgroup. the fornax field star population is dominated by intermediate age starsbut star formation was going on over almost its entire history. it has beenproposed that fornax experienced a minor merger event. despite recent progress,only the high metallicity end of fornax field stars ([fe/h]&gt;-1.2 dex) has beensampled in larger number via high resolution spectroscopy. we want to betterunderstand the full chemical evolution of this galaxy by better sampling thewhole metallicity range, including more metal poor stars. we use the vlt-flamesmulti-fibre spectrograph in high-resolution mode to determine the abundances ofseveral alpha, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements in a sample of 47individual red giant branch stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. wecombine these abundances with accurate age estimates derived from the ageprobability distribution from the colour-magnitude diagram of fornax. similarto other dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the old, metal-poor stars of fornax aretypically alpha-rich while the young metal-rich stars are alpha-poor. in theclassical scenario of the time delay between sne ii and sne ia, we confirm thatsne ia started to contribute to the chemical enrichment at [fe/h] between -2.0and -1.8 dex. we find that the onset of sne ia took place between 12-10 gyrsago. the high values of [ba/fe], [la/fe] reflect the influence of sne ia andagb stars in the abundance pattern of the younger stellar population of fornax.our findings of low [alpha/fe] and enhanced [eu/mg] are compatible with aninitial mass function that lacks the most massive stars and with star formationthat kept going on throughout the whole history of fornax. we find that massivestars kept enriching the interstellar medium in alpha-elements, although theywere not the main contributor to the iron enrichment.

1410.0842	the gaia-eso survey: extracting diffuse interstellar bands from cool  star spectra, dib-based interstellar medium line-of-sight structures at the  kpc scale	we study how diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) measured towarddistance-distributed target stars can be used to locate dense interstellar (is)clouds in the galaxy and probe a line-of-sight (los) kinematical structure, apotential useful tool when gaseous absorption lines are saturated or notavailable in the spectral range. cool target stars are numerous enough for thispurpose. we have devised automated dib fitting methods appropriate to cool starspectra and multiple is components. the data is fitted with a combination of asynthetic stellar spectrum, a synthetic telluric transmission, and empiricaldib profiles. in parallel, stellar distances and extinctions are estimatedself-consistently by means of a 2d bayesian method, fromspectroscopically-derived stellar parameters and photometric data. we haveanalyzed gaia-eso survey (ges) and previously recorded spectra that probebetween $\sim$ 2 and 10 kpc long los in five different regions of the milkyway. depending on the observed spectral intervals, we extracted one or more ofthe following dibs: $\lambda\lambda$ 6283.8, 6613.6 and 8620.4. for each field,we compared the dib strengths with the bayesian distances and extinctions, andthe dib doppler velocities with the hi emission spectra. for all fields, thedib strength and the target extinction are well correlated. in case of targetswidely distributed in distance, marked steps in dibs and extinction radialdistance profiles match with each other and broadly correspond to the expectedlocations of spiral arms. for all fields, the dib velocity structure agreeswith hi emission spectra and all detected dibs correspond to strong nai lines.this illustrates how dibs can be used to locate the galactic interstellar gasand to study its kinematics at the kpc scale.

1412.4153	the gaia-eso survey: chromospheric emission, accretion properties, and  rotation in $\gamma$ velorum and chamaeleon i	we use the fundamental parameters delivered by the ges consortium in thefirst internal data release to select the members of $\gamma$ vel and cha iamong the uves and giraffe spectroscopic observations. a total of 140 $\gamma$vel members and 74 cha i members were studied. we calculated stellarluminosities through spectral energy distributions, while stellar masses werederived by comparison with evolutionary tracks. the spectral subtraction oflow-activity and slowly rotating templates, which are rotationally broadened tomatch the $v\sin i$ of the targets, enabled us to measure the equivalent widths(ews) and the fluxes in the h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ lines. the h$\alpha$ linewas also used for identifying accreting objects and for evaluating the massaccretion rate ($\dot m_{\rm acc}$). the distribution of $v\sin i$ for themembers of $\gamma$ vel displays a peak at about 10 km s$^{-1}$ with a tailtoward faster rotators. there is also some indication of a different $v\sin i$distribution for the members of its two kinematical populations. only a handfulof stars in $\gamma$ vel display signatures of accretion, while many moreaccretors were detected in the younger cha~i. accreting and active stars occupytwo different regions in a $t_{\rm eff}$-flux diagram and we propose acriterion for distinguishing them. we derive $\dot m_{\rm acc}$ in the ranges$10^{-11}$-$10^{-9} m_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and $10^{-10}$-$10^{-7} m_\odot$yr$^{-1}$for $\gamma$ vel and cha i accretors, respectively. we find less scatter in the$\dot m_{\rm acc}-m_\star$ relation derived through the h$\alpha$ ews, whencompared to the h$\alpha$ $10\%w$ diagnostics, in agreement with other authors.

1501.04450	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of pre-main sequence stellar spectra	this paper describes the analysis of uves and giraffe spectra acquired by thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey in the fields of young clusters whosepopulation includes pre-main sequence (pms) stars. both methods that have beenextensively used in the past and new ones developed in the contest of thegaia-eso survey enterprise are available and used. the internal precision ofthese quantities is estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by suchdifferent methods, while the accuracy is estimated by comparison withindependent external data, like effective temperature and surface gravityderived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars.specific strategies are implemented to deal with fast rotation, accretionsignatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling. the analysis carried out onspectra acquired in young clusters' fields during the first 18 months ofobservations, up to june 2013, is presented in preparation of the first releaseof advanced data products. stellar parameters obtained with the higherresolution and larger wavelength coverage from uves are reproduced withcomparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lowerresolution of the giraffe setup adopted for young stars, which allows us toprovide with confidence stellar parameters for the much larger giraffe sample.precisions are estimated to be $\approx$ 120 k r.m.s. in teff, $\approx$0.3 dexr.m.s. in logg, and $\approx$0.15 dex r.m.s. in [fe/h], for both the uves andgiraffe setups.

1502.03223	the gaia-eso survey: tracing interstellar extinction	large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computationof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. such maps are complementaryto 3d maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of thedust properties. our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic surveygaia-eso in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellarextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and thegalactocentric position. we use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than5000 stars, obtained from the gaia-eso survey second internal data release, andcombine them with optical (sdss) and near-infrared (vista) photometry as wellas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances. the extinction coefficients are thencompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellarparameters and position in the galaxy. within the errors of our method, ourwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinctioncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. we do not find anyevidence of the variation of e(j-h)/e(j-k) with the angle from the galacticcentre nor with galactocentric distance. this suggests that we are dealing witha uniform extinction law in the sdss ugriz bands and the near-ir jhks bands.therefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constantextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

1502.03934	the gaia-eso survey: a globular cluster escapee in the galactic halo	a small fraction of the halo field is made up of stars that share the lightelement (z&lt;=13) anomalies characteristic of second generation globular cluster(gc) stars. the ejected stars shed light on the formation of the galactic haloby tracing the dynamical history of the clusters, which are believed to haveonce been more massive. some of these ejected stars are expected to show strongal enhancement at the expense of shortage of mg, but until now no such star hasbeen found. we search for outliers in the mg and al abundances of the fewhundreds of halo field stars observed in the first eighteen months of thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey. one halo star at the base of the redgiant branch, here referred to as 22593757-4648029 is found to have[mg/fe]=-0.36+-0.04 and [al/fe]=0.99+-0.08, which is compatible with the mostextreme ratios detected in gcs so far. we compare the orbit of 22593757-4648029to gcs of similar metallicity and find it unlikely that this star has beentidally stripped with low ejection velocity from any of the clusters. however,both chemical and kinematic arguments render it plausible that the star hasbeen ejected at high velocity from the anomalous gc omega centauri within thelast few billion years. we cannot rule out other progenitor gcs, because somemay have disrupted fully, and the abundance and orbital data are inadequate formany of those that are still intact.

0805.1218	the metal content of bulge field stars from flames-giraffe spectra. i.  stellar parameters and iron abundances	we determine the iron distribution function (idf) for bulge field stars, inthree different fields along the galactic minor axis and at latitudes b=-4 deg,b=-6 deg, and b=-12 deg. a fourth field including ngc6553 is also included inthe discussion. about 800 bulge field k giants were observed with the giraffespectrograph of flames@vlt at spectral resolution r~20,000. several of themwere observed again with uves at r~45,000 to insure the accuracy of themeasurements. the lte abundance analysis yielded stellar parameters and ironabundances that allowed us to construct an idf for the bulge that, for thefirst time, is based on high-resolution spectroscopy for each individual star.the idf derived here is centered on solar metallicity, and extends from [fe/h]~-1.5 to [fe/h]~ +0.5. the distribution is asymmetric, with a sharper cutoff onthe high-metallicity side, and it is narrower than previously measured. avariation in the mean metallicity along the bulge minor axis is clearly betweenb=-4 deg and b=-6 deg ([fe/h] decreasing by ~ 0.6 dex per kpc). the field atb=-12 deg is consistent with the presence of a gradient, but its quantificationis complicated by the higher disk/bulge fraction in this field. our findingssupport a scenario in which both infall and outflow were important during thebulge formation, and then suggest the presence of a radial gradient, whichposes some challenges to the scenario in which the bulge would result solelyfrom the vertical heating of the bar.

1506.01612	zinc abundances in galactic bulge field red giants: implications for dla  systems	zinc in stars is an important reference element because it is a proxy to fein studies of damped lyman-alpha systems, permitting a comparison of chemicalevolution histories of bulge stellar populations and dlas. in terms ofnucleosynthesis, it behaves as an alpha element because it is enhanced inmetal-poor stars. the aim of this work is to derive the iron-peak element znabundances in 56 bulge giants from high resolution spectra. these results arecompared with data from other bulge samples, as well as from disk and halostars, and damped lyman-alpha systems, in order to better understand thechemical evolution in these environments. high-resolution spectra were obtainedusing flames+uves on the very large telescope. we find [zn/fe]=+0.24+-0.02 inthe range -1.3 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.5 and [zn/fe]=+0.06+-0.02 in the range -0.5 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; -0.1, whereas for [fe/h] &gt; -0.1, it shows a spread of -0.60 &lt; [zn/fe]&lt; +0.15, with most of these stars having low [zn/fe]&lt;0.0. these low zincabundances at the high metallicity end of the bulge define a decreasing trendin [zn/fe] with increasing metallicities. a comparison with zn abundances indla systems is presented, where a dust-depletion correction was applied forboth zn and fe. finally, we present a chemical evolution model of zn enrichmentin massive spheroids, representing a typical classical bulge.

1507.00425	the calcium triplet metallicity calibration for galactic bulge stars	we present a new calibration of the calcium ii triplet equivalent widthsversus [fe/h], constructed upon k giant stars in the galactic bulge. thiscalibration will be used to derive iron abundances for the targets of the gibssurvey, and in general it is especially suited for solar and supersolarmetallicity giants, typical of external massive galaxies. about 150 bulge kgiants were observed with the giraffe spectrograph at vlt, both at resolutionr~20,000 and at r~6,000. in the first case, the spectra allowed us to performdirect determination of fe abundances from several unblended fe lines, derivingwhat we call here high resolution [fe/h] measurements. the low resolutionspectra allowed us to measure equivalent widths of the two strongest lines ofthe near infrared calcium ii triplet at 8542 and 8662 a. by comparing the twomeasurements we derived a relation between calcium equivalent widths and [fe/h]that is linear over the metallicity range probed here, -1&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.7. byadding a small second order correction, based on literature globular clusterdata, we derived the unique calibration equation [fe/h]$_{cat} = -3.150 +0.432w' + 0.006w'^2$, with a rms dispersion of 0.197 dex, valid across thewhole metallicity range -2.3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.7.

1507.08066	the gaia-eso survey: characterisation of the [alpha/fe] sequences in the  milky way discs	we investigate, using the gaia-eso survey internal data-release 2, theproperties of the double sequence of the milky way discs (defined chemically asthe high-alpha and low-alpha populations), and discuss their compatibility withdiscs defined by other means such as metallicity, kinematics or positions.  this investigation uses two different approaches: in velocity space for starslocated in the extended solar neighbourhood, and in chemical space for stars atdifferent ranges of galactocentric radii and heights from the plane. theseparation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novelmanner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifyingthem with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of theirmetallicity distribution functions. then, using the separation in chemicalspace, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/fe] -[fe/h] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relativeproportions of the two discs change across the galaxy.  we find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [fe/h]~ +0.2and the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [fe/h]~ -0.8. radialand vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, withmild spatial variations in its [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths, whereas for the thickdisc we do not detect any such spatial variations.  the small variations in the spatial [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths of the thindisc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.on the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/fe] - [fe/h]variations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for themixing of the metals in the young galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration orturbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin discstarted forming.

[ca/fe] abundances follow a similar trend,but with a considerably larger scatter than [mg/fe]. a decrease in [mg/fe] isobserved at $\rm [fe/h]=-0.44$ dex. this \textit{knee} is in agreement with ourprevious bulge study of k-giants along the minor axis, but is 0.1 dex lower inmetallicity than the one reported for the bulge micro lensed dwarf andsub-giant stars. we found no variation in $\alpha$-element abundancedistributions between different fields.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

1512.03835	the gaia-eso survey: separating disk chemical substructures with cluster  models	(abridged) recent spectroscopic surveys have begun to explore the galacticdisk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.in this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporalvariations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. we used agaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, toseparate in the [mg/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane a clean disk star subsample from thegaia-eso survey internal data release 2. we find that the sample is separatedinto five groups associated with major galactic components; the metal-rich endof the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.this is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) survey. the twometal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition([fe/h]&gt;-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. thisholds true at different radial regions. the distribution of galactocentricradial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([fe/h]&lt;-0.25 dex) isshifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. moreover,the metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale heightintermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and itdisplays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. these stars might haveformed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formationtaking place in the internal thin disk. their enhancement levels might be dueto their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or theinner halo. the smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distributionwith respect to the plane, in particular) with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] suggested bythe data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.

astro-ph;0104357	measurement of stellar age from uranium decay	the ages of the oldest stars in the galaxy indicate when star formationbegan, and provide a minimum age for the universe. radioactive dating ofmeteoritic material and stars relies on comparing the present abundance ratiosof radioactive and stable nuclear species to the theoretically predicted ratiosof their production. the radioisotope $^{232}$th (half-life 14 gyr) has beenused to date galactic stars, but it decays by only a factor of two over thelifetime of the universe. $^{238}$u (half-life 4.5 gyr) is in principle a moreprecise age indicator, but even its strongest spectral line, from singlyionized uranium at a wavelength of 385.957 nm, has previously not been detectedin stars. here we report a measurement of this line in the very metal-poor starcs31082-001, a star which is strongly overabundant in its heavy elements. thederived uranium abundance, log(u/h) = -13.7+/-0.14+/-0.12 yields an age of12.5+/-3 gyr, though this is still model dependent. the observation of thiscosmochronometer gives the most direct age determination of the galaxy. also,with improved theoretical and laboratory data, it will provide a highly preciselower limit to the age of the universe.

astro-ph;0211168	vlt/uves abundances in four nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies: ii.  implications for understanding galaxy evolution	we have used uves on vlt-ut2 to take spectra of 15 individual red giant starsin the centers of four nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies: sculptor, fornax,carina and leo i. we measure the abundance variations of numerous elements inthese low mass stars with a range of ages (1-15gyr old). this means that we caneffectively measure the chemical evolution of these galaxies with time. ourresults show a significant spread in metallicity with age, but an overall trendconsistent with what might be expected from a closed (or perhaps leaky) boxchemical evolution scenario over the last 10-15gyr. we notice that each ofthese galaxies show broadly similar abundance patterns for all elementsmeasured. this suggests a fairly uniform progression of chemical evolution withtime, despite quite a large range of star formation histories. it seems likelythat these galaxies had similar initial conditions, and evolve in a similarmanner with star formation occurring at a uniformly low rate, even if atdifferent times. with our accurate measurements we find evidence for smallvariations in abundances which are correlated to variations in star formationhistories. the alpha-elements suggest that dsph chemical evolution has not beenaffected by very high mass stars (&gt;15-20 msun). the abundance patterns wemeasure for stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are significantly different fromthose typically observed in the disk, bulge and inner-halo of our galaxy. thissuggests that it is not possible to construct a significant fraction of ourgalaxy from stars formed in these dwarf spheroidal galaxies which subsequentlymerged into our own. any merger scenario involving dsph has to occur in thevery early universe whilst they are still gas rich, so the majority of masstransfer is gas, and few stars.

astro-ph;0406120	stellar chemical signatures and hierarchical galaxy formation	abridged: to compare the chemistries of stars in the milky way dsph galaxieswith stars in the galaxy, we have compiled a large sample of galactic stellarabundances from the literature. as found in previous studies, the [alpha/fe]ratios of most stars in the dsph galaxies are generally lower than similarmetallicity galactic stars in this extended sample. our kinematically selectedstars confirm that this is true for all major stellar components of the galaxy,including the halo, thin disk, and thick disk. there is marginal overlap in thelow [alpha/fe] ratios between dsph stars and galactic halo stars on extremeretrograde orbits, but this is not supported by other element ratios, like[ba/y]. thus, the full chemical signature of most of the dsph stars aredistinct from the main components of the galaxy. this result rules outcontinuous merging of low mass galaxies similar to these dsph satellites duringthe formation of the galaxy, which is discuss further. the new environmentsoffered by the dsph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptionsrelated to nucleosynthesis. the metal-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt; -1.8) in the dsphgalaxies have [alpha/fe] ratio that are consistent with predictions from thealpha-process (alpha-rich freeze out). this may also explain the very low yabundances, and could suggest a separate r-process site for this light (firstpeak r-process) element. in stars with higher metallicities ([fe/h] &gt; -1.8),contributions from the s-process are expected; [ba/y] is still much higher inthe dsph stars than similar metallicity galactic stars though, consistent withs-process contributions from only the low metallicity agb stars in dsphgalaxies. finally, the na-ni trend in galactic halo stars is confirmed, butdiscuss this in terms of nucleosynthesis, and not the accretion of dsphs.

astro-ph;0605056	first stars ix -mixing in extremely metal-poor giants. variation of the  12c/13c, [na/mg] and [al/mg] ratios	extremely metal-poor (emp) stars preserve a fossil record of the compositionof the ism when the galaxy formed. it is crucial, however, to verify whetherinternal mixing has modified their surface. we aim to understand the cnoabundance variations found in some, but not all emp field giants analysedearlier. mixing beyond the first dredge-up of standard models is required, andits origin needs clarification.the 12c/13c ratio is the most robust diagnosticof deep mixing, because it is insensitive to the adopted stellar parameters andshould be uniformly high in near-primordial gas. we have measured 12c and 13cabundances in 35 emp giants from high-quality vlt/uves spectra. correlationswith other abundance data are used to study the depth of mixing.the 12c/13cratio is found to correlate with [c/fe] (and li/h), and clearly anti-correlatewith [n/fe]. evidence for such deep mixing is observed in giants above logl/lsolar = 2.6, brighter than in less metal-poor stars, but matching the bumpin the luminosity function in both cases. three of the mixed stars are alsona-and al-rich, another signature of deep mixing, but signatures of the oncycle are not clearly seen in these stars. extra mixing processes clearly occurin luminous rgb stars. the na-and al-rich giants could be agb stars themselves,but an inhomogeneous early ism or pollution from a binary companion remainpossible alternatives (abridged).

astro-ph;0608112	first stars x. the nature of three unevolved carbon-enhanced metal-poor  stars	from high-resolution vlt/uves spectra (r~43,000), we determine abundances orupper limits for li, c, n, o, and other important elements, as well as 12c/13cisotopic ratio for three carbon enhanced metal poor stars. all three stars have-3.30 &lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= -2.85 and moderate to high cno abundances. cs 22958-042 isone of the most carbon-rich cemp stars known ([c/fe] = +3.2), while cs29528-041 (one of the few n-enhanced metal-poor stars known) is one of the mostnitrogen rich ([n/fe] = +3.0). oxygen is very high in cs 31080-095 ([o/fe] =+2.35) and in cs 22958-042 ([o/fe] = +1.35). all three stars exhibit [sr/fe] &lt;0; ba is not detected in cs 22958-042 ([ba/fe] &lt; -0.53), but it is moderatelyenhanced ([ba/fe] ~ 1) in the other two stars. cs 22958-042 displays one of thelargest sodium overabundances yet found in cemp stars ([na/fe] = +2.8). cs22958-042 has 12c/13c = 9, similar to most other cemp stars without enhancedneutron-capture elements, while 12c/13c &lt;= 40 in cs 31080-095. cs 31080-095 andcs 29528-041 have a(li) ~ 1.7, below the spite plateau, while li is notdetected in cs 22958-042. cs 22958-042 is a cemp-no star, but the other twostars are in no known class of cemp star and thus either constitute a new classor are a link between the cemp-no and cemp-s classes, adding complexity to theabundance patterns for cemp stars. we interpret the abundance patterns in ourstars to imply that current models for the presumed agb binary progenitors lackan extra-mixing process, similar to those apparently operating in rgb stars.

astro-ph;0608370	the dart imaging and cat survey of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy	as part of the dart project we have used the eso/2.2m wide field imager inconjunction with the vlt/flames giraffe spectrograph to study the detailedproperties of the resolved stellar population of the fornax dwarf spheroidalgalaxy out to and beyond its tidal radius. we re-derived the structuralparameters of the fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field imaging coveringthe galaxy out to its tidal radius, and analysed the spatial distribution ofthe fornax stars of different ages as selected from colour-magnitude diagramanalysis. we have obtained accurate velocities and metallicities from spectrain the caii triplet wavelength region for 562 red giant branch stars which havevelocities consistent with membership in fornax dwarf spheroidal. we have foundevidence for the presence of at least three distinct stellar components: ayoung population (few 100 myr old) concentrated in the centre of the galaxy,visible as a main sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram; an intermediate agepopulation (2-8 gyr old); and an ancient population (&gt; 10gyr),which aredistinguishable from each other kinematically, from the metallicitydistribution and in the spatial distribution of stars found in thecolour-magnitude diagram. from our spectroscopic analysis we find that the``metal rich'' stars ([fe/h]&gt; -1.3) show a less extended and more concentratedspatial distribution, and display a colder kinematics than the ``metal poor''stars ([fe/h&lt;-1.3). there is tentative evidence that the ancient stellarpopulation in the centre of fornax does not exhibit equilibrium kinematics.this could be a sign of a relatively recent accretion of external material.

astro-ph;0610245	first stars vii. lithium in extremely metal poor dwarfs	aims. this study aims to determine the level and constancy of the spiteplateau as definitively as possible from homogeneous high-quality vlt-uvesspectra of 19 of the most metal-poor dwarf stars known. methods. ourhigh-resolution (r ~ 43000), high s/n spectra are analysed with osmarcs 1d ltemodel atmospheres and turbospectrum synthetic spectra to determine effectivetemperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities, as well as li abundancesfor our stars. results. eliminating a cool subgiant and a spectroscopic binary,we find 8 stars to have -3.5 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -3.0 and 9 stars with -3.0 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-2.5. our best value for the mean level of the plateau is a(li) =2.10 +- 0.09.the scatter around the mean is entirely explained by our estimate of theobservational error and does not allow for any intrinsic scatter in the liabundances. in addition, we conclude that a systematic error of the order of200 k in any of the current temperature scales remains possible. the ironexcitation equilibria in our stars support our adopted temperature scale, whichis based on a fit to wings of the halpha line, and disfavour hotter scales,which would lead to a higher li abundance, but fail to achieve excitationequilibrium for iron. conclusions. we confirm the previously noted discrepancybetween the li abundance measured in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars and theprimordial li abundance predicted by standard big-bang nucleosynthesis modelsadopting the baryonic density inferred from wmap. we discuss recent workexplaining the discrepancy in terms of diffusion and find that uncertaintemperature scales remain a major question.

astro-ph;0610346	oxygen, sodium, magnesium and aluminium as tracers of the galactic bulge  formation	this paper investigates the peculiar behaviour of the light even(alpha-elements) and odd atomic number elements in red giants in the galacticbulge, both in terms of the chemical evolution of the bulge, and in terms ofpossible deep-mixing mechanisms in these evolved stars. using uves on vlt, wemeasure the abundances of the four light elements o, na, mg and al in 13 redclump and 40 red giant branch stars in four fields spanning the bulge from b=-3to -12\deg. we show that the resulting abundance patterns point towards achemical enrichment dominated by massive stars at all metallicities. o, mg andal ratios with respect to iron are overabundant with respect to both galacticdisks (thin and thick) for [fe/h]$&gt;-0.5$. a formation timescale for thegalactic bulge shorter than for both the thin and thick disks is thereforeinferred. using mg as a proxy for metallicity (instead of fe) we further showthat: (i) the bulge stars [o/mg] ratio follows and extend to highermetallicities the decreasing trend of [o/mg] found in the galactic disks. (ii)the [na/mg] ratio trend with increasing [mg/h] is found to increase in threedistinct sequences in the thin disk, the thick disk and the bulge. the bulgetrend is well represented by the predicted metallicity-dependent yields ofmassive stars, whereas the galactic disks have too high na/mg ratios at lowmetallicities, pointing to an additional source of na from agb stars. (iii)contrary to na, there appears to be no systematic difference in the [al/mg]ratio between bulge and disk stars, and the theoretical yields by massive starsagree with the observed ratios, leaving no space for agb contribution to al.

astro-ph;0611420	a new view of the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way from  vlt/flames: where are the very metal poor stars?	as part of the dwarf galaxies abundances and radial-velocities team (dart)program, we have measured the metallicities of a large sample of stars in fournearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsph's): sculptor, sextans, fornax, andcarina. the low mean metal abundances and the presence of very old stellarpopulations in these galaxies have supported the view that they are fossilsfrom the early universe. however, contrary to naive expectations, we find asignificant lack of stars with metallicities below [fe/h] ~ -3 dex in all foursystems. this suggests that the gas that made up the stars in these systems hadbeen uniformly enriched prior to their formation. furthermore, the metal-poortail of the dsph metallicity distribution is significantly different from thatof the galactic halo. these findings show that the progenitors of nearby dsph'sappear to have been fundamentally different from the building blocks of themilky way, even at the earliest epochs.

astro-ph;0701199	nlte determination of the sodium abundance in a homogeneous sample of  extremely metal-poor stars	abundance ratios in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars are a good indication ofthe chemical composition of the gas in the earliest phases of the galaxyevolution. it had been found from an lte analysis that at low metallicity, andin contrast with most of the other elements, the scatter of [na/fe] versus[fe/h] was surprisingly large and that, in giants, [na/fe] decreased withmetallicity.  since it is well known that the formation of sodium lines is very sensitiveto non-lte effects, to firmly establish the behaviour of the sodium abundancein the early galaxy, we have used high quality observations of a sample of empstars obtained with uves at the vlt, and we have taken into account the non-lteline formation of sodium.  the profiles of the two resonant sodium d lines (only these sodium lines aredetectable in the spectra of emp stars) have been computed in a sample of 54emp giants and turn-off stars (33 of them with [fe/h]&lt; -3.0) with a modifiedversion of the code multi, and compared to the observed spectra.  with these new determinations in the range -4 &lt;[fe/h]&lt; -2.5, both [na/fe] and[na/mg] are almost constant with a low scatter. in the turn-off stars and"unmixed" giants (located in the low rgb): [na/fe] = -0.21 +/- 0.13 or [na/mg]= -0.45 +/- 0.16. these values are in good agreement with the recentdeterminations of [na/fe] and [na/mg] in nearby metal-poor stars. moreover weconfirm that all the sodium-rich stars are "mixed" stars (i.e., giants locatedafter the bump, which have undergone an extra mixing). none of the turn-offstars is sodium-rich. as a consequence it is probable that the sodiumenhancement observed in some mixed giants is the result of a deep mixing.
