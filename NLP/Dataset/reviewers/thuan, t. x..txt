0908.2535	near-infrared spectroscopy of the blue compact dwarf galaxy markarian 59	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations of the blue compactdwarf (bcd) galaxy mrk 59, obtained with the triplespec spectrograph mounted onthe 3.5m apo telescope. the nir spectrum of mrk 59, which covers the 0.90 -2.40 micron wavelength range, shows atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen,helium, sulfur and iron emission lines. the nir data have been supplemented bya sdss optical spectrum. we found extinction in the bcd to be low [a(v)=0.24mag] and to be the same in both the optical and nir ranges. the nir light doesnot reveal hidden star formation. the h2 emission comes from dense clumps andthe h2 vibrational emission line intensities can be accounted for by photonexcitation. no shock excitation is needed. a cloudy photoinization model of mrk59 reproduces well the observed optical and nir emission line fluxes. there isno need to invoke sources of ionization other than stellar radiation.the [feii]1.257 and 1.643 micron emission lines, often used as supernova shock indicatorsin low-excitation high-metallicity starburst galaxies, cannot play such a rolein high-excitation low-metallicity hii regions such as mrk 59.

0707.2856	the oxygen abundance of nearby galaxies from sloan digital sky survey  spectra	we have derived the oxygen abundance for a sample of nearby galaxies in thedata release 5 of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) which possess at leasttwo independent spectra of one or several hii regions with a detected[oiii]4363 auroral line. since, for nearby galaxies, the [oii]3727 nebular lineis out of the observed wavelength range, we propose a method to derive (o/h)_ffabundances using the classic te method coupled with the ff relation. (o/h)_7325abundances have also been determined, based on the [oii]7320,7330 lineintensities, and using a small modification of the standard te method. the(o/h)_ff and (o/h)_7325 abundances have been derived with both the one- andtwo-dimensional t_2 - t_3 relations. it was found that the (o/h)_ff abundancesderived with the parametric two-dimensional t_2 - t_3 relation are mostreliable. oxygen abundances have been determined in 29 nearby galaxies, basedon 84 individual abundance determinations in hii regions. because of ourselection methods, the metallicity of our galaxies lies in the narrow range 8.2&lt; 12 + log (o/h) &lt; 8.4. the radial distribution of oxygen abundances in thedisk of the spiral galaxy ngc 4490 is determined for the first time.

1002.3486	the redshift evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances in  emission-line sdss galaxies	the oxygen and nitrogen abundance evolutions with redshift and galaxy stellarmass in emission-line sdss galaxies are investigated. this is the first suchstudy for nitrogen abundances, and it provides an additional constraint for thestudy of the chemical evolution of galaxies. we have devised a criterion torecognize and exclude from consideration agns and star-forming galaxies withlarge errors in the line flux measurements. to select star-forming galaxieswith accurate line fluxes measurements, we require that, for each galaxy, thenitrogen abundances derived with various calibrations based on differentemission lines agree. using this selection criterion, subsamples ofstar-forming galaxies have been extracted from catalogs of the mpa/jhu group.we found that the galaxies of highest masses, those with masses &gt; 10^11.2m_sun, have not been enriched in both oxygen and nitrogen over the last 3 gyr:they have formed their stars in the so distant past that these have returnedtheir nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium before z=0.25. thegalaxies in the mass range from 10^11.0 m_sun to 10^11.2 m_sun do not show anappreciable enrichment in oxygen, but do show some enrichment in nitrogen: theyalso formed their stars before z=0.25 but later in comparison to the galaxiesof highest masses; these stars have not returned nitrogen to the interstellarmedium before z=0.25 because they have not had enough time to evolve. thissuggests that stars with lifetimes of 2-3 gyr contribute to the nitrogenproduction. finally, galaxies with masses &lt; 10^11 m_sun show enrichment in bothoxygen and nitrogen during the last 3 gyr: they have undergone appreciable starformation and have converted up to 20% of their mass into stars over thisperiod.

0709.3643	broad line emission in low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies:  evidence for stellar wind, supernova and possible agn activity	we present spectra of a large sample of low-metallicity blue compact dwarfgalaxies which exhibit broad components in their strong emission lines, mainlyin hbeta, [o iii]4959, 5007 and halpha. twenty-three spectra have been obtainedwith the mmt, 14 of which show broad emission. the remaining 21 spectra withbroad emission have been selected from the data release 5 of the sloan digitalsky survey. the most plausible origin of broad line emission is the evolutionof massive stars and their interaction with the circumstellar and interstellarmedium. the broad emission with the lowest h$\alpha$ luminosities (10^36 -10^39 erg/s) is likely produced in circumstellar envelopes around hot ofp/wn9and/or lbv stars. the broad emission with the highest halpha luminosities(10^40 - 10^42 erg/s) probably arises from type iip or type iin supernovae(sne). it can also come from active galactic nuclei (agn) containingintermediate-mass black holes, although we find no strong evidence for hardnon-thermal radiation in our sample galaxies. the oxygen abundance in the hostgalaxies with sn candidates is low and varies in the range 12 + log o/h = 7.36- 8.31. however, type iin sn / agn candidates are found only in galaxies with12 + log o/h &lt; 7.99. spectroscopic monitoring of these type iin sn / agncandidates over a time scale of several years is necessary to distinguishbetween the two possibilities.

1201.1554	abundance determination from global emission-line sdss spectra:  exploring objects with high n/o ratios	we have compared the oxygen and nitrogen abundances derived from globalemission-line sdss spectra of galaxies using (1) the te method and (2) tworecent strong line calibrations: the on and ns calibrations. using the temethod, anomously high n/o abundances ratios have been found in some sdssgalaxies. to investigate this, we have monte carlo simulated the global spectraof composite nebulae by a mix of spectra of individual components, based onspectra of well-studied hii regions in nearby galaxies. we found that the temethod results in an underestimated oxygen abundance (and hence in anoverestimated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio) if hii regions with different physicalproperties contribute to the global spectrum of composite nebulae. this effectis somewhat similar to the small-scale temperature fluctuations in hii regionsdiscussed by peimbert. our work thus suggests that the high te-based n/oabundances ratios found in sdss galaxies may not be real. however, such aneffect is not expected to be present in dwarf galaxies since they havegenerally an uniform chemical composition. the on and ns calibrations give oand n abundances in composite nebulae which agree with the meanluminosity-weighted abundances of their components to within 0.2 dex.

1408.6953	a new determination of the primordial he abundance using the hei 10830a  emission line: cosmological implications	we present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the high-intensity hei10830 emission line in 45 low-metallicity hii regions. we combined these nirdata with spectroscopic data in the optical range to derive the primordial heabundance. the use of the hei 10830a line, the intensity of which is verysensitive to the density of the hii region, greatly improves the determinationof the physical conditions in the he^+ zone. this results in a considerablytighter y - o/h linear regression compared to all previous studies. weextracted a final sample of 28 hii regions with hbeta equivalent widthew(hbeta)&gt;150a, excitation parameter o^2+/o&gt;0.8, and with helium mass fractiony derived with an accuracy better than 3%. with this final sample we derived aprimordial he mass fraction yp = 0.2551+/-0.0022. the derived value of yp ishigher than the one predicted by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis (sbbn)model. using our derived yp together with d/h = (2.53+/-0.04)x10^-5, and thechi^2 technique, we found that the best agreement between these light elementabundances is achieved in a cosmological model with a baryon mass densityomega_b h^2 = 0.0240+/-0.0017 (68% cl), +/-0.0028 (95.4% cl), +/-0.0034 (99%cl) and an effective number of neutrino species neff = 3.58+/-0.25 (68% cl),+/-0.40 (95.4% cl), +/-0.50 (99% cl). a non-standard value of neff is preferredat the 99% cl, implying the possible existence of additional types of neutrinospecies.

1512.06191	near-infrared spectroscopy of a large sample of low-metallicity blue  compact dwarf galaxies	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations in the wavelengthrange 0.90-2.40mum of eighteen low-metallicity blue compact dwarf (bcd)galaxies and six hii regions in spiral and interacting galaxies. hydrogen andhelium emission lines are detected in all spectra, while h2 and iron emissionlines are detected in most spectra. the nir data for all objects have beensupplemented by optical spectra. in all objects, except perhaps for the highestmetallicity ones, we find that the extinctions a(v) in the optical and nirranges are similar, implying that the nir hydrogen emission lines inlow-metallicity bcds do not reveal more star formation than seen in theoptical. we conclude that emission-line spectra of low-metallicity bcds in the0.36-2.40mum wavelength range are emitted by a relatively transparent ionizedgas. the h2 emission line fluxes can be accounted for by fluorescence in mostof the observed galaxies. we find a decrease of the h2 2.122mum emission linerelative to the brgamma line with increasing ionization parameter. thisindicates an efficient destruction of h2 by the stellar uv radiation. theintensities of the [feii] 1.257mum and 1.644mum emission lines in the spectraof all galaxies, but one, are consistent with the predictions of cloudy stellarphotoinization models. there is thus no need to invoke shock excitation forthese lines, and they are not necessarily shock indicators in low-metallicityhigh-excitation bcds. the intensity of the hei 2.058mum emission line is lowerin high-excitation bcds with lower neutral gas column densities and higherturbulent motions.

astro-ph;0007130	the cometary blue compact dwarf galaxies mkn 59 and mkn 71: clues to  dwarf galaxy evolution?	"cometary" blue compact dwarf galaxies (ii,c bcds) are characterized byoff-center starbursts close to the end of an elongated dwarf irregular(di)-like host galaxy. this may either represent randomly enhanced star-formingactivity of a di, or may be caused by a set of special properties of suchsystems or their environment. for a first investigation of this issue, weanalyse the nearby ii,c bcds markarian 59 and markarian 71. using deepground-based spectrophotometric data and hst images, we derive physicalproperties, structure and ages of the starburst regions and the underlyingstellar host galaxies. the metallicities show small scatter in the vicinity ofthe star-forming regions and along the major axis of mrk 59 which suggestseffective mixing of heavy elements on kpc scales. the surface brightnessprofiles of the underlying host galaxies in either ii,c bcd show an exponentialdecay with a central surface brightness and scale length that are intermediatebetween typical ie/ne bcds and dis. spectral population synthesis models incombination with colour magnitude diagrams and colour profiles yield mostlikely formation ages of ~2 gyr for the host galaxies in both ii,c bcds, withupper limits of ~4 gyr for mrk 59 and ~3 gyr for mrk 71, i.e. significantlylower than the typical age of several gyr derived for the host galaxies ofie/ne bcds. these findings raise the question whether ii,c systems form adistinct class within bcds with respect to the age and structure of theirhosts, or whether they represent an evolutionary stage connecting young i0 bcdsand "classical" ie/ne bcds. properties of analogous objects studied in thelocal universe and at medium redshifts provide some support for thisevolutionary hypothesis.

astro-ph;0109518	fuse observations of the blue compact dwarf galaxy mrk 59	new fuse far-uv spectroscopy of the nearby metal-deficient (zsun/8) cometaryblue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy markarian (mrk) 59 is discussed. the data areused to investigate element abundances in its interstellar medium. the h iabsorption lines are characterized by narrow cores which are interstellar inorigin and by broad wings which are stellar in origin. the mean interstellar hi column density is ~ 7x10e20 cm-2 in mrk 59. no h2 lines are seen and n(h2) is&lt; 10e15 cm-2 at the 10 sigma level. the lack of diffuse h2 is due to thecombined effect of a strong uv radiation field which destroys the h2 moleculesand a low metallicity which leads to a scarcity of dust grains necessary for h2formation. p-cygni profiles of the s vi 933.4, 944.5 a and o vi 1031.9, 1037.6a lines are seen, indicating the presence of very hot o stars and a stellarwind terminal velocity of ~ 1000 km/s. by fitting the line profiles withmultiple components having each a velocity dispersion b = 7 km/s and spanning aradial velocity range of 100 km/s, some of which can be saturated, we deriveheavy element abundances in the neutral gas. we find log n(o i)/n(h i) =-5.0+/-0.3 or [o i/h i] = -1.5 for the neutral gas, about a factor of 10 belowthe oxygen abundance of the supergiant h ii region, implying self-enrichment ofthe latter.

astro-ph;0210225	on the origin of nitrogen	the problem of the origin of nitrogen is considered within the framework ofan empirical approach. the oxygen abundances and nitrogen to oxygen abundancesratios are derived in hii regions of a number of spiral galaxies through therecently suggested p-method using more than six hundred published spectra. then/o - o/h diagram for hii regions in irregular and spiral galaxies isconstructed. it is found that the n/o values in hii regions of spiral galaxiesof early morphological types are higher than those in hii regions with the samemetallicity in spiral galaxies of late morphological types. this suggests along-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production. the n/o ratio of agalaxy can then be used as an indicator of the time that has elapsed since thebulk of star formation occurred, or in other words of the nominal "age" of thegalaxy as suggested by edmunds and pagel more than twenty years ago. thescatter in n/o values at a given o/h can be naturally explained by differencesin star formation histories in galaxies. while low-metallicity dwarf galaxieswith low n/o do not contain an appreciable amount of old stars, low-metallicitydwarf galaxies with an appreciable fraction of old stars have high n/o.consideration of planetary nebulae in the small magellanic cloud and in themilky way galaxy suggests that the contribution of low-mass stars to thenitrogen production is significant, confirming the conclusion that there is along-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production.

astro-ph;0507209	high-ionization emission in metal-deficient blue compact dwarf galaxies	primordial stars are expected to be very massive and hot, producing copiousamounts of hard ionizing radiation. the best place to study hard ionizingradiation in the local universe is in very metal-deficient blue compact dwarf(bcd) galaxies. we have carried out a mmt spectroscopic search for [ne v] 3426(ionization potential of 7.1 ryd), [fe v] 4227 (ionization potential of 4 ryd)and he ii 4686 (ionization potential of 4 ryd) emission in a sample of 18 bcds.we have added data from previous work and from the data release 3 of the sloandigital sky survey. in total, we have assembled a bcd high-ionization samplewith [ne v] emission in 4 galaxies, [fe v] emission in 15 galaxies and he iiemission in 465 galaxies. with this large sample, we have reached the followingconclusions. there is a general trend of higher [ne v], [fe v] and he iiemission at lower metallicities. however metallicity is not the only factorwhich controls the hardness of the radiation. high-mass x-ray binaries andmain-sequence stars are probably excluded as the main sources of the very hardionizing radiation responsible for [ne v] emission. the most likely source of[ne v] emission is probably fast radiative shocks moving with velocities &gt; 450km/s through a dense interstellar medium with an electron number density ofseveral hundreds per cm^-3 and associated with supernova explosions of the mostmassive stars. these have masses of ~ 50 - 100 msun and are formed in verycompact super-star clusters. the softer ionizing radiation required for he iiemission is likely associated with less massive evolved stars and/or radiativeshocks moving through a less dense interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0701332	on the maximum value of the cosmic abundance of oxygen and the oxygen  yield	we search for the maximum oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies. because thismaximum value is expected to occur in the centers of the most luminousgalaxies, we have constructed the luminosity - central metallicity diagram forspiral galaxies, based on a large compilation of existing data on oxygenabundances of hii regions in spiral galaxies. we found that this diagram showsa plateau at high luminosities (-22.3 &lt; m_b &lt; -20.3), with a constant maximumvalue of the gas-phase oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h) ~ 8.87. this providesstrong evidence that the oxygen abundance in the centers of the most luminousmetal-rich galaxies reaches the maximum attainable value of oxygen abundance.since some fraction of the oxygen (about 0.08 dex) is expected to be lockedinto dust grains, the maximum value of the true gas+dust oxygen abundance inspiral galaxies is 12+log(o/h) ~ 8.95. this value is a factor of ~ 2 higherthan the recently estimated solar value. based on the derived maximum oxygenabundance in galaxies, we found the oxygen yield to be about 0.0035, dependingon the fraction of oxygen incorporated into dust grains.

astro-ph;0702072	the primordial abundance of 4he: a self-consistent empirical analysis of  systematic effects in a large sample of low-metallicity hii regions	we determine the primordial helium mass fraction yp using 93 spectra of 86low-metallicity extragalactic hii regions. this sample constitutes the largestand most homogeneous high-quality data sets in existence for the determinationof yp. for comparison and to improve the statistics in our investigation ofsystematic effects affecting the yp determination, we have also considered asample of 271 low-metallicity hii regions selected from the dr5 of the sdss.although this larger sample shows more scatter, it gives results that areconsistent at the 2sigma level with our original sample. we have consideredknown systematic effects which may affect the 4he abundance determination. theyinclude different sets of hei line emissivities and reddening laws, collisionaland fluorescent enhancements of hei recombination lines, underlying hei stellarabsorption lines, collisional excitation of hydrogen lines, temperature andionization structure of the hii region, and deviation of hei and h emissionline intensities from case b. however, the most likely value of yp depends onthe adopted set of hei line emissivities. using monte carlo methods to solvesimultaneously the above systematic effects we find a primordial helium massfraction yp = 0.2472+/-0.0012 when using the hei emissivities from benjamin etal. (1999, 2002) and 0.2516+/-0.0011 when using those from porter et al.(2005). the first value agrees well with the value given by sbbn theory, whilethe value obtained with likely more accurate emissivities of porter et al.(2005) is higher at the 2sigma level. this latter value, if confirmed, wouldimply slight deviations from sbbn.

0809.3077	luminous blue variable stars in the two extremely metal-deficient blue  compact dwarf galaxies ddo 68 and phl 293b	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two luminous bluevariable (lbv) stars in two extremely metal-deficient blue compact dwarf (bcd)galaxies, ddo 68 with 12+logo/h = 7.15 and phl 293b with 12+logo/h = 7.72.these two bcds are the lowest-metallicity galaxies where lbv stars have beendetected, allowing to study the lbv phenomenon in the extremely low metallicityregime, and shedding light of the evolution of the first generation of massivestars born from primordial gas. we find that the strong outburst of the lbvstar in ddo 68 occurred sometime between february 2007 and january 2008. wehave compared the properties of the broad line emission in low-metallicity lbvswith those in higher metallicity lbvs. we find that, for the lbv star in ddo68, broad emission with a p cygni profile is seen in both h and he i emissionlines. on the other hand, for the lbv star in phl 293b, p cygni profiles aredetected only in h lines. for both lbvs, no heavy element emission line such asfe ii was detected. the halpha luminosities of lbv stars in both galaxies arecomparable to the one obtained for the lbv star in ngc 2363 (mrk 71) which hasa higher metallicity 12+logo/h = 7.89. on the other hand, the terminalvelocities of the stellar winds in both low-metallicity lbvs are high, ~800km/s, a factor of ~4 higher than the terminal velocities of the winds inhigh-metallicity lbvs. this suggests that stellar winds at low metallicity aredriven by a different mechanism than the one operating in high-metallicitywinds.
