0903.0094	dynamic conjectures in random access networks using bio-inspired  learning	this paper considers a conjecture-based distributed learning approach thatenables autonomous nodes to independently optimize their transmissionprobabilities in random access networks. we model the interaction amongmultiple self-interested nodes as a game. it is well-known that the nashequilibria in this game result in zero throughput for all the nodes if theytake myopic best-response, thereby leading to a network collapse. this paperenables nodes to behave as intelligent entities which can proactively gatherinformation, form internal conjectures on how their competitors would react totheir actions, and update their beliefs according to their local observations.in this way, nodes are capable to autonomously "learn" the behavior of theircompetitors, optimize their own actions, and eventually cultivate reciprocityin the random access network. to characterize the steady-state outcome, theconjectural equilibrium is introduced. inspired by the biological phenomena of"derivative action" and "gradient dynamics", two distributed conjecture-basedaction update mechanisms are proposed to stabilize the random access network.the sufficient conditions that guarantee the proposed conjecture-based learningalgorithms to converge are derived. moreover, it is shown that all theachievable operating points in the throughput region are essentially stableconjectural equilibria corresponding to different conjectures. we investigatehow the conjectural equilibrium can be selected in heterogeneous networks andhow the proposed methods can be extended to ad-hoc networks. simulations verifythat the system performance significantly outperforms existing protocols, suchas ieee 802.11 dcf protocol and the pmac protocol, in terms of throughput,fairness, convergence, and stability.

0903.0207	a systematic framework for dynamically optimizing multi-user wireless  video transmission	in this paper, we formulate the collaborative multi-user wireless videotransmission problem as a multi-user markov decision process (mumdp) byexplicitly considering the users' heterogeneous video traffic characteristics,time-varying network conditions and the resulting dynamic coupling between thewireless users. these environment dynamics are often ignored in existingmulti-user video transmission solutions. to comply with the decentralizednature of wireless networks, we propose to decompose the mumdp into local mdpsusing lagrangian relaxation. unlike in conventional multi-user videotransmission solutions stemming from the network utility maximizationframework, the proposed decomposition enables each wireless user toindividually solve its own dynamic cross-layer optimization (i.e. the localmdp) and the network coordinator to update the lagrangian multipliers (i.e.resource prices) based on not only current, but also future resource needs ofall users, such that the long-term video quality of all users is maximized.however, solving the mumdp requires statistical knowledge of the experiencedenvironment dynamics, which is often unavailable before transmission time. toovercome this obstacle, we then propose a novel online learning algorithm,which allows the wireless users to update their policies in multiple statesduring one time slot. this is different from conventional learning solutions,which often update one state per time slot. the proposed learning algorithm cansignificantly improve the learning performance, thereby dramatically improvingthe video quality experienced by the wireless users over time. our simulationresults demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mumdp framework as comparedto conventional multi-user video transmission solutions.

0904.0544	mission-aware medium access control in random access networks	we study mission-critical networking in wireless communication networks,where network users are subject to critical events such as emergencies andcrises. if a critical event occurs to a user, the user needs to send necessaryinformation for help as early as possible. however, most existing medium accesscontrol (mac) protocols are not adequate to meet the urgent need forinformation transmission by users in a critical situation. in this paer, wepropose a novel class of mac protocols that utilize available past informationas well as current information. our proposed protocols are mission-aware sincethey prescribe different transmission decision rules to users in differentsituations. we show that the proposed protocols perform well not only when thesystem faces a critical situation but also when there is no critical situation.by utilizing past information, the proposed protocols coordinate transmissionsby users to achieve high throughput in the normal phase of operation and to leta user in a critical situation make successful transmissions while it is in thecritical situation. moreover, the proposed protocols require short memory andno message exchanges.

0905.4087	structural solutions for cross-layer optimization of wireless multimedia  transmission	in this paper, we propose a systematic solution to the problem of cross-layeroptimization for delay-sensitive media transmission over time-varying wirelesschannels as well as investigate the structures and properties of this solution,such that it can be easily implemented in various multimedia systems andapplications. specifically, we formulate this problem as a finite-horizonmarkov decision process (mdp) by explicitly considering the users'heterogeneous multimedia traffic characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines,distortion impacts and dependencies etc.), time-varying network conditions aswell as, importantly, their ability to adapt their cross-layer transmissionstrategies in response to these dynamics. based on the heterogeneouscharacteristics of the media packets, we are able to express the transmissionpriorities between packets as a new type of directed acyclic graph (dag). thisdag provides the necessary structure for determining the optimal cross-layeractions in each time slot: the root packet in the dag will always be selectedfor transmission since it has the highest positive marginal utility; and thecomplexity of the proposed cross-layer solution is demonstrated to linearlyincrease w.r.t. the number of disconnected packet pairs in the dag andexponentially increase w.r.t. the number of packets on which the currentpackets depend on. the simulation results demonstrate that the proposedsolution significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-layersolutions. moreover, we show that our solution provides the upper boundperformance for the cross-layer optimization solutions with delayed feedbacksuch as the well-known radio framework.

0906.0531	medium access control protocols with memory	many existing medium access control (mac) protocols utilize past information(e.g., the results of transmission attempts) to adjust the transmissionparameters of users. this paper provides a general framework to express andevaluate distributed mac protocols utilizing a finite length of memory for agiven form of feedback information. we define protocols with memory in thecontext of a slotted random access network with saturated arrivals. weintroduce two performance metrics, throughput and average delay, and formulatethe problem of finding an optimal protocol. we first show that a tdma outcome,which is the best outcome in the considered scenario, can be obtained after atransient period by a protocol with (n-1)-slot memory, where n is the totalnumber of users. next, we analyze the performance of protocols with 1-slotmemory using a markov chain and numerical methods. protocols with 1-slot memorycan achieve throughput arbitrarily close to 1 (i.e., 100% channel utilization)at the expense of large average delay, by correlating successful users in twoconsecutive slots. finally, we apply our framework to wireless local areanetworks.

0906.5325	online reinforcement learning for dynamic multimedia systems	in our previous work, we proposed a systematic cross-layer framework fordynamic multimedia systems, which allows each layer to make autonomous andforesighted decisions that maximize the system's long-term performance, whilemeeting the application's real-time delay constraints. the proposed solutionsolved the cross-layer optimization offline, under the assumption that themultimedia system's probabilistic dynamics were known a priori. in practice,however, these dynamics are unknown a priori and therefore must be learnedonline. in this paper, we address this problem by allowing the multimediasystem layers to learn, through repeated interactions with each other, toautonomously optimize the system's long-term performance at run-time. wepropose two reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing the system underdifferent design constraints: the first algorithm solves the cross-layeroptimization in a centralized manner, and the second solves it in adecentralized manner. we analyze both algorithms in terms of their requiredcomputation, memory, and inter-layer communication overheads. after noting thatthe proposed reinforcement learning algorithms learn too slowly, we introduce acomplementary accelerated learning algorithm that exploits partial knowledgeabout the system's dynamics in order to dramatically improve the system'sperformance. in our experiments, we demonstrate that decentralized learning canperform as well as centralized learning, while enabling the layers to actautonomously. additionally, we show that existing application-independentreinforcement learning algorithms, and existing myopic learning algorithmsdeployed in multimedia systems, perform significantly worse than our proposedapplication-aware and foresighted learning methods.

0910.4186	media-tcp: a quality-centric tcp-friendly congestion control for  multimedia transmission	in this paper, we propose a quality-centric congestion control for multimediastreaming over ip networks, which we refer to as media-tcp. unlike existingcongestion control schemes that adapt a user's sending rate merely to thenetwork condition, our solution adapts the sending rate to both the networkcondition and the application characteristics by explicitly considering thedistortion impacts, delay deadlines, and interdependencies of different videopacket classes. hence, our media-aware solution is able to provide differentialservices for transmitting various packet classes and thereby, further improvesthe multimedia streaming quality. we model this problem using a finite-horizonmarkov decision process (fhmdp) and determine the optimal congestion controlpolicy that maximizes the long-term multimedia quality, while adhering to thehorizon- tcp-friendliness constraint, which ensures long-term fairness withexisting tcp applications. we show that the fhmdp problem can be decomposedinto multiple optimal stopping problems, which admit a low-complexitythreshold-based solution. moreover, unlike existing congestion controlapproaches, which focus on maintaining throughput-based fairness among users,the proposed media-tcp aims to achieve quality-based fairness among multimediausers. we also derive sufficient conditions for multiple multimedia users toachieve quality-based fairness using media-tcp congestion control. oursimulation results show that the proposed media-tcp achieves more than 3dbimprovement in terms of psnr over the conventional tcp congestion controlapproaches, with the largest improvements observed for real-time streamingapplications requiring stringent playback delays.

1002.3449	minimizing weighted sum download time for one-to-many file transfer in  peer-to-peer networks	this paper considers the problem of transferring a file from one source nodeto multiple receivers in a peer-to-peer (p2p) network. the objective is tominimize the weighted sum download time (wsdt) for the one-to-many filetransfer. previous work has shown that, given an order at which the receiversfinish downloading, the minimum wsd can be solved in polynomial time by convexoptimization, and can be achieved by linear network coding, assuming that nodeuplinks are the only bottleneck in the network. this paper, however, considersheterogeneous peers with both uplink and downlink bandwidth constraintsspecified. the static scenario is a file-transfer scheme in which the networkresource allocation remains static until all receivers finish downloading. thispaper first shows that the static scenario may be optimized in polynomial timeby convex optimization, and the associated optimal static wsd can be achievedby linear network coding. this paper then presented a lower bound to theminimum wsdt that is easily computed and turns out to be tight across a widerange of parameterizations of the problem. this paper also proposes a staticrouting-based scheme and a static rateless-coding-based scheme which havealmost-optimal empirical performances. the dynamic scenario is a file-transferscheme which can re-allocate the network resource during the file transfer.this paper proposes a dynamic rateless-coding-based scheme, which providessignificantly smaller wsdt than the optimal static scenario does.

1006.3782	near-optimal deviation-proof medium access control designs in wireless  networks	distributed medium access control (mac) protocols are essential for theproliferation of low cost, decentralized wireless local area networks (wlans).most mac protocols are designed with the presumption that nodes comply withprescribed rules. however, selfish nodes have natural motives to manipulateprotocols in order to improve their own performance. this often degrades theperformance of other nodes as well as that of the overall system. in this work,we propose a class of protocols that limit the performance gain which nodes canobtain through selfish manipulation while incurring only a small efficiencyloss. the proposed protocols are based on the idea of a review strategy, withwhich nodes collect signals about the actions of other nodes over a period oftime, use a statistical test to infer whether or not other nodes are followingthe prescribed protocol, and trigger a punishment if a departure from theprotocol is perceived. we consider the cases of private and public signals andprovide analytical and numerical results to demonstrate the properties of theproposed protocols.

1007.4301	reinforcement learning in bittorrent systems	recent research efforts have shown that the popular bittorrent protocol doesnot provide fair resource reciprocation and may allow free-riding. in thispaper, we propose a bittorrent-like protocol that replaces the peer selectionmechanisms in the regular bittorrent protocol with a novel reinforcementlearning (rl) based mechanism. due to the inherent opration of p2p systems,which involves repeated interactions among peers over a long period of time,the peers can efficiently identify free-riders as well as desirablecollaborators by learning the behavior of their associated peers. thus, it canhelp peers improve their download rates and discourage free-riding, whileimproving fairness in the system. we model the peers' interactions in thebittorrent-like network as a repeated interaction game, where we explicitlyconsider the strategic behavior of the peers. a peer, which applies therl-based mechanism, uses a partial history of the observations on associatedpeers' statistical reciprocal behaviors to determine its best responses andestimate the corresponding impact on its expected utility. the policydetermines the peer's resource reciprocations with other peers, which wouldmaximize the peer's long-term performance, thereby making foresighteddecisions. we have implemented the proposed reinforcement-learning basedmechanism and incorporated it into an existing bittorrent client. we haveperformed extensive experiments on a controlled planetlab test bed. our resultsconfirm that our proposed protocol (1) promotes fairness in terms of incentivesto each peer's contribution e.g. high capacity peers improve their downloadcompletion time by up to 33\%, (2) improves the system stability and robustnesse.g. reducing the peer selection luctuations by 57\%, and (3) discouragesfree-riding e.g. peers reduce by 64\% their upload to \fr, in comparison to theregular \bt~protocol.

1008.4406	structural solutions to dynamic scheduling for multimedia transmission  in unknown wireless environments	in this paper, we propose a systematic solution to the problem of schedulingdelay-sensitive media data for transmission over time-varying wirelesschannels. we first formulate the dynamic scheduling problem as a markovdecision process (mdp) that explicitly considers the users' heterogeneousmultimedia data characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines, distortion impacts anddependencies etc.) and time-varying channel conditions, which are notsimultaneously considered in state-of-the-art packet scheduling algorithms.this formulation allows us to perform foresighted decisions to schedulemultiple data units for transmission at each time in order to optimize thelong-term utilities of the multimedia applications. the heterogeneity of themedia data enables us to express the transmission priorities between thedifferent data units as a priority graph, which is a directed acyclic graph(dag). this priority graph provides us with an elegant structure to decomposethe multi-data unit foresighted decision at each time into multiple single-dataunit foresighted decisions which can be performed sequentially, from the highpriority data units to the low priority data units, thereby significantlyreducing the computation complexity. when the statistical knowledge of themultimedia data characteristics and channel conditions is unknown a priori, wedevelop a low-complexity online learning algorithm to update the valuefunctions which capture the impact of the current decision on the futureutility. the simulation results show that the proposed solution significantlyoutperforms existing state-of-the-art scheduling solutions.

1009.5773	fast reinforcement learning for energy-efficient wireless communications	we consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission ofdelay-sensitive data (e.g. multimedia data) over a fading channel. existingresearch on this topic utilizes either physical-layer centric solutions, namelypower-control and adaptive modulation and coding (amc), or system-levelsolutions based on dynamic power management (dpm); however, there is currentlyno rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing bothphysical-layer centric and system-level techniques to achieve the minimumpossible energy consumption, under delay constraints, in the presence ofstochastic and a priori unknown traffic and channel conditions. in this report,we propose such a framework. we formulate the stochastic optimization problemas a markov decision process (mdp) and solve it online using reinforcementlearning. the advantages of the proposed online method are that (i) it does notrequire a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics todetermine the jointly optimal power-control, amc, and dpm policies; (ii) itexploits partial information about the system so that less information needs tobe learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and(iii) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits theadaptation speed and run-time performance of conventional reinforcementlearning algorithms. our results show that the proposed learning algorithms canconverge up to two orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art learningalgorithm for physical layer power-control and up to three orders of magnitudefaster than conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.

1101.0272	social norms for online communities	sustaining cooperation among self-interested agents is critical for theproliferation of emerging online social communities, such as online communitiesformed through social networking services. providing incentives for cooperationin social communities is particularly challenging because of their uniquefeatures: a large population of anonymous agents interacting infrequently,having asymmetric interests, and dynamically joining and leaving the community;operation errors; and low-cost reputation whitewashing. in this paper, takingthese features into consideration, we propose a framework for the design andanalysis of a class of incentive schemes based on a social norm, which consistsof a reputation scheme and a social strategy. we first define the concept of asustainable social norm under which every agent has an incentive to follow thesocial strategy given the reputation scheme. we then formulate the problem ofdesigning an optimal social norm, which selects a social norm that maximizesoverall social welfare among all sustainable social norms. using the proposedframework, we study the structure of optimal social norms and the impacts ofpunishment lengths and whitewashing on optimal social norms. our results showthat optimal social norms are capable of sustaining cooperation, with theamount of cooperation varying depending on the community characteristics.

1102.5437	transmitting important bits and sailing high radio waves: a  decentralized cross-layer approach to cooperative video transmission	we investigate the impact of cooperative relaying on uplink and downlinkmulti-user (mu) wireless video transmissions. the objective is to maximize thelong-term sum of utilities across the video terminals in a decentralizedfashion, by jointly optimizing the packet scheduling, the resource allocation,and the cooperation decisions, under the assumption that some nodes are willingto act as cooperative relays. a pricing-based distributed resource allocationframework is adopted, where the price reflects the expected future congestionin the network. specifically, we formulate the wireless video transmissionproblem as an mu markov decision process (mdp) that explicitly considers thecooperation at the physical layer and the medium access control sublayer, thevideo users' heterogeneous traffic characteristics, the dynamically varyingnetwork conditions, and the coupling among the users' transmission strategiesacross time due to the shared wireless resource. although mdps notoriouslysuffer from the curse of dimensionality, our study shows that, with appropriatesimplications and approximations, the complexity of the mu-mdp can besignificantly mitigated. our simulation results demonstrate that integratingcooperative decisions into the mu-mdp optimization can increase the resourceprice in networks that only support low transmission rates and can decrease theprice in networks that support high transmission rates. additionally, ourresults show that cooperation allows users with feeble direct signals toachieve improvements in video quality on the order of 5-10 db peaksignal-to-noise ratio (psnr), with less than 0.8 db quality loss by users withstrong direct signals, and with a moderate increase in total network energyconsumption that is significantly less than the energy that a distant nodewould require to achieve an equivalent psnr without exploiting cooperativediversity.

0709.2446	learning for dynamic bidding in cognitive radio resources	in this paper, we model the various wireless users in a cognitive radionetwork as a collection of selfish, autonomous agents that strategicallyinteract in order to acquire the dynamically available spectrum opportunities.our main focus is on developing solutions for wireless users to successfullycompete with each other for the limited and time-varying spectrumopportunities, given the experienced dynamics in the wireless network. wecategorize these dynamics into two types: one is the disturbance due to theenvironment (e.g. wireless channel conditions, source traffic characteristics,etc.) and the other is the impact caused by competing users. to analyze theinteractions among users given the environment disturbance, we propose ageneral stochastic framework for modeling how the competition among users forspectrum opportunities evolves over time. at each stage of the dynamic resourceallocation, a central spectrum moderator auctions the available resources andthe users strategically bid for the required resources. the joint bid actionsaffect the resource allocation and hence, the rewards and future strategies ofall users. based on the observed resource allocation and corresponding rewardsfrom previous allocations, we propose a best response learning algorithm thatcan be deployed by wireless users to improve their bidding policy at eachstage. the simulation results show that by deploying the proposed best responselearning algorithm, the wireless users can significantly improve their ownperformance in terms of both the packet loss rate and the incurred cost for theused resources.

0709.3880	a new perspective on multi-user power control games in interference  channels	this paper considers the problem of how to allocate power among competingusers sharing a frequency-selective interference channel. we model theinteraction between selfish users as a non-cooperative game. as opposed to theexisting iterative water-filling algorithm that studies the myopic users, thispaper studies how a foresighted user, who knows the channel state informationand response strategies of its competing users, should optimize itstransmission strategy. to characterize this multi-user interaction, thestackelberg equilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibriumfor the investigated non-cooperative game is shown. we analyze this interactionin more detail using a simple two-user example, where the foresighted userdetermines its transmission strategy by solving as a bi-level program whichallows him to account for the myopic user's response. it is analytically shownthat a foresighted user can improve its performance, if it has the necessaryinformation about its competitors. since the optimal solution of stackelbergequilibrium is computationally prohibitive, we propose a practicallow-complexity approach based on lagrangian duality theory. numericalsimulations verify the performance improvements. possible ways to acquire therequired information and to extend the formulation to more than two users arealso discussed.

1108.5514	strategic learning and robust protocol design for online communities  with selfish users	this paper focuses on analyzing the free-riding behavior of self-interestedusers in online communities. hence, traditional optimization methods forcommunities composed of compliant users such as network utility maximizationcannot be applied here. in our prior work, we show how social reciprocationprotocols can be designed in online communities which have populationsconsisting of a continuum of users and are stationary under stochasticpermutations. under these assumptions, we are able to prove that usersvoluntarily comply with the pre-determined social norms and cooperate withother users in the community by providing their services. in this paper, wegeneralize the study by analyzing the interactions of self-interested users inonline communities with finite populations and are not stationary. to optimizetheir long-term performance based on their knowledge, users adapt theirstrategies to play their best response by solving individual stochastic controlproblems. the best-response dynamic introduces a stochastic dynamic process inthe community, in which the strategies of users evolve over time. we theninvestigate the long-term evolution of a community, and prove that thecommunity will converge to stochastically stable equilibria which are stableagainst stochastic permutations. understanding the evolution of a communityprovides protocol designers with guidelines for designing social norms in whichno user has incentives to adapt its strategy and deviate from the prescribedprotocol, thereby ensuring that the adopted protocol will enable the communityto achieve the optimal social welfare.

1108.5871	designing practical distributed exchange for online communities	in many online systems, individuals provide services for each other; therecipient of the service obtains a benefit but the provider of the serviceincurs a cost. if benefit exceeds cost, provision of the service increasessocial welfare and should therefore be encouraged -- but the individualsproviding the service gain no (immediate) benefit from providing the serviceand hence have an incentive to withhold service. hence there is scope fordesigning a system that improves welfare by encouraging exchange. to operatesuccessfully within the confines of the online environment, such a systemshould be distributed, practicable, and consistent with individual incentives.this paper proposes and analyzes a simple such system that relies on theexchange of {\em tokens}; the emphasis is on the design of a protocol (numberof tokens and suggested strategies). we provide estimates for the efficiency ofsuch protocols and show that choosing the right protocol will lead to almostfull efficiency if agents are sufficiently patient. however, choosing the wrongprotocols may lead to an enormous loss of efficiency.

1109.4201	production and network formation games with content heterogeneity	online social networks (e.g. facebook, twitter, youtube) provide a popular,cost-effective and scalable framework for sharing user-generated contents. thispaper addresses the intrinsic incentive problems residing in social networksusing a game-theoretic model where individual users selfishly trade off thecosts of forming links (i.e. whom they interact with) and producing contentspersonally against the potential rewards from doing so. departing from theassumption that contents produced by difference users is perfectlysubstitutable, we explicitly consider heterogeneity in user-generated contentsand study how it influences users' behavior and the structure of socialnetworks. given content heterogeneity, we rigorously prove that when thepopulation of a social network is sufficiently large, every (strict)non-cooperative equilibrium should consist of either a symmetric networktopology where each user produces the same amount of content and has the samedegree, or a two-level hierarchical topology with all users belonging to eitherof the two types: influencers who produce large amounts of contents andsubscribers who produce small amounts of contents and get most of theircontents from influencers. meanwhile, the law of the few disappears in suchnetworks. moreover, we prove that the social optimum is always achieved bynetworks with symmetric topologies, where the sum of users' utilities ismaximized. to provide users with incentives for producing and mutually sharingthe socially optimal amount of contents, a pricing scheme is proposed, withwhich we show that the social optimum can be achieved as a non-cooperativeequilibrium with the pricing of content acquisition and link formation.

1111.2456	repeated games with intervention: theory and applications in  communications	in communication systems where users share common resources, users' selfishbehavior usually results in suboptimal resource utilization. there have beenextensive works that model communication systems with selfish users as one-shotgames and propose incentive schemes to achieve pareto optimal action profilesas non-cooperative equilibria. however, in many communication systems, due tostrong negative externalities among users, the sets of feasible payoffs inone-shot games are nonconvex. thus, it is possible to expand the set offeasible payoffs by having users choose convex combinations of differentpayoffs. in this paper, we propose a repeated game model generalized byintervention. first, we use repeated games to convexify the set of feasiblepayoffs in one-shot games. second, we combine conventional repeated games withintervention, originally proposed for one-shot games, to achieve a larger setof equilibrium payoffs and loosen requirements for users' patience to achieveit. we study the problem of maximizing a welfare function defined on users'equilibrium payoffs, subject to minimum payoff guarantees. given the optimalequilibrium payoff, we derive the minimum intervention capability required anddesign corresponding equilibrium strategies. the proposed generalized repeatedgame model applies to various communication systems, such as power control andflow control.

1112.4084	markov decision process based energy-efficient on-line scheduling for  slice-parallel video decoders on multicore systems	we consider the problem of energy-efficient on-line scheduling forslice-parallel video decoders on multicore systems. we assume that each of theprocessors are dynamic voltage frequency scaling (dvfs) enabled such that theycan independently trade off performance for power, while taking the videodecoding workload into account. in the past, scheduling and dvfs policies inmulti-core systems have been formulated heuristically due to the inherentcomplexity of the on-line multicore scheduling problem. the key contribution ofthis report is that we rigorously formulate the problem as a markov decisionprocess (mdp), which simultaneously takes into account the on-line schedulingand per-core dvfs capabilities; the power consumption of the processor coresand caches; and the loss tolerant and dynamic nature of the video decoder'straffic. in particular, we model the video traffic using a direct acyclic graph(dag) to capture the precedence constraints among frames in a group of pictures(gop) structure, while also accounting for the fact that frames have differentdisplay/decoding deadlines and non-deterministic decoding complexities. theobjective of the mdp is to minimize long-term power consumption subject to aminimum quality of service (qos) constraint related to the decoder'sthroughput. although mdps notoriously suffer from the curse of dimensionality,we show that, with appropriate simplifications and approximations, thecomplexity of the mdp can be mitigated. we implement a slice-parallel versionof h.264 on a multiprocessor arm (mparm) virtual platform simulator, whichprovides cycle-accurate and bus signal-accurate simulation for differentprocessors. we use this platform to generate realistic video decoding traceswith which we evaluate the proposed on-line scheduling algorithm in matlab.

1201.2918	social norm design for information exchange systems with limited  observations	information exchange systems differ in many ways, but all share a commonvulnerability to selfish behavior and free-riding. in this paper, we buildincentives schemes based on social norms. social norms prescribe a socialstrategy for the users in the system to follow and deploy reputation schemes toreward or penalize users depending on their behaviors. because users in thesesystems often have only limited capability to observe the global systeminformation, e.g. the reputation distribution of the users participating in thesystem, their beliefs about the reputation distribution are heterogeneous andbiased. such belief heterogeneity causes a positive fraction of users to notfollow the social strategy. in such practical scenarios, the standardequilibrium analysis deployed in the economics literature is no longer directlyapplicable and hence, the system design needs to consider these differences. toinvestigate how the system designs need to change when the participating usershave only limited observations, we focus on a simple social norm with binaryreputation labels but allow adjusting the punishment severity throughrandomization. first, we model the belief heterogeneity using a suitablebayesian belief function. next, we formalize the users' optimal decisionproblems and derive in which scenarios they follow the prescribed socialstrategy. with this result, we then study the system dynamics and formallydefine equilibrium in the sense that the system is stable when usersstrategically optimize their decisions. by rigorously studying two specificcases where users' belief distribution is constant or is linearly influenced bythe true reputation distribution, we prove that the optimal reputation updaterule is to choose the mildest possible punishment. this result is furtherconfirmed for higher order beliefs in simulations.

1201.3328	dynamic spectrum sharing among repeatedly interacting selfish users with  imperfect monitoring	we develop a novel design framework for dynamic distributed spectrum sharingamong secondary users (sus) who adjust their power levels to compete forspectrum opportunities while satisfying the interference temperature (it)constraints imposed by primary users. the considered interaction among the susis characterized by the following three features. first, since the sus aredecentralized, they are selfish and aim to maximize their own long-term payoffsfrom utilizing the network rather than obeying the prescribed allocation of acentralized controller. second, the sus interact with each other repeatedly andthey can coexist in the system for a long time. third, the sus have limited andimperfect monitoring ability: they only observe whether the it constraints areviolated, and their observation is imperfect due to the erroneous measurements.to capture these features, we model the interaction of the sus as a repeatedgame with imperfect monitoring. we first characterize the set of pareto optimalpayoffs that can be achieved by deviation-proof spectrum sharing policies,which are policies that the selfish users find it in their interest to complywith. next, for any given payoff in this set, we show how to construct adeviation-proof policy to achieve it. the constructed deviation-proof policy isamenable to distributed implementation, and allows users to transmit in atime-division multiple-access (tdma) fashion. in the presence of strongmulti-user interference, our policy outperforms existing spectrum sharingpolicies that dictate users to transmit at constant power levelssimultaneously. moreover, our policy can achieve pareto optimality even whenthe sus have limited and imperfect monitoring ability, as opposed to existingsolutions based on repeated games, which require perfect monitoring abilities.

1207.4044	designing information revelation and intervention with an application to  flow control	there are many familiar situations in which a manager seeks to design asystem in which users share a resource, but outcomes depend on the informationheld and actions taken by users. if communication is possible, the manager canask users to report their private information and then, using this information,instruct them on what actions they should take. if the users are compliant,this reduces the manager's optimization problem to a well-studied problem ofoptimal control. however, if the users are self-interested and not compliant,the problem is much more complicated: when asked to report their privateinformation, the users might lie; upon receiving instructions, the users mightdisobey. here we ask whether the manager can design the system to get aroundboth of these difficulties. to do so, the manager must provide for the usersthe incentives to report truthfully and to follow the instructions, despite thefact that the users are self-interested. for a class of environments thatincludes many resource allocation games in communication networks, we providetools for the manager to design an efficient system. in addition to reports andrecommendations, the design we employ allows the manager to intervene in thesystem after the users take actions. in an abstracted environment, we findconditions under which the manager can achieve the same outcome it could ifusers were compliant, and conditions under which it does not. we then apply ourframework and results to design a flow control management system.

1211.3677	pricing and intervention in slotted-aloha: technical report	in many wireless communication networks a common channel is shared bymultiple users who must compete to gain access to it. the operation of thenetwork by self-interested and strategic users usually leads to the overuse ofthe channel resources and to substantial inefficiencies. hence, incentiveschemes are needed to overcome the inefficiencies of non-cooperativeequilibrium. in this work we consider a slotted-aloha like random accessprotocol and two incentive schemes: pricing and intervention. we provide somecriteria for the designer of the protocol to choose one scheme between them andto design the best policy for the selected scheme, depending on the systemparameters. our results show that intervention can achieve the maximumefficiency in the perfect monitoring scenario. in the imperfect monitoringscenario, instead, the performance of the system depends on the informationheld by the different entities and, in some cases, there exists a threshold forthe number of users such that, for a number of users lower than the threshold,intervention outperforms pricing, whereas, for a number of users higher thanthe threshold pricing outperforms intervention.

1211.4174	energy-efficient nonstationary spectrum sharing	we develop a novel design framework for energy-efficient spectrum sharingamong autonomous users who aim to minimize their energy consumptions subject tominimum throughput requirements. most existing works proposed stationaryspectrum sharing policies, in which users transmit at fixed power levels. sinceusers transmit simultaneously under stationary policies, to fulfill minimumthroughput requirements, they need to transmit at high power levels to overcomeinterference. to improve energy efficiency, we construct nonstationary spectrumsharing policies, in which the users transmit at time-varying power levels.specifically, we focus on tdma (time-division multiple access) policies inwhich one user transmits at each time (but not in a round-robin fashion). theproposed policy can be implemented by each user running a low-complexityalgorithm in a decentralized manner. it achieves high energy efficiency evenwhen the users have erroneous and binary feedback about their interferencelevels. moreover, it can adapt to the dynamic entry and exit of users. theproposed policy is also deviation-proof, namely autonomous users will find itin their self-interests to follow it. compared to existing policies, theproposed policy can achieve an energy saving of up to 90% when the number ofusers is high.

0712.2497	a new theoretic foundation for cross-layer optimization	cross-layer optimization solutions have been proposed in recent years toimprove the performance of network users operating in a time-varying,error-prone wireless environment. however, these solutions often rely on ad-hocoptimization approaches, which ignore the different environmental dynamicsexperienced at various layers by a user and violate the layered networkarchitecture of the protocol stack by requiring layers to provide access totheir internal protocol parameters to other layers. this paper presents a newtheoretic foundation for cross-layer optimization, which allows each layer tomake autonomous decisions individually, while maximizing the utility of thewireless user by optimally determining what information needs to be exchangedamong layers. hence, this cross-layer framework does not change the currentlayered architecture. specifically, because the wireless user interacts withthe environment at various layers of the protocol stack, the cross-layeroptimization problem is formulated as a layered markov decision process (mdp)in which each layer adapts its own protocol parameters and exchangesinformation (messages) with other layers in order to cooperatively maximize theperformance of the wireless user. the message exchange mechanism fordetermining the optimal cross-layer transmission strategies has been designedfor both off-line optimization and on-line dynamic adaptation. we also showthat many existing cross-layer optimization algorithms can be formulated assimplified, sub-optimal, versions of our layered mdp framework.

1308.4568	distributed online learning via cooperative contextual bandits	in this paper we propose a novel framework for decentralized, online learningby many learners. at each moment of time, an instance characterized by acertain context may arrive to each learner; based on the context, the learnercan select one of its own actions (which gives a reward and providesinformation) or request assistance from another learner. in the latter case,the requester pays a cost and receives the reward but the provider learns theinformation. in our framework, learners are modeled as cooperative contextualbandits. each learner seeks to maximize the expected reward from its arrivals,which involves trading off the reward received from its own actions, theinformation learned from its own actions, the reward received from the actionsrequested of others and the cost paid for these actions - taking into accountwhat it has learned about the value of assistance from each other learner. wedevelop distributed online learning algorithms and provide analytic bounds tocompare the efficiency of these with algorithms with the complete knowledge(oracle) benchmark (in which the expected reward of every action in everycontext is known by every learner). our estimates show that regret - the lossincurred by the algorithm - is sublinear in time. our theoretical framework canbe used in many practical applications including big data mining, eventdetection in surveillance sensor networks and distributed online recommendationsystems.

1309.1815	information sharing in networks of strategic agents	to ensure that social networks (e.g. opinion consensus, cooperativeestimation, distributed learning and adaptation etc.) proliferate andefficiently operate, the participating agents need to collaborate with eachother by repeatedly sharing information. however, sharing information is oftencostly for the agents while resulting in no direct immediate benefit for them.hence, lacking incentives to collaborate, strategic agents who aim to maximizetheir own individual utilities will withhold rather than share information,leading to inefficient operation or even collapse of networks. in this paper,we develop a systematic framework for designing distributed rating protocolsaimed at incentivizing the strategic agents to collaborate with each other bysharing information. the proposed incentive protocols exploit the ongoingnature of the agents' interactions to assign ratings and through them,determine future rewards and punishments: agents that have behaved as directedenjoy high ratings -- and hence greater future access to the information ofothers; agents that have not behaved as directed enjoy low ratings -- and henceless future access to the information of others. unlike existing ratingprotocols, the proposed protocol operates in a distributed manner, online, andtakes into consideration the underlying interconnectivity of agents as well astheir heterogeneity. we prove that in many deployment scenarios the price ofanarchy (poa) obtained by adopting the proposed rating protocols is one. insettings in which the poa is larger than one, we show that the proposed ratingprotocol still significantly outperforms existing incentive mechanisms such astit-for-tat. importantly, the proposed rating protocols can also operateefficiently in deployment scenarios where the strategic agents interact overtime-varying network topologies where new agents join the network over time.

1311.1264	dynamic network formation with incomplete information	how do networks form and what is their ultimate topology? most of theliterature that addresses these questions assumes complete information: agentsknow in advance the value of linking to other agents, even with agents theyhave never met and with whom they have had no previous interaction (direct orindirect). this paper addresses the same questions under what seems to us to bethe much more natural assumption of incomplete information: agents do not knowin advance -- but must learn -- the value of linking to agents they have nevermet. we show that the assumption of incomplete information has profoundimplications for the process of network formation and the topology of networksthat ultimately form. under complete information, the networks that form andare stable typically have a star, wheel or core-periphery form, with high-valueagents in the core. under incomplete information, the presence of positiveexternalities (the value of indirect links) implies that a much widercollection of network topologies can emerge and be stable. moreover, even whenthe topologies that emerge are the same, the locations of agents can be verydifferent. for instance, when information is incomplete, it is possible for ahub-and-spokes network with a low-value agent in the center to form and endurepermanently: an agent can achieve a central position purely as the result ofchance rather than as the result of merit. perhaps even more strikingly: wheninformation is incomplete, a connected network could form and persist even if,when information were complete, no links would ever form, so that the finalform would be a totally disconnected network. all of this can occur even insettings where agents eventually learn everything so that information, althoughinitially incomplete, eventually becomes complete.

1311.4227	optimal foresighted multi-user wireless video	recent years have seen an explosion in wireless video communication systems.optimization in such systems is crucial - but most existing methods intended tooptimize the performance of multi-user wireless video transmission areinefficient. some works (e.g. network utility maximization (num)) are myopic:they choose actions to maximize instantaneous video quality while ignoring thefuture impact of these actions. such myopic solutions are known to be inferiorto foresighted solutions that optimize the long-term video quality.alternatively, foresighted solutions such as rate-distortion optimized packetscheduling focus on single-user wireless video transmission, while ignoring theresource allocation among the users.  in this paper, we propose an optimal solution for performing jointforesighted resource allocation and packet scheduling among multiple userstransmitting video over a shared wireless network. a key challenge indeveloping foresighted solutions for multiple video users is that the users'decisions are coupled. to decouple the users' decisions, we adopt a novel dualdecomposition approach, which differs from the conventional optimizationsolutions such as num, and determines foresighted policies. specifically, wepropose an informationally-decentralized algorithm in which the network managerupdates resource "prices" (i.e. the dual variables associated with the resourceconstraints), and the users make individual video packet scheduling decisionsbased on these prices. because a priori knowledge of the system dynamics isalmost never available at run-time, the proposed solution can learn online,concurrently with performing the foresighted optimization. simulation resultsshow 7 db and 3 db improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (psnr) overmyopic solutions and existing foresighted solutions, respectively.

1401.2185	foresighted demand side management	we consider a smart grid with an independent system operator (iso), anddistributed aggregators who have energy storage and purchase energy from theiso to serve its customers. all the entities in the system are foresighted:each aggregator seeks to minimize its own long-term payments for energypurchase and operational costs of energy storage by deciding how much energy tobuy from the iso, and the iso seeks to minimize the long-term total cost of thesystem (e.g. energy generation costs and the aggregators' costs) by dispatchingthe energy production among the generators. the decision making of the entitiesis complicated for two reasons. first, the information is decentralized: theiso does not know the aggregators' states (i.e. their energy consumptionrequests from customers and the amount of energy in their storage), and eachaggregator does not know the other aggregators' states or the iso's state (i.e.the energy generation costs and the status of the transmission lines). second,the coupling among the aggregators is unknown to them. specifically, eachaggregator's energy purchase affects the price, and hence the payments of theother aggregators. however, none of them knows how its decision influences theprice because the price is determined by the iso based on its state. we proposea design framework in which the iso provides each aggregator with a conjecturedfuture price, and each aggregator distributively minimizes its own long-termcost based on its conjectured price as well as its local information. theproposed framework can achieve the social optimum despite being decentralizedand involving complex coupling among the various entities.

1409.8650	adaptive prioritized random linear coding and scheduling for layered  data delivery from multiple servers	in this paper, we deal with the problem of jointly determining the optimalcoding strategy and the scheduling decisions when receivers obtain layered datafrom multiple servers. the layered data is encoded by means of prioritizedrandom linear coding (prlc) in order to be resilient to channel loss whilerespecting the unequal levels of importance in the data, and data blocks aretransmitted simultaneously in order to reduce decoding delays and improve thedelivery performance. we formulate the optimal coding and scheduling decisionsproblem in our novel framework with the help of markov decision processes(mdp), which are effective tools for modeling adapting streaming systems.reinforcement learning approaches are then proposed to derive reducedcomputational complexity solutions to the adaptive coding and schedulingproblems. the novel reinforcement learning approaches and the mdp solution areexamined in an illustrative example for scalable video transmission. ourmethods offer large performance gains over competing methods that deliver thedata blocks sequentially. the experimental evaluation also shows that our novelalgorithms offer continuous playback and guarantee small quality variationswhich is not the case for baseline solutions. finally, our work highlights theadvantages of reinforcement learning algorithms to forecast the temporalevolution of data demands and to decide the optimal coding and schedulingdecisions.

1410.3617	etutor: online learning for personalized education	given recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence,web-based education systems have became complementary and, in some cases,viable alternatives to traditional classroom teaching. the popularity of thesesystems stems from their ability to make education available to a largedemographics (see moocs). however, existing systems do not take advantage ofthe personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered:they continue to be one-size-fits-all. in this paper, we aim to provide a firstsystematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system.personalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be providedpersonalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classesalready taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specificcontext, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teachingmaterials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should beadapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam,likes/dislikes etc.) of the students. our personalized online system, e-tutor,is able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teachingmethodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to astudent) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing thetime spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). weillustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real-world etutorplatform which is used for remedial training for a digital signal processing(dsp) course.

1410.7890	global bandits with holder continuity	standard multi-armed bandit (mab) problems assume that the arms areindependent. however, in many application scenarios, the information obtainedby playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. hence,in such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited toenable faster convergence to the optimal solution. in this paper, we introduceand formalize the global mab (gmab), in which arms are globally informativethrough a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about allthe arms. we propose a greedy policy for the gmab which always selects the armwith the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves boundedparameter-dependent regret. hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms onlyfinitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, theoptimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probabilityone. in addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about eachother's rewards affects the speed of learning. specifically, we prove that theparameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with theinformativeness of the arms. we also prove a sublinear in time bayesian riskbound for the gmab which reduces to the well-known bayesian risk bound forlinearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative. gmabs haveapplications ranging from drug and treatment discovery to dynamic pricing.

1410.8091	a dynamic network formation model for understanding bacterial  self-organization into micro-colonies	we propose a general parametrizable model to capture the dynamic interactionamong bacteria in the formation of micro-colonies. micro-colonies represent thefirst social step towards the formation of structured multicellular communitiesknown as bacterial biofilms, which protect the bacteria against antimicrobials.in our model, bacteria can form links in the form of intercellular adhesins(such as polysaccharides) to collaborate in the production of resources thatare fundamental to protect them against antimicrobials. since maintaining alink can be costly, we assume that each bacterium forms and maintains a linkonly if the benefit received from the link is larger than the cost, and weformalize the interaction among bacteria as a dynamic network formation game.we rigorously characterize some of the key properties of the network evolutiondepending on the parameters of the system. in particular, we derive theparameters under which it is guaranteed that all bacteria will joinmicro-colonies and the parameters under which it is guaranteed that somebacteria will not join micro-colonies. importantly, our study does not onlycharacterize the properties of networks emerging in equilibrium, but it alsoprovides important insights on how the network dynamically evolves and on howthe formation history impacts the emerging networks in equilibrium. thisanalysis can be used to develop methods to influence on- the-fly the evolutionof the network, and such methods can be useful to treat or preventbiofilm-related diseases.

1411.2139	incentive design in peer review: rating and repeated endogenous matching	peer review (e.g., grading assignments in massive open online courses(moocs), academic paper review) is an effective and scalable method to evaluatethe products (e.g., assignments, papers) of a large number of agents when thenumber of dedicated reviewing experts (e.g., teaching assistants, editors) islimited. peer review poses two key challenges: 1) identifying the reviewers'intrinsic capabilities (i.e., adverse selection) and 2) incentivizing thereviewers to exert high effort (i.e., moral hazard). some works in mechanismdesign address pure adverse selection using one-shot matching rules, and puremoral hazard was addressed in repeated games with exogenously given and fixedmatching rules. however, in peer review systems exhibiting both adverseselection and moral hazard, one-shot or exogenous matching rules do not linkagents' current behavior with future matches and future payoffs, and as weprove, will induce myopic behavior (i.e., exerting the lowest effort) resultingin the lowest review quality.  in this paper, we propose for the first time a solution that simultaneouslysolves adverse selection and moral hazard. our solution exploits the repeatedinteractions of agents, utilizes ratings to summarize agents' past reviewquality, and designs matching rules that endogenously depend on agents'ratings. our proposed matching rules are easy to implement and require noknowledge about agents' private information (e.g., their benefit and costfunctions). yet, they are effective in guiding the system to an equilibriumwhere the agents are incentivized to exert high effort and receive ratings thatprecisely reflect their review quality. using several illustrative examples, wequantify the significant performance gains obtained by our proposed mechanismas compared to existing one-shot or exogenous matching rules.

1411.3652	jamming bandits	can an intelligent jammer learn and adapt to unknown environments in anelectronic warfare-type scenario? in this paper, we answer this question in thepositive, by developing a cognitive jammer that adaptively and optimallydisrupts the communication between a victim transmitter-receiver pair. weformalize the problem using a novel multi-armed bandit framework where thejammer can choose various physical layer parameters such as the signalingscheme, power level and the on-off/pulsing duration in an attempt to obtainpower efficient jamming strategies. we first present novel online learningalgorithms to maximize the jamming efficacy against static transmitter-receiverpairs and prove that our learning algorithm converges to the optimal (in termsof the error rate inflicted at the victim and the energy used) jammingstrategy. even more importantly, we prove that the rate of convergence to theoptimal jamming strategy is sub-linear, i.e. the learning is fast in comparisonto existing reinforcement learning algorithms, which is particularly importantin dynamically changing wireless environments. also, we characterize theperformance of the proposed bandit-based learning algorithm against multiplestatic and adaptive transmitter-receiver pairs.

1411.5102	distributed interference management policies for heterogeneous small  cell networks	we study the problem of interference management in large-scale small cellnetworks, where each user equipment (ue) needs to determine in a distributedmanner when and at what power level it should transmit to its serving smallcell base station (sbs) such that a given network performance criterion ismaximized subject to minimum quality of service (qos) requirements by the ues.we first propose a distributed algorithm for the ue-sbs pairs to find a subsetof weakly interfering ue-sbs pairs, namely the maximal independent sets (miss)of the interference graph in logarithmic time (with respect to the number ofues). then we propose a novel problem formulation which enables ue-sbs pairs todetermine the optimal fractions of time occupied by each mis in a distributedmanner. we analytically bound the performance of our distributed policy interms of the competitive ratio with respect to the optimal network performance,which is obtained in a centralized manner with np (non-deterministic polynomialtime) complexity. remarkably, the competitive ratio is independent of thenetwork size, which guarantees scalability in terms of performance forarbitrarily large networks. through simulations, we show that our proposedpolicies achieve significant performance improvements (from 150% to 700%) overthe existing policies.

1411.5107	towards a theory of societal co-evolution: individualism versus  collectivism	substantial empirical research has shown that the level of individualism vs.collectivism is one of the most critical and important determinants of societaltraits, such as economic growth, economic institutions and health conditions.but the exact nature of this impact has thus far not been well understood in ananalytical setting. in this work, we develop one of the first theoreticalmodels that analytically studies the impact of individualism-collectivism onthe society. we model the growth of an individual's welfare (wealth, resourcesand health) as depending not only on himself, but also on the level ofcollectivism, i.e. the level of dependence on the rest of the individuals inthe society, which leads to a co-evolutionary setting. based on our model, weare able to predict the impact of individualism-collectivism on varioussocietal metrics, such as average welfare, average life-time, total population,cumulative welfare and average inequality. we analytically show thatindividualism has a positive impact on average welfare and cumulative welfare,but comes with the drawbacks of lower average life-time, lower total populationand higher average inequality.

1412.1468	information-sharing over adaptive networks with self-interested agents	we examine the behavior of multi-agent networks where information-sharing issubject to a positive communications cost over the edges linking the agents. weconsider a general mean-square-error formulation where all agents areinterested in estimating the same target vector. we first show that, in theabsence of any incentives to cooperate, the optimal strategy for the agents isto behave in a selfish manner with each agent seeking the optimal solutionindependently of the other agents. pareto inefficiency arises as a result ofthe fact that agents are not using historical data to predict the behavior oftheir neighbors and to know whether they will reciprocate and participate insharing information. motivated by this observation, we develop a reputationprotocol to summarize the opponent's past actions into a reputation score,which can then be used to form a belief about the opponent's subsequentactions. the reputation protocol entices agents to cooperate and turns theiroptimal strategy into an action-choosing strategy that enhances the overallsocial benefit of the network. in particular, we show that when thecommunications cost becomes large, the expected social benefit of the proposedprotocol outperforms the social benefit that is obtained by cooperative agentsthat always share data. we perform a detailed mean-square-error analysis of theevolution of the network over three domains: far field, near-field, andmiddle-field, and show that the network behavior is stable for sufficientlysmall step-sizes. the various theoretical results are illustrated by numericalsimulations.

1502.01418	releaf: an algorithm for learning and exploiting relevance	recommender systems, medical diagnosis, network security, etc., requireon-going learning and decision-making in real time. these -- and many others --represent perfect examples of the opportunities and difficulties presented bybig data: the available information often arrives from a variety of sources andhas diverse features so that learning from all the sources may be valuable butintegrating what is learned is subject to the curse of dimensionality. thispaper develops and analyzes algorithms that allow efficient learning anddecision-making while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. we formalize theinformation available to the learner/decision-maker at a particular time as acontext vector which the learner should consider when taking actions. ingeneral the context vector is very high dimensional, but in many settings, themost relevant information is embedded into only a few relevant dimensions. ifthese relevant dimensions were known in advance, the problem would be simple --but they are not. moreover, the relevant dimensions may be different fordifferent actions. our algorithm learns the relevant dimensions for eachaction, and makes decisions based in what it has learned. formally, we build onthe structure of a contextual multi-armed bandit by adding and exploiting arelevance relation. we prove a general regret bound for our algorithm whosetime order depends only on the maximum number of relevant dimensions among allthe actions, which in the special case where the relevance relation issingle-valued (a function), reduces to $\tilde{o}(t^{2(\sqrt{2}-1)})$; in theabsence of a relevance relation, the best known contextual bandit algorithmsachieve regret $\tilde{o}(t^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$, where $d$ is the full dimension ofthe context vector.

1502.02125	contextual online learning for multimedia content aggregation	the last decade has witnessed a tremendous growth in the volume as well asthe diversity of multimedia content generated by a multitude of sources (newsagencies, social media, etc.). faced with a variety of content choices,consumers are exhibiting diverse preferences for content; their preferencesoften depend on the context in which they consume content as well as variousexogenous events. to satisfy the consumers' demand for such diverse content,multimedia content aggregators (cas) have emerged which gather content fromnumerous multimedia sources. a key challenge for such systems is to accuratelypredict what type of content each of its consumers prefers in a certaincontext, and adapt these predictions to the evolving consumers' preferences,contexts and content characteristics. we propose a novel, distributed, onlinemultimedia content aggregation framework, which gathers content generated bymultiple heterogeneous producers to fulfill its consumers' demand for content.since both the multimedia content characteristics and the consumers'preferences and contexts are unknown, the optimal content aggregation strategyis unknown a priori. our proposed content aggregation algorithm is able tolearn online what content to gather and how to match content and users byexploiting similarities between consumer types. we prove bounds for ourproposed learning algorithms that guarantee both the accuracy of thepredictions as well as the learning speed. importantly, our algorithms operateefficiently even when feedback from consumers is missing or content andpreferences evolve over time. illustrative results highlight the merits of theproposed content aggregation system in a variety of settings.

1503.04768	self-organizing networks of information gathering cognitive agents	in many scenarios, networks emerge endogenously as cognitive agents establishlinks in order to exchange information. network formation has been widelystudied in economics, but only on the basis of simplistic models that assumethat the value of each additional piece of information is constant. in thispaper we present a first model and associated analysis for network formationunder the much more realistic assumption that the value of each additionalpiece of information depends on the type of that piece of information and onthe information already possessed: information may be complementary orredundant. we model the formation of a network as a non-cooperative game inwhich the actions are the formation of links and the benefit of forming a linkis the value of the information exchanged minus the cost of forming the link.we characterize the topologies of the networks emerging at a nash equilibrium(ne) of this game and compare the efficiency of equilibrium networks with theefficiency of centrally designed networks. to quantify the impact ofinformation redundancy and linking cost on social information loss, we provideestimates for the price of anarchy (poa); to quantify the impact on individualinformation loss we introduce and provide estimates for a measure we callmaximum information loss (mil). finally, we consider the setting in whichagents are not endowed with information, but must produce it. we show that thevalidity of the well-known "law of the few" depends on how informationaggregates; in particular, the "law of the few" fails when information displayscomplementarities.

1503.08370	global bandits	standard multi-armed bandits model decision problems in which theconsequences of each action choice are unknown and independent of each other.but in a wide variety of decision problems - from drug dosage to dynamicpricing - the consequences (rewards) of different actions are correlated, sothat selecting one action provides information about the consequences (rewards)of other actions as well. we propose and analyze a class of models of suchdecision problems; we call this class of models global bandits. when rewardsacross actions (arms) are sufficiently correlated we construct a greedy policythat achieves bounded regret, with a bound that depends on the true parametersof the problem. in the special case in which rewards of all arms aredeterministic functions of a single unknown parameter, we construct a (moresophisticated) greedy policy that achieves bounded regret, with a bound thatdepends on the single true parameter of the problem. for this special case wealso obtain a bound on regret that is independent of the true parameter; thisbound is sub-linear, with an exponent that depends on the informativeness ofthe arms (which measures the strength of correlation between arm rewards).

1504.07009	efficient interference management policies for femtocell networks	managing interference in a network of macrocells underlaid with femtocellspresents an important, yet challenging problem. a majority of spatial(frequency/time) reuse based approaches partition the users based on coloringthe interference graph, which is shown to be suboptimal. some spatial timereuse based approaches schedule the maximal independent sets (miss) in acyclic, (weighted) round-robin fashion, which is inefficient fordelay-sensitive applications. our proposed policies schedule the miss in anon-cyclic fashion, which aim to optimize any given network performancecriterion for delay-sensitive applications while fulfilling minimum throughputrequirements of the users. importantly, we do not take the interference graphas given as in existing works; we propose an optimal construction of theinterference graph. we prove that under certain conditions, the proposed policyachieves the optimal network performance. for large networks, we propose alow-complexity algorithm for computing the proposed policy. we show that thepolicy computed achieves a constant competitive ratio (with respect to theoptimal network performance), which is independent of the network size, underwide range of deployment scenarios. the policy can be implemented in adecentralized manner by the users. compared to the existing policies, ourproposed policies can achieve improvement of up to 130 % in large-scaledeployments.

1508.00205	evolution of social networks: a microfounded model	many societies are organized in networks that are formed by people who meetand interact over time. in this paper, we present a first model to capture themicro-foundations of social networks evolution, where boundedly rational agentsof different types join the network; meet other agents stochastically overtime; and consequently decide to form social ties. a basic premise of our modelis that in real-world networks, agents form links by reasoning about thebenefits that agents they meet over time can bestow. we study the evolution ofthe emerging networks in terms of friendship and popularity acquisition giventhe following exogenous parameters: structural opportunism, type distribution,homophily, and social gregariousness. we show that the time needed for an agentto find "friends" is influenced by the exogenous parameters: agents who aremore gregarious, more homophilic, less opportunistic, or belong to a type"minority" spend a longer time on average searching for friendships. moreover,we show that preferential attachment is a consequence of an emerging doublypreferential meeting process: a process that guides agents of a certain type tomeet more popular similar-type agents with a higher probability, therebycreating asymmetries in the popularity evolution of different types of agents.

1508.00641	staged multi-armed bandits	in conventional multi-armed bandits (mab) and other reinforcement learningmethods, the learner sequentially chooses actions and obtains a reward (whichcan be possibly missing, delayed or erroneous) after each taken action. thisreward is then used by the learner to improve its future decisions. however, innumerous applications, ranging from personalized patient treatment topersonalized web-based education, the learner does not obtain rewards aftereach action, but only after sequences of actions are taken, intermediatefeedbacks are observed, and a final decision is made based on which a reward isobtained. in this paper, we introduce a new class of reinforcement learningmethods which can operate in such settings. we refer to this class as stagedmulti-armed bandits (s-mab). s-mab proceeds in rounds, each composed of severalstages; in each stage, the learner chooses an action and observes a feedbacksignal. upon each action selection a feedback signal is observed, whilst thereward of the selected sequence of actions is only revealed after the learnerselects a stop action that ends the current round. the reward of the rounddepends both on the sequence of actions and the sequence of observed feedbacks.the goal of the learner is to maximize its total expected reward over allrounds by learning to choose the best sequence of actions based on the feedbackit gets about these actions. first, we define an oracle benchmark, whichsequentially selects the actions that maximize the expected immediate reward.this benchmark is known to be approximately optimal when the reward sequenceassociated with the selected actions is adaptive submodular. then, we proposeour online learning algorithm, for which we prove that the regret islogarithmic in the number of rounds and linear in the number of stages withrespect to the oracle benchmark.

1509.06097	the user base dynamics of websites	in this work we study for the first time the interaction between marketingand network effects. we build a model in which the online firm starts with aninitial user base and controls the growth of the user base by choosing theintensity of advertisements and referrals to potential users. a large user baseprovides more profits to the online firm, but building a large user basethrough advertisements and referrals is costly; therefore, the optimal policymust balance the marginal benefits of adding users against the marginal costsof sending advertisements and referrals. our work offers three main insights:(1) the optimal policy prescribes that a new online firm should offer manyadvertisements and referrals initially, but then it should decreaseadvertisements and referrals over time. (2) if the network effects decrease,then the change in the optimal policy depends heavily on two factors i) thelevel of patience of the online firm, where patient online firms are orientedtowards long term profits and impatient online firms are oriented towards shortterm profits and, ii) the size of the user base. if the online firm is verypatient (impatient) and if the network effects decrease, then the optimalpolicy prescribes it to be more (less) aggressive in posting advertisements andreferrals at low user base levels and less (more) aggressive in postingadvertisements and referrals at high user base levels. (3) the change in theoptimal policy when network effects decrease also depends heavily on theheterogeneity in the user base, as measured in terms of the revenue generatedby each user. an online firm that generates most of its revenue from a coregroup of users should be more aggressive and protective of its user base than afirm that generates revenue uniformly from its users.

1510.08103	from acquaintances to friends: homophily and learning in networks	this paper considers the evolution of a network in a discrete time,stochastic setting in which agents learn about each other through repeatedinteractions and maintain/break links on the basis of what they learn fromthese interactions. agents have homophilous preferences and limited capacity,so they maintain links with others who are learned to be similar to themselvesand cut links to others who are learned to be dissimilar to themselves. thuslearning influences the evolution of the network, but learning is imperfect sothe evolution is stochastic. homophily matters. higher levels of homophilydecrease the (average) number of links that agents form. however, the effect ofhomophily is anomalous: mutually beneficial links may be dropped beforelearning is completed, thereby resulting in sparser networks and lessclustering than under complete information. there may be big differencesbetween the networks that emerge under complete and incomplete information.homophily matters here as well: initially, greater levels of homophily increasethe difference between the complete and incomplete information networks, butsufficiently high levels of homophily eventually decrease the difference.complete and incomplete information networks differ the most when the degree ofhomophily is intermediate. with multiple stages of life, the effects ofincomplete information are large initially but fade somewhat over time.

1511.02429	a micro-foundation of social capital in evolving social networks	a social network confers benefits and advantages on individuals (and ongroups), the literature refers to these advantages as social capital. thispaper presents a micro-founded mathematical model of the evolution of a socialnetwork and of the social capital of individuals within the network. theevolution of the network is influenced by the extent to which individuals arehomophilic, structurally opportunistic, socially gregarious and by thedistribution of types in the society. in the analysis, we identify differentkinds of social capital: bonding capital, popularity capital, and bridgingcapital. bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections,homophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connectionsmore homogeneous. popularity capital leads to preferential attachment:individuals who become popular tend to become more popular because others aremore likely to link to them. homophily creates asymmetries in the levels ofpopularity attained by different social groups, more gregarious types of agentsare more likely to become popular. however, in homophilic societies,individuals who belong to less gregarious, less opportunistic, or major typesare likely to be more central in the network and thus acquire a bridgingcapital.

0811.0048	conjectural equilibrium in water-filling games	this paper considers a non-cooperative game in which competing users sharinga frequency-selective interference channel selfishly optimize their powerallocation in order to improve their achievable rates. previously, it was shownthat a user having the knowledge of its opponents' channel state informationcan make foresighted decisions and substantially improve its performancecompared with the case in which it deploys the conventional iterativewater-filling algorithm, which does not exploit such knowledge. this paperdiscusses how a foresighted user can acquire this knowledge by modeling itsexperienced interference as a function of its own power allocation. tocharacterize the outcome of the multi-user interaction, the conjecturalequilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for theinvestigated water-filling game is proved. interestingly, both the nashequilibrium and the stackelberg equilibrium are shown to be special cases ofthe generalization of conjectural equilibrium. we develop practical algorithmsto form accurate beliefs and search desirable power allocation strategies.numerical simulations indicate that a foresighted user without any a prioriknowledge of its competitors' private information can effectively learn therequired information, and induce the entire system to an operating point thatimproves both its own achievable rate as well as the rates of the otherparticipants in the water-filling game.

0812.1244	decomposition principles and online learning in cross-layer optimization  for delay-sensitive applications	in this paper, we propose a general cross-layer optimization framework inwhich we explicitly consider both the heterogeneous and dynamically changingcharacteristics of delay-sensitive applications and the underlying time-varyingnetwork conditions. we consider both the independently decodable data units(dus, e.g. packets) and the interdependent dus whose dependencies are capturedby a directed acyclic graph (dag). we first formulate the cross-layer design asa non-linear constrained optimization problem by assuming complete knowledge ofthe application characteristics and the underlying network conditions. theconstrained cross-layer optimization is decomposed into several cross-layeroptimization subproblems for each du and two master problems. the proposeddecomposition method determines the necessary message exchanges between layersfor achieving the optimal cross-layer solution. however, the attributes (e.g.distortion impact, delay deadline etc) of future dus as well as the networkconditions are often unknown in the considered real-time applications. theimpact of current cross-layer actions on the future dus can be characterized bya state-value function in the markov decision process (mdp) framework. based onthe dynamic programming solution to the mdp, we develop a low-complexitycross-layer optimization algorithm using online learning for each dutransmission. this online algorithm can be implemented in real-time in order tocope with unknown source characteristics, network dynamics and resourceconstraints. our numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposedonline algorithm.
