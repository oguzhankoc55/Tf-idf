0706.1713	dynamics of the giant planets of the solar system in the gaseous  proto-planetary disk and relationship to the current orbital architecture	we study the orbital evolution of the 4 giant planets of our solar system ina gas disk. our investigation extends the previous works by masset andsnellgrove (2001) and morbidelli and crida (2007, mc07), which focussed on thedynamics of the jupiter-saturn system. the only systems that we found to reacha steady state are those in which the planets are locked in a quadruple meanmotion resonance (i.e. each planet is in resonance with its neighbor). in totalwe found 6 such configurations. for the gas disk parameters found in mc07,these configurations are characterized by a negligible migration rate. afterthe disappearance of the gas, and in absence of planetesimals, only two ofthese six configurations (the least compact ones) are stable for a time ofhundreds of millions of years or more. the others become unstable on atimescale of a few my. our preliminary simulations show that, when aplanetesimal disk is added beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, theplanets can evolve from the most stable of these configurations to theircurrent orbits in a fashion qualitatively similar to that described in tsiganiset al. (2005).

0905.3750	building the terrestrial planets: constrained accretion in the inner  solar system	to date, no accretion model has succeeded in reproducing all observedconstraints in the inner solar system. these constraints include 1) the orbits,in particular the small eccentricities, and 2) the masses of the terrestrialplanets -- mars' relatively small mass in particular has not been adequatelyreproduced in previous simulations; 3) the formation timescales of earth andmars, as interpreted from hf/w isotopes; 4) the bulk structure of the asteroidbelt, in particular the lack of an imprint of planetary embryo-sized objects;and 5) earth's relatively large water content, assuming that it was deliveredin the form of water-rich primitive asteroidal material. here we presentresults of 40 high-resolution (n=1000-2000) dynamical simulations of late-stageplanetary accretion with the goal of reproducing these constraints, althoughneglecting the planet mercury. we assume that jupiter and saturn arefully-formed at the start of each simulation, and test orbital configurationsthat are both consistent with and contrary to the "nice model." we find that aconfiguration with jupiter and saturn on circular orbits forms low-eccentricityterrestrial planets and a water-rich earth on the correct timescale, but mars'mass is too large by a factor of 5-10 and embryos are often stranded in theasteroid belt. a configuration with jupiter and saturn in their currentlocations but with slightly higher initial eccentricities (e = 0.07-0.1)produces a small mars, an embryo-free asteroid belt, and a reasonable earthanalog but rarely allows water delivery to earth. none of the configurations wetested reproduced all the observed constraints.

0906.3755	the history of the solar system's debris disc: observable properties of  the kuiper belt	the nice model of gomes et al. (2005) suggests that the migration of thegiant planets caused a planetesimal clearing event which led to the late heavybombardment (lhb) at 880 myr. here we investigate the ir emission from thekuiper belt during the history of the solar system as described by the nicemodel. we describe a method for easily converting the results of n-bodyplanetesimal simulations into observational properties (assuming black-bodygrains and a single size distribution) and further modify this method toimprove its realism (using realistic grain properties and a three-phase sizedistribution). we compare our results with observed debris discs and evaluatethe plausibility of detecting an lhb-like process in extrasolar systems. recentsurveys have shown that 4% of stars exhibit 24 um excess and 16% exhibit 70 umexcess. we show that the solar system would have been amongst the brightest ofthese systems before the lhb at both 24 and 70 um. we find a significantincrease in 24 um emission during the lhb, which rapidly drops off and becomesundetectable within 30 myr, whereas the 70 um emission remains detectable until360 myr after the lhb. comparison with the statistics of debris disc evolutionshows that such depletion events must be rare occurring around less than 12% ofsun-like stars and with this level of incidence we would expect approximately 1of the 413 sun-like, field stars so far detected to have a 24 um excess to becurrently going through an lhb. we also find that collisional processes areimportant in the solar system before the lhb and that parameters for weakkuiper belt objects are inconsistent with the nice model interpretation of thelhb.

0906.4369	dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation	we review the problem of the formation of terrestrial planets, withparticular emphasis on the interaction of dynamical and geochemical models. thelifetime of gas around stars in the process of formation is limited to a fewmillion years based on astronomical observations, while isotopic dating ofmeteorites and the earth-moon system suggest that perhaps 50-100 million yearswere required for the assembly of the earth. therefore, much of the growth ofthe terrestrial planets in our own system is presumed to have taken place underlargely gas-free conditions, and the physics of terrestrial planet formation isdominated by gravitational interactions and collisions. the earliest phase ofterrestrial-planet formation involve the growth of km-sized or largerplanetesimals from dust grains, followed by the accumulations of theseplanetesimals into ~100 lunar- to mars-mass bodies that are initiallygravitationally isolated from one-another in a swarm of smaller planetesimals,but eventually grow to the point of significantly perturbing one-another. themutual perturbations between the embryos, combined with gravitational stirringby jupiter, lead to orbital crossings and collisions that drive the growth toearth-sized planets on a timescale of 10-100 million years. numerical treatmentof this process has focussed on the use of symplectic integrators which canrapidly integrate the thousands of gravitationally-interacting bodies necessaryto accurately model planetary growth. while the general nature of theterrestrial planets--their sizes and orbital parameters--seem to be broadlyreproduced by the models, there are still some outstanding dynamical issues.one of these is the presence of an embryo-sized body, mars, in our system inplace of the more massive objects that simulations tend to yield.

0907.2512	asteroids were born big	how big were the first planetesimals? we attempt to answer this question byconducting coagulation simulations in which the planetesimals grow by mutualcollisions and form larger bodies and planetary embryos. the size frequencydistribution (sfd) of the initial planetesimals is considered a free parameterin these simulations, and we search for the one that produces at the endobjects with a sfd that is consistent with asteroid belt constraints. we findthat, if the initial planetesimals were small (e.g. km-sized), the final sfdfails to fulfill these constraints. in particular, reproducing the bumpobserved at diameter d~100km in the current sfd of the asteroids requires thatthe minimal size of the initial planetesimals was also ~100km. this supportsthe idea that planetesimals formed big, namely that the size of solids in theproto-planetary disk ``jumped'' from sub-meter scale to multi-kilometer scale,without passing through intermediate values. moreover, we find evidence thatthe initial planetesimals had to have sizes ranging from 100 to several 100km,probably even 1,000km, and that their sfd had to have a slope over thisinterval that was similar to the one characterizing the current asteroids inthe same size-range. this result sets a new constraint on planetesimalformation models and opens new perspectives for the investigation of thecollisional evolution in the asteroid and kuiper belts as well as of theaccretion of the cores of the giant planets.

0909.1891	constructing the secular architecture of the solar system ii: the  terrestrial planets	we investigate the dynamical evolution of the terrestrial planets during theplanetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets. a basic assumption of thiswork is that giant planet migration occurred after the completion ofterrestrial planet formation, such as in the models that link the former to theorigin of the late heavy bombardment. the divergent migration of jupiter andsaturn causes the g5 eigenfrequency to cross resonances of the form g5=gk withk ranging from 1 to 4. consequently these secular resonances causelarge-amplitude responses in the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets. weshow that the resonances g5=g_4 and g5=g3 do not pose a problem if jupiter andsaturn have a fast approach and departure from their mutual 2:1 mean motionresonance. on the other hand, the resonance crossings g5=g2 and g5=g1 are moreof a concern as they tend to yield a terrestrial system incompatible with thecurrent one. we offer two solutions to this problem. the first uses the factthat a secular resonance crossing can also damp the amplitude of a fourier modeif the latter is large originally. a second scenario involves a 'jumpingjupiter' in which encounters between an ice giant and jupiter, without ejectionof the former, cause the latter to migrate away from saturn much faster than ifmigration is driven solely by encounters with planetesimals. in this case, theg5=g2 and g5=g1 resonances can be jumped over, or occur very briefly.

1009.1521	evidence from the asteroid belt for a violent past evolution of  jupiter's orbit	we use the current orbital structure of large (&gt;50km) asteroids in the mainasteroid belt to constrain the evolution of the giant planets when theymigrated from their primordial orbits to their current ones. minton &amp; malhotra(2009) showed that the orbital distribution of large asteroids in the main beltcan be reproduced by an exponentially-decaying migration of the giant planetson a time scale of tau ~ 0.5my. however, self-consistent numerical simulationsshow that the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets isinconsistent with an exponential change in their semi major axes on such ashort time scale (hahn &amp; malhotra, 1999). in fact, the typical time scale istau &gt; 5my. when giant planet migration on this time scale is applied to theasteroid belt, the resulting orbital distribution is incompatible with theobserved one. however, the planet migration can be significantly sped up byplanet-planet encounters. consider an evolution where both jupiter and saturnhave close encounters with a neptune-mass planet (presumably uranus or neptunethemselves) and where this third planet, after being scattered inwards bysaturn, is scattered outwards by jupiter. this scenario leads to a very rapidincrease in the orbital separation between jupiter and saturn that we show hereto have only mild effects on the structure of asteroid belt. this type ofevolution is called a jumping-jupiter case. our results suggest that the totalmass and dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt before migration werecomparable to those currently observed. moreover, they imply that, beforemigration, the orbits of jupiter and saturn were much less eccentric than thecurrent ones.

1010.6221	review: a coherent and comprehensive model of the evolution of the outer  solar system	since the discovery of the first extra-solar planets, we are confronted withthe puzzling diversity of planetary systems. processes like planet radialmigration in gas-disks and planetary orbital instabilities, often invoked toexplain the exotic orbits of the extra-solar planets, at first sight do notseem to have played a role in our system. in reality, though, there are severalaspects in the structure of our solar system that cannot be explained in theclassic scenario of in-situ formation and smooth evolution of the giantplanets. this paper describes a new view of the evolution of the outer solarsystem that emerges from the so-called 'nice model' and its recent extensions.the story provided by this model describes a very "dynamical" solar system,with giant planets affected by both radial migrations and a temporary orbitalinstability. thus, the diversity between our system and those found so fararound other stars does not seem to be due to different processes that operatedhere and elsewhere, but rather stems from the strong sensitivity of chaoticevolutions to small differences in the initial and environmental conditions.

1012.0692	calculation of the enrichment of the giant planet envelopes during the  "late heavy bombardment"	the giant planets of our solar system possess envelopes consisting mainly ofhydrogen and helium but are also significantly enriched in heavier elementsrelatively to our sun. in order to better constrain how these heavy elementshave been delivered, we quantify the amount accreted during the so-called "lateheavy bombardment", at a time when planets were fully formed and planetesimalscould not sink deep into the planets. on the basis of the "nice model", weobtain accreted masses (in terrestrial units) equal to $0.15\pm0.04\rm\,m_\oplus$ for jupiter, and $0.08 \pm 0.01 \rm\,m_\oplus$ for saturn. forthe two other giant planets, the results are found to depend mostly on whetherthey switched position during the instability phase. for uranus, the accretedmass is $0.051 \pm 0.003 \rm\,m_\oplus$ with an inversion and $0.030 \pm 0.001\rm\,m_\oplus$ without an inversion. neptune accretes $0.048 \pm 0.015\rm\,m_\oplus$ in models in which it is initially closer to the sun thanuranus, and $0.066 \pm 0.006 \rm\,m_\oplus$ otherwise. with well-mixedenvelopes, this corresponds to an increase in the enrichment over the solarvalue of $0.033 \pm 0.001$ and $0.074 \pm 0.007$ for jupiter and saturn,respectively. for the two other planets, we find the enrichments to be $2.1 \pm1.4$ (w/ inversion) or $1.2 \pm 0.7$ (w/o inversion) for uranus, and $2.0 \pm1.2$ (w/ inversion) or $2.7 \pm 1.6$ (w/o inversion) for neptune. this isclearly insufficient to explain the inferred enrichments of $\sim 4$ forjupiter, $\sim 7$ for saturn and $\sim 45$ for uranus and neptune.

1106.4051	formation and evolution of planetary systems in presence of highly  inclined stellar perturbers	the presence of highly eccentric extrasolar planets in binary stellar systemssuggests that the kozai effect has played an important role in shaping theirdynamical architectures. however, the formation of planets in inclined binarysystems poses a considerable theoretical challenge, as orbital excitation dueto the kozai resonance implies destructive, high-velocity collisions amongplanetesimals. to resolve the apparent difficulties posed by kozai resonance,we seek to identify the primary physical processes responsible for inhibitingthe action of kozai cycles in protoplanetary disks. subsequently, we seek tounderstand how newly-formed planetary systems transition to their observed,kozai-dominated dynamical states. we find that theoretical difficulties inplanet formation arising from the presence of a distant companion star, posedby the kozai effect and other secular perturbations, can be overcome by aproper account of gravitational interactions within the protoplanetary disk. inparticular, fast apsidal recession induced by disk self-gravity tends to erasethe kozai effect, and ensure that the disk's unwarped, rigid structure ismaintained. subsequently, once a planetary system has formed, the kozai effectcan continue to be wiped out as a result of apsidal precession, arising fromplanet-planet interactions. however, if such a system undergoes a dynamicalinstability, its architecture may change in such a way that the kozai effectbecomes operative. the results presented here suggest that planetary formationin highly inclined binary systems is not stalled by perturbations, arising fromthe stellar companion. consequently, planet formation in binary stars isprobably no different from that around single stars on a qualitative level.furthermore, it is likely that systems where the kozai effect operates,underwent a transient phase of dynamical instability in the past.

1206.3042	on the origin of the almahata-sitta meteorite and 2008tc3 asteroid	asteroid 2008tc3 was a near earth asteroid that impacted the earth on 2008october 7. meteorites were produced by the break-up of 2008tc3 in the highatmosphere and at present, about 600 meteorites - called almahata sitta -coming from 2008tc3 have been recovered. a mineralogical study of almahatasitta fragments shows that the asteroid 2008tc3 was made of meteorites ofdifferent types (ureilites, h, l, and e chondrites). understanding the originof this body and how it was put together remain a challenge. here we perform adetailed spectroscopical and dynamical investigation to show that the mostlikely source region of 2008tc3 is in the inner main belt at low inclination(i&lt;8 degrees). we show that asteroids with spectroscopic classes that can beassociated with the different meteorite types of almahata sitta are present inthe region of the main belt that includes the nysa-polana family and objects ofthe background at low inclination. searching for a possible scenario offormation for 2008tc3, we show that there is little chance that 2008tc3 wasformed by low velocity collisions between asteroids of different mineralogies,in the current asteroid belt. it seems more likely that the heterogeneouscomposition of 2008tc3 was a inherited from a time when the asteroid belt wasin a different dynamical state, most likely in the very early solar system.because ureilites are fragments of a large, thermally metamorphosed asteroid,this suggests that the phases of collisional erosion (the break-up of theureilite parent-body) and collisional accretion (the formation of the parentbody of 2008tc3) overlapped for some time in the primordial asteroid belt.

0711.2344	building giant-planet cores at a planet trap	a well-known bottleneck for the core-accretion model of giant-planetformation is the loss of the cores into the star by type-i migration, due tothe tidal interactions with the gas disk. it has been shown that a steepsurface-density gradient in the disk, such as the one expected at the boundarybetween an active and a dead zone, acts as a planet trap and prevents isolatedcores from migrating down to the central star. we study the relevance of theplanet trap concept for the accretion and evolution of systems of multipleplanetary embryos/cores. we performed hydrodynamical simulations of theevolution of systems of multiple massive objects in the vicinity of a planettrap. the planetary embryos evolve in 3 dimensions, whereas the disk is modeledwith a 2d grid. synthetic forces are applied onto the embryos to mimic thedamping effect that the disk has on their inclinations. systems with twoembryos tend to acquire stable, separated and non-migrating orbits, with themore massive embryo placed at the planet trap and the lighter one farther outin the disk. systems of multiple embryos are intrinsically unstable.consequently, a long phase of mutual scattering can lead to accretingcollisions among embryos; some embryos are injected into the inner part of thedisk, where they can be evacuated into the star by type i migration. the systemcan resume a stable, non-migrating configuration only when the number ofsurviving embryos decreases to a small value (~2-4). this can explain thelimited number of giant planets in our solar system. these results should applyin general to any case in which the type-i migration of the inner embryo isprevented by some mechanism, and not solely to the planet trap scenario.

1208.2957	statistical study of the early solar system's instability with 4, 5 and  6 giant planets	several properties of the solar system, including the wide radial spacing andorbital eccentricities of giant planets, can be explained if the early solarsystem evolved through a dynamical instability followed by migration of planetsin the planetesimal disk. here we report the results of a statistical study, inwhich we performed nearly 10^4 numerical simulations of planetary instabilitystarting from hundreds of different initial conditions. we found that thedynamical evolution is typically too violent, if jupiter and saturn start inthe 3:2 resonance, leading to ejection of at least one ice giant from the solarsystem. planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary diskof planetesimals was large (m_disk&gt;50 m_earth), but we found that a massivedisk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e_55 &lt; 0.01compared to present e_55=0.044, where e_55 is the amplitude of the fiftheccentric mode in the jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violatesconstraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets. better results wereobtained when the solar system was assumed to have five giant planets initiallyand one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of uranus and neptune, wasejected into interstellar space by jupiter. the best results were obtained whenthe ejected planet was placed into the external 3:2 or 4:3 resonance withsaturn and m_disk ~ 20 m_earth. the range of possible outcomes is rather broadin this case, indicating that the present solar system is neither a typical norexpected result for a given initial state, and occurs, in best cases, with onlya ~5% probability (as defined by the success criteria described in the maintext). the case with six giant planets shows interesting dynamics but doesoffer significant advantages relative to the five planet case.

1208.4624	a sawtooth-like timeline for the first billion year of lunar bombardment	we revisit the early evolution of the moon's bombardment. our work combinesmodeling (based on plausible projectile sources and their dynamical decayrates) with constraints from the lunar crater record, radiometric ages of theyoungest lunar basins, and the abundance of highly siderophile elements in thelunar crust and mantle. we deduce that the evolution of the impact flux did notdecline exponentially over the first billion years of lunar history, but alsothere was no prominent and "narrow" impact spike some 3.9 gy ago, unlike thattypically envisioned in the lunar cataclysm scenario. instead, we show thetimeline of the lunar bombardment has a sawtooth-like profile, with an uptickin the impact flux near 4.1 gy ago. the impact flux at the beginning of thisweaker cataclysm was 5-10 times higher than the immediately preceding period.the nectaris basin should have been one of the first basins formed at thesawtooth. we predict the bombardment rate since about 4.1gy ago declined slowlyand adhered relatively close to classic crater chronology models (neukum andivanov (1994)). overall we expect that the sawtooth event accounted for about1/4 of the total bombardment suffered by the moon since its formation.consequently, considering that about 12-14 basins formed during the sawtoothevent, we expect that the net number of basins formed on the moon was about45-50. from our expected bombardment timeline, we derived a new and improvedlunar chronology suitable for use on pre-nectarian surface units. according tothis chronology, a significant portion of the oldest lunar cratered terrainshas an age of 4.38-4.42 gyr. moreover, the largest lunar basin, south poleaitken, is older than 4.3gy, and therefore was not produced during the lunarcataclysm.

1208.4687	dynamics of pebbles in the vicinity of a growing planetary embryo:  hydro-dynamical simulations	understanding the growth of the cores of giant planets is a difficultproblem. recently, lambrechts and johansen (2012; lj12) proposed a new model inwhich the cores grow by the accretion of pebble-size objects, as the latterdrift towards the star due to gas drag. here, we investigate the dynamics ofpebble-size objects in the vicinity of planetary embryos of 1 and 5 earthmasses and the resulting accretion rates. we use hydrodynamical simulations, inwhich the embryo influences the dynamics of the gas and the pebbles suffer gasdrag according to the local gas density and velocities. the pebble dynamics inthe vicinity of the planetary embryo is non-trivial, and it changessignificantly with the pebble size. nevertheless, the accretion rate of theembryo that we measure is within an order of magnitude of the rate estimated inlj12 and tends to their value with increasing pebble-size. we conclude that themodel by lj12 has the potential to explain the rapid growth of giant planetcores. the actual accretion rates however, depend on the surface density ofpebble size objects in the disk, which is unknown to date.

0712.0553	origin of the structure of the kuiper belt during a dynamical  instability in the orbits of uranus and neptune	we explore the origin and orbital evolution of the kuiper belt in theframework of a recent model of the dynamical evolution of the giant planets,sometimes known as the nice model. this model is characterized by a short, butviolent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricityorbits. one characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk musthave been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 au so that neptune would stop migratingat its currently observed location. as a result, the kuiper belt would haveinitially been empty. in this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism whichcan deliver objects from the region interior to ~35 au to the kuiper beltwithout excessive inclination excitation. assuming that the last encounter withuranus delivered neptune onto a low-inclination orbit with a semi-major axis of~27 au and an eccentricity of ~0.3, and that subsequently neptune'seccentricity damped in ~1 my, our simulations reproduce the main observedproperties of the kuiper belt at an unprecedented level.

1211.1820	circum-planetary discs as bottlenecks for gas accretion onto giant  planets	with hundreds of exoplanets detected, it is necessary to revisit giantplanets accretion models to explain their mass distribution. in particular,formation of sub-jovian planets remains unclear, given the short timescale forthe runaway accretion of massive atmospheres. however, gas needs to passthrough a circum-planetary disc. if the latter has a low viscosity (as expectedif planets form in "dead zones"), it might act as a bottleneck for gasaccretion. we investigate what the minimum accretion rate is for a planet underthe limit assumption that the circum-planetary disc is totally inviscid, andthe transport of angular momentum occurs solely because of the gravitationalperturbations from the star. to estimate the accretion rate, we present asteady-state model of an inviscid circum-planetary disc, with vertical gasinflow and external torque from the star. hydrodynamical simulations of acircum-planetary disc were conducted in 2d, in a planetocentric frame, with thestar as an external perturber in order to measure the torque exerted by thestar on the disc. the disc shows a two-armed spiral wave caused by stellartides, propagating all the way in from the outer edge of the disc towards theplanet. the stellar torque is small and corresponds to a doubling time for ajupiter mass planet of the order of 5 myrs. given the limit assumptions, thisis clearly a lower bound of the real accretion rate. this result shows that gasaccretion onto a giant planet can be regulated by circum-planetary discs. thissuggests that the diversity of masses of extra-solar planets may be the resultof different viscosities in these discs.

1211.6345	stellar irradiated discs and implications on migration of embedded  planets i: equilibrium discs	the strength and direction of migration of low mass planets depends on thedisc's thermodynamics. in discs where the viscous heating is balanced byradiative transport, the migration can be directed outwards, a process whichextends the lifetime of growing planetary embryos. we investigate the influenceof opacity and stellar irradiation on the disc thermodynamics. utilizing theresulting disc structure, we determine the regions of outward migration. weperform two-dimensional numerical simulations of equilibrium discs with viscousheating, radiative cooling and stellar irradiation. we use the hydrodynamicalcode nirvana that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation, aswell as a two temperature solver that includes radiation transport in theflux-limited diffusion approximation. the migration is studied by using torqueformulae. in the constant opacity case, we reproduce the analytical results ofa black-body disc: the stellar irradiation dominates in the outer regions --leading to flaring -- while the viscous heating dominates close to the star. wefind that the inner edge of the disc should not be significantly puffed-up bythe stellar irradiation. if the opacity depends on the local density andtemperature, the structure of the disc is different, and several bumps in theaspect ratio h/r appear, due to transitions between different opacity regimes.the bumps in the disc can shield the outer disc from stellar irradiation.stellar irradiation is an important factor for determining the disc structureand has dramatic consequences for the migration of embedded planets. comparedto discs with only viscous heating, a stellar irradiated disc features a muchsmaller region of outward migration for a range of planetary masses. thissuggests that the region where the formation of giant planet cores takes placeis smaller, which in turn might lead to a shorter growth phase.

1303.2900	capture of trojans by jumping jupiter	jupiter trojans are thought to be survivors of a much larger population ofplanetesimals that existed in the planetary region when planets formed. theycan provide important constraints on the mass and properties of theplanetesimal disk, and its dispersal during planet migration. here we tested apossibility that the trojans were captured during the early dynamicalinstability among the outer planets (aka the nice model), when the semimajoraxis of jupiter was changing as a result of scattering encounters with an icegiant. the capture occurs in this model when jupiter's orbit and its lagrangepoints become radially displaced in a scattering event and fall into a regionpopulated by planetesimals (that previously evolved from their nataltransplanetary disk to ~5 au during the instability). our numerical simulationsof the new capture model, hereafter jump capture, satisfactorily reproduce theorbital distribution of the trojans and their total mass. the jump capture ispotentially capable of explaining the observed asymmetry in the number ofleading and trailing trojans. we find that the capture probability is(6-8)x10^-7 for each particle in the original transplanetary disk, implyingthat the disk contained (3-4)x10^7 planetesimals with absolute magnitude h&lt;9(corresponding to diameter d=80 km for a 7% albedo). the disk mass inferredfrom this work, m_disk=14-28 m_earth, is consistent with the mass deduced fromrecent dynamical simulations of the planetary instability.

1303.6062	early dynamical instabilities in the giant planet systems	the observed wide eccentricity distribution of extrasolar giant planets isthought to be the result of dynamical instabilities and gravitationalscattering among planets. previously, it has been assumed that the orbits ingiant planet systems become gravitationally unstable after the gas nebuladispersal. it was not well understood, however, how these unstable conditionswere established in the first place.  in this work we numerically simulate the evolution of systems of threeplanets as the planets sequentially grow to jupiter's mass, and dynamicallyinteract among themselves and with the gas disk. we use the hydro-dynamicalcode fargo that we modified by implementing the $n$-body integrator symba. thenew code can handle close encounters and collisions between planets. to testtheir stability, the planetary systems were followed with symba for up to$10^8$ yr after the gas disk dispersal.  we find that dynamics of the growing planets is complex, because migrationand resonances raise their orbital eccentricities, and cause dynamicalinstabilities when gas is still around. if the dynamical instabilities occurearly, planets can be removed by collisions and ejections, and the systemrearranges into a new, more stable configuration. in this case, the planetarysystems emerging from the gas disks are expected to be stable, and would needto be destabilized by other means (low-mass planets, planetesimal disks, etc.).alternatively, for the giant planet system to be intrinsically unstable uponthe gas disk dispersal, a special timing would be required with the growth of(at least some of) the giant planets having to occur near the end of the gasdisk lifetime.

1305.6513	analytical treatment of planetary resonances	an ever-growing observational aggregate of extrasolar planets has revealedthat systems of planets that reside in or near mean-motion resonances arerelatively common. while the origin of such systems is attributed toprotoplanetary disk-driven migration, a qualitative description of thedynamical evolution of resonant planets remains largely elusive. aided by thepioneering works of the last century, we formulate an approximate, integrabletheory for first-order resonant motion. we utilize the developed theory toconstruct an intuitive, geometrical representation of resonances within thecontext of the unrestricted three-body problem. moreover, we derive a simpleanalytical criterion for the appearance of secondary resonances betweenresonant and secular motion. subsequently, we demonstrate the onset of rapidchaotic motion as a result of overlap among neighboring first-order mean-motionresonances, as well as the appearance of slow chaos as a result of secularmodulation of the planetary orbits. finally, we take advantage of theintegrable theory to analytically show that, in the adiabatic regime, divergentencounters with first-order mean-motion resonances always lead to persistentapsidal anti-alignment.

1312.1202	geochemical and planetary dynamical views on the origin of earth's  atmosphere and oceans	earth's volatile elements (h, c, and n) are essential to maintaininghabitable conditions for metazoans and simpler life forms. however, identifyingthe sources (comets, meteorites, and trapped nebular gas) that suppliedvolatiles to earth is not straightforward because secondary processes likemantle degassing, crustal recycling, and escape to space modified thecomposition of the atmosphere. here, we review two complementary approaches toinvestigate the origin of earth's atmosphere and oceans. the geochemicalapproach uses volatile element abundances and isotopic compositions to identifythe possible contributors to the atmosphere and to disentangle the processesthat shaped it. in that respect, noble gases (he, ne, ar, kr, and xe), elementsthat are chemically inert and possess several isotopes produced byradioactivity, play a critical role. the dynamical approach uses our knowledgeof planetary dynamics to track volatile delivery to the earth, starting withdust transport in the disk to planet-building processes. the main conclusion isthat earth acquired most of its major volatile elements by accretion ofplanetesimals or embryos akin to volatile-rich meteorites. at the same time,solar/meteoritic noble gases were captured by embryos and some gases were lostto space, by hydrodynamic escape and large impacts. comets did not contributemuch h, c, and n but may have delivered significant noble gases, which couldrepresent the only fingerprints of the bombardment of our planet with icybodies. the processes that governed the delivery of volatile elements to theearth are thought to be relatively common and it is likely that earth-likeplanets covered with oceans exist in extra-solar systems.

1401.1334	stellar irradiated discs and implications on migration of embedded  planets ii: accreting-discs	the strength and direction of migration of embedded low mass planets dependson the disc's structure. it has been shown that, in discs with viscous heatingand radiative transport, the migration can be directed outwards. in this paperwe investigate the influence of a constant dm/dt-flux through the disc, as wellas the influence of the disc's metallicity on the disc's thermodynamics. wefocus on dm/dt discs, which have a net mass flux through them. utilizing theresulting disc structure, we determine the regions of outward migration in thedisc. we perform numerical hydrosimulations of dm/dt discs with viscousheating, radiative cooling and stellar irradiation in 2d in the r-z-plane. weuse the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code fargoca that includes a fulltensor viscosity and stellar irradiation, as well as a two temperature solverthat includes radiation transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation.the migration of embedded planets is studied by using torque formulae. for adisc of gas surface density and viscosity, we find that the discs thermalstructure depends on the product sigma_g \nu and the amount of heavy elements,while the migration of planets additionally to the mentioned quantities,depends on the amount of viscosity itself. as a result of this, the discstructure can not be approximated by simple power laws. during the lifetime ofthe disc, the structure of the disc changes significantly in a non-linear wayin the inner parts. in the late stages of the discs evolution, outwardmigration is only possible if the metallicity of the disc is high. for lowmetallicity, planets would migrate inwards and could potentially be lost. thepresented disc structures and migration maps have important consequences on theformation of planets, as they can give hints on the different formationmechanisms for different types of planets as a function of metallicity.

1401.2157	the absolute magnitude distribution of kuiper belt objects	here we measure the absolute magnitude distributions (h-distribution) of thedynamically excited and quiescent (hot and cold) kuiper belt objects (kbos),and test if they share the same h-distribution as the jupiter trojans. from acompilation of all useable ecliptic surveys, we find that the kboh-distributions are well described by broken power-laws. the cold populationhas a bright-end slope, $\alpha_{\textrm{1}}=1.5_{-0.2}^{+0.4}$, and breakmagnitude, $h_{\textrm{b}}=6.9_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$ (r'-band). the hot population hasa shallower bright-end slope of, $\alpha_{\textrm{1}}=0.87_{-0.2}^{+0.07}$, andbreak magnitude $h_{\textrm{b}}=7.7_{-0.5}^{+1.0}$. both populations sharesimilar faint end slopes of $\alpha_2\sim0.2$. we estimate the masses of thehot and cold populations are $\sim0.01$ and $\sim3\times10^{-4} \mbox{m$_{\bigoplus}$}$. the broken power-law fit to the trojan h-distribution has$\alpha_\textrm{1}=1.0\pm0.2$, $\alpha_\textrm{2}=0.36\pm0.01$, and$h_{\textrm{b}}=8.3$. the ks test reveals that the probability that the trojansand cold kbos share the same parent h-distribution is less than 1 in 1000. whenthe bimodal albedo distribution of the hot objects is accounted for, there isno evidence that the h-distributions of the trojans and hot kbos differ. ourfindings are in agreement with the predictions of the nice model in terms ofboth mass and h-distribution of the hot and trojan populations. wide fieldsurvey data suggest that the brightest few hot objects, with$h_{\textrm{r'}}\lesssim3$, do not fall on the steep power-law slope of fainterhot objects. under the standard hierarchical model of planetesimal formation,it is difficult to account for the similar break diameters of the hot and coldpopulations given the low mass of the cold belt.

1404.4460	earth-like habitats in planetary systems	understanding the concept of habitability is related to an evolutionaryknowledge of the particular planet-in-question. additional indicationsso-called "systemic aspects" of the planetary system as a whole governs aparticular planet's claim on habitability. here we focus on such systemicaspects and discuss their relevance to the formation of an 'earth-like'habitable planet. we summarize our results obtained by lunar sample work andnumerical models within the framework of the research alliance "planetaryevolution and life". we consider various scenarios which simulate the dynamicalevolution of the solar system and discuss the likelihood of forming anearth-like world orbiting another star. our model approach is constrained byobservations of the modern solar system and the knowledge of its history.results suggest that the long-term presence of terrestrial planets isjeopardized due to gravitational interactions if giant planets are present. buthabitability of inner rocky planets may be supported in those planetary systemshosting giant planets.  gravitational interactions within a complex multiple-body structure includinggiant planets may supply terrestrial planets with materials which formed in thecolder region of the proto-planetary disk. during these processes, water, theprime requisite for habitability, is delivered to the inner system. this mayoccur either during the main accretion phase of terrestrial planets or viaimpacts during a post-accretion bombardment. results for both processes aresummarized and discussed with reference to the lunar crater record.  starting from a scenario involving migration of the giant planets thiscontribution discusses the delivery of water to earth, the modification ofatmospheres by impacts in a planetary system context and the likelihood of theexistence of extrasolar earth-like habitable worlds.

1406.2697	lunar and terrestrial planet formation in the grand tack scenario	we present conclusions from a large number of n-body simulations of the giantimpact phase of terrestrial planet formation. we focus on new results obtainedfrom the recently proposed grand tack model, which couples the gas-drivenmigration of giant planets to the accretion of the terrestrial planets. thegiant impact phase follows the oligarchic growth phase, which builds a bi-modalmass distribution within the disc of embryos and planetesimals. by varying theratio of the total mass in the embryo population to the total mass in theplanetesimal population and the mass of the individual embryos, we explore howdifferent disc conditions control the final planets. the total mass ratio ofembryos to planetesimals controls the timing of the last giant (moon forming)impact and its violence. the initial embryo mass sets the size of the lunarimpactor and the growth rate of mars. after comparing our simulated outcomeswith the actual orbits of the terrestrial planets (angular momentum deficit,mass concentration) and taking into account independent geochemical constraintson the mass accreted by the earth after the moon forming event and on thetimescale for the growth of mars, we conclude that the protoplanetary disc atthe beginning of the giant impact phase must have had most of its mass inmars-sized embryos and only a small fraction of the total disc mass in theplanetesimal population. from this, we infer that the moon forming eventoccurred between $\sim$60 and $\sim$130 my after the formation of the firstsolids, and was caused most likely by an object with a mass similar to that ofmars.

1407.3290	water delivery and giant impacts in the 'grand tack' scenario	a new model for terrestrial planet formation (hansen 2009, walsh et al. 2011)has explored accretion in a truncated protoplanetary disk, and found that sucha configuration is able to reproduce the distribution of mass among the planetsin the solar system, especially the earth/mars mass ratio, which earliersimulations have generally not been able to match. walsh et al. tested apossible mechanism to truncate the disk--a two-stage, inward-then-outwardmigration of jupiter and saturn, as found in numerous hydrodynamicalsimulations of giant planet formation. in addition to truncating the disk andproducing a more realistic earth/mars mass ratio, the migration of the giantplanets also populates the asteroid belt with two distinct populations ofbodies--the inner belt is filled by bodies originating inside of 3 au, and theouter belt is filled with bodies originating from between and beyond the giantplanets (which are hereafter referred to as `primitive' bodies).  we find here that the planets will accrete on order 1-2% of their total massfrom primitive planetesimals scattered onto planet-crossing orbits during theformation of the planets. for an assumed value of 10% for the water massfraction of the primitive planetesimals, this model delivers a total amount ofwater comparable to that estimated to be on the earth today. while the radialdistribution of the planetary masses and the dynamical excitation of theirorbits are a good match to the observed system, we find that the last giantimpact is typically earlier than 20 myr, and a substantial amount of mass isaccreted after that event. however, 5 of the 27 planets larger than half anearth mass formed in all simulations do experience large late impacts andsubsequent accretion consistent with the dating of the moon-forming impact andthe estimated amount of mass accreted by earth following that event.

1408.1016	stellar irradiated discs and implications on migration of embedded  planets iii: viscosity transitions	the migration strength and direction of embedded low-mass planets depends onthe disc structure. in discs with an efficient radiative transport, themigration can be directed outwards for planets with more than 3-5 earth masses.this is due to the entropy driven corotation torque, a process that extends thelifetimes of growing planetary embryos. we investigate the influence on thedisc structure caused by a jump in the alpha parameter of the viscosity tomodel a dead-zone structure in the disc. we focus on m-dot discs, which have aconstant net mass flux. using the resulting disc structure, we investigate theconsequences for the formation of planetesimals and determine the regions ofoutward migration for proto-planets. we performed numerical hydrosimulations ofm-dot discs in the r-z-plane. we used the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical codefargoca that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation as wellas a two-temperature solver that includes radiation transport in theflux-limited diffusion approximation. viscosity transitions inside the disccreate transitions in density that stop inward migration for small planetsthrough the so-called "planet trap" mechanism. this mechanism also works forplanets down to m_p &gt; 0.5m_e. additionally, the viscosity transitions changethe pressure gradient in the disc, which facilitates planetesimal formation viathe streaming instability. however, a very steep transition in viscosity isneeded to achieve in a pressure bump in the disc. the transition in viscosityfacilitates planetesimal formation and can stop the migration of small-massplanets (m_p&gt;0.5m_e), but still does not halt inward migration of smallerplanets and planetesimals that are affected by gas drag. a very steep, probablyunrealistic viscosity gradient is needed to trap planets of smaller masses andhalt gas-drag-driven planetesimal migration at a pressure bump.

1408.6087	separating gas-giant and ice-giant planets by halting pebble accretion	in the solar system giant planets come in two flavours: 'gas giants' (jupiterand saturn) with massive gas envelopes and 'ice giants' (uranus and neptune)with much thinner envelopes around their cores. it is poorly understood howthese two classes of planets formed. high solid accretion rates, necessary toform the cores of giant planets within the life-time of protoplanetary discs,heat the envelope and prevent rapid gas contraction onto the core, unlessaccretion is halted. we find that, in fact, accretion of pebbles (~ cm-sizedparticles) is self-limiting: when a core becomes massive enough it carves a gapin the pebble disc. this halt in pebble accretion subsequently triggers therapid collapse of the super-critical gas envelope. as opposed to gas giants,ice giants do not reach this threshold mass and can only bind low-massenvelopes that are highly enriched by water vapour from sublimated icy pebbles.this offers an explanation for the compositional difference between gas giantsand ice giants in the solar system. furthermore, as opposed toplanetesimal-driven accretion scenarios, our model allows core formation andenvelope attraction within disc life-times, provided that solids inprotoplanetary discs are predominantly in pebbles. our results imply that theouter regions of planetary systems, where the mass required to halt pebbleaccretion is large, are dominated by ice giants and that gas-giant exoplanetsin wide orbits are enriched by more than 50 earth masses of solids.

1409.6340	the grand tack model: a critical review	the `grand tack' model proposes that the inner solar system was sculpted bythe giant planets' orbital migration in the gaseous protoplanetary disk.jupiter first migrated inward then jupiter and saturn migrated back outwardtogether. if jupiter's turnaround or "tack" point was at ~1.5 au the inner diskof terrestrial building blocks would have been truncated at ~1 au, naturallyproducing the terrestrial planets' masses and spacing. during the gas giants'migration the asteroid belt is severely depleted but repopulated by distinctplanetesimal reservoirs that can be associated with the present-day s and ctypes. the giant planets' orbits are consistent with the later evolution of theouter solar system.  here we confront common criticisms of the grand tack model. we show that someuncertainties remain regarding the tack mechanism itself; the most criticalunknown is the timing and rate of gas accretion onto saturn and jupiter.current isotopic and compositional measurements of solar system bodies --including the d/h ratios of saturn's satellites -- do not refute the model. wediscuss how alternate models for the formation of the terrestrial planets eachsuffer from an internal inconsistency and/or place a strong and very specificrequirement on the properties of the protoplanetary disk.  we conclude that the grand tack model remains viable and consistent with ourcurrent understanding of planet formation. nonetheless, we encourage additionaltests of the grand tack as well as the construction of alternate models.

1410.0543	outward migration of jupiter and saturn in 3:2 or 2:1 resonance in  radiative disks: implications for the grand tack and nice models	embedded in the gaseous protoplanetary disk, jupiter and saturn naturallybecome trapped in 3:2 resonance and migrate outward. this serves as the basisof the grand tack model. however, previous hydrodynamical simulations wererestricted to isothermal disks, with moderate aspect ratio and viscosity. herewe simulate the orbital evolution of the gas giants in disks with viscousheating and radiative cooling. we find that jupiter and saturn migrate outwardin 3:2 resonance in modest-mass ($m_{disk} \approx m_{mmsn}$, where mmsn is the"minimum-mass solar nebula") disks with viscous stress parameter $\alpha$between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2} $. in disks with relatively low-mass ($m_{disk}\lesssim m_{mmsn}$) , jupiter and saturn get captured in 2:1 resonance and caneven migrate outward in low-viscosity disks ($\alpha \le 10^{-4}$). such diskshave a very small aspect ratio ($h\sim 0.02-0.03$) that favors outwardmigration after capture in 2:1 resonance, as confirmed by isothermal runs whichresulted in a similar outcome for $h \sim 0.02$ and $\alpha \le 10^{-4}$. wealso performed n-body runs of the outer solar system starting from the resultsof our hydrodynamical simulations and including 2-3 ice giants. after dispersalof the gaseous disk, a nice model instability starting with jupiter and saturnin 2:1 resonance results in good solar systems analogs. we conclude that in acold solar nebula, the 2:1 resonance between jupiter and saturn can lead tooutward migration of the system, and this may represent an alternative scenariofor the evolution of the solar system.

1410.3509	accretion and differentiation of the terrestrial planets with  implications for the compositions of early-formed solar system bodies and  accretion of water	in order to test planetary accretion and differentiation scenarios, weintegrated a multistage core-mantle differentiation model with n-body accretionsimulations. impacts between embryos and planetesimals result in magma oceanformation and episodes of core formation. the core formation model combinesrigorous chemical mass balance with metal-silicate element partitioning data.the primary constraint on the combined model is the composition of the earth'sprimitive mantle, the composition of the martian mantle, and the mass fractionsof the metallic cores of earth and mars. the model is refined by least squaresminimization with up to five fitting parameters that consist of themetal-silicate equilibrium pressure and 1-4 parameters that define the startingcompositions of primitive bodies. this integrated model has been applied to 6grand tack simulations. investigations of a broad parameter space indicatethat: accretion of earth was heterogeneous, metal-silicate equilibrationpressures increase as accretion progresses and are 60-70% of core-mantleboundary pressures at the time of each impact, and a large fraction (70-100%)of the metal of impactor cores equilibrates with a small fraction of thesilicate mantles of protoplanets during each core formation event. acceptablefits to the earth's mantle composition are obtained only when bodies thatoriginated close to the sun, at &lt;0.9-1.2 au, are highly reduced and thosebeyond this distance are increasingly oxidized. the feo content of the martianmantle depends critically on the heliocentric distance at which themars-forming embryo originated. finally, the earth's core is predicted tocontain 8-9 wt% silicon, 2-4 wt% oxygen and 10-60 ppm hydrogen, whereas themartian core is predicted to contain low concentrations (&lt;1 wt%) of si and o.

1411.3255	the structure of protoplanetary discs around evolving young stars	the formation of planets with gaseous envelopes takes place in protoplanetaryaccretion discs on time-scales of several millions of years. small dustparticles stick to each other to form pebbles, pebbles concentrate in theturbulent flow to form planetesimals and planetary embryos and grow to planets,which undergo substantial radial migration. all these processes are influencedby the underlying structure of the protoplanetary disc, specifically theprofiles of temperature, gas scale height and density. the commonly used discstructure of the minimum mass solar nebular (mmsn) is a simple power law in allthese quantities. however, protoplanetary disc models with both viscous andstellar heating show several bumps and dips in temperature, scale height anddensity caused by transitions in opacity, which are missing in the mmsn model.these play an important role in the formation of planets, as they can act assweet spots for the formation of planetesimals via the streaming instabilityand affect the direction and magnitude of type-i-migration. we present 2dsimulations of accretion discs that feature radiative cooling, viscous andstellar heating, and are linked to the observed evolutionary stages ofprotoplanetary discs and their host stars. these models allow us to identifypreferred planetesimal and planet formation regions in the protoplanetary discas a function of the disc's metallicity, accretion rate and lifetime. we derivesimple fitting formulae that feature all structural characteristics ofprotoplanetary discs during the evolution of several myr. these fits arestraightforward to apply for modelling any growth stage of planets wheredetailed knowledge of the underlying disc structure is required.

1411.5066	chaotic disintegration of the inner solar system	on timescales that greatly exceed an orbital period, typical planetary orbitsevolve in a stochastic yet stable fashion. on even longer timescales, however,planetary orbits can spontaneously transition from bounded to unbound chaoticstates. large-scale instabilities associated with such behavior appear to playa dominant role in shaping the architectures of planetary systems, includingour own. here we show how such transitions are possible, focusing on thespecific case of the long-term evolution of mercury. we develop a simpleanalytical model for mercury's dynamics and elucidate the origins of its shortterm stochastic behavior as well as of its sudden progression to unboundedchaos. our model allows us to estimate the timescale on which this transitionis likely to be triggered, i.e. the dynamical lifetime of the solar system aswe know it. the formulated theory is consistent with the results of numericalsimulations and is broadly applicable to extrasolar planetary systems dominatedby secular interactions. these results constitute a significant advancement inour understanding of the processes responsible for sculpting of the dynamicalstructures of generic planetary systems.

1501.06204	the dynamical evolution of the asteroid belt	the asteroid belt is the leftover of the original planetesimal population inthe inner solar system. however, currently the asteroids have orbits with allpossible values of eccentricities and inclinations compatible with long-termdynamical stability, whereas the initial planetesimal orbits should have beenquasi-circular and almost co-planar. the total mass in the asteroid populationis a small fraction of that existing primordially. also, asteroids withdifferent chemical/mineralogical properties are not ranked in an orderly mannerwith mean heliocentric distance as one could expect from the existence of aradial gradient of the temperature in the proto-planetary disk, but they arepartially mixed. these properties show that the asteroid belt has been severelysculpted by one or a series of processes during its lifetime. this paperreviews the processes that have been proposed so far, discussing the propertiesthat they explain and the problems that they are confronted with. emphasis ispaid to the interplay between the dynamical and the collisional evolution ofthe asteroid population, which allows the use of the size distribution toconstrain the dynamical models. we divide the asteroid belt evolution intothree phases. the first phase started during the lifetime of the gaseousproto-planetary disk, when the giant planets formed and presumably experiencedlarge-scale migrations, and continued after the removal of the gas, during thebuild-up of the terrestrial planets. the second phase occurred after theremoval of the gaseous proto-planetary disk and it became particularly livelyfor the asteroid belt when the giant planets suddenly changed their orbits, asa result of a mutual dynamical instability and the interaction with thetrans-neptunian planetesimal disk. the third phase covers the aftermath of thegiant planet instability, until today.

1504.01421	highly siderophile elements in the earth's mantle as a clock for the  moon-forming impact	according to the generally accepted scenario, the last giant impact on theearth formed the moon and initiated the final phase of core formation bymelting the earth's mantle. a key goal of geochemistry is to date this event,but different ages have been proposed. some argue for an early moon-formingevent, approximately 30 million years (myr) after the condensation of the firstsolids in the solar system, whereas others claim a date later than 50 myr (andpossibly as late as around 100 my) after condensation. here we show that amoon-forming event at 40 myr after condensation, or earlier, is ruled out at a99.9 per cent confidence level. we use a large number of n-body simulations todemonstrate a relationship between the time of the last giant impact on anearth-like planet and the amount of mass subsequently added during the eraknown as late accretion. as the last giant impact is delayed, the late-accretedmass decreases in a predictable fashion. this relationship exists within boththe classical scenario and the grand tack scenario of terrestrial planetformation, and it holds across a wide range of disk conditions. theconcentration of highly siderophile elements (hses) in earth's mantleconstrains the mass of chondritic material added to earth during lateaccretion. using hse abundance measurements, we determine a moon-formation ageof 95 +/- 32 myr since condensation. the possibility exists that some lateprojectiles were differentiated and left an incomplete hse record in earth'smantle. even in this case, various isotopic constraints strongly suggest thatthe late-accreted mass did not exceed 1 per cent of earth's mass, and so thehse clock still robustly limits the timing of the moon-forming event tosignificantly later than 40 my after condensation.

1504.03237	a reassessment of the in situ formation of close-in super-earths	a large fraction of stars host one or multiple close-in super-earth planets.there is an active debate about whether these planets formed in situ or atgreater distances from the central star and migrated to their current position.it has been shown that part of their observed properties (e.g., eccentricitydistribution) can be reproduced by n-body simulations of in situ formationstarting with a population of protoplanets of high masses and neglecting theeffects of the disk gas. we plan to reassess the in situ formation of close-insuper-earths through more complete simulations. we performed n-body simulationsof a population of small planetary embryos and planetesimals that include theeffects of disk-planet interactions (e.g., eccentricity damping, type imigration). in addition, we also consider the accretion of a primitiveatmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. we find that planetary embryos grow veryquickly well before the gas dispersal, and thus undergo rapid inward migration,which means that one cannot neglect the effects of a gas disk when consideringthe in-situ formation of close-in super-earths. owing to their rapid inwardmigration, super-earths reach a compact configuration near the disk's inneredge whose distribution of orbital parameters matches the observed close-insuper-earths population poorly. on the other hand, simulations includingeccentricity damping, but no type i migration, reproduce the observeddistributions better. including the accretion of an atmosphere does not helpreproduce the bulk architecture of observations. interestingly, we find thatthe massive embryos can migrate inside the disk edge while capturing only amoderately massive hydrogen/helium atmosphere. by this process they avoidbecoming giant planets. the bulk of close-in super-earths cannot form in situ,unless type i migration is suppressed in the entire disk inside 1 au.

1504.04512	comets as collisional fragments of a primordial planetesimal disk	the rosetta mission and its exquisite measurements have revived the debate onwhether comets are pristine planetesimals or collisionally evolved objects. weinvestigate the collisional evolution experienced by the precursors of currentcomet nuclei during the early stages of the solar system, in the context of theso-called "nice model". we consider two environments for the collisionalevolution: (1) the trans-planetary planetesimal disk, from the time of gasremoval until the disk was dispersed by the migration of the ice giants, and(2) the dispersing disk during the time that the scattered disk was formed.simulations have been performed, using different methods in the two cases, tofind the number of destructive collisions typically experienced by a cometnucleus of 2km radius. in the widely accepted scenario, where the dispersal ofthe planetesimal disk occurred at the time of the late heavy bombardment about4gy ago, comet-sized planetesimals have a very small chance to survive againstdestructive collisions in the disk. on the extreme assumption that the disk wasdispersed directly upon gas removal, there is a chance for a significantfraction of the planetesimals to remain intact. however, these survivors wouldstill bear the marks of many non-destructive impacts. thus, the nice model ofsolar system evolution predicts that typical km-sized comet nuclei arepredominantly fragments resulting from collisions experienced by larger parentbodies. an important goal for further research is to investigate, whether theobserved properties of comet nuclei are compatible with such a collisionalorigin.

1505.02941	new paradigms for asteroid formation	asteroids and meteorites provide key evidence on the formation ofplanetesimals in the solar system. asteroids are traditionally thought to formin a bottom-up process by coagulation within a population of initially km-scaleplanetesimals. however, new models challenge this idea by demonstrating thatasteroids of sizes from 100 to 1000 km can form directly from the gravitationalcollapse of small particles which have organised themselves in dense filamentsand clusters in the turbulent gas. particles concentrate passively betweeneddies down to the smallest scales of the turbulent gas flow and insidelarge-scale pressure bumps and vortices. the streaming instability causesparticles to take an active role in the concentration, by piling up in densefilaments whose friction on the gas reduces the radial drift compared to thatof isolated particles. in this chapter we review new paradigms for asteroidformation and compare critically against the observed properties of asteroidsas well as constraints from meteorites. chondrules of typical sizes from 0.1 to1 mm are ubiquitous in primitive meteorites and likely represent the primarybuilding blocks of asteroids. chondrule-sized particles are neverthelesstightly coupled to the gas via friction and are therefore hard to concentratein large amounts in the turbulent gas. we review recent progress onunderstanding the incorporation of chondrules into the asteroids, includinglayered accretion models where chondrules are accreted onto asteroids overmillions of years. we highlight in the end ten unsolved questions in asteroidformation where we expect that progress will be made over the next decade.

1506.01658	the complex history of trojan asteroids	the trojan asteroids provide a unique perspective on the history of solarsystem. as a large population of small bodies, they record importantgravitational interactions and dynamical evolution of the solar system. in thepast decade, significant advances have been made in understanding physicalproperties, and there has been a revolution in thinking about the origin oftrojans. the ice and organics generally presumed to be a significant part oftrojan compositions have yet to be detected directly, though low density of thebinary system patroclus (and possibly low density of the binary/moonlet systemhektor) is consistent with an interior ice component. by contrast, fine-grainedsilicates that appear to be similar to cometary silicates in composition havebeen detected, and a color bimodality may indicate distinct compositionalgroups among the trojans. whereas trojans had traditionally been thought tohave formed near 5 au, a new paradigm has developed in which the trojans formedin the proto-kuiper belt, and they were scattered inward and captured in thetrojan swarms as a result of resonant interactions of the giant planets.whereas the orbital and population distributions of current trojans areconsistent with this origin scenario, there are significant differences betweencurrent physical properties of trojans and those of kuiper belt objects. thesedifferences may be indicative of surface modification due to the inwardmigration of objects that became the trojans, but understanding of appropriatemodification mechanisms is poor and would benefit from additional laboratorystudies. many open questions remain, and the future promises significantstrides in our understanding of trojans. the time is ripe for a spacecraftmission to the trojans, to turn these objects into geologic worlds that can bestudied in detail to unravel their complex history.

1506.03029	accretion of uranus and neptune from inward-migrating planetary embryos  blocked by jupiter and saturn	reproducing uranus and neptune remains a challenge for simulations of solarsystem formation. the ice giants' peculiar obliquities suggest that they bothsuffered giant collisions during their formation. thus, there must have been anepoch of accretion dominated by collisions among large planetary embryos in theprimordial outer solar system. we test this idea using n-body numericalsimulations including the effects of a gaseous protoplanetary disk. one strongconstraint is that the masses of the ice giants are very similar -- theneptune/uranus mass ratio is $\sim1.18$. we show that similar-size ice giantsdo indeed form by collisions between planetary embryos beyond saturn. thefraction of successful simulations varies depending on the initial number ofplanetary embryos in the system, their individual and total masses.similar-sized ice giants are consistently reproduced in simulations startingwith 5-10 planetary embryos with initial masses of $\sim$3-6 ${\rm m_\oplus}$.we conclude that accretion from a population of planetary embryos is aplausible scenario for the origin of uranus and neptune.

1508.00616	spin-spin coupling in the solar system	the richness of dynamical behavior exhibited by the rotational states ofvarious solar system objects has driven significant advances in the theoreticalunderstanding of their evolutionary histories. an important factor thatdetermines whether a given object is prone to exhibiting non-trivial rotationalevolution is the extent to which such an object can maintain a permanentaspheroidal shape, meaning that exotic behavior is far more common among thesmall body populations of the solar system. gravitationally bound binaryobjects constitute a substantial fraction of asteroidal and tno populations,comprising systems of triaxial satellites that orbit permanently deformedcentral bodies. in this work, we explore the rotational evolution of suchsystems with specific emphasis on quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, and showthat for closely orbiting, highly deformed objects, both prograde andretrograde spin-spin resonances naturally arise. subsequently, we derivecapture probabilities for leading order commensurabilities and apply ourresults to the illustrative examples of (87) sylvia and (216) kleopatraasteroid systems. cumulatively, our results suggest that spin-spin coupling maybe consequential for highly elongated, tightly orbiting binary objects.

1508.01365	terrestrial planet formation constrained by mars and the structure of  the asteroid belt	reproducing the large earth/mars mass ratio requires a strong mass depletionin solids within the protoplanetary disk between 1 and 3 au. the grand tackmodel invokes a specific migration history of the giant planets to remove mostof the mass initially beyond 1 au and to dynamically excite the asteroid belt.however, one could also invoke a steep density gradient created by inward driftand pile-up of small particles induced by gas-drag, as has been proposed toexplain the formation of close-in super earths. here we show that the asteroidbelt's orbital excitation provides a crucial constraint against this scenariofor the solar system. we performed a series of simulations of terrestrialplanet formation and asteroid belt evolution starting from disks ofplanetesimals and planetary embryos with various radial density gradients andincluding jupiter and saturn on nearly circular and coplanar orbits. disks withshallow density gradients reproduce the dynamical excitation of the asteroidbelt by gravitational self-stirring but form mars analogs significantly moremassive than the real planet. in contrast, a disk with a surface densitygradient proportional to $r^{-5.5}$ reproduces the earth/mars mass ratio butleaves the asteroid belt in a dynamical state that is far colder than the realbelt. we conclude that no disk profile can simultaneously explain the structureof the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt. the asteroid belt must have beendepleted and dynamically excited by a different mechanism such as, forinstance, in the grand tack scenario.

1510.06010	suppression of type i migration by disk winds	planets less massive than saturn tend to rapidly migrate inward inprotoplanetary disks. this is the so-called type i migration. simulationsattempting to reproduce the observed properties of exoplanets show that type imigration needs to be significantly reduced over a wide region of the disk fora long time. however, the mechanism capable of suppressing type i migrationover a wide region has remained elusive. the recently found turbulence-drivendisk winds offer new possibilities. we investigate the effects of disk winds onthe disk profile and type i migration for a range of parameters that describethe strength of disk winds. we also examine the in situ formation of close-insuper-earths in disks that evolve through disk winds. the disk profile, whichis regulated by viscous diffusion and disk winds, was derived by solving thediffusion equation. we carried out a number of simulations and plot heremigration maps that indicate the type i migration rate. we also performedn-body simulations of the formation of close-in super-earths from a populationof planetesimals and planetary embryos. we define a key parameter, kw, whichdetermines the ratio of strengths between the viscous diffusion and disk winds.for a wide range of kw, the type i migration rate is presented in migrationmaps. these maps show that type i migration is suppressed over the wholeclose-in region when the effects of disk winds are relatively strong (kw &lt;100). from the results of n-body simulations, we see that type i migration issignificantly slowed down assuming kw = 40. we also show that the results ofn-body simulations match statistical orbital distributions of close-insuper-earths.

0807.1761	accretion and destruction of planetesimals in turbulent disks	we study the conditions for collisions between planetesimals to beaccretional or disruptive in turbulent disks, through analytical argumentsbased on fluid dynamical simulations and orbital integrations. in turbulentdisks, the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is pumped up by randomgravitational perturbations from density fluctuations of the disk gas. when thevelocity dispersion is larger than the planetesimals' surface escape velocity,collisions between planetesimals do not result in accretion, and may even leadto their destruction. in disks with a surface density equal to that of the``minimum mass solar nebula'' and with nominal mri turbulence, we find thataccretion proceeds only for planetesimals with sizes above $\sim 300$ km at 1auand $\sim 1000$ km at 5au. we find that accretion is facilitated in disks withsmaller masses. however, at 5au and for nominal turbulence strength, km-sizedplanetesimals are in a highly erosive regime even for a disk mass as small as afraction of the mass of jupiter. the existence of giant planets implies thateither turbulence was weaker than calculated by standard mri models or somemechanism was capable of producing ceres-mass planetesimals in very shorttimescales. in any case, our results show that in the presence of turbulenceplanetesimal accretion is most difficult in massive disks and at large orbitaldistances.

astro-ph;0603106	the size-frequency distribution of dormant jupiter family comets	we estimate the total number and the slope of the size frequency distribution(sfd) of dormant jupiter family comets (jfcs) by fitting a one-parameter modelto the known population. we first select 61 near earth objects (neos) that arelikely to be dormant jfcs because their orbits are dynamically coupled tojupiter (bottke et al, 2002). then, from the numerical simulations of levison &amp;duncan (1997), we construct an orbit distribution model for jfcs in the neoorbital element space. we assume an orbit independent sfd for all jfcs, theslope of which is our unique free parameter. finally, we compute observationalbiases for dormant jfcs using a calibrated neo survey simulator (jedicke et al.2003). by fitting the biased model to the data, we estimate that there are ~75dormant jfcs with h&lt;18 in the neo region and that the slope of their cumulativesfd is -1.5 +/- 0.3. our slope for the sfd of dormant jfcs is very close tothat of active jfcs as determined by weissman and lowry (2003). thus, we arguethat when jfcs fade they are likely to become dormant rather than to disruptand that the fate of faded comets is size independent. our results imply thatthe size distribution of the jfc progenitors - the scattered disktrans-neptunian population - either (i) has a similar and shallow sfd or (i')is slightly steeper and physical processes acting on the comets in asize-dependent manner creates the shallower active comet sfd. our measuredslope, typical of collisionally evolved populations with a size dependentimpact strength (benz and asphaug 1999), suggests that scattered disk bodiesreached collisional equilibrium inside the proto-planetary disk prior to theirremoval from the planetary region.

astro-ph;0612619	accretion of terrestrial planets from oligarchs in a turbulent disk	we have investigated the final accretion stage of terrestrial planets frommars-mass protoplanets that formed through oligarchic growth in a diskcomparable to the minimum mass solar nebula (mmsn), through n-body simulationincluding random torques exerted by disk turbulence due tomagneto-rotational-instability. for the torques, we used the semi-analyticalformula developed by laughlin et al.(2004). the damping of orbitaleccentricities (in all runs) and type-i migration (in some runs) due to thetidal interactions with disk gas are also included. we found that the orbitaleccentricities pumped up by the turbulent torques and associated random walksin semimajor axes tend to delay isolation of planets, resulting in morecoagulation of planets than in the case without turbulence. the eccentricitiesare still damped after planets become isolated. as a result, the number offinal planets decreases with increase in strength of the turbulence, whileearth-mass planets with small eccentricities are still formed. in the case ofrelatively strong turbulence, the number of final planets are 4-5 at 0.5-2au,which is consistent with solar system, for relatively wide range of disksurface density (~10^{-4}-10^{-2} times mmsn).

astro-ph;0701544	models of the collisional damping scenario for ice giant planets and  kuiper belt formatio	chiang et al. 2006, hereafter c06 have recently proposed that the observedstructure of the kuiper belt could be the result of a dynamical instability ofa system of ~5 primordial ice giant planets in the outer solar system.according to this scenario, before the instability occurred, these giants weregrowing in a highly collisionally damped environment according to the argumentsin goldreich et al. (2004a,b, hereafter g04). here we test this hypothesis witha series of numerical simulations using a new code designed to incorporate thedynamical effects of collisions. we find that we cannot reproduce the observedsolar system. in particular, g04 and c06 argue that during the instability, allbut two of the ice giants would be ejected from the solar system by jupiter andsaturn, leaving uranus and neptune behind. we find that ejections are actuallyrare and that instead the systems spread outward. this always leads to aconfiguration with too many planets that are too far from the sun. thus, weconclude that both g04's scheme for the formation of uranus and neptune andc06's kuiper belt formation scenario are not viable in their current forms.

0809.5073	did saturn's rings form during the late heavy bombardment ?	the origin of saturn\' s massive ring system is still unknown. two popularscenarios - the tidal splitting of passing comets and the collisionaldestruction of a satellite - rely on a high cometary flux in the past. in thepresent paper we attempt to quantify the cometary flux during the late heavybombardment (lhb) to assess the likelihood of both scenarios. our analysisrelies on the so-called nice model of the origin of the lhb (tsiganis et al.,2005; morbidelli et al., 2005; gomes et al., 2005) and on the size distributionof the primordial trans-neptunian planetesimals constrained in charnoz &amp;morbidelli (2007). we find that the cometary flux on saturn during the lhb wasso high that both scenarios for the formation of saturn rings are viable inprinciple. however, a more detailed study shows that the comet tidal disruptionscenario implies that all four giant planets should have comparable ringsystems whereas the destroyed satellite scenario would work only for saturn,and perhaps jupiter. this is because in saturn\'s system, the synchronous orbitis interior to the roche limit, which is a necessary condition for maintaininga satellite in the roche zone up to the time of the lhb. we also discuss theapparent elimination of silicates from the ring parent body implied by thepurity of the ice in saturn \' s rings. the lhb has also strong implicationsfor the survival of the saturnian satellites: all satellites smaller than mimaswould have been destroyed during the lhb, whereas enceladus would have had from40% to 70% chance of survival depending on the disruption model. in conclusion,these results suggest that the lhb is the sweet moment for the formation of amassive ring system around saturn.
