0903.5363	building large area czt imaging detectors for a wide-field hard x-ray  telescope - protoexist1	we have constructed a moderately large area (32 cm2), fine pixel (2.5 mmpixel, 5 mm thick) czt imaging detector which constitutes the first section ofa detector module (256 cm2) developed for a balloon-borne wide-field hard x-raytelescope, protoexist1. protoexist1 is a prototype for the high energytelescope (het) in the energetic x-ray imaging survey telescope (exist), a nextgeneration space-borne multi-wavelength telescope. we have constructed a large(nearly gapless) detector plane through a modularization scheme by tiling of alarge number of 2 cm x 2 cm czt crystals. our innovative packaging method isideal for many applications such as coded-aperture imaging, where a large,continuous detector plane is desirable for the optimal performance. currentlywe have been able to achieve an energy resolution of 3.2 kev (fwhm) at 59.6 kevon average, which is exceptional considering the moderate pixel size and thenumber of detectors in simultaneous operation. we expect to complete twomodules (512 cm2) within the next few months as more czt becomes available. weplan to test the performance of these detectors in a near space environment ina series of high altitude balloon flights, the first of which is scheduled forfall 2009. these detector modules are the first in a series of progressivelymore sophisticated detector units and packaging schemes planned for protoexist2&amp; 3, which will demonstrate the technology required for the advanced cztimaging detectors (0.6 mm pixel, 4.5 m2 area) required in exist/het.

0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

1208.1228	two millisecond pulsars discovered by the palfa survey and a shapiro  delay measurement	we present two millisecond pulsar discoveries from the palfa survey of thegalactic plane with the arecibo telescope. psr j1955+2527 is an isolated pulsarwith a period of 4.87 ms, and psr j1949+3106 has a period of 13.14 ms and is ina 1.9-day binary system with a massive companion. their timing solutions, basedon 4 years of timing measurements with the arecibo, green bank, nan\c{c}ay andjodrell bank telescopes, allow precise determination of spin and astrometricparameters, including precise determinations of their proper motions. for psrj1949+3106, we can clearly detect the shapiro delay. from this we measure thepulsar mass to be 1.47(+0.43/-0.31) solar masses, the companion mass to be0.85(+0.14/-0.11) solar masses and the orbital inclination to be i =79.9(+1.6/-1.9) degrees, where uncertainties correspond to +/- 1-\sigma\confidence levels. with continued timing, we expect to also be able to detectthe advance of periastron for the j1949+3106 system. this effect, combined withthe shapiro delay, will eventually provide very precise mass measurements forthis system and a test of general relativity.

1208.1273	four highly dispersed millisecond pulsars discovered in the arecibo  palfa galactic plane survey	we present the discovery and phase-coherent timing of four highly dispersedmillisecond pulsars (msps) from the arecibo palfa galactic plane survey: psrsj1844+0115, j1850+0124, j1900+0308, and j1944+2236. three of the four pulsarsare in binary systems with low-mass companions, which are most likely whitedwarfs, and which have orbital periods on the order of days. the fourth pulsaris isolated. all four pulsars have large dispersion measures (dm &gt; 100 pccm-3), are distant (&gt; 3.4 kpc), faint at 1.4 ghz (&lt; 0.2 mjy), and are fullyrecycled (with spin periods p between 3.5 and 4.9 ms). the three binaries alsohave very small orbital eccentricities, as expected for tidally circularized,fully recycled systems with low-mass companions. these four pulsars have dm/pratios that are among the highest values for field msps in the galaxy. thesediscoveries bring the total number of confirmed msps from the palfa survey tofifteen. the discovery of these msps illustrates the power of palfa for findingweak, distant msps at low-galactic latitudes. this is important for accurateestimates of the galactic msp population and for the number of msps that thesquare kilometer array can be expected to detect.

1210.8003	the palfa survey: going to great depths to find radio pulsars	the on-going palfa survey is searching the galactic plane (|b| &lt; 5 deg., 32 &lt;l &lt; 77 deg. and 168 &lt; l &lt; 214 deg.) for radio pulsars at 1.4 ghz using alfa,the 7-beam receiver installed at the arecibo observatory. by the end of august2012, the palfa survey has discovered 100 pulsars, including 17 millisecondpulsars (p &lt; 30 ms). many of these discoveries are among the pulsars with thelargest dm/p ratios, proving that the palfa survey is capable of probing thegalactic plane for millisecond pulsars to a much greater depth than anyprevious survey. this is due to the survey's high sensitivity, relatively highobserving frequency, and its high time and frequency resolution. recently therate of discoveries has increased, due to a new more sensitive spectrometer,two updated complementary search pipelines, the development of onlinecollaborative tools, and access to new computing resources. looking forward,focus has shifted to the application of artificial intelligence systems toidentify pulsar-like candidates, and the development of an improvedfull-resolution pipeline incorporating more sophisticated radio interferencerejection. the new pipeline will be used in a complete second analysis of dataalready taken, and will be applied to future survey observations. an overviewof recent developments, and highlights of exciting discoveries will bepresented.

1211.3782	moa-2010-blg-073l: an m-dwarf with a substellar companion at the  planet/brown dwarf boundary	we present an analysis of the anomalous microlensing event, moa-2010-blg-073,announced by the microlensing observations in astrophysics survey on2010-03-18.  this event was remarkable because the source was previously known to bephotometrically variable. analyzing the pre-event source lightcurve, wedemonstrate that it is an irregular variable over time scales &gt;200d. itsdereddened color, $(v-i)_{s,0}$, is 1.221$\pm$0.051mag and from our lens modelwe derive a source radius of 14.7$\pm$1.3 $r_{\odot}$, suggesting that it is ared giant star.  we initially explored a number of purely microlensing models for the eventbut found a residual gradient in the data taken prior to and after the event.this is likely to be due to the variability of the source rather than part ofthe lensing event, so we incorporated a slope parameter in our model in orderto derive the true parameters of the lensing system.  we find that the lensing system has a mass ratio of q=0.0654$\pm$0.0006. theeinstein crossing time of the event, $t_{\rm{e}}=44.3$\pm$0.1d, wassufficiently long that the lightcurve exhibited parallax effects. in addition,the source trajectory relative to the large caustic structure allowed theorbital motion of the lens system to be detected. combining the parallax withthe einstein radius, we were able to derive the distance to the lens,$d_l$=2.8$\pm$0.4kpc, and the masses of the lensing objects. the primary of thelens is an m-dwarf with $m_{l,p}$=0.16$\pm0.03m_{\odot}$ while the companionhas $m_{l,s}$=11.0$\pm2.0m_{\rm{j}}$ putting it in the boundary zone betweenplanets and brown dwarfs.

1302.0467	einstein@home discovery of 24 pulsars in the parkes multi-beam pulsar  survey	we have conducted a new search for radio pulsars in compact binary systems inthe parkes multi-beam pulsar survey (pmps) data, employing novel methods toremove the doppler modulation from binary motion. this has yielded unparalleledsensitivity to pulsars in compact binaries. the required computation time ofapproximately 17000 cpu core years was provided by the distributed volunteercomputing project einstein@home, which has a sustained computing power of about1 pflop/s. we discovered 24 new pulsars in our search, of which 18 wereisolated pulsars, and six were members of binary systems. despite the widefilterbank channels and relatively slow sampling time of the pmps data, wefound pulsars with very large ratios of dispersion measure (dm) to spin period.among those is psr j1748-3009, the millisecond pulsar with the highest known dm(approximately 420 pc/cc). we also discovered psr j1840-0643, which is in abinary system with an orbital period of 937 days, the fourth largest known. thenew pulsar j1750-2536 likely belongs to the rare class of intermediate-massbinary pulsars. three of the isolated pulsars show long-term nulling orintermittency in their emission, further increasing this growing family. ourdiscoveries demonstrate the value of distributed volunteer computing fordata-driven astronomy and the importance of applying new analysis methods toextensively searched data.

1304.1775	parameter estimation for compact binary coalescence signals with the  first generation gravitational-wave detector network	compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the mostpromising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. gravitationalradiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameterestimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detectioncandidate events. detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inferenceon several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location anddistance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.however, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of modelsdescribing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals addedeither in hardware or software to the data collected by the two ligoinstruments and the virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed tothe collaboration. we exemplify the ability to extract information about thesource physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameterspace over the individual mass range 1 msun - 25 msun and the full range ofspin parameters. the cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of thestatus of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanceddetectors.

1305.0447	peace: pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction -- a  software package for post-analysis processing of pulsar survey candidates	modern radio pulsar surveys produce a large volume of prospective candidates,the majority of which are polluted by human-created radio frequencyinterference or other forms of noise. typically, large numbers of candidatesneed to be visually inspected in order to determine if they are real pulsars.this process can be labor intensive. in this paper, we introduce an algorithmcalled peace (pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction) whichimproves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. the algorithm ranks thecandidates based on a score function. unlike popular machine-learning basedalgorithms, no prior training data sets are required. this algorithm has beenapplied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. using thehuman-based ranking results generated by students in the arecibo remote commandenter programme, the statistical performance of peace was evaluated. it wasfound that peace ranked 68% of the student-identified pulsars within the top0.17% of sorted candidates, 95% within the top 0.34%, and 100% within the top3.7%. this clearly demonstrates that peace significantly increases the pulsaridentification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. to date, peace has beendirectly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which aremillisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing basedgravitational-wave detection projects.

1307.2146	x-ray observations of disrupted recycled pulsars: no refuge for orphaned  central compact objects	we present a chandra x-ray survey of the disrupted recycled pulsars (drps),isolated radio pulsars with p &gt; 20 ms and b_s &lt; 3e10 g. these observations weremotivated as a search for the immediate descendants of the approx. 10 centralcompact objects (ccos) in supernova remnants, three of which have similartiming and magnetic properties as the drps, but are bright, thermal x-raysources consistent with minimal neutron star cooling curves. since none of thedprs were detected, there is no evidence that they are "orphaned" ccos, neutronstars whose supernova remnants has dissipated. upper limits on their thermalx-ray luminosities are in the range log lx[erg/s] = 31.8-32.8, which impliescooling ages &gt; 1e4 - 1e5 yr, roughly 10 times the ages of the approximately 10known ccos in a similar volume of the galaxy. the order of a hundred ccodescendants that could be detected by this method are thus either intrinsicallyradio quiet, or occupy a different region of (p,b_s) parameter space from thedrps. this motivates a new x-ray search for orphaned ccos among radio pulsarswith larger b-fields, which could verify the theory that their fields areburied by fall-back of supernova ejecta, but quickly regrow to join the normalpulsar population.

1309.0776	searching for pulsars using image pattern recognition	in this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (ai) program thatidentifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition withdeep neural nets---the pics (pulsar image-based classification system) ai. theai mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferencesby looking for patterns from candidate. the information from each pulsarcandidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up tothousands pixel of image data. the ai takes these data from each candidate asits input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,the pics ai teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a setof human-labeled candidates through machine learning. the deep neural networksin this ai system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types ofpulsars as well as their harmonic signals. the trained ai's performance hasbeen validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.in this completely independent test, pics ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-relatedcandidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. the first non-pulsarcandidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. in otherwords, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. the performance of thissystem can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. this aisystem has been integrated into the palfa survey pipeline and has discoveredsix new pulsars to date.

1310.5857	timing of a young mildly recycled pulsar with a massive white dwarf  companion	we report on timing observations of the recently discovered binary pulsar psrj1952+2630 using the arecibo observatory. the mildly recycled 20.7-ms pulsar isin a 9.4-hr orbit with a massive, m_wd &gt; 0.93 m_sun, white dwarf (wd)companion. we present, for the first time, a phase-coherent timing solution,with precise spin, astrometric, and keplerian orbital parameters. this showsthat the characteristic age of psr j1952+2630 is 77 myr, younger by one orderof magnitude than any other recycled pulsar-massive wd system. we derive anupper limit on the true age of the system of 50 myr. we investigate theformation of psr j1952+2630 using detailed modelling of the mass-transferprocess from a naked helium star on to the neutron star following acommon-envelope phase (case bb roche-lobe overflow). from our modelling of theprogenitor system, we constrain the accretion efficiency of the neutron star,which suggests a value between 100 and 300% of the eddington accretion limit.we present numerical models of the chemical structure of a possibleoxygen-neon-magnesium wd companion. furthermore, we calculate the past and thefuture spin evolution of psr j1952+2630, until the system merges in about 3.4gyr due to gravitational wave emission. although we detect no relativisticeffects in our timing analysis we show that several such effects will becomemeasurable with continued observations over the next 10 years; thus psrj1952+2630 has potential as a testbed for gravitational theories.

1404.2199	search for gravitational radiation from intermediate mass black hole  binaries in data from the second ligo-virgo joint science run	this paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational wavesfrom merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (imbhb). the search wasperformed on data from the second joint science run of the ligo and virgodetectors (july 2009 - october 2010) and was sensitive to imbhbs with a rangeup to $\sim 200$ mpc, averaged over the possible sky positions and inclinationsof the binaries with respect to the line of sight. no significant candidate wasfound. upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning imbhbs withtotal masses between 100 and $450 \ \mbox{m}_{\odot}$ and mass ratios between$0.25$ and $1\,$ were placed by combining this analysis with an analogoussearch performed on data from the first ligo-virgo joint science run (november2005 - october 2007). the most stringent limit was set for systems consistingof two $88 \ \mbox{m}_{\odot}$ black holes and is equal to $0.12 \\mbox{mpc}^{-3} \ \mbox{myr}^{-1}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level. this paperalso presents the first estimate, for the case of an unmodeled analysis, of theimpact on the search range of imbhb spin configurations: the visible volume forimbhbs with nonspinning components is roughly doubled for a population ofimbhbs with spins aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum anduniformly distributed in the dimensionless spin parameter up to 0.8, whereas ananalogous population with antialigned spins decreases the visible volume by$\sim 20\%\,$.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1405.7904	first all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from unknown  sources in binary systems	we present the first results of an all-sky search for continuousgravitational waves from unknown spinning neutron stars in binary systems usingligo and virgo data. using a specially developed analysis program, the twospectalgorithm, the search was carried out on data from the sixth ligo science runand the second and third virgo science runs. the search covers a range offrequencies from 20 hz to 520 hz, a range of orbital periods from 2 to ~2,254 hand a frequency- and period-dependent range of frequency modulation depths from0.277 to 100 mhz. this corresponds to a range of projected semi-major axes ofthe orbit from ~0.6e-3 ls to ~6,500 ls assuming the orbit of the binary iscircular. while no plausible candidate gravitational wave events survive thepipeline, upper limits are set on the analyzed data. the most sensitive 95%confidence upper limit obtained on gravitational wave strain is 2.3e-24 at 217hz, assuming the source waves are circularly polarized. although this searchhas been optimized for circular binary orbits, the upper limits obtained remainvalid for orbital eccentricities as large as 0.9. in addition, upper limits areplaced on continuous gravitational wave emission from the low-mass x-ray binaryscorpius x-1 between 20 hz and 57.25 hz.

1405.7953	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iii. precursor survey and population  synthesis	the pulsar arecibo l-band feed array (palfa) survey uses the alfa 7-beamreceiver to search both inner and outer galactic sectors visible from arecibo($32^{\circ}\lesssim \ell \lesssim 77^{\circ}$ and $168^{\circ}\lesssim \ell  \lesssim 214^{\circ}$) close to the galactic plane ($|b|\lesssim5^{\circ}$)for pulsars. in this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region withpalfa, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in$\ell$ and $|b|\lesssim1^{\circ}$) and detected 45 pulsars. for both galacticmillisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detectionswith simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate thenumber of observable pulsars in the galaxy. we place 95\% confidence intervalsof 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9,000 to100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk.these are consistent with previous estimates. given the most likely populationsize in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars,respectively) we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, whencomplete, the full palfa survey should have detected $1,000\substack{+330 \\-230}$ normal pulsars and $30\substack{+200 \\ -20}$ millisecond pulsars.identical estimation techniques predict that $490\substack{+160 \\ -115}$normal pulsars and $12\substack{+70 \\ -5}$ millisecond pulsars would bedetected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the palfa survey had detected283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively.

1406.4556	improved upper limits on the stochastic gravitational-wave background  from 2009-2010 ligo and virgo data	gravitational waves from a variety of sources are predicted to superpose tocreate a stochastic background. this background is expected to contain uniqueinformation from throughout the history of the universe that is unavailablethrough standard electromagnetic observations, making its study of fundamentalimportance to understanding the evolution of the universe. we carry out asearch for the stochastic background with the latest data from ligo and virgo.consistent with predictions from most stochastic gravitational-wave backgroundmodels, the data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal.assuming a gravitational-wave spectrum ofomega_gw(f)=omega_alpha*(f/f_ref)^alpha, we place 95% confidence level upperlimits on the energy density of the background in each of four frequency bandsspanning 41.5-1726 hz. in the frequency band of 41.5-169.25 hz for a spectralindex of alpha=0, we constrain the energy density of the stochastic backgroundto be omega_gw(f)&lt;5.6x10^-6. for the 600-1000 hz band, omega_gw(f)&lt;0.14*(f/900hz)^3, a factor of 2.5 lower than the best previously reported upper limits. wefind omega_gw(f)&lt;1.8x10^-4 using a spectral index of zero for 170-600 hz andomega_gw(f)&lt;1.0*(f/1300 hz)^3 for 1000-1726 hz, bands in which no previousdirect limits have been placed. the limits in these four bands are the lowestdirect measurements to date on the stochastic background. we discuss theimplications of these results in light of the recent claim by the bicep2experiment of the possible evidence for inflationary gravitational waves.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1410.8310	narrow-band search of continuous gravitational-wave signals from crab  and vela pulsars in virgo vsr4 data	in this paper we present the results of a coherent narrow-band search forcontinuous gravitational-wave signals from the crab and vela pulsars conductedon virgo vsr4 data. in order to take into account a possible small mismatchbetween the gravitational wave frequency and two times the star rotationfrequency, inferred from measurement of the electromagnetic pulse rate, a rangeof 0.02 hz around two times the star rotational frequency has been searched forboth the pulsars. no evidence for a signal has been found and 95$\%$ confidencelevel upper limits have been computed both assuming polarization parameters arecompletely unknown and that they are known with some uncertainty, as derivedfrom x-ray observations of the pulsar wind torii. for vela the upper limits arecomparable to the spin-down limit, computed assuming that all the observedspin-down is due to the emission of gravitational waves. for crab the upperlimits are about a factor of two below the spin-down limit, and represent asignificant improvement with respect to past analysis. this is the first timethe spin-down limit is significantly overcome in a narrow-band search.

1412.0605	a directed search for gravitational waves from scorpius x-1 with initial  ligo	we present results of a search for continuously-emitted gravitationalradiation, directed at the brightest low-mass x-ray binary, scorpius x-1. oursemi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of ligo s5 data ranging from 50-550 hz,and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\mathcal{f}$-statistic powerdistributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. all candidates notremoved at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% falsealarm rate. we present bayesian 95% confidence upper limits ongravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: astandard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of scorpiusx-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagneticobservations. median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at150 hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. this proofof principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknowneffects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, butimproves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.

0804.3075	blandford's argument: the strongest continuous gravitational wave signal	for a uniform population of neutron stars whose spin-down is dominated by theemission of gravitational radiation, an old argument of blandford states thatthe expected gravitational-wave amplitude of the nearest source is independentof the deformation and rotation frequency of the objects. recent work hasimproved and extended this argument to set upper limits on the expectedamplitude from neutron stars that also emit electromagnetic radiation. werestate these arguments in a more general framework, and simulate the evolutionof such a population of stars in the gravitational potential of our galaxy. thesimulations allow us to test the assumptions of blandford's argument on arealistic model of our galaxy. we show that the two key assumptions of theargument (two dimensionality of the spatial distribution and a steady-statefrequency distribution) are in general not fulfilled. the effective scalingdimension d of the spatial distribution of neutron stars is significantlylarger than two, and for frequencies detectable by terrestrial instruments thefrequency distribution is not in a steady state unless the ellipticity isunrealistically large. thus, in the cases of most interest, the maximumexpected gravitational-wave amplitude does have a strong dependence on thedeformation and rotation frequency of the population. the results strengthenthe previous upper limits on the expected gravitational-wave amplitude fromneutron stars by a factor of 6 for realistic values of ellipticity.

1504.02294	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iv. mock spectrometer data analysis,  survey sensitivity, and the discovery of 41 pulsars	the on-going palfa survey at the arecibo observatory began in 2004 and issearching for radio pulsars in the galactic plane at 1.4 ghz. observationssince 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than werepreviously employed in this survey. a new data reduction pipeline has been inplace since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, aswell as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selectionheuristics. this pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8millisecond pulsars (msps; p &lt; 10 ms), bringing the palfa survey's discoverytotals to 145 pulsars, including 17 msps, and one fast radio burst (frb). thepipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsarsincluding 60 found in palfa data by re-analyzing observations previouslysearched by other pipelines. a comprehensive description of the surveysensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has beendetermined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters andamplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recoveredwith the data reduction pipeline. we have confirmed that the palfa surveyachieves the sensitivity to msps predicted by theoretical models. however, wealso find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly usedthere is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods p &gt;= 100 ms thatgradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for p &gt; 4 s at dm &lt; 150 pc/cc.this degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. wefind that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to bedetected in the absence of red noise. this reduced sensitivity could haveimplications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the galaxy.

0805.0417	a measurement of the spatial distribution of diffuse tev gamma ray  emission from the galactic plane with milagro	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission produced by the interaction of cosmic-rayparticles with matter and radiation in the galaxy can be used to probe thedistribution of cosmic rays and their sources in different regions of thegalaxy. with its large field of view and long observation time, the milagrogamma ray observatory is an ideal instrument for surveying large regions of thenorthern hemisphere sky and for detecting diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission at veryhigh energies. here, the spatial distribution and the flux of the diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission in the tev energy range with a median energy of 15 tevfor galactic longitudes between 30$^\circ$ and 110$^\circ$ and between136$^\circ$ and 216$^\circ$ and for galactic latitudes between -10$^\circ$ and10$^\circ$ are determined. the measured fluxes are consistent with predictionsof the galprop model everywhere except for the cygnus region($l\in[65^\circ,85^\circ]$). for the cygnus region, the flux is twice thepredicted value. this excess can be explained by the presence of active cosmicray sources accelerating hadrons which interact with the local denseinterstellar medium and produce gamma rays through pion decay.

1504.03684	einstein@home discovery of a palfa millisecond pulsar in an eccentric  binary orbit	we report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar (msp) psr j1950+2414($p=4.3$ ms) in a binary system with an eccentric ($e=0.08$) 22-day orbit inpulsar alfa survey observations with the arecibo telescope. its companion starhas a median mass of 0.3 $m_\odot$ and is most likely a white dwarf. fullyrecycled msps like this one are thought to be old neutron stars spun-up by masstransfer from a companion star. this process should circularize the orbit, asis observed for the vast majority of binary msps, which predominantly haveorbital eccentricities $e &lt; 0.001$. however, four recently discovered binarymsps have orbits with $0.027 &lt; e &lt; 0.44$; psr j1950+2414 is the fifth suchsystem to be discovered. the upper limits for its intrinsic spin periodderivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to thoseof the general msp population. the large eccentricities are incompatible withthe predictions of the standard recycling scenario: something unusual happenedduring their evolution. proposed scenarios are a) initial evolution of thepulsar in a triple system which became dynamically unstable, b) origin in anexchange encounter in an environment with high stellar density, c) rotationallydelayed accretion-induced collapse of a super-chandrasekhar white dwarf, and d)dynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk. we compare theproperties of all five known eccentric msps with the predictions of theseformation channels. future measurements of the masses and proper motion mightallow us to firmly exclude some of the proposed formation scenarios.
