0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al. (2008) supernova sample, we find \omega_{tot} = 1.011 +/- 0.009and w = -0.99 +/- 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equationof state w.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

1007.2414	three-point correlation functions of sdss galaxies: luminosity and color  dependence in redshift and projected space	the three-point correlation function (3pcf) provides an important view intothe clustering of galaxies that is not available to its lower order cousin, thetwo-point correlation function (2pcf). higher order statistics, such as the3pcf, are necessary to probe the non-gaussian structure and shape informationexpected in these distributions. we measure the clustering of spectroscopicgalaxies in the main galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),focusing on the shape or configuration dependence of the reduced 3pcf in bothredshift and projected space. this work constitutes the largest number ofgalaxies ever used to investigate the reduced 3pcf, using over 220,000 galaxiesin three volume-limited samples. we find significant configuration dependenceof the reduced 3pcf at 3-27 mpc/h, in agreement with lcdm predictions and indisagreement with the hierarchical ansatz. below 6 mpc/h, the redshift spacereduced 3pcf shows a smaller amplitude and weak configuration dependence incomparison with projected measurements suggesting that redshift distortions,and not galaxy bias, can make the reduced 3pcf appear consistent with thehierarchical ansatz. the reduced 3pcf shows a weaker dependence on luminositythan the 2pcf, with no significant dependence on scales above 9 mpc/h. onscales less than 9 mpc/h, the reduced 3pcf appears more affected by galaxycolor than luminosty. we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the 3pcf tosystematic effects such as sky completeness and binning scheme, along with thedifficulty of resolving the errors. some comparable analyses make assumptionsthat do not consistently account for these effects.

1101.1559	the eighth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first data from  sdss-iii	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) started a new phase in august 2008, withnew instrumentation and new surveys focused on galactic structure and chemicalevolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering ofgalaxies and the quasar ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search forplanets around ~8000 stars. this paper describes the first data release ofsdss-iii (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the sdss). the releaseincludes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the southern galactic cap,bringing the total footprint of the sdss imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over athird of the celestial sphere. all the imaging data have been reprocessed withan improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometricrecalibration and flat-field determination. this release also includes all datafrom the second phase of the sloan extension for galactic understanding andevolution (segue-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 starsat both high and low galactic latitudes. all the more than half a millionstellar spectra obtained with the sdss spectrograph have been reprocessedthrough an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determinationof metallicity for high metallicity stars.

1104.0389	the growth of galaxy stellar mass within dark matter halos	we study the evolution of stellar mass in galaxies as a function of host halomass, using the "mpa" and "durham" semi-analytic models, implemented on themillennium run simulation. the results from both models are similar. we findthat about 45% of the stellar mass in central galaxies in present-day halosless massive than ~10^{12} msun/h is already in place at z~1. this fractionincreases to ~65% for more massive halos. the peak of star formation efficiencyshifts toward lower mass halos from z~1 to z~0. the stellar mass in low-masshalos grows mostly by star formation since z~1, while in high-mass halos mostof the stellar mass is assembled by mergers. these trends are clear indicationsof "halo downsizing". we compare our findings to the results of thephenomenological method developed by zheng, coil &amp; zehavi (2007). thetheoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with these results,however there are large discrepancies. the most significant one concerns theamount of stars already in place in the progenitor galaxies at z~1, which isabout a factor of two larger in both semi-analytic models. we also use thesemi-analytic catalogs to test different assumptions made in that work, andillustrate the importance of smooth accretion of dark matter when estimatingthe mergers contribution. we demonstrate that methods studying galaxy evolutionfrom the galaxy-halo connection are powerful in constraining theoretical modelsand can guide future efforts of modeling galaxy evolution. conversely,semi-analytic models serve an important role in improving such methods.

1104.1635	cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering and the mass-to-number  ratio of galaxy clusters	we place constraints on the average density (omega_m) and clusteringamplitude (sigma_8) of matter using a combination of two measurements from thesloan digital sky survey: the galaxy two-point correlation function, w_p, andthe mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, m/n, analogous tocluster m/l ratios. our w_p measurements are obtained from dr7 while the sampleof clusters is the maxbcg sample, with cluster masses derived from weakgravitational lensing. we construct non-linear galaxy bias models using thehalo occupation distribution (hod) to fit both w_p and m/n for differentcosmological parameters. hod models that match the same two-point clusteringpredict different numbers of galaxies in massive halos when omega_m or sigma_8is varied, thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. wedemonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent andcompetitive with current results from cluster abundance studies, even thoughthis technique does not use abundance information. using w_p and m/n alone, wefind omega_m^0.5*sigma_8=0.465+/-0.026, with individual constraints ofomega_m=0.29+/-0.03 and sigma_8=0.85+/-0.06. combined with current cmb data,these constraints are omega_m=0.290+/-0.016 and sigma_8=0.826+/-0.020. allerrors are 1-sigma. the systematic uncertainties that the m/n technique aremost sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark matter halosand the possibility of redshift evolution between the sdss main sample and themaxbcg sample. our derived constraints are insensitive to the current level ofuncertainties in the halo mass function and in the mass-richness relation ofclusters and its scatter, making the m/n technique complementary to clusterabundances as a method for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1111.0969	galaxy zoo: the environmental dependence of bars and bulges in disc  galaxies	we present an analysis of the environmental dependence of bars and bulges indisc galaxies, using a volume-limited catalogue of 15810 galaxies at z&lt;0.06from the sloan digital sky survey with visual morphologies from the galaxy zoo2 project. we find that the likelihood of having a bar, or bulge, in discgalaxies increases when the galaxies have redder (optical) colours and largerstellar masses, and observe a transition in the bar and bulge likelihoods, suchthat massive disc galaxies are more likely to host bars and bulges. we usegalaxy clustering methods to demonstrate statistically significantenvironmental correlations of barred, and bulge-dominated, galaxies, fromprojected separations of 150 kpc/h to 3 mpc/h. these environmental correlationsappear to be independent of each other: i.e., bulge-dominated disc galaxiesexhibit a significant bar-environment correlation, and barred disc galaxiesshow a bulge-environment correlation. we demonstrate that approximately half(50 +/- 10%) of the bar-environment correlation can be explained by the factthat more massive dark matter haloes host redder disc galaxies, which are thenmore likely to have bars. likewise, we show that the environmental dependenceof stellar mass can only explain a small fraction (25 +/- 10%) of thebar-environment correlation. therefore, a significant fraction of our observedenvironmental dependence of barred galaxies is not due to colour or stellarmass dependences, and hence could be due to another galaxy property. finally,by analyzing the projected clustering of barred and unbarred disc galaxies withhalo occupation models, we argue that barred galaxies are in slightlyhigher-mass haloes than unbarred ones, and some of them (approximately 25%) aresatellite galaxies in groups. we also discuss implications about the effects ofminor mergers and interactions on bar formation.

1111.6598	a new method to correct for fiber collisions in galaxy two-point  statistics	in fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of the fiber plugsprevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting theability of studying galaxy clustering on all scales. we present a new methodfor correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statisticsbased on spectroscopic observations. our method makes use of observations intile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population,and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. the method is rootedin solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs.we demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the fullthree-dimensional redshift-space two-point correlation functions on scales bothbelow and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly usednearest neighbor and angular correction methods. we discuss potentialsystematic effects in our method. the statistical correction accuracy of ourmethod is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the squareroot of) the volume probed. for a sample similar to the final sdss-iii bossgalaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the levelof 1% on scales 0.1--30mpc/h for the two-point correlation functions. thesystematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by non-perfect correctionof collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5%.our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering statisticsas well, enables more accurate measurements of full three-dimensional galaxyclustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys.

1201.2172	acoustic scale from the angular power spectra of sdss-iii dr8  photometric luminous galaxies	we measure the acoustic scale from the angular power spectra of the sloandigital sky survey iii (sdss-iii) data release 8 imaging catalog that includes872,921 galaxies over ~ 10,000 deg^2 between 0.45&lt;z&lt;0.65. the extensivespectroscopic training set of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey(boss) luminous galaxies allows precise estimates of the true redshiftdistributions of galaxies in our imaging catalog. utilizing the redshiftdistribution information, we build templates and fit to the power spectra ofthe data, which are measured in our companion paper, ho et al. 2011, to derivethe location of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) while marginalizing overmany free parameters to exclude nearly all of the non-bao signal. we derive theratio of the angular diameter distance to the sound horizon scale d_a/r_s=9.212 + 0.416 -0.404 at z=0.54, and therefore, d_a= 1411+- 65 mpc at z=0.54;the result is fairly independent of assumptions on the underlying cosmology.our measurement of angular diameter distance d_a is 1.4 \sigma higher than whatis expected for the concordance lcdm (komatsu et al. 2011), in accordance tothe trend of other spectroscopic bao measurements for z &gt;~ 0.35. we reportconstraints on cosmological parameters from our measurement in combination withthe wmap7 data and the previous spectroscopic bao measurements of sdss(percival et al. 2010) and wigglez (blake et al. 2011). we refer to ourcompanion papers (ho et al. 2011; de putter et al. 2011) for investigations oninformation of the full power spectrum.

1202.6057	the clustering of galaxies at z~0.5 in the sdss-iii data release 9  boss-cmass sample: a test for the lcdm cosmology	we present results on the clustering of 282,068 galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) sample of massive galaxies withredshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii project.our results cover a large range of scales from ~0.5 to ~90 mpc/h. we comparethese estimates with the expectations of the flat lcdm cosmological model withparameters compatible with wmap7 data. we use the multidark cosmologicalsimulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, toestimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloesand galaxy biases. we find that the lcdm model gives a reasonable descriptionto the observed correlation functions at z~0.5, which is a remarkably goodagreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance ofboss galaxies, does not have any free parameters. however, we find a deviation(&gt;~10%) in the correlation functions for scales less than ~1 mpc/h and ~10-40mpc/h. a more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics fromupcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. we also estimatethat about 12% of the "galaxies" in the abundance-matched sample are satellitesinhabiting central haloes with mass m&gt;~1e14 m_sun/h. using the multidarksimulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched cataloguefinding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtainedusing the measured boss projected correlation function. furthermore, the linearlarge-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matchedsample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/mpc)^3). extrapolating these resultsto bao scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signalproduced by non-linear evolution that leads to ~2-4% dips at ~3 sigma level forwavenumbers k&gt;~0.1 h/mpc in the linear large-scale bias.

1202.6241	the progenitors of present-day massive red galaxies up to z ~ 0.7 -  finding passive galaxies using sdss-i/ii and sdss-iii	we present a comprehensive study of 250,000 galaxies targeted by the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) up to z ~ 0.7 with the specific goal ofidentifying and characterising a population of galaxies that has evolvedwithout significant merging. we compute a likelihood that each boss galaxy is aprogenitor of the luminous red galaxies (lrgs) sample, targeted by sdss-i/ii upz ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of lrgs and their inferred star-formationhistories, metallicity histories and dust content. we determine merger rates,luminosity growth rates and the evolution of the large-scale clustering betweenthe two surveys, and we investigate the effect of using different stellarpopulation synthesis models in our conclusions. we demonstrate that our sampleis slowly evolving (of the order of 2 +/- 1.5% per gyr by merging). ourconclusions refer to the bright and massive end of the galaxy population, withmi0.55 &lt; -22, and m* &gt; 1e11.2 msolar, corresponding roughly to 95% and 40% ofthe lrgs and boss galaxy populations, respectively. our analysis further showsthat any possible excess of flux in boss galaxies, when compared to lrgs, frompotentially unresolved targets at z ~ 0.55 must be less than 1% in ther0.55-band (approximately equivalent to the g-band in the rest-frame ofgalaxies at z=0.55). when weighting the boss galaxies based on the predictedproperties of the lrgs, and restricting the analysis to the reddest bossgalaxies, we find an evolution of the large-scale clustering that is consistentwith dynamical passive evolution, assuming a standard cosmology. we concludethat our likelihoods give a weighted sample that is as clean and as close topassive evolution (in dynamical terms, i.e. no or negligible merging) aspossible, and that is optimal for cosmological studies.

1208.0022	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of sdss-iii	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) is designed to measure thescale of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in the clustering of matter over alarger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveysof large scale structure. boss uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint asi=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure bao to redshifts z&lt;0.7.observations of neutral hydrogen in the lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g&lt;22) will constrain bao over the redshift range 2.15&lt;z&lt;3.5.early results from boss include the first detection of the large-scalethree-dimensional clustering of the lyman alpha forest and a strong detectionfrom the data release 9 data set of the bao in the clustering of massivegalaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. we project that boss will yieldmeasurements of the angular diameter distance d_a to an accuracy of 1.0% atredshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of h(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at thesame redshifts. forecasts for lyman alpha forest constraints predict ameasurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerated_a(z) and h^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the surveyis complete. here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopictargets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality ofboss.

1208.1491	the clustering of galaxies in sdss-iii dr9 baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	we analyze the density field of 264,283 galaxies observed by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)and included in the sdss data release nine (dr9). in total, the sdss dr9 bossdata includes spectroscopic redshifts for over 400,000 galaxies spread over afootprint of more than 3,000 deg^2. we measure the power spectrum of thesegalaxies with redshifts 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 in order to constrain the amount oflocal non-gaussianity, f_nl,local, in the primordial density field, payingparticular attention to the impact of systematic uncertainties. the boss galaxydensity field is systematically affected by the local stellar density and thisinfluences the ability to accurately measure f_nl,local. in the absence of anycorrection, we find (erroneously) that the probability that f_nl,local isgreater than zero, p(f_nl,local &gt;0), is 99.5%. after quantifying and correctingfor the systematic bias and including the added uncertainty, we find -45 &lt;f_nl,local &lt; 195 at 95% confidence, and p(f_nl,local &gt;0) = 91.0%. a moreconservative approach assumes that we have only learned the k-dependence of thesystematic bias and allows any amplitude for the systematic correction; we findthat the systematic effect is not fully degenerate with that of f_nl,local, andwe determine that -82 &lt; f_nl,local &lt; 178 (at 95% confidence) and p(f_nl,local&gt;0) = 68%. this analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for theimpact of galactic foregrounds on f_nl,local measurements. we outline themethods that account for these systematic biases and uncertainties. we expectour methods to yield robust constraints on f_nl,local for both our own andfuture large-scale-structure investigations.

1212.1211	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: luminosity and color dependence and redshift evolution	we measure the luminosity and color dependence and the redshift evolution ofgalaxy clustering in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey ninth data release. we focus on the projected two-pointcorrelation function (2pcf) of subsets of its cmass sample, which includesabout 260,000 galaxies over ~3,300 sq. deg in the redshift range 0.43&lt;z&lt;0.7. tominimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-definedluminosity and color subsamples by carefully accounting for the cmass galaxyselection cuts. the 2pcf of the whole cmass sample, if approximated by apower-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\pm0.06mpc/h and an index of\gamma=1.85\pm0.01. clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are foundfor the projected 2pcf in all redshift bins, with more luminous and reddergalaxies generally exhibiting stronger clustering and steeper 2pcf. the colordependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within the red sequence,consistent with the behavior of sdss-ii main sample galaxies at lowerredshifts. at a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution ofthe projected 2pcfs with redshift is detected for red sequence galaxies. wealso construct galaxy samples of fixed number density at different redshifts,using redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. the clustering of these galaxiesin the cmass redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted bypassive evolution. our measurements of the luminosity and color dependence andredshift evolution of galaxy clustering will allow for detailed modeling of therelation between galaxies and dark matter halos and new constraints on galaxyformation and evolution.

1212.4526	cross-correlation of sdss dr7 quasars and dr10 boss galaxies: the weak  luminosity dependence of quasar clustering at z~0.5	we present the measurement of the two-point cross-correlation function (ccf)of 8,198 sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) quasars and349,608 dr10 cmass galaxies from the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey(boss) at redshift &lt;z&gt;~0.5 (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9). the cross-correlation function can bereasonably well fit by a power-law model xi_qg(r)=(r/r_0)^(-gamma) on projectedscales of r_p=2-25 mpc/h with r_0=6.61+-0.25 mpc/h and gamma=1.69+-0.07. weestimate a quasar linear bias of b_q=1.38+-0.10 at &lt;z&gt;=0.53 from the ccfmeasurements. this linear bias corresponds to a characteristic host halo massof ~4x10^12 m_sun/h, compared to ~10^13 m_sun/h characteristic host halo massfor cmass galaxies. we divide the quasar sample in luminosity and constrain theluminosity dependence of quasar bias to be db_q/dlogl=0.20+-0.34 or 0.11+-0.32(depending on different luminosity divisions) for quasar luminosities-23.5&gt;m_i(z=2)&gt;-25.5, implying a weak luminosity dependence of quasarclustering for the bright end of the quasar population at &lt;z&gt;~0.5. we compareour measurements with theoretical predictions, halo occupation distribution(hod) models and mock catalogs. these comparisons suggest quasars reside in abroad range of host halos, and the host halo mass distributions significantlyoverlap with each other for quasars at different luminosities, implying a poorcorrelation between halo mass and instantaneous quasar luminosity. we also findthat the quasar hod parameterization is largely degenerate such that differenthods can reproduce the ccf equally well, but with different outcomes such asthe satellite fraction and host halo mass distribution. these results highlightthe limitations and ambiguities in modeling the distribution of quasars withthe standard hod approach and the need for additional information in populatingquasars in dark matter halos with hod.

0712.1643	passive evolution of galaxy clustering	we present a numerical study of the evolution of galaxy clustering whengalaxies flow passively from high redshift, respecting the continuity equationthroughout. while passive flow is a special case of galaxy evolution, it allowsa well-defined study of galaxy ancestry and serves as an interesting limit tobe compared to non-passive cases. we use dissipationless n-body simulations,assign galaxies to massive halos at z=1 and z=2 using various hod models, andtrace these galaxy particles to lower redshift while conserving their number.we find that passive flow results in an asymptotic convergence at low redshiftin the hod and in galaxy clustering on scales above ~3mpc/h for a wide range ofinitial hods. as galaxies become less biased with respect to massasymptotically with time, the hod parameters evolve such that m1/mm decreaseswhile alpha converges toward unity, where mm is the characteristic halo mass tohost a central galaxy, m1 is the halo mass to host one satellite galaxy, andalpha is the power-law index in the halo-mass dependence of the average numberof satellites per halo. the satellite populations converge toward the poissondistribution at low redshift. the convergence is robust for different numberdensities and is enhanced when galaxies evolve from higher redshift. we compareour results with the observed lrg sample from sloan digital sky survey that hasthe same number density. we claim that if lrgs have experienced a strictpassive flow, their &lt;n_g(m)&gt; should be close to a power law with an index ofunity in halo mass. discrepancies could be due to dry galaxy merging or newmembers arising between the initial and the final redshifts. the spatialdistribution of passively flowing galaxies within halos appears on average moreconcentrated than the halo mass profile at low redshift.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1310.1106	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii dr10 baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: no detectable colour dependence of distance scale or  growth rate measurements	we study the clustering of galaxies, as a function of their colour, from datarelease ten (dr10) of the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. weselect 122,967 galaxies with 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 into a "blue" sample and 131,969into a "red" sample based on k+e corrected (to z=0.55) r-i colours and i bandmagnitudes. the samples are chosen to each contain more than 100,000 galaxies,have similar redshift distributions, and maximize the difference in clusteringamplitude. the red sample has a 40% larger bias than the blue (b_red/b_blue =1.39+-0.04), implying the red galaxies occupy dark matter halos with an averagemass that is 0.5 log mo greater. spherically averaged measurements of thecorrelation function, \xi 0, and the power spectrum are used to locate theposition of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature of both samples.using \xi 0, we obtain distance scales, relative to our reference lcdmcosmology, of 1.010+-0.027 for the red sample and 1.005+-0.031 for the blue.after applying reconstruction, these measurements improve to 1.013+/-0.020 forthe red sample and 1.008+-0.026 for the blue. for each sample, measurements of\xi 0 and the second multipole moment, \xi 2, of the anisotropic correlationfunction are used to determine the rate of structure growth, parameterized byf\sigma 8. we find f\sigma 8,red = 0.511+-0.083, f\sigma 8,blue =0.509+/-0.085, and f\sigma 8,cross = 0.423+-0.061 (from the cross-correlationbetween the red and blue samples). we use the covariance between the bias andgrowth measurements obtained from each sample and their cross-correlation toproduce an optimally-combined measurement of f\sigma 8,comb = 0.443+-0.055. inno instance do we detect significant differences in distance scale or structuregrowth measurements obtained from the blue and red samples.

1312.4854	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: cosmological implications of the full shape of the  clustering wedges in the data release 10 and 11 galaxy samples	we explore the cosmological implications of the angle-averaged correlationfunction, xi(s), and the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s) and xi_para(s), of thelowz and cmass galaxy samples from data release 10 and 11 of the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. our results show no significantevidence for a deviation from the standard lcdm model. the combination of theinformation from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmicmicrowave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the universeto omega_k = 0.0010 +- 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to sum m_nu &lt; 0.23 ev(95% confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species ton_eff=3.31 +- 0.27, and the dark energy equation of state to w_de = -1.051 +-0.076. these limits are further improved by adding information from type iasupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. in particular,this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent darkenergy equation of state, in which case we find w_de=-1.024 +- 0.052. weexplore the constraints on the growth-rate of cosmic structures assumingf(z)=omega_m(z)^gamma and obtain gamma=0.69 +- 0.15, in agreement with thepredictions from general relativity of gamma=0.55.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1312.4899	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey (boss): measuring growth rate and geometry with  anisotropic clustering	we use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 11 cmass sample to measurethe linear growth rate of structure, the hubble expansion rate and the comovingdistance scale. our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses an effectivevolume of 6.0 ${\rm gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. wefind $f\sigma_8 = 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $h = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}$ and $d_{\rm a} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm mpc}$when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. when we fix thebackground expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\lambda$cdm modelin agreement with recent planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$(6 per cent accuracy). while our measurements are generally consistent with thepredictions of $\lambda$cdm and general relativity, they mildly favor models inwhich the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what ispredicted by general relativity. combining our measurements with recent cosmicmicrowave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmologicalparameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. separatelyvarying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent accuracy)and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equationof state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. bothconstraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of $w=-1$ and$\gamma = 0.554$.

1401.3009	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: modeling of the luminosity and colour dependence in the  data release 10	we investigate the luminosity and colour dependence of clustering of cmassgalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey tenth data release. the halo occupation distribution framework isadopted to model the projected two-point correlation function measurements onsmall and intermediate scales (from $0.02$ to $60\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) and tointerpret the observed trends and infer the connection of galaxies to darkmatter halos. we find that luminous red galaxies reside in massive halos ofmass $m{\sim}10^{13}$--$10^{14}\,h^{-1}{\rm m_\odot}$ and more luminousgalaxies are more clustered and hosted by more massive halos. the strongsmall-scale clustering requires a fraction of these galaxies to be satellitesin massive halos, with the fraction at the level of 5--8 per cent anddecreasing with luminosity. the characteristic mass of a halo hosting onaverage one satellite galaxy above a luminosity threshold is about a factor$8.7$ larger than that of a halo hosting a central galaxy above the samethreshold. at a fixed luminosity, progressively redder galaxies are morestrongly clustered on small scales, which can be explained by having a largerfraction of these galaxies in the form of satellites in massive halos. ourclustering measurements on scales below $0.4\,h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$ allow us tostudy the small-scale spatial distribution of satellites inside halos. whilethe clustering of luminosity-threshold samples can be well described by anavarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, that of the reddest galaxies prefers asteeper or more concentrated profile. finally, we also use galaxy samples ofconstant number density at different redshifts to study the evolution ofluminous galaxies, and find the clustering to be consistent with passiveevolution in the redshift range of $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$.

1407.4811	velocity bias from the small scale clustering of sdss-iii boss galaxies	we present the measurements and modelling of the projected and redshift-spaceclustering of cmass galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey data release 11. for a volume-limited luminousred galaxy sample in the redshift range of $0.48&lt;z&lt;0.55$, we perform halooccupation distribution modelling of the small- and intermediate-scale($0.1$--$60h^{-1}{\rm {mpc}}$) projected and redshift-space two-pointcorrelation functions, with an accurate model built on high resolution $n$-bodysimulations. to interpret the measured redshift-space distortions, thedistribution of galaxy velocities must differ from that of the dark matterinside haloes of $\sim 10^{13}$--$10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm m_{\odot}}$, i.e. the datarequire the existence of galaxy velocity bias. most notably, central galaxieson average are not at rest with respect to the core of their host haloes(defined by the inner 25% of particles around the halo potential minimum), butrather move around it with a 1d velocity dispersion of $0.22^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$times that of the dark matter, implying a spatial offset from the centre at thelevel of $\lesssim$1% of the halo virial radius. the luminous satellitegalaxies move more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities$0.86^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ times those of the dark matter, which suggests that thevelocity and spatial distributions of these satellites cannot both be unbiased.the constraints mainly arise from the fingers-of-god effect at nonlinear scalesand the smoothing to the kaiser effect in the translinear regime; therobustness of the results is demonstrated by a variety of tests. in addition,no clear evidence is found for a strong luminosity dependence of the velocitybias. we discuss the implications of the existence of galaxy velocity bias forinvestigations of galaxy formation and cosmology.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1505.07861	redshift-space clustering of sdss galaxies --- luminosity dependence,  halo occupation distribution, and velocity bias	we present the measurements and modelling of the small-to-intermediate scale(0.1--25 mpc/h) projected and three-dimensional (3d) redshift-space two-pointcorrelation functions (2pcfs) of local galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release 7. we find a clear dependence of galaxy clustering onluminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger formore luminous samples. the measurements are successfully interpreted within thehalo occupation distribution (hod) framework with central and satellitevelocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and tomodel redshift-space distortion (rsd) effects. in agreement with previousstudies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes.including the redshift-space 2pcfs helps tighten the hod constraints. moreover,we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres,with the velocity dispersion about 30% that of the dark matter. such a relativemotion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find thatcentral galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect totheir host haloes. the motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples isconsistent with their following that of the dark matter. for faint samples,satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloesabout 85% that of the dark matter. we discuss possible applications of thevelocity bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. in theappendix, we characterize the distribution of galaxy redshift measurementerrors, which is well described by a gaussian-convolved double exponentialdistribution.

astro-ph;0106476	galaxy clustering in early sdss redshift data	we present the first measurements of clustering in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) galaxy redshift survey. our sample consists of 29,300 galaxieswith redshifts 5,700 km/s &lt; cz &lt; 39,000 km/s, distributed in several long butnarrow (2.5-5 degree) segments, covering 690 square degrees. for the full,flux-limited sample, the redshift-space correlation length is approximately 8mpc/h. the two-dimensional correlation function \xi(r_p,\pi) shows clearsignatures of both the small-scale, ``fingers-of-god'' distortion caused byvelocity dispersions in collapsed objects and the large-scale compressioncaused by coherent flows, though the latter cannot be measured with highprecision in the present sample. the inferred real-space correlation functionis well described by a power law, \xi(r)=(r/6.1+/-0.2 mpc/h)^{-1.75+/-0.03},for 0.1 mpc/h &lt; r &lt; 16 mpc/h. the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion is\sigma_{12} ~ 600+/-100 km/s for projected separations 0.15 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 5mpc/h. when we divide the sample by color, the red galaxies exhibit a strongerand steeper real-space correlation function and a higher pairwise velocitydispersion than do the blue galaxies. the relative behavior of subsamplesdefined by high/low profile concentration or high/low surface brightness isqualitatively similar to that of the red/blue subsamples. our most strikingresult is a clear measurement of scale-independent luminosity bias at r &lt; 10mpc/h: subsamples with absolute magnitude ranges centered on m_*-1.5, m_*, andm_*+1.5 have real-space correlation functions that are parallel power laws ofslope ~ -1.8 with correlation lengths of approximately 7.4 mpc/h, 6.3 mpc/h,and 4.7 mpc/h, respectively.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107419	kl estimation of the power spectrum parameters from the angular  distribution of galaxies in early sdss data	we present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the sloandigital sky survey. the projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expandedover a set of karhunen-loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noiseratio in our analysis. a maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimateparameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional powerspectrum. our best estimates are gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8l = 0.915 +/-0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. we demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at orbeyond the peak of the 3d power spectrum. we discuss how the results scale withsystematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. we find that thecentral values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. we havealso explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations ofthe kl basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. we find that theimpact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties ofour fiducial result.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0301280	on departures from a power law in the galaxy correlation function	we measure the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) from the sloan digitalsky survey for a flux-limited sample of 118,000 galaxies and for a volumelimited subset of 22,000 galaxies with absolute magnitude m_r&lt;-21. bothcorrelation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fitpower law, in particular a change in slope at r_p~1-2 mpc/h. these departuresare stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relativelyluminous galaxies. we show that the inflection point in w_p(r_p) can benaturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according towhich it marks the transition from a large scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in separate dark matter halos to a small scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in the same dark matter halo. for example, given the dark halo populationpredicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projectedcorrelation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by amodel in which the mean number of m_r&lt;-21 galaxies in a halo of mass m&gt;m_1=4.74x 10^{13}\msun/h is &lt;n&gt;_m=(m/m_1)^{0.89}, with 75% of the galaxies residing inless massive, single-galaxy halos. this physically motivated model has the samenumber of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the w_p(r_p) data better,with a \chi^2/d.o.f.=0.93 compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom,incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). departuresfrom a power-law correlation function encode information about the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter halos. higher precision measurements of thesedepartures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias andprovide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0408003	cosmology and the halo occupation distribution from small-scale galaxy  clustering in the sloan digital sky survey	we use the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) of a volume-limitedsubsample of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy redshift catalogueto measure the halo occupation distribution (hod) of the galaxies of thesample. simultaneously, we allow the cosmology to vary within cosmologicalconstraints imposed by cosmic microwave background experiments in a lambda-cdmmodel. we find that combining w_p(r_p) for this sample alone with theobservations by wmap, acbar, cbi and vsa can provide one of the most precisetechniques available to measure cosmological parameters. for a minimal flatsix-parameter lambda-cdm model with an hod with three free parameters, we findomega_m=0.278^{+0.027}_{-0.027}, sigma_8=0.812^{+0.028}_{-0.027}, andh_0=69.8^{+2.6}_{-2.6}km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}; these errors are significantlysmaller than from cmb alone and similar to those obtained by combining cmb withthe large-scale galaxy power spectrum assuming scale-independent bias. thecorresponding hod parameters describing the minimum halo mass and thenormalization and cut-off of the satellite mean occupation arem_min=(3.03^{+0.36}_{-0.36})x 10^{12} h^{-1} m_sun, m_1 =(4.58^{+0.60}_{-0.60})x 10^{13} h^{-1} m_sun, and kappa=4.44^{+0.51}_{-0.69}.when more parameters are added to the hod model, the error bars on the hodparameters increase because of degeneracies, but the error bars on thecosmological parameters do not increase greatly. similar modeling for othergalaxy samples could reduce the statistical errors on these results, while morethorough investigations of the cosmology dependence of nonlinear halo bias andhalo mass functions are needed to eliminate remaining systematic uncertainties,which may be comparable to statistical uncertainties.

astro-ph;0411037	the scale-dependence of relative galaxy bias: encouragement for the halo  model description	we investigate the relationship between the colors, luminosities, andenvironments of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey spectroscopic sample,using environmental measurements on scales ranging from 0.2 to 6 mpc/h. wefind: (1) that the relationship between color and environment persists even tothe lowest luminosities we probe (absolute magnitude in the r band of about -14for h=1); (2) at luminosities and colors for which the galaxy correlationfunction has a large amplitude, it also has a steep slope; and (3) in regionsof a given overdensity on small scales (1 mpc/h), the overdensity on largescales (6 mpc/h) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation historyof the galaxies. of these results, the last has the most immediate applicationto galaxy formation theory. in particular, it lends support to the notion thata galaxy's properties are related only to the mass of its host dark matterhalo, and not to the larger scale environment.

astro-ph;0608635	measuring the matter density using baryon oscillations in the sdss	we measure the cosmological matter density by observing the positions ofbaryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we jointly analyse the main galaxies and lrgs in the sdssdr5 sample, using over half a million galaxies in total. the oscillations aredetected with 99.74% confidence (3.0sigma assuming gaussianity) compared to asmooth power spectrum. when combined with the observed scale of the peakswithin the cmb, we find a best-fit value of omega_m=0.256+0.029-0.024 (68%confidence interval), for a flat lambda cosmology when marginalising over thehubble parameter and the baryon density. this value of the matter density isderived from the locations of the baryon oscillations in the galaxy powerspectrum and in the cmb, and does not include any information from the overallshape of the power spectra. this is an extremely clean cosmological measurementas the physics of the baryon acoustic oscillation production is wellunderstood, and the positions of the oscillations are expected to beindependent of systematics such as galaxy bias.

astro-ph;0703457	galaxy evolution from halo occupation distribution modeling of deep2 and  sdss galaxy clustering	we model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function ofdeep2 (z~1) and sdss (z~0) galaxies within the halo occupation distribution(hod) framework. at both epochs, there is a tight correlation between centralgalaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing forlarger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higherluminosity. central l* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z~1than at z~0. we find little evolution in the relation between mass scales ofhost halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the sameluminosity threshold. combining these hod results with theoretical predictionsof the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection betweenthe galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies toz~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us tostudy the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. we find that thestellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. on average, the majorityof the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low mass halos(~5x10^11 msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in centralgalaxies of high mass halos (~10^13 msun/h) result from star formation betweenz~1 and z~0. in addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formationefficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time.future work can combine hod modeling of the clustering of galaxies at differentredshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matterhalos. this can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to bothmergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerfultests of galaxy formation theories.

astro-ph;9810246	large-scale mass power spectrum from peculiar velocities	the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations is estimated from the markiii and the sfi catalogs of peculiar velocities by applying a maximumlikelihood analysis, using parametric models for the power spectrum and for theerrors. generalized cdm models with and without cobe normalization are used.the applications to the two different data sets give consistent results. thegeneral result is a relatively high amplitude of the power spectrum, eg, atk=0.1 h/mpc we find p(k) \omega^{1.2} = (4.5+/-2.0)x10^3 (mpc/h)^3,corresponding to \sigma_8 \omega^{0.6} = 0.85+/-0.2. model-dependentconstraints on combinations of cosmological parameters are obtained forfamilies of cobe-normalized cdm models. these can roughly be approximated by\omega h_{60}^\mu n^\nu = 0.6+/-0.2, where \mu=1.3 and \nu=3.7, 2.0 for flat\lambda cdm models with and without tensor fluctuations respectively. for opencdm, without tensor fluctuations, the powers are \mu=0.9 and \nu=1.4. thequoted error-bars reflect the 90% formal likelihood uncertainty for each modeland the variance among different models and between catalogs. this is a briefreview of a collaborative project (for more details, see zaroubi et al 1997,freudling et al 1998). preliminary constraints in the \omega-\lambda plane arepresented as well.

astro-ph;9904118	large-scale power spectrum and cosmological parameters from sfi peculiar  velocities	we estimate the power spectrum of mass density fluctuations from peculiarvelocities of galaxies by applying an improved maximum-likelihood technique tothe new all-sky sfi catalog. parametric models are used for the power spectrumand the errors, and the free parameters are determined by assuming gaussianvelocity fields and errors and maximizing the probability of the data given themodel. it has been applied to generalized cdm models with and without cobenormalization. the method has been carefully tested using artificial sficatalogs. the most likely distance errors are found to be similar to theoriginal error estimates in the sfi data. the general result that is not verysensitive to the prior model used is a relatively high amplitude of the powerspectrum. for example, at k=0.1 h/mpc we find p(k)\omega^{1.2}=(4.4+/-1.7)x10^3(mpc/h)^3. an integral over the power spectrum yields\sigma_8\omega^{0.6}=0.82+/-0.12. model-dependent constraints on thecosmological parameters are obtained for families of cdm models. for example,for cobe-normalized \lambda cdm models (scalar fluctuations only), themaximum-likelihood result can be approximated by \omega n^{2} h_{60}^{1.3}=0.58+/-0.11. the formal random errors quoted correspond to the 90% confidencelevel. the total uncertainty, including systematic errors associated withnonlinear effects, may be larger by a factor of ~2. these results are inagreement with an application of a similar method to other data (mark iii).
