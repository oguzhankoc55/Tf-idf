0704.1129	sw sextantis stars: the dominant population of cvs with orbital periods  between 3-4 hours	[abridged] we present time-series optical photometry of five new cvsidentified by the hamburg quasar survey. the eclipses observed in hs 0129+2933,hs 0220+0603, and hs 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. hs0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)h. time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new cvs (with the exception of hs0805+3822) is also presented. radial velocity studies provided an orbitalperiod of 3.55 h for hs 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observedphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. the spectroscopicbehaviour clearly identifies these new cvs as new sw sextantis stars. these newadditions increase the number of known sw sex stars to 35. almost 40 per centof the total sw sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating therequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and themodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. on the other hand,the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becomingmore pronounced. in fact, almost half the cvs which populate the 3-4.5 h periodinterval are definite members of the class. these statistics are confirmed byour results from the hamburg quasar survey cvs. remarkably, 54 per cent of thehamburg nova-like variables have been identified as sw sex stars with orbitalperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. the observation of this pile-up of systems closeto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with thestandard theory of cv evolution, as the sw sex stars are believed to have thehighest mass transfer rates among cvs. finally, we review the full range ofcommon properties that the sw sex stars exhibit.

0903.2420	new faint optical spectrophotometric standards. hot white dwarfs from  the sloan digital sky survey	the spectral energy distributions for pure-hydrogen (da) hot white dwarfs canbe accurately predicted by model atmospheres. this makes it possible to definespectrophotometric calibrators by scaling the theoretical spectral shapes withbroad-band photometric observations -- a strategy successfully exploited forthe spectrographs onboard the hubble space telescope (hst) using three primaryda standards. absolute fluxes for non-da secondary standards, introduced toincrease the density of calibrators in the sky, need to be referred to theprimary standards, but a far better solution would be to employ a network of dastars scattered throughout the sky. we search for blue objects in the sixthdata release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and fit da model fluxes toidentify suitable candidates. reddening needs to be considered in the analysisof the hottest and therefore more distant stars. we propose a list of ninepure-hydrogen white dwarfs with absolute fluxes with estimated uncertaintiesbelow 3%, including four objects with estimated errors &lt;2%, as candidates forspectrophotometric standards in the range 14&lt;g&lt;18, and provide model-basedfluxes scaled to match the sdss broad-band fluxes for each. we apply the samemethod to the three hst da standards, linking the zero point of their absolutefluxes to ugr magnitudes transformed from photometry obtained with the usno 1-mtelescope. for these stars we estimate uncertainties of &lt;1% in the optical,finding good consistency with the fluxes adopted for hst calibration.

0904.1003	halo streams in the 7th sdss data release	we have detected stellar halo streams in the solar neighborhood using datafrom the 7th public data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), whichincludes the directed stellar program segue: sloan extension for galacticunderstanding and exploration. in order to derive distances to each star, weused the metallicity-dependent photometric parallax relation from ivezic et al.(2008) for which we examine and quantify the accuracy. our final sampleconsists of 22,321 nearby (d &lt; 2 kpc), metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -0.5) main-sequencestars with 6d estimates of position and space velocity. we characterize theorbits of these stars through suitable kinematic proxies for their "effective"integrals of motion, angular momentum, eccentricity, and orbital polar angleand compare the observed distribution to expectations from a smoothdistribution in four [fe/h] bins. on this basis we identify at least fivesignificant "phase-space overdensities" of stars on very similar orbits in thesolar neighborhood to which we can assign unambiguously peaked [fe/h]distributions. three of them have been identified previously, including thehalo stream discovered by helmi et al. (1999) at a significance level of 12.0.in addition, we find at least two new genuine halo streams, judged by theirkinematics and [fe/h], at significance levels of 2.9 and 4.8, respectively. forone stream the stars even show coherence in configuration space, matching aspatial overdensity of stars found by juric et al. (2008) at (r,z) \approx(9.5,0.8) kpc. our results demonstrate the practical power of our search methodto detect substructure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars withoutmaking a-priori assumptions about the detailed form of the gravitationalpotential.

0704.1780	hs1857+5144: a hot and young pre-cataclysmic variable	we report the discovery of a new white dwarf/m dwarf binary, hs1857+5144,identified in the hamburg quasar survey (hqs). time-resolved opticalspectroscopy and photometry were carried out to determine the properties ofthis new cataclysmic variable progenitor pre-cv). the light curves ofhs1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of porb=383.52 min andpeak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the b-band and r-band,respectively. the large amplitude of the brightness variation results from areflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star,suggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. our radial velocitystudy confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. amodel atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimumlight provides limits to its mass and temperature of mwd=~0.6-1.0 msun andtwd=~70000-100000 k, respectively. the detection of heii 4686 absorptionclassifies the primary star of hs1857+5144 as a dao white dwarf. combining theresults from our spectroscopy and photometry, we estimate the mass of thecompanion star and the binary inclination to be msec=~0.15-0.30 msun andi=~45-55 deg, respectively. we classify hs1857+5144 as one of the youngestpre-cv known to date. the cooling age of the white dwarf suggests that thepresent system has just emerged from a common envelope phase ~10^5 yr ago.hs1857+5144 will start mass transfer within or below the 2-3h period gap.

0710.1542	the initial-final mass relationship from white dwarfs in common proper  motion pairs	the initial-final mass relationship of white dwarfs, which is poorlyconstrained, is of paramount importance for different aspects in modernastrophysics. from an observational perspective, most of the studies up to nowhave been done using white dwarfs in open clusters. in order to improve theinitial-final mass relationship we explore the possibility of deriving asemi-empirical relation studying white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs. wehave acquired long-slit spectra of the white dwarf members of the selectedcommon proper motion pairs, as well as high resolution spectra of theircompanions. from these observations, a full analysis of the two members of eachcommon proper motion pair has lead to the initial and final masses of the whitedwarfs. these observations have allowed us to provide updated information forthe white dwarfs, since some of them were misclassified. this work is the firstone in using common proper motion pairs to improve the initial-final massrelationship, and has also allowed to cover the poorly explored low-massdomain. as in the case of studies based on white dwarfs in open clusters, thedistribution of the semi-empirical data presents a large scatter, which ishigher than the expected uncertainties in the derived values. this suggeststhat the initial-final mass relationship may not be a single-valued function.

1211.5321	automated unsupervised classification of the sloan digital sky survey  stellar spectra using k-means clustering	(abridged) this paper explores the use of k-means clustering as a tool forautomated unsupervised classification of massive stellar spectral catalogs. theclassification criteria are defined by the data and the algorithm, with noprior physical framework. we work with a representative set of stellar spectraassociated with the sdss segue and segue-2 programs. we classify the originalspectra as well as the spectra with the continuum removed. the second set onlycontains spectral lines, and it is less dependent on uncertainties of the fluxcalibration. the classification of the spectra with continuum renders 16 majorclasses. roughly speaking, stars are split according to their colors, withenough finesse to distinguish dwarfs from giants of the same effectivetemperature, but with difficulties to separate stars with differentmetallicities. overall, there is no one-to-one correspondence between theclasses we derive and the mk types. the classification of spectra withoutcontinuum renders 13 classes, the color separation is not so sharp, but itdistinguishes stars of the same effective temperature and differentmetallicities. some classes thus obtained present a fairly small range ofphysical parameters (200 k in effective temperature, 0.25 dex in surfacegravity, and 0.35 dex in metallicity), so that the classification can be usedto estimate the main physical parameters of some stars at a minimumcomputational cost. we also analyze the outliers of the classification. most ofthem turn out to be failures of the reduction pipeline, but there are also highredshift qsos, multiple stellar systems, dust-reddened stars, galaxies, and,finally, odd spectra whose nature we have not decipher. the template spectrarepresentative of the classes are publicly available(ftp://stars:kmeans@ftp.iac.es).

1301.3703	convective line shifts for the gaia rvs from the cifist 3d model  atmosphere grid	to derive space velocities of stars along the line of sight from wavelengthshifts in stellar spectra requires accounting for a number of second-ordereffects. for most stars, gravitational redshifts, convective blueshifts, andtransverse stellar motion are the dominant contributors. we provide theoreticalcorrections for the net velocity shifts due to convection expected for themeasurements from the gaia radial velocity spectrometer (rvs). we used a set ofthree-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface convectioncomputed with co5bold to calculate spectra of late-type stars in the gaia rvsrange and to infer the net velocity offset that convective motions will inducein radial velocities derived by cross-correlation. the net velocity shiftsderived by cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectralresolution of the observations. convective shifts for gaia rvs observations areless than 0.1 km/s for late-k-type stars, and they increase with stellar mass,reaching about 0.3 km/s or more for early f-type dwarfs. this tendency is theresult of an increase with effective temperature in both temperature andvelocity fluctuations in the line-forming region. our simulations also indicatethat the net rvs convective shifts can be positive (i.e. redshifts) in somecases. overall, the blueshifts weaken slightly with increasing surface gravity,and are enhanced at low metallicity. gravitational redshifts amount up to 0.7km/s and dominate convective blueshifts for dwarfs, but become much weaker forgiants.

1311.4549	chemodynamics of the milky way. i. the first year of apogee data	we investigate the chemo-kinematic properties of the milky way disc byexploring the first year of data from the apache point observatory galacticevolution experiment (apogee), and compare our results to smaller opticalhigh-resolution samples in the literature, as well as results from lowerresolution surveys such as gcs, segue and rave. we start by selecting ahigh-quality sample in terms of chemistry ($\sim$ 20.000 stars) and, aftercomputing distances and orbital parameters for this sample, we employ a numberof useful subsets to formulate constraints on galactic chemical andchemodynamical evolution processes in the solar neighbourhood and beyond (e.g.,metallicity distributions -- mdfs, [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] diagrams, andabundance gradients). our red giant sample spans distances as large as 10 kpcfrom the sun.  we find remarkable agreement between the recently published local (d $&lt;$ 100pc) high-resolution high-s/n harps sample and our local hq sample (d $&lt;$ 1kpc). the local mdf peaks slightly below solar metallicity, and exhibits anextended tail towards [fe/h] $= -$1, whereas a sharper cut-off is seen atlarger metallicities. the apogee data also confirm the existence of a gap inthe [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] abundance diagram. when expanding our sample tocover three different galactocentric distance bins, we find thehigh-[$\alpha$/fe] stars to be rare towards the outer zones, as previouslysuggested in the literature. for the gradients in [fe/h] and [$\alpha$/fe],measured over a range of 6 $ &lt; $ r $ &lt;$ 11 kpc in galactocentric distance, wefind a good agreement with the gradients traced by the gcs and rave dwarfsamples. for stars with 1.5 $&lt;$ z $&lt;$ 3 kpc, we find a positive metallicitygradient and a negative gradient in [$\alpha$/fe].

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

0802.2177	center-to-limb variation of solar 3-d hydrodynamical simulations	we examine closely the solar center-to-limb variation of continua and linesand compare observations with predictions from both a 3-d hydrodynamicsimulation of the solar surface (provided by m. asplund and collaborators) and1-d model atmospheres. intensities from the 3-d time series are derived bymeans of the new synthesis code asset, which overcomes limitations ofpreviously available codes by including a consistent treatment of scatteringand allowing for arbitrarily complex line and continuum opacities. in thecontinuum, we find very similar discrepancies between synthesis and observationfor both types of model atmospheres. this is in contrast to previous studiesthat used a ``horizontally'' and time averaged representation of the 3-d modeland found a significantly larger disagreement with observations. the presenceof temperature and velocity fields in the 3-d simulation provides a significantadvantage when it comes to reproduce solar spectral line shapes. nonetheless, acomparison of observed and synthetic equivalent widths reveals that the 3-dmodel also predicts more uniform abundances as a function of position angle onthe disk. we conclude that the 3-d simulation provides not only a morerealistic description of the gas dynamics, but, despite its simplifiedtreatment of the radiation transport, it also predicts reasonably well theobserved center-to-limb variation, which is indicative of a thermal structurefree from significant systematic errors.

1401.5918	espresso: the next european exoplanet hunter	the acronym espresso stems for echelle spectrograph for rocky exoplanets andstable spectroscopic observations; this instrument will be the next vlt highresolution spectrograph. the spectrograph will be installed at thecombined-coud\'e laboratory of the vlt and linked to the four 8.2 m unittelescopes (ut) through four optical coud\'e trains. espresso will combineefficiency and extreme spectroscopic precision. espresso is foreseen to achievea gain of two magnitudes with respect to its predecessor harps, and to improvethe instrumental radial-velocity precision to reach the 10 cm/s level. it canbe operated either with a single ut or with up to four uts, enabling anadditional gain in the latter mode. the incoherent combination of fourtelescopes and the extreme precision requirements called for many innovativedesign solutions while ensuring the technical heritage of the successful harpsexperience. espresso will allow to explore new frontiers in most domains ofastrophysics that require precision and sensitivity. the main scientificdrivers are the search and characterization of rocky exoplanets in thehabitable zone of quiet, nearby g to m-dwarfs and the analysis of thevariability of fundamental physical constants. the project passed the finaldesign review in may 2013 and entered the manufacturing phase. espresso will beinstalled at the paranal observatory in 2016 and its operation is planned tostart by the end of the same year.

1402.0751	making miles better for stellar population modelling	in order to build more realistic single stellar population (ssp) models withvariable alpha-enhancement, we have recently determined [mg/fe] in a uniformscale with a precision of about 0.1 dex for 752 stars in the miles empiricallibrary. the [alpha/fe] abundance ratio is commonly used as a good temporalscale indicator of star formation, taking mg as a template for alpha elements.calcium is another element whose abundance is currently being investigated forthe miles stars. the miles library is also being expanded by around 20% byincluding stars with known teff, log g, [fe/h] and [mg/fe]. the transformationof their photospheric parameters to the miles system has been carried out, butthe calibration of their [mg/fe] is still in progress. in parallel, c, n and oabundances are also being compiled from literature for the library starsbecause they play an important role in the photospheric opacity, particularlyinfluencing the blue spectral region. the galactic kinematic classification ofmiles stars with compiled [mg/fe] has been just computed such that thisinformation can be considered in the ssp modeling. comparisons of theoreticalstellar predictions of the lick line-strength indices against the miles datahave revealed the good behaviour of fe-sensitive indices predictions, whilehighlighting areas for improvement in some models for the higher order h-balmerfeatures.

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7568	the gaia-eso survey: the galactic thick to thin disc transition	(abridged) we have used the atmospheric parameters, [alpha/fe] abundances andradial velocities, determined from the gaia-eso survey giraffe spectra offgk-type stars (idr1), to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation of thedisc stellar populations. we focuss on a subsample of 1016 stars with highquality parameters, covering the volume |z|&lt;4.5kpc and r in the range 2-13kpc.we have identified a thin to thick disc separation in the [alpha/fe] vs [m/h]plane, thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number densitydistribution. the thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layersabove the galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/fe] decreases.the thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to theplane at all metallicities. our data confirm the already known correlationsbetween v_phi and [m/h] for the two discs. for the thick disc sequence, a studyof the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to64km/s/dex. the distributions of v_phi, v_z, and orbital parameters areanalysed for the chemically separated samples. concerning the gradients withgalactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of v_phi, a[m/h] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/fe] gradient. forthe thick disc, flat gradients in [m/h] and [alpha/fe] are derived. ourchemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems tohave experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increasedprogressively, and, possibly, the v_phi dispersion decreased. at [m/h]-0.25dexand [alpha/fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance tothe galactic plane, v_phi, v_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with thoseof the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between thesepopulations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.

1405.2180	extinction maps towards the milky way bulge: 2d and 3d tests with apogee	galactic interstellar extinction maps are powerful and necessary tools formilky way structure and stellar population analyses, particularly toward theheavily-reddened bulge and in the midplane. however, due to the difficulty ofobtaining reliable extinction measures and distances for a large number ofstars that are independent of these maps, tests of their accuracy andsystematics have been limited.  our goal is to assess a variety of photometric stellar extinction estimates,including both 2d and 3d extinction maps, using independent extinction measuresbased on a large spectroscopic sample of stars towards the milky way bulge. weemploy stellar atmospheric parameters derived from high-resolution $h$-bandapogee spectra, combined with theoretical stellar isochrones, to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances for a sample of more than 2400 giantstowards the milky way bulge. we compare these extinction values to thosepredicted by individual near-ir and near+mid-ir stellar colors, 2d bulgeextinction maps and 3d extinction maps. the long baseline, near+mid-ir stellarcolors are, on average, the most accurate predictors of the apogee extinctionestimates, and the 2d and 3d extinction maps derived from different stellarpopulations along different sightlines show varying degrees of reliability. wepresent the results of all of the comparisons and discuss reasons for theobserved discrepancies. we also demonstrate how the particular stellaratmospheric models adopted can have a strong impact on this type of analysis,and discuss related caveats.

1406.4997	deep sdss optical spectroscopy of distant halo stars i. atmospheric  parameters and stellar metallicity distribution	we analyze a sample of tens of thousands of spectra of halo turnoff stars,obtained with the optical spectrographs of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),to characterize the stellar halo population "in situ" out to a distance of afew tens of kpc from the sun. in this paper we describe the derivation ofatmospheric parameters. we also derive the overall stellar metallicitydistribution based on f-type stars observed as flux calibrators for thebaryonic oscillations spectroscopic survey (boss). our analysis is based on anautomated method that determines the set of parameters of a model atmospherethat reproduces each observed spectrum best. we used an optimization algorithmand evaluate model fluxes by means of interpolation in a precomputed grid. inour analysis, we account for the spectrograph's varying resolution as afunction of fiber and wavelength. our results for early sdss (pre-boss upgrade)data compare well with those from the segue stellar parameter pipeline (sspp),except for stars with logg (cgs units) lower than 2.5. an analysis of stars inthe globular cluster m13 reveals a dependence of the inferred metallicity onsurface gravity for stars with logg &lt; 2.5, confirming the systematicsidentified in the comparison with the sspp. we find that our metallicityestimates are significantly more precise than the sspp results. we obtain ahalo metallicity distribution that is narrower and more asymmetric than inprevious studies. the lowest gravity stars in our sample, at tens of kpc fromthe sun, indicate a shift of the metallicity distribution to lower abundances,consistent with what is expected from a dual halo system in the milky way.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1411.4886	the gaia-eso survey: kinematics of seven galactic globular clusters	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed atinvestigating the origin and formation history of our galaxy by collectingspectroscopy of representative samples (about 10^5 milky way stars) of allgalactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. the survey usesglobular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellaratmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars inclusters, along with radial velocity determinations. we used precise radialvelocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (ngc 1851, ngc2808, ngc 4372, ngc 4833, ngc 5927, ngc 6752, and ngc 7078) to validatepipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internalkinematics. radial velocity measurements were extracted from flames/giraffespectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal datarelease of data products to eso. we complemented our sample with eso archivaldata obtained with different instrument configurations. reliable radialvelocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained intotal. we measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions,and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters,providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of thecentral velocity dispersion for the cluster ngc~5927. finally, we explore thepossible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. theanalysis we present here demonstrates that gaia-eso survey data aresufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systemsand stellar populations in the milky way.

1501.01330	the gaia-eso survey: discovery of a spatially extended low-mass  population in the vela ob2 association	the nearby (distance~350-400 pc), rich vela ob2 association, includes$\gamma^2$ velorum, one of the most massive binaries in the solar neighbourhoodand an excellent laboratory for investigating the formation and early evolutionof young clusters. recent gaia-eso survey observations have led to thediscovery of two kinematically distinct populations in the young (10-15 myr)cluster immediately surrounding $\gamma^2$ velorum. here we analyse the resultsof gaia-eso survey observations of ngc 2547, a 35 myr cluster located twodegrees south of $\gamma^2$ velorum. the radial velocity distribution oflithium-rich pre-main sequence stars shows a secondary population that iskinematically distinct from and younger than ngc 2547. the radial velocities,lithium absorption lines, and the positions in a colour-magnitude diagram ofthis secondary population are consistent with those of one of the componentsdiscovered around $\gamma^2$ velorum. this result shows that there is a young,low-mass stellar population spread over at least several square degrees in thevela ob2 association. this population could have originally been part of acluster around $\gamma^2$ velorum that expanded after gas expulsion or formedin a less dense environment that is spread over the whole vela ob2 region.

1501.04450	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of pre-main sequence stellar spectra	this paper describes the analysis of uves and giraffe spectra acquired by thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey in the fields of young clusters whosepopulation includes pre-main sequence (pms) stars. both methods that have beenextensively used in the past and new ones developed in the contest of thegaia-eso survey enterprise are available and used. the internal precision ofthese quantities is estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by suchdifferent methods, while the accuracy is estimated by comparison withindependent external data, like effective temperature and surface gravityderived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars.specific strategies are implemented to deal with fast rotation, accretionsignatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling. the analysis carried out onspectra acquired in young clusters' fields during the first 18 months ofobservations, up to june 2013, is presented in preparation of the first releaseof advanced data products. stellar parameters obtained with the higherresolution and larger wavelength coverage from uves are reproduced withcomparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lowerresolution of the giraffe setup adopted for young stars, which allows us toprovide with confidence stellar parameters for the much larger giraffe sample.precisions are estimated to be $\approx$ 120 k r.m.s. in teff, $\approx$0.3 dexr.m.s. in logg, and $\approx$0.15 dex r.m.s. in [fe/h], for both the uves andgiraffe setups.

1502.03934	the gaia-eso survey: a globular cluster escapee in the galactic halo	a small fraction of the halo field is made up of stars that share the lightelement (z&lt;=13) anomalies characteristic of second generation globular cluster(gc) stars. the ejected stars shed light on the formation of the galactic haloby tracing the dynamical history of the clusters, which are believed to haveonce been more massive. some of these ejected stars are expected to show strongal enhancement at the expense of shortage of mg, but until now no such star hasbeen found. we search for outliers in the mg and al abundances of the fewhundreds of halo field stars observed in the first eighteen months of thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey. one halo star at the base of the redgiant branch, here referred to as 22593757-4648029 is found to have[mg/fe]=-0.36+-0.04 and [al/fe]=0.99+-0.08, which is compatible with the mostextreme ratios detected in gcs so far. we compare the orbit of 22593757-4648029to gcs of similar metallicity and find it unlikely that this star has beentidally stripped with low ejection velocity from any of the clusters. however,both chemical and kinematic arguments render it plausible that the star hasbeen ejected at high velocity from the anomalous gc omega centauri within thelast few billion years. we cannot rule out other progenitor gcs, because somemay have disrupted fully, and the abundance and orbital data are inadequate formany of those that are still intact.

1502.05237	new h-band stellar spectral libraries for the sdss-iii/apogee survey	the sloan digital sky survey--iii (sdss--iii) apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee) has obtained high resolution (r $\sim$22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio ($&gt;$ 100) spectra in the h$-$band($\sim$1.5$-$1.7 $\mu$m) for about 146,000 stars in the milky way galaxy. wehave computed spectral libraries with effective temperature ($t\rm{_{eff}}$)ranging from 3500 to 8000 k for the automated chemical analy\-sis of the surveydata. the libraries, used to derive stellar parameters and abundances from theapogee spectra in the sdss--iii data release 12 (dr12), are based on atlas9model atmospheres and the ass$\epsilon$t spectral synthesis code. we present asecond set of libraries based on marcs model atmospheres and the spectralsynthesis code turbospectrum. the atlas9/ass$\epsilon$t ($t\rm{_{eff}}$ =3500$-$8000 k) and marcs/turbospectrum ($t\rm{_{eff}}$ = 3500$-$5500 k) gridscover a wide range of metallicity ($-$2.5 $\leq$ [m/h] $\leq$ $+$0.5 dex),surface gravity (0 $\leq$ log $g$ $\leq$ 5 dex), microturbulence (0.5 $\leq$$\xi$ $\leq$ 8 km~s$^{-1}$), carbon ($-$1 $\leq$ [c/m] $\leq$ $+$1 dex),nitrogen ($-$1 $\leq$ [n/m] $\leq$ $+$1 dex), and $\alpha$-element ($-$1 $\leq$[$\alpha$/m] $\leq$ $+$1 dex) variations, having thus seven dimensions. wecompare the atlas9/ass$\epsilon$t and marcs/turbospectrum libraries and applyboth of them to the analysis of the observed h$-$band spectra of the sun andthe k2 giant arcturus, as well as to a selected sample of well-known giantstars observed at very high-resolution. the new apogee libraries are publiclyavailable and can be employed for chemical studies in the h$-$band using otherhigh-resolution spectrographs.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1503.04362	deep sdss optical spectroscopy of distant halo stars ii. iron, calcium,  and magnesium abundances	we analyze a sample of 3,944 low-resolution (r ~ 2000) optical spectra fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss), focusing on stars with effectivetemperatures 5800 &lt; teff &lt; 6300 k, and distances from the milky way plane inexcess of 5 kpc, and determine their abundances of fe, ca, and mg. we followedthe same methodology as in the previous paper in this series, derivingatmospheric parameters by chi2 minimization, but this time we obtained theabundances of individual elements by fitting their associated spectral lines.distances were calculated from absolute magnitudes obtained by a statisticalcomparison of our stellar parameters with stellar-evolution models. theobservations reveal a decrease in the abundances of iron, calcium, andmagnesium at large distances from the galactic center. the median abundancesfor the halo stars analyzed are fairly constant up to a galactocentric distancer ~ 20 kpc, rapidly decrease between r ~ 20 and r ~ 40 kpc, and flatten out tosignificantly lower values at larger distances, consistent with previousstudies. in addition, we examine the [ca/fe] and [mg/fe] as a function of fe/hand galactocentric distance. our results show that the most distant parts ofthe halo show a steeper variation of the [ca/fe] and [mg/fe] with iron. wefound that at the range -1.6 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.4 [ca/fe] decreases with distance,in agreement with earlier results based on local stars. however, the oppositetrend is apparent for [mg/fe]. our conclusion that the outer regions of thehalo are more metal-poor than the inner regions, based on in situ observationsof distant stars, agrees with recent results based on inferences from thekinematics of more local stars, and with predictions of recent galaxy formationsimulations for galaxies similar to the milky way.

1503.06990	young [$\alpha$/fe]-enhanced stars discovered by corot and apogee: what  is their origin?	we report the discovery of a group of apparently young corot red-giant starsexhibiting enhanced [alpha/fe] abundance ratios (as determined from apogeespectra) with respect to solar values. their existence is not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the milky way, and shows that thechemical-enrichment history of the galactic disc is more complex. we findsimilar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could berobustly obtained, although in smaller relative numbers, which could explainwhy these stars have not received prior attention. the young [alpha/fe]-richstars are much more numerous in the corot-apogee (corogee) inner-field samplethan in any other high-resolution sample available at present, as only corogeecan explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. thekinematic properties of the young [$\alpha$/fe]-rich stars are not clearlythick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the galacticmid-plane. our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguingobservations in the milky way is that these stars were formed close to the endof the galactic bar, near corotation -- a region where gas can be kept inertfor longer times, compared to other regions shocked more frequently by thepassage of spiral arms. moreover, that is where the mass return from olderinner-disc stellar generations should be maximal (according to an inside-outdisc-formation scenario), further diluting the in-situ gas. other possibilitiesto explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are alsodiscussed.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.

1509.07104	evidence for a metal-poor population in the inner galactic bulge	the inner galactic bulge has, until recently, been avoided in chemicalevolution studies due to extreme extinction and stellar crowding. large,near-ir spectroscopic surveys, such as apogee, allow for the first time themeasurement of metallicities in the inner region of our galaxy. we studymetallicities of 33 k/m giants situated in the galactic center region fromobservations obtained with the apogee survey. we selected k/m giants withreliable stellar parameters from the apogee/aspcap pipeline. distances,interstellar extinction values, and radial velocities were checked to confirmthat these stars are indeed situated in the inner galactic bulge. we find ametal-rich population centered at [m/h] = +0.4 dex, in agreement with earlierstudies of other bulge regions, but also a peak at low metallicity around $\rm[m/h] = -1.0\,dex$, suggesting the presence of a metal-poor population whichhas not previously been detected in the central region. our results indicate adominant metal-rich population with a metal-poor component that is enhanced inthe $\alpha$-elements. this metal-poor population may be associated with theclassical bulge and a fast formation scenario.

1510.00111	stellar parametrization from gaia rvs spectra	among the myriad of data collected by the esa gaia satellite, about 150million spectra will be delivered by the radial velocity spectrometer (rvs) forstars as faint as g_rvs~16. a specific stellar parametrization will beperformed for most of these rvs spectra. some individual chemical abundanceswill also be estimated for the brightest targets. we describe the differentparametrization codes that have been specifically developed or adapted for rvsspectra within the gsp-spec working group of the analysis consortium. thetested codes are based on optimization (ferre and gauguin), projection(matisse) or pattern recognition methods (artificial neural networks). wepresent and discuss their expected performances in the recovered stellaratmospheric parameters (teff, log(g), [m/h]) for b- to k- type stars. theperformances for the determinations of [alpha/fe] ratios are also presented forcool stars. for all the considered stellar types, stars brighter thang_rvs~12.5 will be very efficiently parametrized by the gsp-spec pipeline,including solid estimations of [alpha/fe]. typical internal errors for fgkmetal-rich and metal-intermediate stars are around 40k in teff , 0.1dex inlog(g), 0.04dex in [m/h], and 0.03dex in [alpha/fe] at g_rvs=10.3. similaraccuracies in teff and [m/h] are found for a-type stars, while the log(g)derivation is more accurate. for the faintest stars, with g_rvs&gt;13-14, aspectrophotometric teff input will allow the improvement of the final gsp-specparametrization. the reported results show that the contribution of the rvsbased stellar parameters will be unique in the brighter part of the gaia surveyallowing crucial age estimations, and accurate chemical abundances. this willconstitute a unique and precious sample for which many pieces of the milky wayhistory puzzle will be available, with unprecedented precision and statisticalrelevance.

astro-ph;0005320	line formation in solar granulation: i. fe line shapes, shifts and  asymmetries	realistic ab-initio 3d, radiative-hydrodynamical convection simulations ofthe solar granulation have been applied to fei and feii line formation. incontrast to classical analyses based on hydrostatic 1d model atmospheres theprocedure contains no adjustable free parameters but the treatment of thenumerical viscosity in the construction of the 3d, time-dependent,inhomogeneous model atmosphere and the elemental abundance in the 3d spectralsynthesis. however, the numerical viscosity is introduced purely for numericalstability purposes and is determined from standard hydrodynamical test caseswith no adjustments allowed to improve the agreement with the observationalconstraints from the solar granulation. the non-thermal line broadening ismainly provided by the doppler shifts arising from the convective flows in thesolar photosphere and the solar oscillations. the almost perfect agreementbetween the predicted temporally and spatially averaged line profiles for weakfe lines with the observed profiles and the absence of trends in derivedabundances with line strengths, seem to imply that the micro- andmacroturbulence concepts are obsolete in these 3d analyses. furthermore, thetheoretical line asymmetries and shifts show a very satisfactory agreement withobservations with an accuracy of typically 50-100 m/s on an absolute velocityscale. the remaining minor discrepancies point to how the convectionsimulations can be refined further.

(2000). infact, perhaps fortuitously, reasonable agreement is found near solarmetallicity, while we find significantly cooler temperatures for lowmetallicity stars of around solar temperature.

astro-ph;0312290	line formation in solar granulation: iv. [o i], oi and oh lines and the  photospheric o abundance	the solar photospheric oxygen abundance has been determined from [oi], oi, ohvibration-rotation and oh pure rotation lines by means of a realistictime-dependent, 3d, hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. in the caseof the oi lines, 3d non-lte calculations have been performed, revealingsignificant departures from lte as a result of photon losses in the lines. wederive a solar oxygen abundance of log o = 8.66 +/- 0.05. all oxygendiagnostics yield highly consistent abundances, in sharp contrast with theresults of classical 1d model atmospheres. this low value is in good agreementwith measurements of the local interstellar medium and nearby b stars. this lowabundance is also supported by the excellent correspondence between lines ofvery different line formation sensitivities, and between the observed andpredicted line shapes and center-to-limb variations. together with thecorresponding down-ward revisions of the solar carbon, nitrogen and neonabundances, the resulting significant decrease in solar metal mass fraction toz = 0.0126 can, however, potentially spoil the impressive agreement betweenpredicted and observed sound speed in the solar interior determined fromhelioseismology.

astro-ph;0405154	center-to-limb variation of solar line profiles as a test of nlte line  formation calculations	we present new observations of the center-to-limb variation of spectral linesin the quiet sun. our long-slit spectra are corrected for scattered light,which amounts to 4-8 % of the continuum intensity, by comparison with a fouriertransform spectrum of the disk center. we examine the effect of inelasticcollisions with neutral hydrogen in nlte line formation calculations of theoxygen infrared triplet, and the na i 6160.8 a line. adopting a classicalone-dimensional theoretical model atmosphere, we find that the sodiumtransition, formed in higher layers, is much more effectively thermalized byhydrogen collisions than the high-excitation oxygen lines. this result appearsas a simple consequence of the decrease of the ratio nh/ne with depth in thesolar photosphere. the center-to-limb variation of the selected lines isstudied both under lte and nlte conditions. in the nlte analysis, inelasticcollisions with hydrogen atoms are considered with a simple approximation orneglected, in an attempt to test the validity of such approximation. for thesodium line studied, the best agreement between theory and observation happenswhen nlte is considered and inelastic collisions with hydrogen are neglected inthe rate equations. the analysis of the oxygen triplet benefits from a verydetailed calculation using an lte three-dimensional model atmosphere and nlteline formation. the chi**2 statistics favors including hydrogen collisions withthe approximation adopted, but the oxygen abundance derived in that case issignificantly higher than the value derived from oh infrared transitions.
