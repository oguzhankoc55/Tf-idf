0908.1394	simulations of quintessential cold dark matter: beyond the cosmological  constant	we study the nonlinear growth of cosmic structure in different dark energymodels, using large volume n-body simulations. we consider a range ofquintessence models which feature both rapidly and slowly varying dark energyequations of state, and compare the growth of structure to that in a universewith a cosmological constant. the adoption of a quintessence model changes theexpansion history of the universe, the form of the linear theory power spectrumand can alter key observables, such as the horizon scale and the distance tolast scattering. we incorporate these effects into our simulations in stages toisolate the impact of each on the growth of structure. the difference instructure formation can be explained to first order by the difference in growthfactor at a given epoch; this scaling also accounts for the nonlinear growth atthe 15% level. we find that quintessence models that are different from$\lambda$cdm both today and at high redshifts $(z \sim 1000)$ and which featurelate $(z&lt;2)$, rapid transitions in the equation of state, can have identicalbaryonic acoustic oscillation (bao) peak positions to those in $\lambda$cdm. wefind that these models have higher abundances of dark matter haloes at $z&gt;0$compared to $\lambda$cdm and so measurements of the mass function should allowus to distinguish these quintessence models from a cosmological constant.however, we find that a second class of quintessence models, whose equation ofstate makes an early $(z&gt;2)$ rapid transition to $w=-1$, cannot bedistinguished from $\lambda$cdm using measurements of the mass function or thebao, even if these models have non-negligible amounts of dark energy at earlytimes.

1003.4282	modelling redshift space distortions in hierarchical cosmologies	the anisotropy of clustering in redshift space provides a direct measure ofthe growth rate of large scale structure in the universe. future galaxyredshift surveys will make high precision measurements of these distortions,and will potentially allow us to distinguish between different scenarios forthe accelerating expansion of the universe. accurate predictions are needed inorder to distinguish between competing cosmological models. we study thedistortions in the redshift space power spectrum in $\lambda$cdm andquintessence dark energy models, using large volume n-body simulations, andtest predictions for the form of the redshift space distortions. we find thatthe linear perturbation theory prediction by kaiser (1987) is a poor fit to themeasured distortions, even on surprisingly large scales $k \ge 0.05h$mpc$^{-1}$. an improved model for the redshift space power spectrum,including the non-linear velocity divergence power spectrum, is presented andagrees with the power spectra measured from the simulations up to $k \sim 0.2h$mpc$^{-1}$. we have found a density-velocity relation which is cosmologyindependent and which relates the non-linear velocity divergence spectrum tothe non-linear matter power spectrum. we provide a formula which generates thenon-linear velocity divergence $p(k)$ at any redshift, using only thenon-linear matter power spectrum and the linear growth factor at the desiredredshift. this formula is accurate to better than 5% on scales $k&lt;0.2 h$mpc$^{-1}$ for all the cosmological models discussed in this paper. ourresults will extend the statistical power of future galaxy surveys.

1006.3517	designing a space-based galaxy redshift survey to probe dark energy	a space-based galaxy redshift survey would have enormous power inconstraining dark energy and testing general relativity, provided that itsparameters are suitably optimized. we study viable space-based galaxy redshiftsurveys, exploring the dependence of the dark energy task force (detf)figure-of-merit (fom) on redshift accuracy, redshift range, survey area, targetselection, and forecast method. fitting formulae are provided for convenience.we also consider the dependence on the information used: the full galaxy powerspectrum p(k, p(k) marginalized over its shape, or just the baryon acousticoscillations (bao). we find that the inclusion of growth rate information(extracted using redshift space distortion and galaxy clustering amplitudemeasurements) leads to a factor of ~ 3 improvement in the fom, assuming generalrelativity is not modified. this inclusion partially compensates for the lossof information when only the bao are used to give geometrical constraints,rather than using the full p(k) as a standard ruler. we find that a space-basedgalaxy redshift survey covering ~20,000 deg^2 over 0.5&lt; z &lt; 2 with\sigma_z/(1+z)&lt;= 0.001 exploits a redshift range that is only easily accessiblefrom space, extends to sufficiently low redshifts to allow both a vast 3-d mapof the universe using a single tracer population, and overlaps withground-based surveys to enable robust modeling of systematic effects. we arguethat these parameters are close to their optimal values given currentinstrumental and practical constraints.

0709.0298	narrow-band surveys for very high redshift lyman-alpha emitters	context: many current and future surveys aim to detect the highest redshift(z &gt;~ 7) sources through their lyman-alpha (ly-alpha) emission, using thenarrow-band imaging method. however, to date the surveys have only yieldednon-detections and upper limits as no survey has reached the necessarycombination of depth and area to detect these very young star forming galaxies.  aims: we aim to calculate model luminosity functions and mock surveys ofly-alpha emitters at z &gt;~ 7 based on a variety of approaches.  methods: we calculate model luminosity functions at different redshifts basedon three different approaches: a semi-analytical model based on cdm, a simplephenomenological model, and an extrapolation of observed schechter functions atlower redshifts. the results of the first two models are compared withobservations made at redshifts z ~ 5.7 and z ~ 6.5, and they are thenextrapolated to higher redshift.  results: we present model luminosity functions for redshifts between z = 7 -12.5 and give specific number predictions for future planned or possiblenarrow-band surveys for ly-alpha emitters. we also investigate what constraintsfuture observations will be able to place on the ly-alpha luminosity functionat very high redshift.  conclusion: it should be possible to observe z = 7 - 10 ly-alpha emitterswith present or near-future instruments if enough observing time is allocated.in particular, large area surveys such as elvis (emission line galaxies withvista survey) will be useful in collecting a large sample. however, to get alarge enough sample to constrain well the z &gt;= 10 ly-alpha luminosity function,instruments further in the future, such as an elt, will be necessary.

1011.2842	testing gravity using the growth of large scale structure in the  universe	future galaxy surveys hope to distinguish between the dark energy andmodified gravity scenarios for the accelerating expansion of the universe usingthe distortion of clustering in redshift space. the aim is to model the formand size of the distortion to infer the rate at which large scale structuregrows. we test this hypothesis and assess the performance of currenttheoretical models for the redshift space distortion using large volume n-bodysimulations of the gravitational instability process. we simulate competingcosmological models which have identical expansion histories - one is aquintessence dark energy model with a scalar field and the other is a modifiedgravity model with a time varying gravitational constant - and demonstrate thatthey do indeed produce different redshift space distortions. this is the firsttime this approach has been verified using a technique that can follow thegrowth of structure at the required level of accuracy. our comparisons showthat theoretical models for the redshift space distortion based on linearperturbation theory give a surprisingly poor description of the simulationresults. furthermore, the application of such models can give rise tocatastrophic systematic errors leading to incorrect interpretation of theobservations. we show that an improved model is able to extract the correctgrowth rate. further enhancements to theoretical models of redshift spacedistortions, calibrated against simulations, are needed to fully exploit theforthcoming high precision clustering measurements.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1011.5506	on the impact of empirical and theoretical star formation laws on galaxy  formation	we investigate the consequences of applying different star formation laws inthe galaxy formation model galform. three broad star formation laws areimplemented: the empirical relations of kennicutt and schmidt and blitz &amp;rosolowsky and the theoretical model of krumholz, mckee &amp; tumlinson. these lawshave no free parameters once calibrated against observations of the starformation rate (sfr) and gas surface density in nearby galaxies. we start frompublished models, and investigate which observables are sensitive to a changein the star formation law, without altering any other model parameters. we showthat changing the star formation law (i) does not significantly affect eitherthe star formation history of the universe or the galaxy luminosity functionsin the optical and near-ir, due to an effective balance between the quiescentand burst star formation modes; (ii) greatly affects the cold gas contents ofgalaxies; (iii) changes the location of galaxies in the sfr versus stellar massplane, so that a second sequence of "passive" galaxies arises, in addition tothe known "active" sequence. we show that this plane can be used todiscriminate between the star formation laws.

1105.2294	cosmic evolution of the atomic and molecular gas content of galaxies	we study the evolution of the cold gas content of galaxies by splitting theinterstellar medium into its atomic and molecular hydrogen components, usingthe galaxy formation model galform in the lcdm framework. we calculate themolecular-to-atomic hydrogen mass ratio, h2/hi, in each galaxy using twodifferent approaches; the pressure-based empirical relation of blitz &amp;rosolowsky and the theoretical model of krumholz, mckeee &amp; tumlinson, and applythem to consistently calculate the star formation rates of galaxies. we findthat the model based on the blitz &amp; rosolowsky law predicts an hi massfunction, co(1-0) luminosity function, correlations between the h2/hi ratio andstellar and cold gas mass, and infrared-co luminosity relation in goodagreement with local and high redshift observations. the hi mass functionevolves weakly with redshift, with the number density of high mass galaxiesdecreasing with increasing redshift. in the case of the h2 mass function, thenumber density of massive galaxies increases strongly from z=0 to z=2, followedby weak evolution up to z=4. we also find that the h2/hi ratio of galaxies isstrongly dependent on stellar and cold gas mass, and also on redshift. theslopes of the correlations between h2/hi and stellar and cold gas mass hardlyevolve, but the normalisation increases by up to two orders of magnitude fromz=0-8. the strong evolution in the h2 mass function and the h2/hi ratio isprimarily due to the evolution in the sizes of galaxies and secondarily, in thegas fractions. the predicted cosmic density evolution of hi agrees with theobserved evolution inferred from dlas, and is dominated by low/intermediatemass halos. we find that previous theoretical studies have largelyoverestimated the redshift evolution of the global h2/hi ratio due to limitedresolution. we predict a maximum of rho_h2/rho_hi~1.2 at z~3.5.

1106.5701	statistical analysis of galaxy surveys-iv: an objective way to quantify  the impact of superstructures on galaxy clustering statistics	for galaxy clustering to provide robust constraints on cosmologicalparameters and galaxy formation models, it is essential to make reliableestimates of the errors on clustering measurements. we present a new technique,based on a spatial jackknife (jk) resampling, which provides an objective wayto estimate errors on clustering statistics. our approach allows us to set theappropriate size for the jackknife subsamples. the method also provides a meansto assess the impact of individual regions on the measured clustering, andthereby to establish whether or not a given galaxy catalogue is dominated byone or several large structures, preventing it to be considered as a "fairsample". we apply this methodology to the two- and three-point correlationfunctions measured from a volume limited sample of m* galaxies drawn from datarelease seven of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the frequency ofjackknife subsample outliers in the data is shown to be consistent with thatseen in large n-body simulations of clustering in the cosmological constantplus cold dark matter cosmology. we also present a comparison of thethree-point correlation function in sdss and 2dfgrs using this approach andfind consistent measurements between the two samples.

1110.5701	can galactic outflows explain the properties of ly-alpha emitters?	we study the properties of ly-alpha emitters in a cosmological framework bycomputing the escape of ly-alpha photons through galactic outflows. we combinethe galform semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with a monte carloly-alpha radiative transfer code. the properties of ly-alpha emitters at 0&lt;z&lt;7are predicted using two outflow geometries: a shell of neutral gas and a windejecting material, both expanding at constant velocity. we characterise thedifferences in the ly-alpha line profiles predicted by the two outflowgeometries in terms of their width, asymmetry and shift from the line centrefor a set of outflows with different hydrogen column densities, expansionvelocities and metallicities. in general, the ly-alpha line profile of theshell geometry is broader and more asymmetric, and the ly-alpha escape fractionis lower than with the wind geometry for the same set of parameters. in orderto implement the outflow geometries in the semi-analytical model galform, anumber of free parameters in the outflow model are set by matching theluminosity function of ly-alpha emitters over the whole observed redshiftrange. the models are consistent with the observationally inferred ly-alphaescape fractions, equivalent width distributions and with the shape of thely-alpha line from composite spectra. interestingly, our predicted uvluminosity function of ly-alpha emitters and the fraction of ly-alpha emittersin lyman-break galaxy samples at high redshift are in partial agreement withobservations. attenuation of the ly-alpha line by the presence of a neutralintergalactic medium at high redshift could be responsible for thisdisagreement. we predict that ly-alpha emitters constitute a subset of thegalaxy population with lower metallicities, lower instantaneous star formationrates and larger sizes than the overall population at the same uv luminosity.

1204.0795	predictions for the co emission of galaxies from a coupled simulation of  galaxy formation and photon dominated regions	we combine the galaxy formation model galform with the photon dominatedregion code ucl_pdr to study the emission from the rotational transitions of12co (co) in galaxies from z=0 to z=6 in the lambda cdm framework. galform isused to predict the molecular (h2) and atomic hydrogen (hi) gas contents ofgalaxies using the pressure-based empirical star formation relation of blitz &amp;rosolowsky. from the predicted h2 mass and the conditions in the interstellarmedium, we estimate the co emission in the rotational transitions 1-0 to 10-9by applying the ucl_pdr model to each galaxy. we find that deviations from themilky-way co-h2 conversion factor come mainly from variations in metallicity,and in the average gas and star formation rate surface densities. in the localuniverse, the model predicts a co(1-0) luminosity function (lf), co-to-totalinfrared (ir) luminosity ratios for multiple co lines and a co spectral lineenergy distribution (sled) which are in good agreement with observations ofluminous and ultra-luminous ir galaxies. at high redshifts, the predicted cosled of the brightest ir galaxies reproduces the shape and normalization of theobserved co sled. the model predicts little evolution in the co-to-irluminosity ratio for different co transitions, in good agreement withobservations up to z~5. we use this new hybrid model to explore the potentialof using colour selected samples of high-redshift star-forming galaxies tocharacterise the evolution of the cold gas mass in galaxies throughobservations with the atacama large millimeter array.

1205.2698	redshift space distortions in f(r) gravity	we use large volume n-body simulations to predict the clustering of darkmatter in redshift space in f(r) modified gravity cosmologies. this is thefirst time that the nonlinear matter and velocity fields have been resolved tosuch a high level of accuracy over a broad range of scales in this class ofmodels. we find significant deviations from the clustering signal in standardgravity, with an enhanced boost in power on large scales and stronger dampingon small scales in the f(r) models compared to gr at redshifts z&lt;1. we measurethe velocity divergence (p_\theta \theta) and matter (p_\delta \delta) powerspectra and find a large deviation in the ratios \sqrt{p_\theta \theta/p_\delta\delta} and p_\delta \theta/p_\delta\delta, between the f(r) models and gr for0.03&lt;k/(h/mpc)&lt;0.5. in linear theory these ratios equal the growth rate ofstructure on large scales. our results show that the simulated ratios agreewith the growth rate for each cosmology (which is scale dependent in the caseof modified gravity) only for extremely large scales, k&lt;0.06h/mpc at z=0. thevelocity power spectrum is substantially different in the f(r) models comparedto gr, suggesting that this observable is a sensitive probe of modifiedgravity. we demonstrate how to extract the matter and velocity power spectrafrom the 2d redshift space power spectrum, p(k,\mu), and can recover thenonlinear matter power spectrum to within a few percent for k&lt;0.1h/mpc.however, the model fails to describe the shape of the 2d power spectrumdemonstrating that an improved model is necessary in order to reconstruct thevelocity power spectrum accurately. the same model can match the monopolemoment to within 3% for gr and 10% for the f(r) cosmology at k&lt;0.2 h/mpc atz=1. our results suggest that the extraction of the velocity power spectrumfrom future galaxy surveys is a promising method to constrain deviations fromgr.

1206.2732	predictions for the intrinsic uv continuum properties of star forming  galaxies and the implications for inferring dust extinction	the observed ultraviolet continuum (uvc) slope is potentially a powerfuldiagnostic of dust obscuration in star forming galaxies. however, the intrinsicslope is also sensitive to the form of the stellar initial mass function (imf)and to the recent star formation and metal enrichment histories of a galaxy.using the galform semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, we investigate theintrinsic distribution of uvc slopes. for star-forming galaxies, we find thatthe intrinsic distribution of uvc slopes at z=0, parameterised by the power lawindex beta, has a standard deviation of sigma_beta=0.30. this suggests anuncertainty on the inferred uv attenuation of a_fuv=0.7$ (assuming a calzettiattenuation curve) for an individual object, even with perfect photometry.furthermore, we find that the intrinsic uvc slope correlates with starformation rate, intrinsic uv luminosity, stellar mass and redshift. thesecorrelations have implications for the interpretation of trends in the observeduvc slope with these quantities irrespective of the sample size or quality ofthe photometry. our results suggest that in some cases the attenuation by dusthas been incorrectly estimated.

1206.4317	the nonlinear matter and velocity power spectra in f(r) gravity	we study the matter and velocity divergence power spectra in a f(r) gravitytheory and their time evolution measured from several large-volume n-bodysimulations with varying box sizes and resolution. we find that accurateprediction of the matter power spectrum in f(r) gravity places strongerrequirements on the simulation than is the case with lcdm, because of thenonlinear nature of the fifth force. linear perturbation theory is shown to bea poor approximation for the f(r) models, except when the chameleon effect isvery weak. we show that the relative differences from the fiducial lcdm modelare much more pronounced in the nonlinear tail of the velocity divergence powerspectrum than in the matter power spectrum, which suggests that future surveyswhich target the collection of peculiar velocity data will open newopportunities to constrain modified gravity theories. a close investigation ofthe time evolution of the power spectra shows that there is a pattern in theevolution history, which can be explained by the properties of thechameleon-type fifth force in f(r) gravity. varying the model parameter |f_r0|,which quantifies the strength of the departure from standard gravity, mainlyvaries the epoch marking the onset of the fifth force, as a result of which thedifferent f(r) models are in different stages of the same evolutionary path atany given time

1209.3473	the accuracy of the uv continuum as an indicator of the star formation  rate in galaxies	the rest-frame intrinsic uv luminosity is often used as an indicator of theinstantaneous star formation rate (sfr) in a galaxy. while it is in general arobust indicator of the ongoing star formation activity, the precise value ofthe calibration relating the uv luminosity to the sfr ($b_{\nu}$), is sensitiveto various physical properties, such as the recent star formation and metalenrichment histories, along with the choice of stellar initial mass function.the distribution of these properties for the star-forming galaxy populationthen suggests that the adoption of a single calibration is not appropriateunless properly qualified with the uncertainties on the calibration. weinvestigate, with the aid of the {\sc galform} semi-analytic model of galaxyformation, the distribution of uv-sfr calibrations obtained using realisticstar formation and metal enrichment histories. at $z=0$, we find that when theinitial mass function is fixed (to the kennicutt imf), the median calibrationis $b_{\rm fuv}=0.9$ where ${\rm sfr}/[{\rm m_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}]=b_{\nu}\times10^{-28}\times l_{\nu}/[{\rm ergs\,s^{-1}\,hz^{-1}}]$. however, the width ofthe distribution $b_{\rm fuv}$ suggests that for a single object there isaround a 20% {\em intrinsic} uncertainty (at $z=0$, rising to $\simeq 30%$ at$z=6$) on the star formation rate inferred from the fuv luminosity withoutadditional constraints on the star formation history or metallicity. we alsofind that the median value of the calibration $b_{\rm fuv}$ is correlated withthe star formation rate and redshift (at $z&gt;3$) raising implications for thecorrect determination of the star formation rate from the uv.

1210.4974	simulations and modelling of the ism in galaxies	the latest observations of molecular gas and the atomic hydrogen content oflocal and high-redshift galaxies, coupled with how these correlate with starformation activity, have revolutionized our ideas about how to model starformation in a galactic context. a successful theory of galaxy formation has toexplain some key facts: (i) high-redshift galaxies have higher molecular gasfractions and star formation rates than local galaxies, (ii) scaling relationsshow that the atomic-to-stellar mass ratio decreases with stellar mass in thelocal universe, and (iii) the global abundance of atomic hydrogen evolves veryweakly with time. we review how modern cosmological simulations of galaxyformation attempt to put these pieces together and highlight how approachessimultaneously solving dark matter and gas physics, and approaches firstsolving the dark matter n-body problem and then dealing with gas physics usingsemi-analytic models, differ and complement each other. we review theobservable predictions, what we think we have learned so far and what stillneeds to be done in the simulations to allow robust testing by the newobservations expected from telescopes such as alma, pdbi, lmt, jvla, askap,meerkat, ska.

1303.6635	a dynamical model of supernova feedback: gas outflows from the  interstellar medium	we present a dynamical model of supernova feedback which follows theevolution of pressurised bubbles driven by supernovae in a multi-phaseinterstellar medium (ism). the bubbles are followed until the point ofbreak-out into the halo, starting from an initial adiabatic phase to aradiative phase. we show that a key property which sets the fate of bubbles inthe ism is the gas surface density, through the work done by the expansion ofbubbles and its role in setting the gas scaleheight. the multi-phasedescription of the ism is essential, and neglecting it leads to order ofmagnitude differences in the predicted outflow rates. we compare our predictedmass loading and outflow velocities to observations of local and high-redshiftgalaxies and find good agreement over a wide range of stellar masses andvelocities. with the aim of analysing the dependence of the mass loading of theoutflow, beta (i.e. the ratio between the outflow and star formation rates), ongalaxy properties, we embed our model in the galaxy formation simulation,galform, set in the lcdm framework. we find that a dependence of beta solely onthe circular velocity, as is widely assumed in the literature, is actually apoor description of the outflow rate, as large variations with redshift andgalaxy properties are obtained. moreover, we find that below a circularvelocity of 80km/s the mass loading saturates. a more fundamental relation isthat between beta and the gas scaleheight of the disk, hg, and the gasfraction, fgas, as beta hg^(1.1) fgas^(0.4), or the gas surface density,\sigma_g, and the gas fraction, as beta \sigma_g^(-0.6) fgas^(0.8). we findthat using the new mass loading model leads to a shallower faint-end slope inthe predicted optical and near-ir galaxy luminosity functions.

1304.4421	single colour diagnostics of the mass-to-light ratio: predictions from  galaxy formation models	accurate galaxy stellar masses are crucial to better understand the physicalmechanisms driving the galaxy formation process. we use synthetic starformation and metal enrichment histories predicted by the {\sc galform} galaxyformation model to investigate the precision with which various colours$(m_{a}-m_{b})$ can alone be used as diagnostics of the stellar mass-to-lightratio. as an example, we find that, at $z=0$, the {\em intrinsic}(b$_{f435w}-$v$_{f606w}$) colour can be used to determine the intrinsicrest-frame $v$-band stellar mass-to-light ratio($\log_{10}\gamma_{v}=\log_{10}[(m/m_{\odot})/(l_{v}/l_{v\odot})]$) with aprecision of $\sigma_{lg\gamma}\simeq 0.06$ when the initial mass function andredshift are known beforehand. while the presence of dust, assuming a universalattenuation curve, can have a systematic effect on the inferred mass-to-lightratio using a single-colour relation, this is typically small as it is oftenpossible to choose a colour for which the dust reddening vector isapproximately aligned with the $(m_{a}-m_{b})-\log_{10}\gamma_{v}$ relation.the precision with which the stellar mass-to-light ratio can be recovered usinga single colour diagnostic rivals implementations of sed fitting using moreinformation but in which simple parameterisations of the star formation andmetal enrichment histories are assumed. to facilitate the wide use of theserelations, we provide the optimal observer frame colour to estimate the stellarmass-to-light ratio, along with the associated parameters, as a function ofredshift ($0&lt;z&lt;1.5$) for two sets of commonly used filters.

1306.3219	nonlinear structure formation in the cubic galileon gravity model	we model the linear and nonlinear growth of large scale structure in thecubic galileon gravity model, by running a suite of n-body cosmologicalsimulations using the {\tt ecosmog} code. our simulations include thevainshtein screening effect, which reconciles the cubic galileon model withlocal tests of gravity. in the linear regime, the amplitude of the matter powerspectrum increases by $\sim 25%$ with respect to the standard $\lambda$cdmmodel today. the modified expansion rate accounts for $\sim 20%$ of thisenhancement, while the fifth force is responsible for only $\sim 5%$. this isbecause the effective unscreened gravitational strength deviates from standardgravity only at late times, even though it can be twice as large today. in thenonlinear regime ($k \gtrsim 0.1 h\rm{mpc}^{-1}$), the fifth force leads toonly a modest increase ($\lesssim 8%$) in the clustering power on all scalesdue to the very efficient operation of the vainshtein mechanism. such a strongeffect is typically not seen in other models with the same screening mechanism.the screening also results in the fifth force increasing the number density ofhalos by less than 10%, on all mass scales. our results show that the screeningdoes not ruin the validity of linear theory on large scales which anticipatesvery strong constraints from galaxy clustering data. we also show that, whilstthe model gives an excellent match to cmb data on small angular scales ($l\gtrsim 50$), the predicted integrated sachs-wolf effect is in tension withplanck/wmap results.

1308.3491	simulating the quartic galileon gravity model on adaptively refined  meshes	we develop a numerical algorithm to solve the high-order nonlinearderivative-coupling equation associated with the quartic galileon model, andimplement it in a modified version of the ramses n-body code to study theeffect of the galileon field on the large-scale matter clustering. thealgorithm is tested for several matter field configurations with differentsymmetries, and works very well. this enables us to perform the firstsimulations for a quartic galileon model which provides a good fit to thecosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy, supernovae and baryonic acousticoscillations (bao) data. our result shows that the vainshtein mechanism in thismodel is very efficient in suppressing the spatial variations of the scalarfield. however, the time variation of the effective newtonian constant causedby the curvature coupling of the galileon field cannot be suppressed by thevainshtein mechanism. this leads to a significant weakening of the strength ofgravity in high-density regions at late times, and therefore a weaker matterclustering on small scales. we also find that without the vainshtein mechanismthe model would have behaved in a completely different way, which shows thecrucial role played by nonlinearities in modified gravity theories and theimportance of performing self-consistent n-body simulations for these theories.

1310.3880	extending the halo mass resolution of $n$-body simulations	we present a scheme to extend the halo mass resolution of n-body simulationsof the hierarchical clustering of dark matter. the method uses the densityfield of the simulation to predict the number of sub-resolution dark matterhaloes expected in different regions. the technique requires as input theabundance of haloes of a given mass and their average clustering, as expressedthrough the linear and higher order bias factors. these quantities can becomputed analytically or, more accurately, derived from a higher resolutionsimulation as done here. our method can recover the abundance and clustering inreal- and redshift-space of haloes with mass below $\sim 7.5 \times10^{13}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ to better than 10%. we demonstrate thetechnique by applying it to an ensemble of 50 low resolution, large-volume$n$-body simulations to compute the correlation function and covariance matrixof luminous red galaxies (lrgs). the limited resolution of the originalsimulations results in them resolving just two thirds of the lrg population. weextend the resolution of the simulations by a factor of 30 in halo mass inorder to recover all lrgs. with existing simulations it is possible to generatea halo catalogue equivalent to that which would be obtained from a $n$-bodysimulation using more than 20 trillion particles; a direct simulation of thissize is likely to remain unachievable for many years. using our method it isnow feasible to build the large numbers of high-resolution large volume mockgalaxy catalogues required to compute the covariance matrices necessary toanalyse upcoming galaxy surveys designed to probe dark energy.

1311.4624	clustering of extremely red objects in elais-n1 from the ukidss dxs with  optical photometry from pan-starrs1 and subaru	we measure the angular clustering of 33 415 extremely red objects (eros) inthe elais-n1 field covering 5.33 deg$^{2}$, which cover the redshift range$z=0.8$ to $2$. this sample was made by merging the ukidss deep extragalacticsurvey (dxs) with the optical subaru and pan-starrs ps1 datasets. we confirmthe existence of a clear break in the angular correlation function at $\sim0.02^{\circ}$ corresponding to $1 h^{-1}$ mpc at $z\sim1$. we find that redderor brighter eros are more clustered than bluer or fainter ones. halo occupationdistribution (hod) model fits imply that the average mass of dark matter haloeswhich host eros is over $10^{13} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ and that eros have a biasranging from 2.7 to 3.5. compared to eros at $z\sim1.1$, at $z\sim1.5$ eroshave a higher bias and fewer are expected to be satellite galaxies.furthermore, eros reside in similar dark matter haloes to those that host$10^{11.0} m_{\odot}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$ galaxies. we compare our newmeasurement and hod fits with the predictions of the galform semi-analyticalgalaxy formation model. overall, the clustering predicted by galform gives anencouraging match to our results. however, compared to our deductions from themeasurements, galform puts eros into lower mass haloes and predicts that alarger fraction of eros are satellite galaxies. this suggests that thetreatment of gas cooling may need to be revised in the model. our analysisillustrates the potential of clustering analyses to provide observationalconstraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation.

1401.1497	halo model and halo properties in galileon gravity cosmologies	we investigate the performance of semi-analytical modelling of large-scalestructure in galileon gravity cosmologies using results from n-bodysimulations. we focus on the cubic and quartic galileon models that provide areasonable fit to cmb, snia and bao data. we demonstrate that the sheth-tormenmass function and linear halo bias can be calibrated to provide a very good fitto our simulation results. we also find that the halo concentration-massrelation is well fitted by a power law. the nonlinear matter power spectrumcomputed in the halo model approach is found to be inaccurate in the mildlynonlinear regime, but captures reasonably well the effects of the vainshteinscreening mechanism on small scales. in the cubic model, the screeningmechanism hides essentially all of the effects of the fifth force insidehaloes. in the case of the quartic model, the screening mechanism leaves behindresidual modifications to gravity, which make the effective gravitationalstrength time-varying and smaller than the standard value. compared to normalgravity, this causes a deficiency of massive haloes and leads to a weakermatter clustering on small scales. for both models, we show that there arerealistic halo occupation distributions of luminous red galaxies that can matchboth the observed large-scale clustering amplitude and the number density ofthese galaxies.

1402.3590	clustering tomography: measuring cosmological distances through angular  clustering in thin redshift shells	we test the cosmological implications of studying galaxy clustering using atomographic approach, by computing the galaxy two-point angular correlationfunction $\omega(\theta)$ in thin redshift shells using aspectroscopic-redshift galaxy survey. the advantages of this procedure are thatit is not necessary to assume a fiducial cosmology in order to convert measuredangular positions and redshifts into distances, and that it gives several (lessaccurate) measurements of the angular diameter distance $d_\rm{a}(z)$ insteadof only one (more precise) measurement of the effective average distance$d_\rm{v}(z)$, which results in better constraints on the expansion history ofthe universe. we test our model for $\omega(\theta)$ and its covariance matrixagainst a set of mock galaxy catalogues and show that this technique is able toextract unbiased cosmological constraints. also, assuming the best-fit$\lambda$cdm cosmology from the cosmic microwave background measurements fromthe planck satellite, we forecast the result of applying this tomographicapproach to the final baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey catalogue incombination with planck for three flat cosmological models, and compare themwith the expected results of the isotropic baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)measurements post-reconstruction on the same galaxy catalogue combined withplanck. while baos are more accurate for constraining cosmological parametersfor the standard $\lambda$cdm model, the tomographic technique gives betterresults when we allow the dark energy equation of state $w_{de}$ to deviatefrom $-1$, resulting in a performance similar to baos in the case of a constantvalue of $w_{de}$, and a moderate improvement in the case of a time-dependentvalue of $w_{de}$, increasing the value of the figure-of-merit in the $w_0-w_a$plane up to $15\%$.

1403.1585	the evolution of the star forming sequence in hierarchical galaxy  formation models	it has been argued that the specific star formation rates of star forminggalaxies inferred from observational data decline more rapidly below z = 2 thanis predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models. we present a detailedanalysis of this problem by comparing predictions from the galformsemi-analytic model with an extensive compilation of data on the average starformation rates of star-forming galaxies. we also use this data to infer theform of the stellar mass assembly histories of star forming galaxies. ouranalysis reveals that the currently available data favour a scenario where thestellar mass assembly histories of star forming galaxies rise at early timesand then fall towards the present day. in contrast, our model predicts stellarmass assembly histories that are almost flat below z = 2 for star forminggalaxies, such that the predicted star formation rates can be offset withrespect to the observational data by factors of up to 2-3. this disagreementcan be explained by the level of coevolution between stellar and halo massassembly that exists in contemporary galaxy formation models. in turn, thisarises because the standard implementations of star formation and supernovafeedback used in the models result in the efficiencies of these processremaining approximately constant over the lifetime of a given star forminggalaxy. we demonstrate how a modification to the timescale for gas ejected byfeedback to be reincorporated into galaxy haloes can help to reconcile themodel predictions with the data.

0802.4288	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the clustering of luminous  red galaxies since z = 0.6	we present an analysis of the small-to-intermediate scale clustering ofsamples of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey andthe 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey carefully matched to have the samerest-frame colours and luminosity. we study the spatial two-pointauto-correlation function in both redshift-space and real-space of a combinedsample of over 10,000 lrgs, which represent the most massive galaxies in theuniverse with stellar masses &gt; 10^11 h^-1 m_sun and space densities 10^-4 h^-3mpc^-3. we find no significant evolution in the amplitude r_0 of thecorrelation function with redshift, but do see a slight decrease in the slopewith increasing redshift over 0.19 &lt; z &lt; 0.55 and scales of 0.32 &lt; r &lt; 32 h^-1mpc. we compare our measurements with the predicted evolution of dark matterclustering and use the halo model to interpret our results. we find that ourclustering measurements are inconsistent (&gt;99.9% significance) with a passivemodel whereby the lrgs do not merge with one another; a model with a mergerrate of 7.5 +/- 2.3% from z = 0.55 to z = 0.19 (i.e. an average rate of 2.4%gyr^-1) provides a better fit to our observations. our clustering and numberdensity measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the merged lrgswere originally central galaxies in different haloes which, following themerger of these haloes, merged to create a single brightest cluster galaxy. inaddition, we show that the small-scale clustering signal constrains the scatterin halo merger histories. when combined with measurements of the luminosityfunction, our results suggest that this scatter is sub-poisson. while this is ageneric prediction of hierarchical models, it has not been tested before.

1406.0855	simulated observations of sub-millimetre galaxies: the impact of  single-dish resolution and field variance	recent observational evidence suggests that the coarse angular resolution($\sim20"$ fwhm) of single-dish telescopes at sub-mm wavelengths has biased theobserved galaxy number counts by blending together the sub-mm emission frommultiple sub-mm galaxies (smgs). we use lightcones computed from an updatedimplementation of the \galform semi-analytic model to generate $50$ mock sub-mmsurveys of $0.5$ deg$^2$ at $850$ $\mu$m, taking into account the effects ofthe finite single-dish beam in a more accurate way than has been donepreviously. we find that blending of smgs does lead to an enhancement of sourceextracted number counts at bright fluxes($s_{\mathrm{850}\mu\mathrm{m}}\gtrsim1$ mjy). typically, $\sim3{-}6$ galaxiescontribute $90\%$ of the flux of an $s_{850\mu\mathrm{m}}=5$ mjy source andthese blended galaxies are physically unassociated. we find that field-to-fieldvariations are comparable to poisson fluctuations for our$s_{850\mu\mathrm{m}}&gt;5$ mjy smg population, which has a median redshift$z_{50}=2.0$, but are greater than poisson for the $s_{850\mu\mathrm{m}}&gt;1$ mjypopulation ($z_{50}=2.8$). in a detailed comparison to a recent interferometricsurvey targeted at single-dish detected sources, we reproduce the differencebetween single-dish and interferometer number counts and find a median redshift($z_{50}=2.5$) in excellent agreement with the observed value ($z_{50}=2.5\pm0.2$). we also present predictions for single-dish survey number counts at$450$ and $1100$ $\mu$m, which show good agreement with observational data.

1407.7296	velocity and mass bias in the distribution of dark matter halos	the non-linear, scale-dependent bias in the mass distribution of galaxies andthe underlying dark matter is a key systematic affecting the extraction ofcosmological parameters from galaxy clustering. using 95 million halos from themillennium-xxl n-body simulation, we find that the mass bias is scaleindependent only for $k&lt;0.1 h{\rm mpc}^{-1}$ today ($z=0$) and for $k&lt;0.2 h{\rmmpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0.7$. we test analytic halo bias models against our simulationmeasurements and find that the model of tinker et al. 2005 is accurate tobetter then 5% at $z=0$. however, the simulation results are better fit by anellipsoidal collapse model at $z=0.7$. we highlight, for the first time,another potentially serious systematic due to a sampling bias in the halovelocity divergence power spectra which will affect the comparison betweenobservations and any redshift space distortion model which assumes dark mattervelocity statistics with no velocity bias. by measuring the velocity divergencepower spectra for different sized halo samples, we find that there is asignificant bias which increases with decreasing number density. this bias isapproximately 20% at $k=0.1h$mpc$^{-1}$ for a halo sample of number density$\bar{n} = 10^{-3} (h/$mpc$)^3$ at both $z=0$ and $z=0.7$ for the velocitydivergence auto power spectrum. given the importance of redshift spacedistortions as a probe of dark energy and the on-going major effort to advancemodels for the clustering signal in redshift space, our results show thisvelocity bias introduces another systematic, alongside scale-dependent halomass bias, which cannot be neglected.

1408.1084	nonlinear structure formation in nonlocal gravity	we study the nonlinear growth of structure in nonlocal gravity models withthe aid of n-body simulation and the spherical collapse and halo models. wefocus on a model in which the inverse-squared of the d'alembertian operatoracts on the ricci scalar in the action. for fixed cosmological parameters, thismodel differs from $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ by having a lower late-time expansionrate and an enhanced and time-dependent gravitational strength ($\sim 6\%$larger today). compared to $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ today, in the nonlocal model,massive haloes are slightly more abundant (by $\sim 10\%$ at $m \sim 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h$) and concentrated ($\approx 8\%$ enhancement over a range of massscales), but their linear bias remains almost unchanged. we find that thesheth-tormen formalism describes the mass function and halo bias very well,with little need for recalibration of free parameters. the fitting of the haloconcentrations is however essential to ensure the good performance of the halomodel on small scales. for $k \gtrsim 1 h/{\rm mpc}$, the amplitude of thenonlinear matter and velocity divergence power spectra exhibits a modestenhancement of $\sim 12\%$ to $15\%$, compared to $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ today.this suggests that this model might only be distinguishable from $\lambda{\rmcdm}$ by future observational missions. we point out that the absence of ascreening mechanism may lead to tensions with solar system tests due to localtime variations of the gravitational strength, although this is subject toassumptions about the local time evolution of background averaged quantities.

0804.0233	what is the best way to measure baryonic acoustic oscillations?	oscillations in the baryon-photon fluid prior to recombination imprintdifferent signatures on the power spectrum and correlation function of matterfluctuations. the measurement of these features using galaxy surveys has beenproposed as means to determine the equation of state of the dark energy. theaccuracy required to achieve competitive constraints demands an extremely goodunderstanding of systematic effects which change the baryonic acousticoscillation (bao) imprint. we use 50 very large volume n-body simulations toinvestigate the bao signature in the two-point correlation function. thelocation of the bao bump does not correspond to the sound horizon scale at thelevel of accuracy required by future measurements, even before any dynamical orstatistical effects are considered. careful modelling of the correlationfunction is therefore required to extract the cosmological information encodedon large scales. we find that the correlation function is less affected byscale dependent effects than the power spectrum. we show that a model for thecorrelation function proposed by crocce &amp; scoccimarro (2008), based onrenormalised perturbation theory, gives an essentially unbiased measurement ofthe dark energy equation of state. this means that information from the largescale shape of the correlation function, in addition to the form of the baopeak, can be used to provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters. thecorrelation function therefore provides a better constraint on the distancescale (~50% smaller errors with no systematic bias) than the more conservativeapproach required when using the power spectrum (i.e. which requires amplitudeand long wavelength shape information to be discarded).

1412.3804	a new methodology to test galaxy formation models using the dependence  of clustering on stellar mass	we present predictions for the two-point correlation function of galaxyclustering as a function of stellar mass, computed using two new versions ofthe galform semi-analytic galaxy formation model. these models make use of ahigh resolution, large volume n-body simulation, set in the wmap7 cosmology.one model uses a universal stellar initial mass function (imf), while the otherassumes different imfs for quiescent star formation and bursts. particularconsideration is given to how the assumptions required to estimate the stellarmasses of observed galaxies (such as the choice of imf, stellar populationsynthesis model and dust extinction) influence the perceived dependence ofgalaxy clustering on stellar mass. broad-band spectral energy distributionfitting is carried out to estimate stellar masses for the model galaxies in thesame manner as in observational studies. we show clear differences between theclustering signals computed using the true and estimated model stellar masses.as such, we highlight the importance of applying our methodology to comparetheoretical models to observations. we introduce an alternative scheme for thecalculation of the merger timescales for satellite galaxies in galform, whichtakes into account the dark matter subhalo information from the simulation.this reduces the amplitude of small-scale clustering. the new merger schemeoffers improved or similar agreement with observational clusteringmeasurements, over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we find reasonable agreementwith clustering measurements from gama, but find larger discrepancies for somestellar mass ranges and separation scales with respect to measurements fromsdss and vipers, depending on the galform model used.

1509.01254	the environments of high redshift radio galaxies and quasars: probes of  protoclusters	we use the galform semi-analytical model to study high density regions tracedby radio galaxies and quasars at high redshifts. we explore the impact thatbaryonic physics has upon the properties of galaxies in these environments.star-forming emission-line galaxies (ly{\alpha} and h{\alpha} emitters) areused to probe the environments at high redshifts. radio galaxies are predictedto be hosted by more massive haloes than quasars, and this is imprinted on theamplitude of galaxy overdensities and cross-correlation functions. we find thatly{\alpha} radiative transfer and agn feedback indirectly affect the clusteringon small scales and also the stellar masses, star- formation rates and gasmetallicities of galaxies in dense environments. we also investigate therelation between protoclusters associated with radio galaxies and quasars, andtheir present- day cluster descendants. the progenitors of massive clustersassociated with radio galaxies and quasars allow us to determine an averageprotocluster size in a simple way. overdensities within the protoclusters arefound to correlate with the halo descendant masses. we present scalingrelations that can be applied to observational data. by computing projectioneffects due to the wavelength resolution of modern spectrographs andnarrow-band filters we show that the former have enough spectral resolution tomap the structure of protoclusters, whereas the latter can be used to measurethe clustering around radio galaxies and quasars over larger scales todetermine the mass of dark matter haloes hosting them.

1511.00692	can we distinguish early dark energy from a cosmological constant?	early dark energy (ede) models are a class of quintessence dark energy with adynamically evolving scalar field which display a small but non-negligibleamount of dark energy at the epoch of matter-radiation equality. compared witha cosmological constant, the presence of dark energy at early times changes thecosmic expansion history and consequently the shape of the linear theory powerspectrum and potentially other observables. we constrain the cosmologicalparameters in the ede cosmology using recent measurements of the cosmicmicrowave background and baryon acoustic oscillations. the best-fitting modelsfavour no ede; here we consider extreme examples which are in mild tension withcurrent observations in order to explore the observational consequences of amaximally allowed amount of ede. we study the non-linear evolution of cosmicstructure in ede cosmologies using large volume n-body simulations. manylarge-scale structure statistics are found to be very similar between the$\lambda$ cold dark matter ($\lambda$cdm) and ede models. we find that the mostpromising way to distinguish ede from $\lambda$cdm is to measure the powerspectrum on large scales, where differences of up to 15% are expected.

0807.0001	the colours of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters	current models of galaxy formation predict satellite galaxies in groups andclusters that are redder than observed. we investigate the effect on thecolours of satellite galaxies produced by the ram pressure stripping of theirhot gaseous atmospheres as the satellites orbit within their parent halo. weincorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamicsimulations within the durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. thesimulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressivethan previously assumed. the main uncertainty in the model is the treatment ofgas expelled by supernovae. with reasonable assumptions for the stripping ofthis material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significantfraction of their hot gas for several gigayears, thereby replenishing theirreservoirs of cold, star forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively longperiod of time. a bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to thatobserved in sdss data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxiesare in good agreement with the data. in addition, our model naturally accountsfor the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from smallgroups to high mass clusters.

astro-ph;0104313	cluster correlations in redshift space	we test an analytic model for the two-point correlations of galaxy clustersin redshift space using the hubble volume n-body simulations. the correlationfunction of clusters shows no enhancement along the line of sight, due to thelack of any virialised structures in the cluster distribution. however, thedistortion of the clustering pattern due to coherent bulk motions is clearlyvisible. the distribution of cluster peculiar motions is well described by agaussian, except in the extreme high velocity tails. the simulations produce asmall but significant number of clusters with large peculiar motions. the formof the redshift space power spectrum is strongly influenced by errors inmeasured cluster redshifts in extant surveys. when these errors are taken intoaccount, the model reproduces the power spectrum recovered from the simulationto an accuracy of 15% or better over a decade in wavenumber. we compare ouranalytic predictions with the power spectrum measured from t! he!  apm cluster redshift survey. the cluster power spectrum constrains theamplitude of density fluctuations, as measured by the linear rms variance inspheres of radius 8 h^(-1) mpc, denoted by sigma_8. when combined with theconstraints on sigma_8 and the density parameter omega derived from the localabundance of clusters, we find a best fitting cold dark matter model withsigma_8~1.25 and omega~0.2, for a power spectrum shape that matches thatmeasured for galaxies. however, for the best fitting value of omega and giventhe value of hubble's constant from recent measurements, the assumed shape ofthe power spectrum is incompatible with the most readily motivated predictionsfrom the cold dark matter paradigm.

astro-ph;0202485	a comparison of gas dynamics in sph and semi-analytic models of galaxy  formation	we compare the results of two techniques used to calculate the evolution ofcooling gas during galaxy formation: smooth particle hydrodynamics (sph)simulations and semi-analytic modelling. we improve upon the earlierstatistical comparison of benson et al. by taking halo merger histories fromthe dark matter component of the sph simulation, which allows us to compare theevolution of galaxies on an object-by-object basis in the two treatments. weuse a ``stripped-down'' version of the semi-analytic model described by hellyet al. which includes only shock heating and radiative cooling of gas and whichis adjusted to mimic the resolution and other parameters of a comparison sphsimulation as closely as possible. we compare the total mass of gas that coolsin halos of different mass as a function of redshift as well as the masses andspatial distribution of individual ``galaxies.'' at redshift z=0, the cooledgas mass in well-resolved halos agrees remarkably well (to better than ~20%) inthe sph simulation and stripped-down semi-analytic model. at high redshift,resolution effects in the simulation become increasingly important and, as aresult, more gas tends to cool in low mass halos in the sph simulation than inthe semi-analytic model. the cold gas mass function of individual galaxies inthe two treatments at z=0 also agrees very well and, when the effects ofmergers are accounted for, the masses of individual galaxies and their 2-pointcorrelation functions are also in excellent agreement in the two treatments.thus, our comparison confirms and extends the earlier conclusion of benson etal. that sph simulations and semi-analytic models give consistent results forthe evolution of cooling galactic gas.

astro-ph;0210141	galaxy formation using halo merger histories taken from n-body  simulations	we develop a hybrid galaxy formation model which uses outputs from an n-bodysimulation to follow the merger histories (or ``merger trees'') of dark matterhalos and treats baryonic processes, such as the cooling of gas within halosand subsequent star formation, using the semi-analytic model of cole et al. wecompare this hybrid model to an otherwise identical model which utilises mergertree realisations generated by a monte-carlo algorithm and find that, apartfrom the limited mass resolution imposed by the n-body particle mass, the onlysignificant differences between the models are due to the known discrepancybetween the distribution of halo progenitor masses predicted by extended pressschechter theory and that found in n-body simulations. we investigate theeffect of limited mass resolution on the hybrid model by comparing to a purelysemi-analytic model with greatly improved mass resolution. we find that themass resolution of the simulation we use, which has a particle mass of1.4x10^10 msolar/h, is insufficient to produce a reasonable luminosity functionfor galaxies with magnitudes in the b_j band fainter than -17.

astro-ph;0212357	the halo occupation distribution and the physics of galaxy formation	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the bias between galaxiesand dark matter by specifying (a) the probability p(n|m) that a halo of virialmass m contains n galaxies of a particular class and (b) the relativedistributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. we calculate predictedhods for a lambda-cdm cosmological model using an sph hydrodynamic simulationand a semi-analytic (sa) galaxy formation model. although the two methodspredict different galaxy mass functions, their hod predictions agree remarkablywell. for mass-selected samples, the mean occupation &lt;n(m)&gt; exhibits a sharpcutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau for &lt;n&gt;~1-2, and a moresteeply rising high occupancy regime. at low &lt;n&gt;, the mean pair and triplecounts are well below poisson expectations, with important consequences forsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. the hod dependsstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxiesand low mass halos by young galaxies. the sph simulation supports severalsimplifying assumptions about hod bias: the most massive galaxy in a halousually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as thedark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of thehalo's larger scale environment. by applying the sph and sa hods to a largevolume n-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight, observabledepartures from a power-law galaxy correlation function. the predicted hods areclosely tied to the underlying galaxy formation physics, they offer usefulguidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be testedempirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys.

astro-ph;0303531	the properties of spiral galaxies: confronting hierarchical galaxy  formation models with observations	we compare the properties of local spiral galaxies with the predictions ofthe cole et al. semi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation, in orderto gain insight into the baryonic processes that were responsible for shapingthese galaxies. on the whole, the models reproduce the properties ofpresent-day spirals (such as sfrs, sfhs, scale sizes, metallicities, and gasfractions) rather well. in particular, we find that once the effects of dustand variations in stellar populations have been taken into account, publishedspiral galaxy scale-size distributions derived from optical data (withlogarithmic widths ~0.3) can be reconciled with the width of the stellar massscale-size distribution predicted by the semi-analytic model (~0.5). there aresome illuminating discrepancies between the observations and the modelpredictions. the model colours of luminous spiral galaxies are somewhat tooblue and those of faint galaxies somewhat too red, most likely indicatingshortcomings in the way that gas is accreted by spiral galaxies. furthermore,the model produces too few luminous spiral galaxies. these difficulties couldbe resolved by altering the way in which gas cooling is treated or, perhaps, byadopting a higher baryon fraction and invoking galactic `superwinds.' secondly,stellar m/ls are found to be as high as observations permit. yet, typically 60%of the mass in the inner half-light radius of the model galaxies is dark. thisresults in an offset between the model and observed spiral galaxyluminosity-linewidth relation. this could be resolved by substantially reducingthe mass of baryons which make it into a galaxy disc (with an attendantdecrease in stellar m/l), or by modifying the assumed dark matter profile toinclude less dark matter in the inner parts.

astro-ph;0408529	the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium in hierarchical galaxy  formation models	we investigate the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium (icm) in theframework of hierarchical models of galaxy formation. we calculate theformation and evolution of galaxies and clusters using a semi-analytical modelwhich includes the effects of flows of gas and metals both into and out ofgalaxies. for the first time in a semi-analytical model, we calculate theproduction of both alpha and iron-peak elements based on theoretical models forthe lifetimes and ejecta of type ia and type ii supernovae (sne ia and sne ii).it is essential to include the long lifetimes of the snia progenitors in orderto correctly model the evolution of the iron-peak elements. we find that if allstars form with an imf similar to that found in the solar neighbourhood, thenthe metallicities of o, mg, si and fe in the icm are predicted to be 2-3 timeslower than observed values. in contrast, a model (also favoured on othergrounds) in which stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy mergers have atop-heavy imf reproduces the observed icm abundances of o, mg, si and fe. thesame model predicts ratios of icm mass to total stellar luminosity in clusterswhich agree well with observations. according to our model, the bulk of themetals in clusters are produced by l* and brighter galaxies.

astro-ph;0408564	theoretical models of the halo occupation distribution: separating  central and satellite galaxies	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the relation betweengalaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. theproperties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those ofsatellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. using asmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulation and a semi-analytic (sa)galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central andsatellite galaxies to the hod, more specifically to the probability p(n|m) thata halo of virial mass m contains n galaxies of a particular class. in agreementwith earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupationfunction &lt;n&gt; for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximatedby a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, andthat the distribution of satellite numbers is close to poisson at fixed halomass. for galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, thereis a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass mmin required to hosta central galaxy and the mass m1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite,with m1 ~ 14 mmin (sph) or m1 ~ 18 mmin (sa). the mean occupation number ofyoung galaxies exhibits a local minimum at m ~ 10 mmin where halos are toomassive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to hostsatellites. we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halomass cannot be described by a schechter function because central galaxiesproduce a "bump" at high masses. we suggest parameterizations for the hod andthe conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxyclustering. many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent resultsinferred from clustering in the sloan digital sky survey.

astro-ph;0504618	the metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in hierarchical galaxy  formation models	we investigate the metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in the frameworkof hierarchical models of galaxy formation. the semi-analytical model we use inthis letter, which has been used to study the metal enrichment of theintracluster medium (icm) by nagashima et al., includes the effects of flows ofgas and metals both into and out of galaxies and the processes of metalenrichment due to both type ia and type ii supernovae. we adopt a solarneighbourhood imf for star formation in discs, but consider models in whichstarbursts have either a solar neighbourhood imf or a top-heavy imf. we findthat the alpha-element abundance in ellipticals is consistent with observedvalues only if the top-heavy imf is used. this result is consistent with ourprevious study on the metal enrichment of the icm. we also discuss theabundance ratio of alpha elements to iron as a function of velocity dispersionand metallicity. we find that models with a top-heavy imf match the alpha/feratios observed in typical l_* ellipticals, but none of the models reproducethe observed increase of alpha/fe with velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;0508207	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: correlation with the rosat-eso flux  limited x-ray (reflex) galaxy cluster survey	the rosat-eso flux limited x-ray (reflex) galaxy cluster survey and the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) respectively comprise the largest, homogeneousx-ray selected cluster catalogue and completed galaxy redshift survey. in thiswork we combine these two outstanding datasets in order to study the effect ofthe large-scale cluster environment, as traced by x-ray luminosity, on theproperties of the cluster member galaxies. we measure the lx-sigma relationfrom the correlated dataset and find it to be consistent with recent resultsfound in the literature. using a sample of 19 clusters with lx&gt;=0.36*10^44 ergs^-1 in the (0.1-2.4 kev) band, and 49 clusters with lower x-ray luminosity, wefind that the fraction of early spectral type (eta&lt;=-1.4), passively-evolvinggalaxies is significantly higher in the high-lx sample within r200. we extendthe investigation to include composite bj cluster luminosity functions, andfind that the characteristic magnitude of the schechter-function fit to theearly-type luminosity function is fainter for the high-lx sample compared tothe low-lx sample (delta m*=0.58+/-0.14). this seems to be driven by a deficitof such galaxies with m_bj ~ -21. in contrast, we find no significantdifferences between the luminosity functions of star-forming, late-typegalaxies. we believe these results are consistent with a scenario in which thehigh-lx clusters are more dynamically evolved systems than the low-lx clusters.

astro-ph;0611313	statistical analysis of galaxy surveys - iii: the non-linear clustering  of red and blue galaxies in the 2dfgrs	we present measurements of the higher-order clustering of red and bluegalaxies as a function of scale and luminosity made from the two-degree fieldgalaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we use a counts-in-cells analysis to estimatethe volume averaged correlation functions, xi_p, as a function of scale up toorder p=5, and also the reduced void probability function. hierarchicalamplitudes are constructed using the estimates of the correlation functions:s_p=(xi_p/xi_2)^(p-1). we find that: 1) red galaxies display strongerclustering than blue galaxies at all orders measured. 2) red galaxies showvalues of s_p that are strongly dependent on luminosity, whereas blue galaxiesshow no segregation in s_p within the errors; this is remarkable given thesegregation in the variance. 3) the linear relative bias shows the oppositetrend to the hierarchical amplitudes, with little segregation for the redsequence and some segregation for the blue. 4) faint red galaxies deviatesignificantly from the "universal" negative binomial reduced void probabilitiesfollowed by all other galaxy populations. our results show that thecharacteristic colour of a galaxy population reveals a unique signature in itsspatial distribution. such signatures will hopefully further elucidate thephysics responsible for shaping the cosmological evolution of galaxies.

astro-ph;0612743	cosmological parameters 2006	recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation (cmb),particularly when combined with other datasets, have revolutionised ourknowledge of the values of the basic cosmological parameters. here we summarizethe state of play at the end of 2006, focusing on the combination of cmbmeasurements with the power spectrum of galaxy clustering. we compare theconstraints derived from the extant cmb data circa 2005 and the final 2dfgrsgalaxy power spectrum, with the results obtained when the wmap 1-year data isreplaced by the 3-year measurements (hereafter wmap1 and wmap3). remarkably,the picture has changed relatively little with the arrival of wmap3, thoughsome aspects have been brought into much sharper focus. one notable example ofthis is the index of primordial scalar fluctuations, n_s. prior to wmap3,sanchez et al. (2006) found that the scale invariant value of n_s = 1 wasexcluded at the 95% level. with wmap3, this becomes a 3sigma result, withimplications for models of inflation. we find some disagreement between theconstraints on certain parameters when the 2dfgrs p(k) is replaced by the sdssmeasurement. this suggests that more work is needed to understand the relationbetween the clustering of different types of galaxies and the linearperturbation theory prediction for the power spectrum of matter fluctuations.

0810.1885	statistical analysis of galaxy surveys - i. robust error estimation for  2-point clustering statistics	we present a test of different error estimators for 2-point clusteringstatistics, appropriate for present and future large galaxy redshift surveys.using an ensemble of very large dark matter lambdacdm n-body simulations, wecompare internal error estimators (jackknife and bootstrap) to external ones(monte-carlo realizations). for 3-dimensional clustering statistics, we findthat none of the internal error methods investigated are able to reproduceneither accurately nor robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to 25mpc/h scales. the standard bootstrap overestimates the variance of xi(s) by~40% on all scales probed, but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principaleigenvectors of the underlying covariance matrix. the jackknife returns thecorrect variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smallerscales. this scale dependence in the jackknife affects the recoveredeigenvectors, which tend to disagree on small scales with the externalestimates. our results have important implications for the use of galaxyclustering in placing constraints on cosmological parameters. for example, in a2-parameter fit to the projected correlation function, we find that thestandard bootstrap systematically overestimates the 95% confidence interval,while the jackknife method remains biased, but to a lesser extent. the scatterwe find between realizations, for gaussian statistics, implies that a 2-sigmaconfidence interval, as inferred from an internal estimator, could correspondin practice to anything from 1-sigma to 3-sigma. finally, by an oversampling ofsub-volumes, it is possible to obtain bootstrap variances and confidenceintervals that agree with external error estimates, but it is not clear if thisprescription will work for a general case.

0810.2300	mock galaxy redshift catalogues from simulations: implications for  pan-starrs1	we describe a method for constructing mock galaxy catalogues which are wellsuited for use in conjunction with large photometric surveys. we use thesemi-analytic galaxy formation model of bower et al. implemented in themillennium simulation. we apply our method to the specific case of the surveyssoon to commence with ps1, the first of 4 telescopes planned for the pan-starrssystem. ps1 has 5 photometric bands (grizy), and will carry out an all-sky 3pisurvey and a medium deep survey (mds) over 84 sq.deg. we calculate the expectedmagnitude limits for extended sources in the two surveys. we find that, after 3years, the 3pi survey will have detected over 10^8 galaxies in all 5 bands, 10million of which will lie at redshift z&gt;0.9, while the mds will have detectedover 10^7 galaxies with 0.5 million lying at z&gt;2. these numbers at least doubleif detection in the shallowest band, y is not required. we then evaluate theaccuracy of photometric redshifts estimated using an off-the-shelf photo-zcode. with the grizy bands alone it is possible to achieve an accuracy in the3pi survey of delta z/(1+z)~0.06 for 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.8, which could be reduced byabout 15% using near infrared photometry from the ukidds survey, but wouldincrease by about 25% for the deeper sample without the y band photometry. forthe mds an accuracy of delta z/(1+z)~0.05 is achievable for 0.02&lt;z&lt;1.5 usinggrizy. a dramatic improvement in accuracy is possible by selecting only redgalaxies. in this case, delta z/(1+z)~0.02-0.04 is achievable for ~100 milliongalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.1 in the 3pi survey and for 30 million galaxies in the mdsat 0.4&lt;z&lt;2. we investigate the effect of using photo-z in the estimate of thebaryonic acoustic oscillation scale. we find that ps1 will achieve a similaraccuracy in this estimate as a spectroscopic survey of 20 million galaxies.
