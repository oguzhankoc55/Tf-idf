0906.2310	rotationally warm molecular hydrogen in the orion bar	the orion bar is one of the nearest and best-studied photodissociation orphoton-dominated regions (pdrs). observations reveal the presence of h2 linesfrom vibrationally or rotationally excited upper levels that suggest warm gastemperatures (400 to 700 k). however, standard models of pdrs are unable toreproduce such warm rotational temperatures. in this paper we attempt toexplain these observations with new comprehensive models which extend from theh+ region through the bar and include the magnetic field in the equation ofstate. we adopt the model parameters from our previous paper which successfullyreproduced a wide variety of spectral observations across the bar. in thismodel the local cosmic-ray density is enhanced above the galactic background,as is the magnetic field, and which increases the cosmic-ray heating elevatingthe temperature in the molecular region. the pressure is further enhanced abovethe gas pressure in the h+ region by the momentum transferred from the absorbedstarlight. here we investigate whether the observed h2 lines can be reproducedwith standard assumptions concerning the grain photoelectric emission. we alsoexplore the effects due to the inclusion of recently computed h2 + h2, h2 + hand h2 + he collisional rate coefficients.

1005.0800	a bright molecular core in a crab nebula filament	in a sub-arcsec near-infrared survey of the crab nebula using the new spartaninfrared camera, we have found several knots with high surface brightness inthe h_2 2.12 micron line and a very large h_2 2.12 micron to br-gamma ratio.the brightest of these knots has an intensity ratio i(h_2 2.12micron)/i(br-gamma) = 18+/-9, which we show sets a lower limit on the ratio ofmasses in the molecular and recombination (i.e. ionized) zones m_mol / m_rec&gt;/- 0.9, and a total molecular mass within this single knot m_mol &gt;/- 5e-5m_sun. we argue that the knot discussed here probably is able to emit sostrongly in the 2.12 micron line because its physical conditions are bettertuned for such emission than is the case in other filaments. it is unclearwhether this knot has an unusually large m_mol / m_rec ratio, or if many othercrab filaments also have similar amounts of molecular gas which is not emittingbecause the physical conditions are not so well tuned.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

1005.1502	herschel images of ngc 6720: h2 formation on dust grains	herschel pacs and spire images have been obtained of ngc 6720 (the ringnebula). this is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that iscurrently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula arerecombining. from the pacs and spire images we conclude that there is astriking resemblance between the dust distribution and the h2 emission, whichappears to be observational evidence that h2 forms on grain surfaces. we havedeveloped a photoionization model of the nebula with the cloudy code which weused to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possibleformation scenarios for the h2. we conclude that the most plausible scenario isthat the h2 resides in high density knots which were formed after therecombination of the gas started when the central star entered the coolingtrack. hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of therecombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. h2 formationin the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent astrong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still beongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and theproperties of the grains in the knots.

1009.2581	detection of optical coronal emission from 10^6 k gas in the core of the  centaurus cluster	we report a detection (3.5x10^37 \pm 5.6x10^36 ergps) of the optical coronalemission line [fe x]6374 and upper limits of four other coronal lines usinghigh resolution vimos spectra centred on ngc 4696, the brightest cluster galaxyin the centaurus cluster. emission from these lines is indicative of gas attemperatures between 1 and 5 million k so traces the interstellar gas in ngc4696. the rate of cooling derived from the upper limits is consistent with thecooling rate from x-ray observations (~10 solar masses per year) however wedetect twice the luminosity expected for [fe x]6374 emission, at 1 million k,our lowest temperature probe. we suggest this emission is due to the gas beingheated rather than cooling out of the intracluster medium. we detect no coronallines from [ca xv], which are expected from the 5 million k gas seen near thecentre in x-rays with chandra. calcium is however likely to be depleted fromthe gas phase onto dust grains in the central regions of ngc 4696.

0704.2642	revisiting he-like x-ray emission line plasma diagnostics	a complete model of helium-like line and continuum emission has beenincorporated into the plasma simulation code cloudy. all elements between heand zn are treated, any number of levels can be considered, and radiative andcollisional processes are included. this includes photoionization from alllevels, line transfer including continuum pumping and destruction by backgroundopacities, scattering, and collisional processes. the model is calculatedself-consistently along with the ionization and thermal structure of thesurrounding nebula. the result is a complete line and continuum spectrum of theplasma. here we focus on the ions of the he i sequence and reconsider thestandard helium-like x-ray diagnostics. we first consider semi-analyticalpredictions and compare these with previous work in the low-density,optically-thin limit. we then perform numerical calculations of helium-likex-ray emission (such as is observed in some regions of seyferts) and predictline ratios as a function of ionizing flux, hydrogen density, and columndensity. in particular, we demonstrate that, in photoionized plasmas, the$r$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, depends on theionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large columndensities. we also introduce the notion that the $r$-ratio is a measure of theincident continuum at uv wavelengths. the $g$-ratio, which istemperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown tobe strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well. thesedistinguish a photoionized plasma from the more commonly studied collisionalcase.

1105.1735	the energy source of the filaments around the giant galaxy ngc1275	the brightest galaxy in the nearby perseus cluster, ngc1275, is surrounded bya network of filaments. these were first observed through their halpha emissionbut are now known to have a large molecular component with a total massapproaching 10^11msun of gas. the filaments are embedded in hot intraclustergas and stretch over 80 kpc. they have an unusual low excitation spectrum whichis well modelled by collisional heating and ionization by secondary electrons.here we note that the surface radiative flux from the outer filaments is closeto the energy flux impacting on them from particles in the hot gas. we proposethat the secondary electrons within the cold filaments, which excite theobserved submillimetre through uv emission, are due to the hot surrounding gasefficiently penetrating the cold gas through reconnection diffusion. some ofthe soft x-ray emission seen from the filaments is then due to charge exchange,although this is insufficient to account for all the observed x-ray flux. thefilaments are complex with multiphase gas. interpenetration of hot and cold gasleads to the filaments growing in mass, at a rate of up to 100msunpyr. the lackof soft x-ray cooling emission in cool core clusters is then due to thenon-radiative cooling of hot gas on mixing with cold gas around and within thecentral galaxy.

1107.3620	star formation in self-gravitating disks in active galactic nuclei. i.  metallicity gradients in broad line regions	it has been suggested that the high metallicity generally observed in activegalactic nuclei (agns) and quasars originates from ongoing star formation inthe self-gravitating part of accretion disks around the supermassive blackholes. we designate this region as the star forming (sf) disk, in which metalsare produced from supernova explosions (snexp) while at the same time inflowsare driven by snexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the smbhs. inthis paper, an equation of metallicity governed by snexp and radial advectionis established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the sf disk.we find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at differentpositions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolvesfor steady-state agns. metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can beused as a probe of the sf disk age during one episode of smbh activity. in thesf disk, evaporation of molecular clouds heated by snexp blast wavesunavoidably forms hot gas. this heating is eventually balanced by the coolingof the hot gas, but we show that the hot gas will escape from the sf diskbefore being cooled, and diffuse into the blrs forming with a typical rate of$\sim 1\sunmyr$. the diffusion of hot gas from a sf disk depends on ongoingstar formation, leading to the metallicity gradients in blr observed in agns.we discuss this and other observable consequences of this scenario.

1112.1568	h2 temperatures in the crab nebula	we used k-band spectra to measure the h2 excitation temperatures in sixmolecular knots associated with the filaments in the crab nebula. thetemperatures are quite high - in the range t ~ 2000-3000k, just below the h2dissociation temperature. this is the temperature range over which the h2 1-0s(1) line at 2.121\mum has its maximum emissivity per unit mass, so there maybe many additional h2 cores with lower temperatures that are too faint todetect. we also measured the electron density in adjacent ionized gas, which onthe assumption of gas pressure balance indicates densities in the molecularregion n_mol ~ 20,000 h baryons cm-3, although this really is just a lowerlimit since the h2 gas may be confined by other means. the excited region maybe just a thin skin on a much more extensive blob of molecular gas that doesnot have the correct temperature and density to be as easily detectable. at theopposite extreme, the observed knots could consist of a fine mist of moleculargas in which we are detecting essentially all of the h2. future co observationscould distinguish between these two cases. the crab filaments serve as thenearby laboratories for understanding the very much larger filamentarystructures that have formed in the intracluster medium of cool-core galaxyclusters.

1202.1563	the curious conundrum regarding sulfur abundances in planetary nebulae	sulfur abundances derived from optical emission line measurements andionization correction factors in planetary nebulae are systematically lowerthan expected for the objects' metallicities. we have carefully considered alarge range of explanations for this "sulfur anomaly", including: (1)correlations between the size of the sulfur deficit and numerous nebular andcentral star properties; (2) ionization correction factors which under-correctfor unobserved ions; (3) effects of dielectronic recombination on the sulfurionization balance; (4) sequestering of s into dust and/or molecules; and (5)excessive destruction of s or production of o by agb stars. it appears that allbut the second scenario can be ruled out. however, we find evidence that thesulfur deficit is generally reduced but not eliminated when s^+3 abundancesdetermined directly from ir measurements are used in place of the customarysulfur ionization correction factor. we tentatively conclude that the sulfuranomaly is caused by the inability of commonly used icfs to properly correctfor populations of ionization stages higher than s^+2.

0711.0335	on the enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in the diffuse cloud towards  zeta persei	the spatial distribution of the cosmic-ray flux is important in understandingthe interstellar medium (ism) of the galaxy. this distribution can be analyzedby studying different molecular species along different sight lines whoseabundances are sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate. recently severalgroups have reported an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse cloudscompared to the standard value, zeta(average)=2.5e-17 s^-1, measured towarddense molecular clouds. in an earlier work we reported an enhancement in thecosmic ray rate of 20 towards hd185418. mccall et al. have reportedenhancements of 48 towards zeta persei based on the observed abundance ofh$_{3}^+ while le petit et al. found a cosmic ray enhancement of ~10 to beconsistent with their models for this same sight line. here we revisit zetapersei and perform a detailed calculation using a self-consistent treatment ofthe hydrogen chemistry, grain physics, energy and ionization balance, andexcitation physics. we show that the value of zeta deduced from the h$_{3}^+$column density in the diffuse region of the sightline depends strongly on theproperties of the grains because they remove free electrons and change thehydrogen chemistry. the observations are largely consistent with a cosmic rayenhancement of 40, with several diagnostics indicating higher values. thisunderscores the importance of a full treatment of grain physics in studies ofinterstellar chemistry.

1209.0028	pumping up the [n i] nebular lines	the optical [n i] doublet near 5200 {\aa} is anomalously strong in a varietyof emission-line objects. we compute a detailed photoionization model and useit to show that pumping by far-ultraviolet (fuv) stellar radiation previouslyposited as a general explanation applies to the orion nebula (m42) and itscompanion m43; but, it is unlikely to explain planetary nebulae and supernovaremnants. our models establish that the observed nearly constant equivalentwidth of [n i] with respect to the dust-scattered stellar continuum dependsprimarily on three factors: the fuv to visual-band flux ratio of the stellarpopulation; the optical properties of the dust; and the line broadening wherethe pumping occurs. in contrast, the intensity ratio [n i]/h{\beta} dependsprimarily on the fuv to extreme-ultraviolet ratio, which varies strongly withthe spectral type of the exciting star. this is consistent with the observeddifference of a factor of five between m42 and m43, which are excited by an o7and b0.5 star respectively. we derive a non-thermal broadening of order 5 km/sfor the [n i] pumping zone and show that the broadening mechanism must bedifferent from the large-scale turbulent motions that have been suggested toexplain the line-widths in this h ii region. a mechanism is required thatoperates at scales of a few astronomical units, which may be driven by thermalinstabilities of neutral gas in the range 1000 to 3000 k. in an appendix, wedescribe how collisional and radiative processes are treated in the detailedmodel n i atom now included in the cloudy plasma code.

1212.5642	the nature of the h2-emitting gas in the crab nebula	understanding how molecules and dust might have formed within a rapidlyexpanding young supernova remnant is important because of the obviousapplication to vigorous supernova activity at very high redshift. in previouspapers, we found that the h2 emission is often quite strong, correlates withoptical low-ionization emission lines, and has a surprisingly high excitationtemperature. here we study knot 51, a representative, bright example, for whichwe have available long slit optical and nir spectra covering emission linesfrom ionized, neutral, and molecular gas, as well as hst visible and soartelescope nir narrow-band images. we present a series of cloudy simulations toprobe the excitation mechanisms, formation processes and dust content inenvironments that can produce the observed h2 emission. we do not try for anexact match between model and observations given knot 51's ambiguous geometry.rather, we aim to explain how the bright h2 emission lines can be formed fromwithin the volume of knot 51 that also produces the observed optical emissionfrom ionized and neutral gas. our models that are powered only by the crab'ssynchrotron radiation are ruled out because they cannot reproduce the strong,thermal h2 emission. the simulations that come closest to fitting theobservations have the core of knot 51 almost entirely atomic with the h2emission coming from just a trace molecular component, and in which there isextra heating. in this unusual environment, h2 forms primarily by associativedetachment rather than grain catalysis. in this picture, the 55 h2-emittingcores that we have previously catalogued in the crab have a total mass of about0.1 m_sun, which is about 5% of the total mass of the system of filaments. wealso explore the effect of varying the dust abundance. we discuss possiblefuture observations that could further elucidate the nature of these h2 knots.

1303.2338	suppression of dielectronic recombination due to finite density effects	we have developed a general model for determining density-dependent effectivedielectronic recombination (dr) rate coefficients in order to explorefinite-density effects on the ionization balance of plasmas. our model consistsof multiplying by a suppression factor those highly-accurate total zero-densitydr rate coefficients which have been produced from state-of-the-art theoreticalcalculations and which have been benchmarked by experiment. the suppressionfactor is based-upon earlier detailed collision-radiative calculations whichwere made for a wide range of ions at various densities and temperatures, butused a simplified treatment of dr. a general suppression formula is thendeveloped as a function of isoelectronic sequence, charge, density, andtemperature. these density-dependent effective dr rate coefficients are thenused in the plasma simulation code cloudy to compute ionization balance curvesfor both collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas at very low (ne = 1cm^-3) and finite (ne=10^10 cm^-3) densities. we find that the denser case issignificantly more ionized due to suppression of dr, warranting further studiesof density effects on dr by detailed collisional-radiative calculations whichutilize state-of-the-art partial dr rate coefficients. this is expected toimpact the predictions of the ionization balance in denser cosmic gases such asthose found in nova and supernova shells, accretion disks, and the broademission line regions in active galactic nuclei.

1307.1044	detecting the rapidly expanding outer shell of the crab nebula: where to  look	we present a range of steady-state photoionization simulations, correspondingto different assumed shell geometries and compositions, of the unseenpostulated rapidly expanding outer shell to the crab nebula. the properties ofthe shell are constrained by the mass that must lie within it, and by limits tothe intensities of hydrogen recombination lines. in all cases thephotoionization models predict very strong emission from high ionization linesthat will not be emitted by the crab's filaments, alleviating problems withdetecting these lines in the presence of light scattered from brighter parts ofthe crab. the nir [ne vi] $\lambda$7.652 $\mu$m line is a particularly goodcase; it should be dramatically brighter than the optical lines commonly usedin searches. the c iv $\lambda1549\aa$ doublet is predicted to be the strongestabsorption line from the shell, which is in agreement with hst observations. weshow that the cooling timescale for the outer shell is much longer than the ageof the crab, due to the low density. this means that the temperature of theshell will actually "remember" its initial conditions. however, therecombination time is much shorter than the age of the crab, so the predictedlevel of ionization should approximate the real ionization. in any case, it isclear that ir observations present the best opportunity to detect the outershell and so guide future models that will constrain early events in theoriginal explosion.

0802.2535	the origin of molecular hydrogen emission in cooling-flow filaments	the optical filaments found in many cooling flows in galaxy clusters consistof low density ($\sim 10^3 \pcc$) cool ($\sim 10^3$ k) gas surrounded bysignificant amounts of cosmic-ray and magnetic-field energy. their spectra showanomalously strong low-ionization and molecular emission lines when comparedwith galactic molecular clouds exposed to ionizing radiation such as the orioncomplex. previous studies have shown that the spectra cannot be produced byo-star photoionization. here we calculate the physical conditions in dusty gasthat is well shielded from external sources of ionizing photons and isenergized either by cosmic rays or dissipative mhd waves. strong molecularhydrogen lines, with relative intensities similar to those observed, areproduced. selection effects introduced by the microphysics produce acorrelation between the \htwo line upper level energy and the populationtemperature. these selection effects allow a purely collisional gas to produce\htwo emission that masquerades as starlight-pumped \htwo but with intensitiesthat are far stronger. this physics may find application to any environmentwhere a broad range of gas densities or heating rates occur.

(2011),which detected [fe x] {\lambda}6375, but not [fe xiv] {\lambda}5303. we showthat these observations are not consistent with predictions of cooling flowmodels. differential extinction could in principle account for theobservations, but it requires extinction levels (a_v &gt; 3.625) incompatible withprevious observations. the non-detection of [fe xiv] implies a temperatureceiling of 2.1 million k. assuming cylindrical geometry and transonic turbulentpressure support, we estimate the gas mass at ~1 million solar masses. thecoronal gas is cooling isochorically. we propose that the coronal gas has notcondensed out of the intracluster medium, but instead is the conductive ormixing interface between the x-ray plume and the optical filaments. we presenta number of emission lines that may be pursued to test this hypothesis andconstrain the amount of intermediate temperature gas in the system.

1501.01081	collisional excitation of [c ii], [o i] and co in massive galaxies	many massive galaxies at the centres of relaxed galaxy clusters and groupshave vast reservoirs of cool (~10,000 k) and cold (~100 k) gas. in many lowredshift brightest group and cluster galaxies this gas is lifted into the hotism in filamentary structures, which are long lived and are typically notforming stars. two important questions are how far do these reservoirs cool andif cold gas is abundant what is the cause of the low star formation efficiency?heating and excitation of the filaments from collisions and mixing of hotparticles in the surrounding x-ray gas describes well the optical and nearinfra-red line ratios observed in the filaments. in this paper we examine thetheoretical properties of dense, cold clouds emitting in the far infra-red andsubmillimeter through the bright lines of [c ii]157 \mu m , [o i]63 \mu m andco, exposed to these energetic ionising particles. while some emission linesmay be optically thick we find this is not sufficient to model the emissionline ratios. models where the filaments are supported by thermal pressuresupport alone also cannot account for the cold gas line ratios but a verymodest additional pressure support, either from turbulence or magnetic fieldscan fit the observed [o i]/[c ii] line ratios by decreasing the density of thegas. this may also help stabilise the filaments against collapse leading to thelow rates of star formation. finally we make predictions for the line ratiosexpected from cold gas under these conditions and present diagnostic diagramsfor comparison with further observations. we provide our code as an appendix.

1502.06788	accurate determination of the free-free gaunt factor. ii - relativistic  gaunt factors	when modelling an ionised plasma, all spectral synthesis codes need thethermally averaged free-free gaunt factor defined over a very wide range ofparameter space in order to produce an accurate prediction for the spectrum.until now no data set exists that would meet these needs completely. we havetherefore produced a table of relativistic gaunt factors over a much widerrange of parameter space than has ever been produced before. we present tablesof the thermally averaged gaunt factor covering the range log10(gamma^2) = -6to 10 and log10(u) = -16 to 13 for all atomic numbers z = 1 through 36. thedata were calculated using the relativistic bethe-heitler-elwert (bhe)approximation and were subsequently merged with accurate non-relativisticresults in those parts of the parameter space where the bhe approximation isnot valid. these data will be incorporated in the next major release of thespectral synthesis code cloudy. we also produced tables of the frequencyintegrated gaunt factor covering the parameter space log10(gamma^2) = -6 to 10for all values of z between 1 and 36. all the data presented in this paper areavailable online.

1503.05905	bootstrapping dielectronic recombination from second-row elements and  the orion nebula	dielectronic recombination (dr) is the dominant recombination process formost heavy elements in photoionized clouds. accurate dr rates for a species canbe predicted when the positions of autoionizing states are known. unfortunatelysuch data are not available for most third and higher-row elements. thisintroduces an uncertainty that is especially acute for photoionized clouds,where the low temperatures mean that dr occurs energetically through verylow-lying autoionizing states. this paper discusses s$^{2+} \rightarrow$ s$^+$dr, the process that is largely responsible for establishing the [s~iii]/[s~ii]ratio in nebulae. we derive an empirical rate coefficient using a novel methodfor second-row ions, which do have accurate data. photoionization models areused to reproduce the [o~iii] / [o~ii] / [o~i] / [ne~iii] intensity ratios incentral regions of the orion nebula. o and ne have accurate atomic data and canbe used to derive an empirical s$^{2+} \rightarrow$ s$^+$ dr rate coefficientat $\sim 10^{4}$~k. we present new calculations of the dr rate coefficient fors$^{2+} \rightarrow$ s$^+$ and quantify how uncertainties in the autoionizinglevel positions affect it. the empirical and theoretical results are combinedand we derive a simple fit to the resulting rate coefficient at alltemperatures for incorporation into spectral synthesis codes. this method canbe used to derive empirical dr rates for other ions, provided that goodobservations of several stages of ionization of o and ne are available.

1508.03412	the nature and frequency of outflows from stars in the central orion  nebula cluster	recent hubble space telescope images have allowed the determination withunprecedented accuracy of motions and changes of shocks within the inner orionnebula. these originate from collimated outflows from very young stars, somewithin the ionized portion of the nebula and others within the host molecularcloud. we have doubled the number of herbig-haro objects known within the innerorion nebula. we find that the best-known herbig-haro shocks originate from arelatively few stars, with the optically visible x-ray source coup 666 drivingmany of them.  while some isolated shocks are driven by single collimated outflows, manygroups of shocks are the result of a single stellar source having jets orientedin multiple directions at similar times. this explains the feature that shocksaligned in opposite directions in the plane of the sky are usually blue shiftedbecause the redshifted outflows pass into the optically thick photon dominatedregion behind the nebula. there are two regions from which optical outflowsoriginate for which there are no candidate sources in the simbad data base.

astro-ph;0002047	the primordial helium abundance: towards understanding and removing the  cosmic scatter in the dy/dz relation	we present results from photoionization models of low-metallicity hiiregions. these nebulae form the basis for measuring the primordial heliumabundance. our models show that the helium ionization correction factor (icf)can be non-negligible for nebulae excited by stars with effective temperatureslarger than 40,000 k. furthermore, we find that when the effective temperaturerises to above 45,000 k, the icf can be significantly negative. this result isindependent of the choice of stellar atmosphere. however, if an hii region hasan [o iii] 5007/[o i] 6300 ratio greater than 300, then our models show that,regardless of its metallicity, it will have a negligibly small icf. a similar,but metallicity dependent, result was found using the [o iii] 5007/h$\beta$ratio. these two results can be used as selection criteria to remove nebulaewith potentially non-negligible icfs. using our metallicity independentcriterion on the data of izotov &amp; thuan (1998) results in a 20% reduction ofthe rms scatter about the best fit $y-z$ line. a fit to the selected dataresults in a slight increase of the value of the primordial helium abundance.

astro-ph;0107183	grains in photo-ionized environments	ever since the pioneering study of spitzer, it has been widely recognizedthat grains play an important role in the heating and cooling of photo-ionizedenvironments. this includes the diffuse ism, as well as h ii regions, planetarynebulae, and photo-dissociation regions.  a detailed code is necessary to model grains in a photo-ionized medium sincethe interactions of grains with their environment include a host ofmicrophysical processes, and their importance can only be judged by performinga complete simulation. in this paper we will use the spectral synthesis codecloudy for this purpose. a comprehensive upgrade of the grain model has beenrecently incorporated in cloudy, and certain aspects of this upgrade will bediscussed. special emphasis will be on the new grain charge model. we willconsider in detail the physics of grains in both ionized and neutralenvironments, and will present a calculation of photo-electric heating andcollisional cooling rates for a range of physical conditions and grainmaterials and for a range of grain sizes (including a realistic sizedistribution). we conclude with a brief discussion of the problems currentlyhampering progress in this field. the new grain model will be used to model thesilicate emission in the ney-allen nebula, and will help us better understandthe nature of the grains in that part of the orion complex.

astro-ph;0109006	metallicities and abundance ratios from quasar broad emission lines	the broad emission lines (bels) of quasars and active galactic nuclei (agns)are important diagnostics of the relative abundances and overall metallicity inthe gas. here we present new theoretical predictions for several uv bels. wefocus specifically on the relative nitrogen abundance as a metallicityindicator, based on the expected secondary enrichment of nitrogen atmetallicities z &gt; 0.2 z_o. among the lines we consider, n iii] 1750/o iii]1664, n v 1240/(c iv 1549 + o vi 1034) and n v/he ii 1640 are the most robustdiagnostics. we argue, in particular, that the average n v bel is not dominatedby scattered ly-alpha photons from a broad absorption line wind. we thencompare our calculated line ratios with observations from the literature. theresults support earlier claims that the gas-phase metallicities near quasarsare typically near or several times above the solar value. we conclude thatquasar activity is preceded by, or coeval with, an episode of rapid andextensive star formation in the surrounding galactic (or proto-galactic)nuclei. chemical evolution models of these environments suggest that, to reachz &gt; z_o in well-mixed interstellar gas, the star formation must have begun &gt;10^8 yr before the observed quasar activity.

astro-ph;0203052	the physical conditions within dense cold clouds in cooling flows ii	this is a progress report on our numerical simulations of conditions in thecold cores of cooling flow condensations. the physical conditions in anynon-equilibrium plasma are the result of a host of microphysical processes,many involving reactions that are research areas in themselves. we review thedominant physical processes in our previously published simulations, to clarifythose issues that have caused confusion in the literature. we show thatconditions in the core of an x-ray illuminated cloud are very different fromthose found in molecular clouds, largely because carbon remains substantiallyatomic and provides powerful cooling through its far infrared lines. we showhow the results of the opacity project have had a major impact on ourpredictions, largely because photoionization cross sections of atoms and firstions are now calculated to be far larger than previously estimated. finally weshow that the predicted conditions are strongly affected by such complexitiesas microturbulence or the presence of small amounts of dust. large masses ofcold dense gas, in addition to the warmer molecular gas detected recently,could be present in cooling flows.

astro-ph;0204276	temperature variations from hst imagery and spectroscopy of ngc 7009	we present new hst/wfpc2 imagery and stis long-slit spectroscopy of theplanetary nebula ngc 7009. the primary goal was to obtain high spatialresolution of the intrinsic line ratio [o iii] 4364/5008 and thereby evaluatethe electron temperature (t_e) and the fractional mean-square t_e variation(t_a^2) across the nebula. the wfpc2 t_e map is rather uniform; almost allvalues are between 9000 - 11,000 k, with the higher t_e's closely coincidingwith the inner he^++-zone. the results indicate very small values - &lt;~ 0.01 -for t_a^2 throughout. our stis data allow an even more direct determination oft_e and t_a^2, albeit for a much smaller area than with wfpc2. we presentresults from binning the data along the slit into tiles that are 0.5'' square(matching the slit width). the average [o iii] temperature using 45 tiles(excluding the central star and stis fiducial bars) is 10,139 k; t_a^2 is0.0035. the measurements of t_e reported here are an average along each line ofsight. therefore, despite finding remarkably low t_a^2, we cannot completelyrule out temperature fluctuations along the line of sight as the cause of thelarge abundance discrepancy between heavy element abundances inferred fromcollisionally excited emission lines compared to those derived fromrecombination lines.

astro-ph;0209335	the mass of quasar broad emission line regions	we show that the mass of ionized gas in the broad line regions (blrs) ofluminous qsos is at least several hundred msun, and probably of order 10^3-10^4m_sun. blr mass estimates in several existing textbooks suggest lower values,but pertain to much less luminous seyfert galaxies or include only a smallfraction of the ionized/emitting volume of the blr. the previous estimates alsofail to include the large amounts of blr gas that emit at low efficiency (in agiven line), but that must be present based on reverberation and other studies.very highly ionized gas, as well as partially ionized and neutral gas lyingbehind the ionization zones, are likely additional sources of mass within theblr. the high masses found here imply that the chemical enrichment of the blrcannot be controlled by mass ejection from one or a few stars. a significantstellar population in the host galaxies must be contributing. simple scalingarguments based on normal galactic chemical enrichment and solar or higher blrmetallicities show that the minimum mass of the enriching stellar population isof order 10 times the blr mass, or greater than 10^4-10^5 m_sun. more realisticmodels of the chemical and dynamical evolution in galactic nuclei suggest thatmuch larger, bulge-size stellar populations are involved.

astro-ph;0212244	temperature variations from hst spectroscopy of the orion nebula	we present hst/stis long-slit spectroscopy of ngc 1976. our goal is tomeasure the intrinsic line ratio [o iii] 4364/5008 and thereby evaluate theelectron temperature (t_e) and the fractional mean-square t_e variation (t_a^2)across the nebula. we also measure the intrinsic line ratio [n ii] 5756/6585 inorder to estimate t_e and t_a^2 in the n^+ region. the interpretation of the [nii] data is not as clear cut as the [o iii] data because of a highersensitivity to knowledge of the electron density as well as a possiblecontribution to the [n ii] 5756 emission by recombination (and cascading). wepresent results from binning the data along the various slits into tiles thatare 0.5" square (matching the slit width). the average [o iii] temperature forour four hst/stis slits varies from 7678 k to 8358 k; t_a^2 varies from 0.00682to at most 0.0176. for our preferred solution, the average [n ii] temperaturefor each of the four slits varies from 9133 k to 10232 k; t_a^2 varies from0.00584 to 0.0175. the measurements of t_e reported here are an average alongeach line of sight. therefore, despite finding remarkably low t_a^2, we cannotrule out significantly larger temperature fluctuations along the line of sight.the result that the average [n ii] t_e exceeds the average [o iii] t_e confirmswhat has been previously found for orion and what is expected on theoreticalgrounds. observations of the proplyd p159-350 indicate: large local extinctionassociated; ionization stratification consistent with external ionization bytheta^1 ori c; and indirectly, evidence of high electron density.

astro-ph;0402381	grain size distributions and photo-electric heating in ionized media	ever since the pioneering study of spitzer, it has been widely recognizedthat grains play an important role in the heating and cooling of photo-ionizedenvironments. a detailed code is necessary to model grains in a photo-ionizedmedium. in this paper we will use the spectral synthesis code cloudy for thispurpose. the grain model of this code has recently undergone a comprehensiveupgrade. part of this is the newly developed hybrid grain charge model, whichwill be described in detail. this model allows discrete charge states of verysmall grains to be modelled accurately while simultaneously avoiding theoverhead of fully resolving the charge distribution of large grains, thusmaking the model both accurate and computationally efficient. a comprehensivecomparison with the fully resolved charge state models of weingartner &amp; draine(2001) shows that the agreement is very satisfactory for realistic sizedistributions. the effect of the grain size distribution on the line emissionfrom photo-ionized regions is studied by taking standard models for an h iiregion and a planetary nebula and adding a dust component to the models withvarying grain size distributions. a comparison of the models shows that varyingthe size distribution has a dramatic effect on the emitted spectrum, andaffects the ionization balance as well. these results clearly demonstrate thatthe grain size distribution is an important parameter in photo-ionizationmodels.

astro-ph;0407404	the origin of fe ii emission in agn	we used a very large set of models of broad emission line (bel) clouds in agnto investigate the formation of the observed fe ii emission lines. we show thatphotoionized bel clouds cannot produce both the observed shape and observedequivalent width of the 2200-2800a fe ii uv bump unless there is considerablevelocity structure corresponding to a microturbulent velocity parameter v_turb&gt; 100 km/s for the loc models used here. this could be either microturbulencein gas that is confined by some phenomenon such as mhd waves, or a velocityshear such as in the various models of winds flowing off the surfaces ofaccretion disks. the alternative way that we can find to simultaneously matchboth the observed shape and equivalent width of the fe ii uv bump is for the feii emission to be the result of collisional excitation in a warm, dense gas.such gas would emit very few lines other than fe ii. however, since thecollisionally excited gas would constitute yet another component in an alreadycomplicated picture of the belr, we prefer the model involving turbulence. ineither model, the strength of fe ii emission relative to the emission lines ofother ions such as mg ii depends as much on other parameters (either v_turb orthe surface area of the collisionally excited gas) as it does on the ironabundance. therefore, the measurement of the iron abundance from the feiiemission in quasars becomes a more difficult problem.

astro-ph;0504083	j-resolved he i emission predictions in the low-density limit	determinations of the primordial helium abundance are used in precisioncosmological tests. these require highly accurate he i recombination ratecoefficients. here we reconsider the formation of he i recombination lines inthe low-density limit. this is the simplest case and it forms the basis for themore complex situation where collisions are important. the formation of arecombination line is a two-step process, beginning with the capture of acontinuum electron into a bound state and followed by radiative cascade toground. the rate coefficient for capture from the continuum is obtained fromphotoionization cross sections and detailed balancing, while radiativetransition probabilities determine the cascades. we have made every effort touse today's best atomic data. radiative decay rates are from drake'svariational calculations, which include qed, fine structure, andsinglet-triplet mixing. certain high-$l$ fine-structure levels do not have asinglet-triplet distinction and the singlets and triplets are free to mix indipole-allowed radiative decays. we use quantum defect or hydrogenicapproximations to include levels higher than those treated in the variationalcalculations.

astro-ph;0611808	a magnetically-supported pdr in m17	the sw part of the bright galactic h ii region m17 contains an obscuredionization front that is most easily seen at infrared and radio wavelengths.this "sw bar" has received considerable attention because the ionization frontis seen nearly edge-on, thus offering an excellent opportunity to study the wayin which the gas changes from fully ionized to molecular as radiation from theionizing stars penetrates into it. m17 also is one of the very few h ii regionsfor which the magnetic field strength can be measured in the photodissociationregion (the "pdr") that forms the interface between the ionized and moleculargas. here we carefully model an observed line of sight through the gas cloud,including the h+, h0 (pdr) and molecular layers, in a fully self-consistentsingle calculation. an interesting aspect of the m17 sw bar is that the pdr isvery extended. we show that the relatively strong magnetic field which isobserved to be present inevitably leads to a very deep pdr, because thestructure of the neutral and molecular gas is dominated by magnetic pressure,rather than by gas pressure as previously had been supposed. we also show thata wide variety of observed facts can be explained if a hydrostatic geometryprevails, in which the gas pressure from an inner x-ray hot bubble and theoutward momentum of the stellar radiation field compresses the gas and itsassociated magnetic field in the pdr, as has already been shown to occur in theorion nebula. the magnetic field compression may also amplify the local cosmicray density by a factor of 300. the pressure in the observed magnetic fieldjust balances the outward forces, suggesting that the observed geometry is anatural consequence of the formation of a star cluster within a molecularcloud.

astro-ph;0701636	determination of the physical conditions of the knots in the helix  nebula from optical and infrared observations	[abridged] we use new hst and archived images to clarify the nature of theknots in the helix nebula. we employ published far infrared spectrophotometryand existing 2.12 micron images to establish that the population distributionof the lowest ro-vibrational states of h2 is close to the distribution of a gasin lte at 988 +- 119 k. we derive a total flux from the nebula in h2 lines andcompare this with the power available from the central star for producing thisradiation. we establish that neither soft x-rays nor fuv radiation has enoughenergy to power the h2 radiation, only the stellar euv radiation shortward of912 angstrom does. advection of material from the cold regions of the knotsproduces an extensive zone where both atomic and molecular hydrogen are found,allowing the h2 to directly be heated by lyman continuum radiation, thusproviding a mechanism that can explain the excitation temperature and surfacebrightness of the cusps and tails. new images of the knot 378-801 reveal thatthe 2.12 micron cusp and tail lie immediately inside the ionized atomic gaszone. this firmly establishes that the "tail" structure is an ionizationbounded radiation shadow behind the optically thick core of the knot. a uniquenew image in the heii 4686 angstrom line fails to show any emission from knotsthat might have been found in the he++ core of the nebula. we also re-examinedhigh signal-to-noise ratio ground-based telescope images of this same innerregion and found no evidence of structures that could be related to knots.

astro-ph;0702231	a pdr-code comparison study	we present a comparison between independent computer codes, modeling thephysics and chemistry of interstellar photon dominated regions (pdrs). our goalwas to understand the mutual differences in the pdr codes and their effects onthe physical and chemical structure of the model clouds, and to converge theoutput of different codes to a common solution. a number of benchmark modelshave been created, covering low and high gas densities and far ultravioletintensities. the benchmark models were computed in two ways: one set assumingconstant temperatures, thus testing the consistency of the chemical network andphoto-processes, and a second set determining the temperature selfconsistently.we investigated the impact of pdr geometry and agreed on the comparison ofresults from spherical and plane-parallel pdr models. we identified a number ofkey processes governing the chemical network which have been treateddifferently in the various codes, and defined a proper common treatment. weestablished a comprehensive set of reference models for ongoing and future pdrmodel bench-marking and were able to increase the agreement in modelpredictions for all benchmark models significantly.

astro-ph;0702266	optically thick [o i] and [c ii] emission towards ngc 6334 a	this work focuses on [o i] and [c ii] emission towards ngc 6334 a, anembedded h+ region/pdr only observable at infrared or longer wavelengths. ageometry where nearly all the emission escapes out the side of the cloud facingthe stars, such as orion, is not applicable to this region. instead, we findthe geometry to be one where the h+ region and associated pdr is embedded inthe molecular cloud. constant density pdr calculations are presented whichpredict line intensities as a function of av (or n(h)), hydrogen density (nh),and incident uv radiation field (g0). we find that a single component modelwith av ~650 mag, nh = 5x10^5 cm-3, and g0 = 7x10^4 reproduces the observed [oi] and [c ii] intensities, and that the low [o i] 63 to 146 micron ratio is dueto line optical depth effects in the [o i] lines, produced by a large columndensity of atomic/molecular gas. we find that the effects of a density-lawwould increase our derived av, while the effects of an asymmetric geometrywould decrease av, with the two effects largely canceling. we conclude thatoptically selected h+ regions adjacent to pdrs, such as orion, likely have adifferent viewing angle or geometry than similar regions detected through irobservations. overall, the theoretical calculations presented in this work haveutility for any pdr embedded in a molecular cloud.

astro-ph;9905091	the pg x-ray qso sample: links between the uv-x-ray continuum and  emission lines	the uv to soft x-rays of luminous agns dominate their bolometric luminosity,driven by an accretion-powered dynamo at the center. these photons ionize thesurrounding gas, thereby providing clues to fueling and exhaust. two sets ofimportant relationships - neither of them understood - link the continuum andgas properties. (i) boroson &amp; green's `eigenvector 1' relationships: steepersoft x-ray spectra are clearly related to narrower hbeta emission and strongeroptical fe ii emission from the blr, and weaker [o iii] 5007 from the nlr. weshow that these relationships extend to uv spectra: narrower c iii] 1909,stronger low ionization lines, larger si iii] 1892/c iii] 1909 (a densityindicator), weaker c iv 1549 but stronger higher-ionization n v 1240. wespeculate that high accretion rates are linked to high columns of dense (1e10 -1e11 cm-3), nitrogen-enhanced, low-ionization gas from nuclear starbursts.linewidth, inverse fe ii-[o iii] and inverse fe ii-c iv relationships hint atthe geometrical arrangement of this gas. (ii) the baldwin effect (inverseequivalent width - luminosity relationships): our correlation analyses suggestthat these are independent of the above eigenvector 1 relationships. theeigenvector 1 relationships can therefore be used in future work, to reducescatter in the baldwin relationships, perhaps fulfilling the dream of using thebaldwin effect for cosmological studies.

astro-ph;9912253	the collision strength of the [ne v] infrared fine-structure lines	the calculation of accurate collision strengths for atomic transitions hasbeen a long standing problem in quantitative spectroscopy. most moderncalculations are based on the r-matrix method and problems pertaining to theuse of this method have led to a discussion of the accuracy of these results.more in particular, based on an analysis of the spectra of ngc 3918 and ngc6302, clegg et al. (1987) and oliva et al. (1996) have questioned r-matrixcalculations for the infrared [ne v] fine-structure transitions. using improvedflux measurements for the [ne v] lines, we show that the conclusion that thesecollision strengths would be too high, is not correct. the discrepancies foundby clegg et al. (1987) can be explained by the inaccuracy of the [ne v] 342.6nm flux they adopted. the discrepancies found by oliva et al. (1996) can beexplained by the inaccuracy of the lrs flux for the [ne v] 14.32 micron line.based on the data presented in this paper there is no reason to assume thatthere are any problems with the r-matrix calculations for ne^4+ of lennon &amp;burke (1994). we show that the data are accurate at the 30 % level or better.this confirms the validity of the close coupling method.

0810.4375	the three dimensional dynamic structure of the inner orion nebula	the three dimensional structure of the brightest part of the orion nebula isassessed in the light of published and new data. we find that the widelyaccepted model of a concave blister of ionized material needs to be altered inthe southwest direction from the trapezium, where we find that the orion-sfeature is a separate cloud of very optically thick molecules within the bodyof ionized gas, which is probably the location of the multiple embedded sourcesthat produce the outflows that define the orion-s star formation region.evidence for this cloud comes from the presence of h2co lines in absorption inthe radio continuum and discrepancies in the extinction derived fromradio-optical and optical only emission. we present an equilibrium cloudy modelof the orion-s cloud, which successfully reproduces many observed properties ofthis feature. we also report the discovery of an open-sided shell of [o iii]surrounding the trapezium stars, revealed through emission line ratio imagesand the onset of radiation shadows beyond some proplyds. we show that theobserved properties of the shell are consistent with it being a stationarystructure, produced by shock interactions between the ambient nebular gas andthe high-velocity wind from theta^1 ori c. we examine the implications of therecently published evidence for a large blueshifted velocity of theta^1 ori cwith respect to the orion molecular cloud, which could mean that this star hasonly recently begun to photoionize the orion nebula. we show that currentobservations of the nebula do not rule out such a possibility, so long as theionization front has propagated into a pre-existing low-density region. inaddition, a young age for the nebula would help explain the presence of nearbyproplyds with a short mass-loss timescale to photoablation.

0810.5372	collisional heating as the origin of filament emission in galaxy  clusters	[abridged] photoionization, whether by starlight or other sources, hasdifficulty in accounting for the observed spectra of the optical filaments thatoften surround central galaxies in large clusters. our first paper examinedwhether heating by energetic particles or dissipative mhd wave can account forthe observations. here we include atomic and low-ionization regions. the modelof the hydrogen atom, along with all elements of the h-like iso-electronicsequence, is now fully nl-resolved. we show how the predicted hi spectrumdiffers from the pure recombination case. the second update is to the rates forh^0 - h2 inelastic collisions. we now use the values computed by wrathmall etal. the rates are often much larger.  we calculate the chemistry, ionization, temperature, gas pressure, andemission-line spectrum for a wide range of gas densities and collisionalheating rates. we assume that the filaments are magnetically confined and freeto move along field lines so that the gas pressure is equal to that of thesurrounding hot gas. a mix of clouds, some being dense and cold and others hotand tenuous, can exist. the observed spectrum will be the integrated emissionfrom clouds with different densities and temperatures but the same pressure. weassume that the gas filling factor is given by a power law in density. thepower-law index is set by matching the observed intensities of ir h2 linesrelative to optical hi lines. we conclude that the filaments are heated byionizing particles, either conducted in from surrounding regions or produced insitu by processes related to mhd waves.

0810.5556	fluorescent excitation of balmer lines in gaseous nebulae: case d	(abridged) non-ionizing stellar continua are a source of photons forcontinuum pumping in the hydrogen lyman transitions. in the environments wherethese transitions are optically thick, deexcitation occurs through higherseries lines, so that the flux in these lines has a fluorescent contribution inaddition to recombination; in particular, balmer emissivities aresystematically enhanced above case b. the effectiveness of such mechanism inhii regions and the adequacy of photoionization models as a tool to study itare the two main focuses of this work. we find that photoionization models of hii regions illuminated by low-resolution population synthesis modelssignificantly overpredict the fluorescent contribution to the balmer lines.conversely, photoionization models in which the non-ionizing part of thecontinuum is omitted or is not transferred underpredict the fluorescentcontribution to the balmer lines, producing a bias of similar amplitude in theopposite direction. in this paper, we carry out realistic estimations of thefluorescent balmer intensity and discuss the variations to be expected as thesimulated observational setup and the stellar population's parameters arevaried. in all the cases explored, we find that fluorescent excitation providesa significant contribution. we also show that differential fluorescentenhancement may produce line-of-sight differences in the balmer decrement,mimicking interstellar extinction. fluorescent excitation emerges from ourstudy as a small but important mechanism for the enhancement of balmer lines,which should be taken into account in the abundance analysis of photoionizedregions, particularly in the case of high-precision applications such as thedetermination of primordial helium.

0811.1176	orion's bar: physical conditions across the definitive h+ / h0 / h2  interface	previous work has shown the orion bar to be an interface between ionized andmolecular gas, viewed roughly edge on, which is excited by the light from thetrapezium cluster. much of the emission from any star-forming region willoriginate from such interfaces, so the bar serves as a foundation test of anyemission model. here we combine x-ray, optical, ir and radio data sets toderive emission spectra along the transition from h+ to h0 to h2 regions. wethen reproduce the spectra of these layers with a simulation thatsimultaneously accounts for the detailed microphysics of the gas, the grains,and molecules, especially h2 and co. the magnetic field, observed to be thedominant pressure in another region of the orion nebula, is treated as a freeparameter, along with the density of cosmic rays. our model successfullyaccounts for the optical, ir and radio observations across the bar by includinga significant magnetic pressure and also heating by an excess density of cosmicrays, which we suggest is due to cosmic rays being trapped in the compressedmagnetic field. in the orion bar, as we had previously found in m17, momentumcarried by radiation and winds from the newly formed stars pushes back andcompresses the surrounding gas. there is a rough balance between outwardmomentum in starlight and the total pressure in atomic and molecular gassurrounding the h+ region. if the gas starts out with a weak magnetic field,the starlight from a newly formed cluster will push back the gas and compressthe gas, magnetic field, and cosmic rays until magnetic pressure becomes animportant factor.
