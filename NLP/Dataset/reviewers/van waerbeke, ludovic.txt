0908.0945	results of the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	we present the results of the great08 challenge, a blind analysis challengeto infer weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from images. the primarygoal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchersoutside the shear measurement community. six great08 team methods werepresented at the launch of the challenge and five additional groups submittedresults during the 6 month competition. participants analyzed 30 millionsimulated galaxies with a range in signal to noise ratio, point-spread functionellipticity, galaxy size, and galaxy type. the large quantity of simulationsallowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracysuitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the firsttime. different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameterspace and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. anumber of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the challenge including are-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies,which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. the imagesimulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future great challenges,meanwhile the great08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additionaldevelopments in shear measurement algorithms.

0707.1698	the masses and shapes of dark matter halos from galaxy-galaxy lensing in  the cfhtls	we present the first galaxy-galaxy weak lensing results using early data fromthe canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls). these results arebased on ~22 sq. deg. of i' data. from this data, we estimate the averagevelocity dispersion for an l* galaxy at a redshift of 0.3 to be 137 +- 11 km/s,with a virial mass, m_{200}, of 1.1 +- 0.2 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} msun and arest frame r-band mass-to-light ratio of 173 +- 34 h msun/lsun. we alsoinvestigate various possible sources of systematic error in detail.additionally, we separate our lens sample into two sub-samples, divided byapparent magnitude, thus average redshift. from this early data we do notdetect significant evolution in galaxy dark matter halo mass-to-light ratiosfrom a redshift of 0.45 to 0.27. finally, we test for non-spherical galaxy darkmatter halos. our results favor a dark matter halo with an ellipticity of ~0.3at the 2-sigma level when averaged over all galaxies. if the sample offoreground lens galaxies is selected to favor ellipticals, the mean haloellipticity and significance of this result increase.

0911.0053	evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe from weak lensing  tomography with cosmos	we present a tomographic cosmological weak lensing analysis of the hst cosmossurvey. applying our lensing-optimized data reduction, principal componentinterpolation for the acs psf, and improved modelling of charge-transferinefficiency, we measure a lensing signal which is consistent with puregravitational modes and no significant shape systematics. we carefully estimatethe statistical uncertainty from simulated cosmos-like fields obtained fromray-tracing through the millennium simulation. we test our pipeline onsimulated space-based data, recalibrate non-linear power spectrum correctionsusing the ray-tracing, employ photometric redshifts to reduce potentialcontamination by intrinsic galaxy alignments, and marginalize over systematicuncertainties. we find that the lensing signal scales with redshift as expectedfrom general relativity for a concordance lcdm cosmology, including the fullcross-correlations between different redshift bins. for a flat lcdm cosmology,we measure sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^0.51=0.75+-0.08 from lensing, in perfectagreement with wmap-5, yielding joint constraints omega_m=0.266+0.025-0.023,sigma_8=0.802+0.028-0.029 (all 68% conf.). dropping the assumption of flatnessand using hst key project and bbn priors only, we find a negative decelerationparameter q_0 at 94.3% conf. from the tomographic lensing analysis, providingindependent evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe. for a flatwcdm cosmology and prior w in [-2,0], we obtain w&lt;-0.41 (90% conf.). our darkenergy constraints are still relatively weak solely due to the limited area ofcosmos. however, they provide an important demonstration for the usefulness oftomographic weak lensing measurements from space.

1002.2266	photometric redshifts: estimating their contamination and distribution  using clustering information	we present a new technique to estimate the level of contamination betweenphotometric redshift bins. if the true angular cross-correlation betweenredshift bins can be safely assumed to be zero, any measured cross-correlationis a result of contamination between the bins. we present the theory for anarbitrary number of redshift bins, and discuss in detail the case of two andthree bins which can be easily solved analytically. we use mock cataloguesconstructed from the millennium simulation to test the method, showing thatartificial contamination can be successfully recovered with our method. we findthat degeneracies in the parameter space prohibit us from determining a uniquesolution for the contamination, though constraints are made which can beimproved with larger data sets. we then apply the method to an observationalgalaxy survey: the deep component of the canada-france-hawaii telescope legacysurvey. we estimate the level of contamination between photometric redshiftbins and demonstrate our ability to reconstruct both the true redshiftdistribution and the true average redshift of galaxies in each photometric bin.

1009.0779	gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2010 (great10) challenge handbook	gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2010 (great10) is a public imageanalysis challenge aimed at the development of algorithms to analyzeastronomical images. specifically, the challenge is to measure varying imagedistortions in the presence of a variable convolution kernel, pixelization andnoise. this is the second in a series of challenges set to the astronomy,computer science and statistics communities, providing a structured environmentin which methods can be improved and tested in preparation for plannedastronomical surveys. great10 extends upon previous work by introducingvariable fields into the challenge. the "galaxy challenge" involves the precisemeasurement of galaxy shape distortions, quantified locally by two parameterscalled shear, in the presence of a known convolution kernel. crucially, theconvolution kernel and the simulated gravitational lensing shape distortionboth now vary as a function of position within the images, as is the case forreal data. in addition, we introduce the "star challenge" that concerns thereconstruction of a variable convolution kernel, similar to that in a typicalastronomical observation. this document details the great10 challenge forpotential participants. continually updated information is also available fromhttp://www.greatchallenges.info.

1103.1876	from weak lensing to non-gaussianity via minkowski functionals	we present a new harmonic-domain approach for extracting morphologicalinformation, in the form of minkowski functionals (mfs), from weak lensing (wl)convergence maps. using a perturbative expansion of the mfs, which is expectedto be valid for the range of angular scales probed by most current weak-lensingsurveys, we show that the study of three generalized skewness parameters isequivalent to the study of the three mfs defined in two dimensions. we thenextend these skewness parameters to three associated skew-spectra which carrymore information about the convergence bispectrum than their one-pointcounterparts. we discuss various issues such as noise and incomplete skycoverage in the context of estimation of these skew-spectra from realisticdata. our technique provides an alternative to the pixel-space approachestypically used in the estimation of mfs, and it can be particularly useful inthe presence of masks with non-trivial topology. analytical modeling of weaklensing statistics relies on an accurate modeling of the statistics ofunderlying density distribution. we apply three different formalisms to modelthe underlying dark-matter bispectrum: the hierarchical ansatz, halo model anda fitting function based on numerical simulations; mfs resulting from each ofthese formalisms are computed and compared. we investigate the extent to witchlate-time gravity-induced non-gaussianity (to which weak lensing is primarilysensitive) can be separated from primordial non-gaussianity and how thisseparation depends on source redshift and angular scale.

1103.4407	lensing magnification: a novel method to weigh high-redshift clusters  and its application to sparcs	we introduce a novel method to measure the masses of galaxy clusters at highredshift selected from optical and ir spitzer data via the red-sequencetechnique. lyman-break galaxies are used as a well understood, high-redshiftbackground sample allowing mass measurements of lenses at unprecedented highredshifts using weak lensing magnification. by stacking a significant number ofclusters at different redshifts with average masses of ~1-3x10^14m_sun, asestimated from their richness, we can calibrate the normalisation of themass-richness relation. with the current data set (area: 6 deg^2) we detect amagnification signal at the &gt;3-sigma level. there is good agreement between themasses estimated from the richness of the clusters and the average massesestimated from magnification, albeit with large uncertainties. we perform teststhat suggest the absence of strong systematic effects and support therobustness of the measurement. this method - when applied to larger data setsin the future - will yield an accurate calibration of the mass-observablerelations at z&gt;~1 which will represent an invaluable input for cosmologicalstudies using the galaxy cluster mass function and astrophysical studies ofcluster formation. furthermore this method will probably be the least expensiveway to measure masses of large numbers of z&gt;1 clusters detected in futureir-imaging surveys.

1110.4913	the impact of high spatial frequency atmospheric distortions on weak  lensing measurements	high precision cosmology with weak gravitational lensing requires a precisemeasure of the point spread function across the imaging data where the accuracyto which high spatial frequency variation can be modelled is limited by thestellar number density across the field. we analyse dense stellar fields imagedat the canada-france-hawaii telescope to quantify the degree of high spatialfrequency variation in ground-based imaging point spread functions and compareour results to models of atmospheric turbulence. the data shows an anisotropicturbulence pattern with an orientation independent of the wind direction andwind speed. we find the amplitude of the high spatial frequencies to decreasewith increasing exposure time as $t^{-1/2}$, and find a negligibly smallatmospheric contribution to the point spread function ellipticity variation forexposure times $t&gt;180$ seconds. for future surveys analysing shorter exposuredata, this anisotropic turbulence will need to be taken into account as theamplitude of the correlated atmospheric distortions becomes comparable to acosmological lensing signal on scales less than $\sim 10$ arcminutes. thiseffect could be mitigated, however, by correlating galaxy shear measured onexposures imaged with a time separation greater than 50 seconds, for which wefind the spatial turbulence patterns to be uncorrelated.

1111.3698	magnification by galaxy group dark matter halos	we report on the detection of gravitational lensing magnification by apopulation of galaxy groups, at a significance level of 4.9 sigma. using x-rayselected groups in the cosmos 1.64 deg^2 field, and high-redshift lyman breakgalaxies as sources, we measure a lensing-induced angular cross-correlationbetween the samples. after satisfying consistency checks that demonstrate wehave indeed detected a magnification signal, and are not suffering fromcontamination by physical overlap of samples, we proceed to implement anoptimally weighted cross-correlation function to further boost the signal tonoise of the measurement. interpreting this optimally weighted measurementallows us to study properties of the lensing groups. we model the fulldistribution of group masses using a composite-halo approach, considering boththe singular isothermal sphere and navarro-frenk-white profiles, and find ourbest fit values to be consistent with those recovered using the weak-lensingshear technique. we argue that future weak-lensing studies will need toincorporate magnification along with shear, both to reduce residual systematicsand to make full use of all available source information, in an effort tomaximize scientific yield of the observations.

1212.3338	cfhtlens: combined probe cosmological model comparison using 2d weak  gravitational lensing	we present cosmological constraints from 2d weak gravitational lensing by thelarge-scale structure in the canada-france hawaii telescope lensing survey(cfhtlens) which spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands. using accuratephotometric redshifts and measured shapes for 4.2 million galaxies betweenredshifts of 0.2 and 1.3, we compute the 2d cosmic shear correlation functionover angular scales ranging between 0.8 and 350 arcmin. using non-linear modelsof the dark-matter power spectrum, we constrain cosmological parameters byexploring the parameter space with population monte carlo sampling. the bestconstraints from lensing alone are obtained for the small-scaledensity-fluctuations amplitude sigma_8 scaled with the total matter densityomega_m. for a flat lambdacdm model we obtain sigma_8(omega_m/0.27)^0.6 =0.79+-0.03.  we combine the cfhtlens data with wmap7, boss and an hst distance-ladderprior on the hubble constant to get joint constraints. for a flat lambdacdmmodel, we find omega_m = 0.283+-0.010 and sigma_8 = 0.813+-0.014. in the caseof a curved wcdm universe, we obtain omega_m = 0.27+-0.03, sigma_8 =0.83+-0.04, w_0 = -1.10+-0.15 and omega_k = 0.006+0.006-0.004.  we calculate the bayesian evidence to compare flat and curved lambdacdm anddark-energy cdm models. from the combination of all four probes, we find modelswith curvature to be at moderately disfavoured with respect to the flat case. asimple dark-energy model is indistinguishable from lambdacdm. our resultstherefore do not necessitate any deviations from the standard cosmologicalmodel.

1301.7421	cfhtlens: the environmental dependence of galaxy halo masses from weak  lensing	we use weak gravitational lensing to analyse the dark matter halos aroundsatellite galaxies in galaxy groups in the cfhtlens dataset. this dataset isderived from the cfhtls-wide survey, and encompasses 154 sq. deg ofhigh-quality shape data. using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sampleof lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^9 msun to 10^10.5 msuninto those likely to lie in high-density environments (hde) and those likely tolie in low-density environments (lde). through comparison with galaxycatalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, we show that the sample ofhde galaxies should primarily (~61%) consist of satellite galaxies in groups,while the sample of lde galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite(field and central) galaxies. comparing the lensing signals around samples ofhde and lde galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around hdegalaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on theirlensing signals at radii of ~500--1000 kpc, the typical separation betweensatellites and group centres. more importantly, the subhalos of hde galaxiesare less massive than those around lde galaxies by a factor 0.65 +/- 0.12,significant at the 2.9 sigma level. a natural explanation is that the halos ofsatellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment.our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of ~40 kpc.

1304.4265	cfhtlens: the relation between galaxy dark matter haloes and baryons  from weak gravitational lensing	we present a study of the relation between dark matter halo mass and thebaryonic content of host galaxies, quantified via luminosity and stellar mass.our investigation uses 154 deg2 of canada-france-hawaii telescope lensingsurvey (cfhtlens) lensing and photometric data, obtained from the cfht legacysurvey. we employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us toconstrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. our analysis is limited tolenses at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. we express the relationship betweenhalo mass and baryonic observable as a power law. for the luminosity-halo massrelation we find a slope of 1.32+/-0.06 and a normalisation of1.19+0.06-0.07x10^13 h70^-1 msun for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies thebest-fit slope is 1.09+0.20-0.13 and the normalisation is 0.18+0.04-0.05x10^13h70^-1 msun. similarly, we find a best-fit slope of 1.36+0.06-0.07 and anormalisation of 1.43+0.11-0.08x10^13 h70^-1 msun for the stellar mass-halomass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding valuesare 0.98+0.08-0.07 and 0.84+0.20-0.16x10^13 h70^-1 msun. for red lenses, thefraction which are satellites tends to decrease with luminosity and stellarmass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2x10^9h70^-2 msun. the satellite fractions are generally close to zero for bluelenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. this, together with theshallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a directconfirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in lessclustered environments than red galaxies. we also find that the halo model,while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is prone toover-predicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses.this could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolatedthan assumed.

1310.5721	detection of warm and diffuse baryons in large scale structure from the  cross-correlation of gravitational lensing and the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich  effect	we report the first detection of a correlation between gravitational lensingby large scale structure and the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect. usingthe mass map from the canada france hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens)and a newly-constructed tsz map from planck, we measure a non-zero correlationbetween the two maps out to one degree angular separation on the sky, with anoverall significance of 6 sigma. the tsz maps are formed in a manner thatremoves primary cosmic microwave background fluctuations and minimizes residualcontamination by galactic and extragalactic dust emission, and by co lineemission. we perform numerous tests to show that our measurement is immune tothese residual contaminants. the resulting correlation function is consistentwith the existence of a warm baryonic gas tracing the large scale structurewith a bias b_gas. given the shape of the lensing kernel, our signalsensitivity peaks at a redshift z~0.4, where half a degree separation on thesky corresponds to a physical scale of ~10 mpc. the amplitude of the signalconstrains the product (b_gas/1)(t_e / 0.1 kev)(n_e / 1 m^-3)=2.01\pm 0.31\pm0.21, at redshift zero. our study suggests that a substantial fraction of the"missing" baryons in the universe may reside in a low density warm plasma thattraces dark matter.

1310.6784	cfhtlens: co-evolution of galaxies and their dark matter haloes	galaxy-galaxy weak lensing is a direct probe of the mean matter distributionaround galaxies. the depth and sky coverage of the cfht legacy survey yieldstatistically significant galaxy halo mass measurements over a much wider rangeof stellar masses ($10^{8.75}$ to $10^{11.3} m_{\odot}$) and redshifts ($0.2 &lt;z &lt; 0.8$) than previous weak lensing studies. at redshift $z \sim 0.5$, thestellar-to-halo mass ratio (shmr) reaches a maximum of $4.0\pm0.2$ percent as afunction of halo mass at $\sim 10^{12.25} m_{\odot}$. we find, for the firsttime from weak lensing alone, evidence for significant evolution in the shmr:the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from $4.5 \pm 0.3$ percent at$z \sim 0.7$ to $3.4 \pm 0.2$ percent at $z \sim 0.3$, and shifts to lowerstellar mass haloes. these evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies,and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which starformation is quenched "downsizes" with cosmic time. in contrast, the shmr ofblue, star-forming galaxies is well-fit by a power law that does not evolvewith time. this suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that isbalanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve alongthe shmr locus. the redshift dependence of the shmr can be used to constrainthe evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.

1311.1319	weak lensing mass map and peak statistics in canada-france-hawaii  telescope stripe 82 survey	we present a weak lensing mass map covering ~124 square degrees of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope stripe 82 survey (cs82). we study the statisticsof rare peaks in the map, including peak abundance, the peak-peak correlationfunctions and the tangential-shear profiles around peaks. we find that theabundance of peaks detected in cs82 is consistent with predictions from alambda-cdm cosmological model, once noise effects are properly included. thecorrelation functions of peaks with different signal-to-noise ratio (snr) arewell described by power laws, and there is a clear cross-correlation betweenthe sloan digital sky survey iii/constant mass galaxies and high snr peaks. thetangential-shear profiles around peaks increase with peak snr. we fitanalytical models to the tangential-shear profiles, including a projectedsingular isothermal sphere (sis) model and a projected navarro, frenk &amp; white(nfw) model, plus a two-halo term. for the high snr peaks, the sis model isrejected at ~3-sigma. the nfw model plus a two-halo term gives more acceptablefits to the data. some peaks match the positions of optically detectedclusters, while others are relatively dark. comparing dark and matched peaks,we find a difference in lensing signal of a factor of 2, suggesting that abouthalf of the dark peaks are false detections.

0802.1214	handbook for the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	the gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2008 (great08) challenge focuseson a problem that is of crucial importance for future observations incosmology. the shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine theproperties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from thosegalaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. the observedgalaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes mustbe precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution andnoise. the worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significantprogress in techniques to measure these distortions via the shear testingprogram (step). via step, we have run challenges within our own community, andcome to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideallymatched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computationallearning. thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we areseeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities. this document detailsthe great08 challenge for potential participants. please visithttp://www.great08challenge.info for the latest information.

0802.2174	first catalog of strong lens candidates in the cosmos field	we present the first catalog of 67 strong galaxy-galaxy lens candidatesdiscovered in the 1.64 square degree hubble space telescope cosmos survey.twenty of these systems display multiple images or strongly curved large arcs.our initial search is performed by visual inspection of the data and isrestricted, for practical considerations, to massive early-type lens galaxieswith arcs found at radii smaller than ~5''. simple mass models are constructedfor the best lens candidates and our results are compared to the strong lensingcatalogs of the slacs survey and the castles database. these new stronggalaxy-galaxy lensing systems constitute a valuable sample to study the massdistribution of early-type galaxies and their associated dark matter halos. wefurther expect this sample to play an important role in the testing of softwarealgorithms designed to automatically search for strong gravitational lenses.  from our analysis a robust lower limit is derived for the expected occurrenceof strong galaxy-galaxy systems in current and future space-based wide-fieldimaging surveys. we expect that such surveys should uncover a large number ofstrong lensing systems (more than 10 systems per square degree), which willallow for a detailed statistical analysis of galaxy properties and will likelylead to constraints on models of gravitational structure formation andcosmology. the sample of strong lenses is available here:http://cosmosstronglensing.uni-hd.de/

0802.3978	sources of contamination to weak lensing three-point statistics:  constraints from n-body simulations	we investigate the impact of the observed correlation between a galaxiesshape and its surrounding density field on the measurement of third order weaklensing shear statistics. using numerical simulations, we estimate thesystematic error contribution to a measurement of the third order moment of theaperture mass statistic (ggg) from three-point intrinsic ellipticitycorrelations (iii), and the three-point coupling between the weak lensing shearexperienced by distant galaxies and the shape of foreground galaxies (ggi andgii). we find that third-order weak lensing statistics are typically morestrongly contaminated by these physical systematics compared to second-ordershear measurements, contaminating the measured three-point signal formoderately deep surveys with a median redshift z_m ~ 0.7 by ~ 15%. it has beenshown that accurate photometric redshifts will be crucial to correct for thiseffect, once a model and the redshift dependence of the effect can beaccurately constrained. to this end we provide redshift-dependent fittingfunctions to our results and propose a new tool for the observational study ofintrinsic galaxy alignments. for a shallow survey with z_m ~ 0.4 we find iii tobe an order of magnitude larger than the expected cosmological ggg shearsignal. compared to the two-point intrinsic ellipticity correlation which issimilar in amplitude to the two-point shear signal at these survey depths,third order statistics therefore offer a promising new way to constrain modelsof intrinsic galaxy alignments. early shallow data from the next generation ofvery wide weak lensing surveys will be optimal for this type of study.

1404.5469	cfhtlens: cosmological constraints from a combination of cosmic shear  two-point and three-point correlations	higher-order, non-gaussian aspects of the large-scale structure carryvaluable information on structure formation and cosmology, which iscomplementary to second-order statistics. in this work we measure second- andthird-order weak-lensing aperture-mass moments from cfhtlens and combine thosewith cmb anisotropy probes. the third moment is measured with a significance of$2\sigma$. the combined constraint on $\sigma_8 = \sigma_8 (\omega_{\rmm}/0.27)^\alpha$ is improved by 10%, in comparison to the second-order only,and the allowed ranges for $\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ are substantiallyreduced. including general triangles of the lensing bispectrum yields tighterconstraints compared to probing mainly equilateral triangles. second- andthird-order cfhtlens lensing measurements improve planck cmb constraints on$\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ by 26% for flat $\lambda$cdm. for a model withfree curvature, the joint cfhtlens-planck result is $\omega_{\rm m} = 0.28 \pm0.02$ (68% confidence), which is an improvement of 43% compared to planckalone. we test how our results are potentially subject to three astrophysicalsources of contamination: source-lens clustering, the intrinsic alignment ofgalaxy shapes, and baryonic effects. we explore future limitations of thecosmological use of third-order weak lensing, such as the nonlinear model andthe gaussianity of the likelihood function.

1406.0543	simulations of weak gravitational lensing - ii : including finite  support effects in cosmic shear covariance matrices	(abridged) we investigate and quantify the impact of finite simulation volumeon weak lensing two- and four-point statistics. these {\it finite support} (fs)effects are modelled for several estimators, simulation box sizes and sourceredshifts, and validated against a new large suite of 500 $n$-body simulations.the comparison reveals that our theoretical model is accurate to better than 5per cent for the shear correlation function $\xi_{+}(\theta)$ and its error. wefind that the most important quantities for fs modelling is the ratio betweenthe measured angle $\theta$ and the angular size of the simulation box at thesource redshift, $\theta_{box}(z_s)$, or the multipole equivalent $\ell /\ell_{box}(z_s)$. when this ratio reaches 0.1, independently of the sourceredshift, the shear correlation function $\xi_+$ is suppressed by 5, 10, 20 and25 percent for $l_{box}= 1000$, $500$, $250$ and $147\mbox{mpc}/h$respectively. when it reaches 0.2, the suppression exceeds 25 percent even forthe largest box. the same effect is observed in $\xi_{-}(\theta)$, but at muchlarger angles. this has important consequences for cosmological analyses using$n$-body simulations to calibrate the impact of non-linear gravitationalclustering or to estimate errors and systematics effects, and should not beoverlooked. we propose simple semi-analytic solutions to correct for thesefinite box effects with and without the presence of survey masks, and themethod can be generalized to any weak lensing estimator. this offers a gracefulsolution to the important problem of estimating accurate covariance matricesfor weak lensing studies: there is no need to run extra large simulationvolumes, as long as the box effects are corrected.

1407.4301	baryons, neutrinos, feedback and weak gravitational lensing	(abridged) the effect of baryonic feedback on the dark matter massdistribution is generally considered to be a nuisance to weak gravitationallensing. measurements of cosmological parameters are affected as feedbackalters the cosmic shear signal on angular scales smaller than a few arcminutes.recent progress on the numerical modelling of baryon physics has shown thatthis effect could be so large that, rather than being a nuisance, the effectcan be constrained with current weak lensing surveys, hence providing analternative astrophysical insight on one of the most challenging questions ofgalaxy formation. in order to perform our analysis, we construct an analyticfitting formula that describes the effect of the baryons on the mass powerspectrum. this fitting formula is based on three scenarios of the owlhydrodynamical simulations. it is specifically calibrated for $z&lt;1.5$, where itmodels the simulations to an accuracy that is better than $2\%$ for scales$k&lt;10 h\mbox{mpc}^{-1}$ and better than $5\%$ for $10 &lt; k &lt; 100h\mbox{mpc}^{-1}$. equipped with this precise tool, this paper presents thefirst constraint on baryonic feedback models using gravitational lensing data,from the canada france hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens). in thisanalysis, we show that the effect of neutrino mass on the mass power spectrumis degenerate with the baryonic feedback at small angular scales and cannot beignored. assuming a cosmology precision fixed by wmap9, we find that a universewith no baryon feedback and massless neutrinos is rejected by the cfhtlenslensing data with 96\% confidence. our study shows that ongoing weakgravitational lensing surveys (kids, hsc and des) will offer a uniqueopportunity to probe the physics of baryons at galactic scales, in addition tothe expected constraints on the total neutrino mass.

1412.3683	cosmological constraints from weak lensing peak statistics with cfht  stripe 82 survey	we derived constraints on cosmological parameters using weak lensing peakstatistics measured on the $\sim130~{\rm deg}^2$ of the canada-france-hawaiitelescope stripe 82 survey (cs82). this analysis demonstrates the feasibilityof using peak statistics in cosmological studies. for our measurements, weconsidered peaks with signal-to-noise ratio in the range of $\nu=[3,6]$. for aflat $\lambda$cdm model with only $(\omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8)$ as freeparameters, we constrained the parameters of the following relation$\sigma_8=\sigma_8(\omega_{\rm m}/0.27)^{\alpha}$ to be: $\sigma_8=0.82 \pm0.03 $ and $\alpha=0.43\pm 0.02$. the $\alpha$ value found is considerablysmaller than the one measured in two-point and three-point cosmic shearcorrelation analyses, showing a significant complement of peak statistics tostandard weak lensing cosmological studies. the derived constraints on$(\omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8)$ are fully consistent with the ones from eitherwmap9 or planck. from the weak lensing peak abundances alone, we obtainedmarginalised mean values of $\omega_{\rm m}=0.38^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and$\sigma_8=0.81\pm 0.26$. finally, we also explored the potential of using weaklensing peak statistics to constrain the mass-concentration relation of darkmatter halos simultaneously with cosmological parameters.

1506.06313	testing modified gravity with cosmic shear	we use the cosmic shear data from the canada-france-hawaii telescope lensingsurvey to place constraints on $f(r)$ and {\it generalized dilaton} models ofmodified gravity. this is highly complimentary to other probes since theconstraints mainly come from the non-linear scales: maximal deviations withrespects to the general-relativity + $\lambda$cdm scenario occurs at $k\sim1 h\mbox{mpc}^{-1}$. at these scales, it becomes necessary to account for knowndegeneracies with baryon feedback and massive neutrinos, hence we placeconstraints jointly on these three physical effects. to achieve this, weformulate these modified gravity theories within a common tomographicparameterization, we compute their impact on the clustering properties relativeto a gr universe, and propagate the observed modifications into the weaklensing $\xi_{\pm}$ quantity. confronted against the cosmic shear data, wereject the $f(r)$ $\{ |f_{r_0}|=10^{-4}, n=1\}$ model with more than 99.9%confidence interval (ci) when assuming a $\lambda$cdm dark matter only model.in the presence of baryonic feedback processes and massive neutrinos with totalmass up to 0.2ev, the model is disfavoured with at least 94% ci in alldifferent combinations studied. constraints on the $\{ |f_{r_0}|=10^{-4},n=2\}$ model are weaker, but nevertheless disfavoured with at least 89% ci. weidentify several specific combinations of neutrino mass, baryon feedback and$f(r)$ or dilaton gravity models that are excluded by the current cosmic sheardata. notably, universes with three massless neutrinos and no baryon feedbackare strongly disfavoured in all modified gravity scenarios studied. theseresults indicate that competitive constraints may be achieved with futurecosmic shear data.

astro-ph;0603696	redshift and shear calibration: impact on cosmic shear studies and  survey design	the cosmological interpretation of weak lensing by large-scale structuresrequires knowledge of the redshift distribution of the source galaxies. currentlensing surveys are often calibrated using external redshift samples which spana significantly smaller sky area in comparison to the lensing survey, and arethus subject to sample variance. some future lensing surveys are expected to becalibrated in the same way, in particular the fainter galaxy populations wherethe entire color coverage, and hence photometric redshift estimate, could bechallenging to obtain. using n-body simulations, we study the impact of thissample variance on cosmic shear analysis and show that, to first approximation,it behaves like a shear calibration error 1+/-epsilon. using the hubble deepfield as a redshift calibration survey could therefore be a problem for currentlensing surveys. we discuss the impact of the redshift distribution samplingerror and a shear calibration error on the design of future lensing surveys,and find that a lensing survey of area theta square degrees and limitingmagnitude m_lim}, has a minimum shear and redshift calibration accuracyrequirements given by epsilon = epsilon_0 10^{beta(m_lim-24.5)} / sqrt(theta/200). above that limit, lensing surveys would not reach their full potential.using the galaxy number counts from the hubble ultra-deep field, we find(epsilon_0,beta)=(0.015,-0.18) and (epsilon_0,beta)=(0.011,-0.23) for groundand space based surveys respectively. lensing surveys with no or limitedredshift information and/or poor shear calibration accuracy will loose theirpotential to analyse the cosmic shear signal in the sub-degree angular scales,and therefore complete photometric redshift coverage should be a top priorityfor future lensing surveys.

astro-ph;0604001	potential sources of contamination to weak lensing measurements:  constraints from n-body simulations	we investigate the expected correlation between the weak gravitational shearof distant galaxies and the orientation of foreground galaxies, through the useof numerical simulations. this shear-ellipticity correlation can mimic acosmological weak lensing signal, and is potentially the limiting physicalsystematic effect for cosmology with future high-precision weak lensingsurveys. we find that, if uncorrected, the shear-ellipticity correlation couldcontribute up to 10% of the weak lensing signal on scales up to 20 arcminutes,for lensing surveys with a median depth z=1. the most massive foregroundgalaxies are expected to cause the largest correlations, a result also seen inthe sloan digital sky survey. we find that the redshift dependence of theeffect is proportional to the lensing efficiency of the foreground, and thisoffers prospects for removal to high precision, although with some modeldependence. the contamination is characterised by a weakly negative b-mode,which can be used as a diagnostic of systematic errors. we also provide moreaccurate predictions for a second potential source of error, the intrinsicalignment of nearby galaxies. this source of contamination is less important,however, as it can be easily removed with distance information.

astro-ph;0606648	cosmic variance of weak lensing surveys in the non-gaussian regime	the results from weak gravitational lensing analyses are subject to a cosmicvariance error term that has previously been estimated assuming gaussianstatistics. in this letter we address the issue of estimating cosmic varianceerrors for weak lensing surveys in the non-gaussian regime. using standard colddark matter model ray-tracing simulations characterized by omega_m=0.3,omega_lambda=0.7, h=0.7, sigma_8=1.0 for different survey redshifts z_s, wedetermine the variance of the two-point shear correlation function measuredacross 64 independent lines of sight. we compare the measured variance to thevariance expected from a random gaussian field and derive a redshift-dependentnon-gaussian calibration relation. we find that the ratio can be as high as ~30for a survey with source redshift z_s ~ 0.5 and ~10 for z_s ~ 1. the transitionscale theta_c above which the ratio is consistent with unity, is found to betheta_c ~ 20 arcmin for z_s ~ 0.5 and theta_c ~ 10 arcmin for z_s ~ 1. weprovide fitting formula to our results permitting the estimation ofnon-gaussian cosmic variance errors for any weak lensing analysis, and discussthe impact on current and future surveys. a more extensive set of simulationswill however be required to investigate the dependence of our results oncosmology, specifically on the amplitude of clustering.

astro-ph;0608643	the shear testing programme 2: factors affecting high precision weak  lensing analyses	the shear testing programme (step) is a collaborative project to improve theaccuracy and reliability of weak lensing measurement, in preparation for thenext generation of wide-field surveys. we review sixteen current and emergingshear measurement methods in a common language, and assess their performance byrunning them (blindly) on simulated images that contain a known shear signal.we determine the common features of algorithms that most successfully recoverthe input parameters. we achieve previously unattained discriminatory precisionin our analysis, via a combination of more extensive simulations, and pairs ofgalaxy images that have been rotated with respect to each other, thus removingnoise from their intrinsic ellipticities. the robustness of our simulationapproach is also confirmed by testing the relative calibration of methods onreal data.  weak lensing measurement has improved since the first step paper. severalmethods now consistently achieve better than 2% precision, and are still beingdeveloped. however, the simulations can now distinguish all methods fromperfect performance. our main concern continues to be the potential for amultiplicative shear calibration bias: not least because this can not beinternally calibrated with real data. we determine which galaxy populations areresponsible and, by adjusting the simulated observing conditions, we alsoinvestigate the effects of instrumental and atmospheric parameters. we haveisolated several previously unrecognised aspects of galaxy shape measurement,in which focussed development could provide further progress towards thesub-percent level of precision desired for future surveys.

astro-ph;0611932	lemomaf: lensed mock map facility	we present the lensed mock map facility (lemomaf), a tool designed to performmock weak lensing measurements on numerically simulated chunks of the universe.coupling n-body simulations to a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation,lemomaf can create realistic lensed images and mock catalogues of galaxies, atwavelengths ranging from the uv to the submm. to demonstrate the power of sucha tool we compute predictions of the source-lens clustering effect on theconvergence statistics, and quantify the impact of weak lensing on galaxycounts in two different filters. we find that the source-lens clustering effectskews the probability density function of the convergence towards low values,with an intensity which strongly depends on the redshift distribution ofgalaxies. on the other hand, the degree of enhancement or depletion in galaxycounts due to weak lensing is independent of the source-lens clustering effect.we discuss the impact on the two-points shear statistics to be measured byfuture missions like snap and lsst. the source-lens clustering effect wouldbias the estimation of sigma_8 from two point statistics by 2% -5%. we concludethat accurate photometric redshifts for individual galaxies are necessary inorder to quantify and isolate the source-lens clustering effect.

astro-ph;0701480	cosmos: 3d weak lensing and the growth of structure	we present a three dimensional cosmic shear analysis of the hubble spacetelescope cosmos survey, the largest ever optical imaging program performed inspace. we have measured the shapes of galaxies for the tell-tale distortionscaused by weak gravitational lensing, and traced the growth of that signal as afunction of redshift. using both 2d and 3d analyses, we measure cosmologicalparameters omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, thenormalization of the matter power spectrum. the introduction of redshiftinformation tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces therelative sampling (or "cosmic") variance compared to recent surveys that may belarger but are only two dimensional. from the 3d analysis, we findsigma_8*(omega_m/0.3)^0.44=0.866+^0.085_-0.068 at 68% confidence limits,including both statistical and potential systematic sources of error in thetotal budget. indeed, the absolute calibration of shear measurement methods isnow the dominant source of uncertainty. assuming instead a baseline cosmologyto fix the geometry of the universe, we have measured the growth of structureon both linear and non-linear physical scales. our results thus demonstrate aproof of concept for tomographic analysis techniques that have been proposedfor future weak lensing surveys by a dedicated wide-field telescope in space.

astro-ph;0702140	the stability of the point spread function of the advanced camera for  surveys on the hubble space telescope and implications for weak gravitational  lensing	(abridged) we examine the spatial and temporal stability of the hst acs widefield camera (wfc) point spread function (psf) using the two square degreecosmos survey. we show that stochastic aliasing of the psf necessarily occursduring `drizzling'. this aliasing is maximal if the output pixel scale is equalto the input pixel scale of 0.05''. we show that this source of psf variationcan be significantly reduced by choosing a gaussian drizzle kernel and bysetting the output pixel size to 0.03''. we show that the psf is temporallyunstable, most likely due to thermal fluctuations in the telescope's focus. wefind that the primary manifestation of this thermal drift in cosmos images isan overall slow periodic focus change. using a modified version of tinytim, wecreate undistorted stars in a 30x30 grid across the acs wfc ccds. these psfmodels are created for telescope focus values in the range -10 microns to +5microns, thus spanning the allowed range of telescope focus values. we then usethe approximately ten well measured stars in each cosmos field to pick thebest-fit focus value for each field. the tinytim model stars are then used toperform psf corrections for weak lensing allowing systematics due toincorrectly modeled psfs to be greatly reduced. we have made the software forpsf modeling using our modified version of tinytim available to theastronomical community. we show the effects of charge transfer efficiency (cte)degradation, which distorts the object in the readout direction, mimicking aweak lensing signal. we derive a parametric correction for the effect of cte onthe shapes of objects in the cosmos field as a function of observation date,position within the acs wfc field, and object flux.

astro-ph;0703570	cosmological constraints from the 100 square degree weak lensing survey	we present a cosmic shear analysis of the 100 square degree weak lensingsurvey, combining data from the cfhtls-wide, rcs, virmos-descart and gabodssurveys. spanning ~100 square degrees, with a median source redshift z~0.78,this combined survey allows us to place tight joint constraints on the matterdensity parameter omega_m, and the amplitude of the matter power spectrumsigma_8, finding sigma_8*(omega_m/0.24)^0.59 = 0.84+/-0.05. tables of themeasured shear correlation function and the calculated covariance matrix foreach survey are included.  the accuracy of our results is a marked improvement on previous work owing tothree important differences in our analysis; we correctly account for cosmicvariance errors by including a non-gaussian contribution estimated fromnumerical simulations; we correct the measured shear for a calibration bias asestimated from simulated data; we model the redshift distribution, n(z), ofeach survey from the largest deep photometric redshift catalogue currentlyavailable from the cfhtls-deep. this catalogue is randomly sampled to reproducethe magnitude distribution of each survey with the resulting survey dependentn(z) parametrised using two different models. while our results are consistentfor the n(z) models tested, we find that our cosmological parameter constraintsdepend weakly (at the 5% level) on the inclusion or exclusion of galaxies withlow confidence photometric redshift estimates (z&gt;1.5). these high redshiftgalaxies are relatively few in number but contribute a significant weak lensingsignal. it will therefore be important for future weak lensing surveys toobtain near-infra-red data to reliably determine the number of high redshiftgalaxies in cosmic shear analyses.

astro-ph;9708143	a new measure for cosmic shear	we consider here a new statistical measure for cosmic shear, the aperturemass map, which is defined as a spatially filtered projected density field andwhich can be measured directly from the image distortions of high-redshiftgalaxies. by selecting an appropriate spatial filter function, the dispersionof the aperture mass is a convolution of the power spectrum of the projecteddensity field with a narrow kernel, so that &lt;map**2(theta)&gt; provides a welllocalized estimate of the power spectrum at wavenumbers s~5/theta. we calculate&lt;map**2(theta)&gt; for various cosmological models, using the fully non-linearpower spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations. the non-linear evolutionyields a significant increase of &lt;map**2&gt; relative to the linear growth onscales below ~0.5 degree. the third-order moment of map can be used to define askewness, which is a measure of the non-gaussianity of the density field. wepresent the first calculation of the skewness of the shear in the frame ofquasi-linear theory of structure growth. we show that it yields a sensitivemeasure of the cosmological model; in particular, it is independent of thenormalization of the power spectrum. several practical estimates for &lt;map**2&gt;are constructed and their dispersions calculated. we show that one sq.deg. of ahigh-quality image is sufficient to detect the cosmic shear with themap-statistics on scales below ~10 arcmin, and to estimate its amplitude withan accuracy of ~30% on scales below ~5 arcmin.

astro-ph;9710244	scale dependence of the bias investigated by weak lensing	the statistical analysis of the lensing effects coupled with the statisticalanalysis of the number counts is a tool to probe directly the relation betweenthe mass and the light. in particular, some properties of the bias parametercan be investigated. the correlation between the shear of a given population ofgalaxies, and the number counts of a different population of galaxies along thesame line of sight is calculated for the linear and the non-linear powerspectra of density fluctuations for different cosmologies. the estimator rdefined as the ratio of this correlation and the variance of the number countsis inversely proportional to the bias parameter. unfortunately, r is highlydependent on the cosmological model, which makes a direct measure of the biasquite difficult. however, it is showed that rb is independent on the powerspectrum and the smoothing scale, thus r is a direct measure of the inverse ofthe bias times a function of the cosmological parameters. from r, a newestimator is defined which is only sensible to the scale dependence of thebias. it is showed that with a sample of 25 square degrees, one can measure ascale variation of the bias larger than 20% in the 1' to 10' scale range,almost independently of the cosmological parameters, the redshift distributionof the galaxies, and the power spectrum.

astro-ph;9802267	the evolution rate of quasars at various redshifts	the evolution of optically selected quasars is usually supposed to be welldescribed by a single constant parameter, either k_l or k_d, depending whetherwe refer to luminosity or density evolution. in this paper we present a studyof the variations of the evolution parameters with redshift, for differentcosmological models, in order to probe the differential evolution withredshift. two different quasar samples have been analyzed, the aat boyle's etal. and the lbqs catalogues. basically, these samples are divided in redshiftintervals and in each of them k_l and k_d are estimated by forcing that&lt;v/vmax&gt;=0.5. the dependence with respect to the cosmological parameters issmall. both aat and lbqs show roughly the same tendencies. lbqs, however, showsstrong fluctuations, whose origin is not statistical but rather due to theselection criteria. a discussion on selection techniques, biases and binningeffects explains the differences between these results. we finally concludethat the evolution parameter is almost constant in the redshift range 0.7 &lt; z &lt;1.7, at least within 2 sigma, while it decreases slightly afterwards. resultsdepend on the binning chosen (but not in a very significant way). the methodhas been tested with monte-carlo simulated catalogues in order to give a betterunderstanding of the results coming from the real catalogues. a correlationbetween k_l (k_d) and &lt;v/vmax&gt; is also derived and is used for the calculationof the error bars on the evolution parameter.

astro-ph;9910459	statistics of dark matter halos from gravitational lensing	we present a new approach to measure the mass function of dark matter halosand to discriminate models with differing values of omega through weakgravitational lensing. we measure the distribution of peaks from simulatedlensing surveys and show that the lensing signal due to dark matter halos canbe detected for a wide range of peak heights. even when the signal-to-noise iswell below the limit for detection of individual halos, projected halostatistics can be constrained for halo masses spanning galactic to clusterhalos. the use of peak statistics relies on an analytical model of the noisedue to the intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies. the noise model has beenshown to accurately describe simulated data for a variety of input ellipticitydistributions. we show that the measured peak distribution has distinctsignatures of gravitational lensing, and its non-gaussian shape can be used todistinguish models with different values of omega. the use of peak statisticsis complementary to the measurement of field statistics, such as theellipticity correlation function, and possibly not susceptible to the samesystematic errors.

0812.1881	sources of contamination to weak lensing tomography: redshift-dependent  shear measurement bias	the current methods available to estimate gravitational shear fromastronomical images of galaxies introduce systematic errors which can affectthe accuracy of weak lensing cosmological constraints. we study the impact ofksb shape measurement bias on the cosmological interpretation of tomographictwo-point weak lensing shear statistics.  we use a set of realistic image simulations produced by the stepcollaboration to derive shape measurement bias as a function of redshift. wedefine biased two-point weak lensing statistics and perform a likelihoodanalysis for two fiducial surveys. we present a derivation of the covariancematrix for tomography in real space and a fitting formula to calibrate it fornon-gaussianity.  we find the biased aperture mass dispersion is reduced by ~20% at redshift~1, and has a shallower scaling with redshift. this effect, if ignored in dataanalyses, biases sigma_8 and w_0 estimates by a few percent. the power oftomography is significantly reduced when marginalising over a range ofrealistic shape measurement biases. for a cfhtls-wide-like survey, [omega_m,sigma_8] confidence regions are degraded by a factor of 2, whereas for akids-like survey the factor is 3.5. our results are strictly valid only for ksbmethods but they demonstrate the need to marginalise over a redshift-dependentshape measurement bias in all future cosmological analyses.
