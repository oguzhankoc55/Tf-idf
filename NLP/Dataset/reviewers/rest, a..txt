0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0910.0075	optical cross correlation filters: an economical approach for  identifying sne ia and estimating their redshifts	large photometric surveys of transient phenomena, such as pan-starrs andlsst, will locate thousands to millions of type ia supernova candidates peryear, a rate prohibitive for acquiring spectroscopy to determine eachcandidate's type and redshift. in response, we have developed an economicalapproach to identifying sne ia and their redshifts using an uncommon type ofoptical filter which has multiple, discontinuous passbands on a singlesubstrate. observation of a supernova through a specially designed pair ofthese `cross-correlation filters' measures the approximate amplitude and phaseof the cross-correlation between the spectrum and a sn ia template, a quantitytypically used to determine the redshift and type of a high-redshift sn ia.simulating the use of these filters, we obtain a sample of sne ia which is ~98%pure with individual redshifts measured to 0.01 precision. the advantages ofthis approach over standard broadband photometric methods are that it isinsensitive to reddening, independent of the color data used for subsequentdistance determinations which reduces selection or interpretation bias, andbecause it makes use of the spectral features its reliability is greater. agreat advantage over long-slit spectroscopy comes from increased throughput,enhanced multiplexing and reduced set-up time resulting in a net gain in speedof up to ~30 times. this approach is also insensitive to host galaxycontamination. prototype filters were built and successfully used on magellanwith ldss-3 to characterize three snls candidates. we discuss how these filterscan provide critical information for the upcoming photometric supernovasurveys.

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1004.3783	on the interpretation of supernova light echo profiles and spectra	the light echo systems of historical supernovae in the milky way and localgroup galaxies provide an unprecedented opportunity to reveal the effects ofasymmetry on observables, particularly optical spectra. scattering dust atdifferent locations on the light echo ellipsoid witnesses the supernova fromdifferent perspectives and the light consequently scattered towards earthpreserves the shape of line profile variations introduced by asymmetries in thesupernova photosphere. however, the interpretation of supernova light echospectra to date has not involved a detailed consideration of the effects ofoutburst duration and geometrical scattering modifications due to finitescattering dust filament dimension, inclination, and image point-spreadfunction and spectrograph slit width. in this paper, we explore theimplications of these factors and present a framework for future resolvedsupernova light echo spectra interpretation, and test it against cas a and sn1987a light echo spectra. we conclude that the full modeling of the dimensionsand orientation of the scattering dust using the observed light echoes at twoor more epochs is critical for the correct interpretation of light echospectra. indeed, without doing so one might falsely conclude that differencesexist when none are actually present.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

0710.2338	constraining cosmic evolution of type ia supernovae	we present the first large-scale effort of creating composite spectra ofhigh-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia) and comparing them to low-redshiftcounterparts. through the essence project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88high-redshift sne ia with excellent light-curve information. in addition, wehave obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift sne through a multiple-decade effortat lick and keck observatories, and we have used 45 uv spectra obtained byhst/iue. the low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to theessence spectra. in all instances, the essence and lick composite spectraappear very similar. the addition of galaxy light to the lick composite spectraallows a nearly perfect match of the overall spectral-energy distribution withthe essence composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift sne are morecontaminated with host-galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. thisis caused by observing objects at all redshifts with the same slit width, whichcorresponds to different projected distances. after correcting for thegalaxy-light contamination, subtle differences in the spectra remain. we haveestimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates fork-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. the variance in the composite spectra give anestimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum-light sn spectra of~3% in the optical and growing toward the uv. the difference between themaximum light low and high-redshift spectra constrain sn evolution between oursamples to be &lt; 10% in the rest-frame optical.

1112.2210	light echoes reveal an unexpectedly cool eta carinae during its  19th-century great eruption	eta carinae (eta car) is one of the most massive binary stars in the milkyway. it became the second-brightest star in the sky during its mid-19th century"great eruption," but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates ofbrightness). its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in thatit exceeded the eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. because it is only 2.3kpc away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejectedmass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, eta carejected more than 10 m_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of atypical core-collapse supernova without destroying the star. here we report thediscovery of light echoes of eta carinae which appear to be from the 1838-1858great eruption. spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, whichare blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansionspeeds. the light-echo spectra correlate best with those of g2-g5 supergiantspectra, which have effective temperatures of ~5000 k. in contrast to the classof extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogs of eta car's great eruption,the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly cooler than allowedby standard opaque wind models. this indicates that other physical mechanismslike an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1204.1341	light echoes of transients and variables in the local universe	astronomical light echoes, the time-dependent light scattered by dust in thevicinity of varying objects, have been recognized for over a century.initially, their utility was thought to be confined to mapping out thethree-dimensional distribution of interstellar dust. recently, the discovery ofspectroscopically-useful light echoes around centuries-old supernovae in themilky way and the large magellanic cloud has opened up new scientificopportunities to exploit light echoes.  in this review, we describe the history of light echoes in the local universeand cover the many new developments in both the observation of light echoes andthe interpretation of the light scattered from them. among other benefits, wehighlight our new ability to spectroscopically classify outbursting objects, toview them from multiple perspectives, to obtain a spectroscopic time series ofthe outburst, and to establish accurate distances to the source event. we alsodescribe the broader range of variable objects whose properties may be betterunderstood from light echo observations. finally, we discuss the prospects ofnew light echo techniques not yet realized in practice.

1205.0252	an ultraviolet-optical flare from the tidal disruption of a helium-rich  stellar core	the flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star canbe used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant andundetected in the centres of distant galaxies. previous candidate flares havehad declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poorconstraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, becausethe rising emission was not observed. recently, two `relativistic' candidatetidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme x-ray luminosityand synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from arelativistic jet. here we report the discovery of a luminousultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at aredshift of 0.1696. the observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simpleaccreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decline of its light curvefollows the predicted mass accretion rate, and can be modelled to determine thetime of disruption to an accuracy of two days. the black hole has a mass ofabout 2 million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radiusof the star disrupted. on the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionizedhelium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was ahelium-rich stellar core.

1205.3103	weak-lensing mass measurements of five galaxy clusters in the south pole  telescope survey using magellan/megacam	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of five galaxyclusters selected from the south pole telescope (spt) survey, with the primarygoal of comparing these with the spt sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray basedmass estimates. the clusters span redshifts 0.28 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 and have massesm_500 &gt; 2 x 10^14 h^-1 m_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered bythe spt survey. we observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with themegacam imager on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. we measure a mean ratio ofweak lensing (wl) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the sz data,both within an aperture of r_500,sz derived from the sz mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.we measure a mean ratio of spherical wl masses evaluated at r_500,sz tospherical sz masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical wl massesevaluated at r_500,wl to spherical sz masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. we explorepotential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude thatall are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms beingcluster concentration uncertainty and n-body simulation calibration bias.expanding the sample of spt clusters with wl observations has the potential tosignificantly improve the spt cluster mass calibration and the resultingcosmological constraints from the spt cluster survey. these are the first wldetections using megacam on the magellan clay telescope.

1206.4050	ultra-luminous supernovae as a new probe of the interstellar medium in  distant galaxies	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery and light curves, and follow-up mmt andgemini spectroscopy of an ultra-luminous supernova (ulsn; dubbed ps1-11bam) ata redshift of z=1.566 with a peak brightness of m_uv=-22.3 mag. ps1-11bam isone of the highest redshift spectroscopically-confirmed sne known to date. thespectrum is characterized by broad absorption features typical of previousulsne (e.g., cii, siiii), and by strong and narrow mgii and feii absorptionlines from the interstellar medium (ism) of the host galaxy, confirmed by an[oii]3727 emission line at the same redshift. the equivalent widths of thefeii2600 and mgii2803 lines are in the top quartile of the quasar interveningabsorption system distribution, but are weaker than those of gamma-ray burstintrinsic absorbers (i.e., grb host galaxies). we also detect the host galaxyin pre-explosion pan-starrs1 data and find that its uv spectral energydistribution is best fit with a young stellar population age of tau~15-45 myrand a stellar mass of m \sim (1.1-2.6)x10^9 m_sun (for z=0.05-1 z_sun). thestar formation rate inferred from the uv continuum and [oii]3727 emission lineis ~10 m_sun/yr, higher than in any previous ulsn host. ps1-11bam provides thefirst direct demonstration that ulsne can serve as probes of the interstellarmedium in distant galaxies. at the present, the depth and red sensitivity ofps1 are uniquely suited to finding such events at cosmologically interestingredshifts (z~1-2); the future combination of lsst and 30-m class telescopespromises to extend this technique to z~4.

1207.4369	redshifts, sample purity, and bcg positions for the galaxy cluster  catalog from the first 720 square degrees of the south pole telescope survey	we present the results of the ground- and space-based optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up of 224 galaxy cluster candidates detected withthe sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect in the 720 deg^2 of the south pole telescope(spt) survey completed in the 2008 and 2009 observing seasons. we use theoptical/nir data to establish whether each candidate is associated with anoverdensity of galaxies and to estimate the cluster redshift. most photometricredshifts are derived through a combination of three different cluster redshiftestimators using red-sequence galaxies, resulting in an accuracy of \deltaz/(1+z)=0.017, determined through comparison with a subsample of 57 clustersfor which we have spectroscopic redshifts. we successfully measure redshiftsfor 158 systems and present redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates.the redshift distribution of the confirmed clusters extends to z=1.35 with amedian of z_{med}=0.57. approximately 18% of the sample with measured redshiftslies at z&gt;0.8. we estimate a lower limit to the purity of this spt sz-selectedsample by assuming that all unconfirmed clusters are noise fluctuations in thespt data. we show that the cumulative purity at detection significance \xi&gt;5(\xi&gt;4.5) is &gt;= 95 (&gt;= 70%). we present the red brightest cluster galaxy (rbcg)positions for the sample and examine the offsets between the spt candidateposition and the rbcg. the radial distribution of offsets is similar to thatseen in x-ray-selected cluster samples, providing no evidence that sz-selectedcluster samples include a different fraction of recent mergers thanx-ray-selected cluster samples.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1211.3781	asymmetry in the outburst of sn 1987a detected using light echo  spectroscopy	we report direct evidence for asymmetry in the early phases of sn 1987a viaoptical spectroscopy of five fields of its light echo system. the light echoesallow the first few hundred days of the explosion to be reobserved, withdifferent position angles providing different viewing angles to the supernova.light echo spectroscopy therefore allows a direct spectroscopic comparison oflight originating from different regions of the photosphere during the earlyphases of sn 1987a. gemini multi-object spectroscopy of the light echo fieldsshows fine-structure in the h-alpha line as a smooth function of position angleon the near-circular light echo rings. h-alpha profiles originating from thenorthern hemisphere of sn 1987a show an excess in redshifted emission and ablue knee, while southern hemisphere profiles show an excess of blueshiftedh-alpha emission and a red knee. this fine-structure is reminiscent of the"bochum event" originally observed for sn 1987a, but in an exaggerated form.maximum deviation from symmetry in the h-alpha line is observed at positionangles 16 and 186 degrees, consistent with the major-axis of the expandingelongated ejecta. the asymmetry signature observed in the h-alpha line smoothlydiminishes as a function of viewing angle away from the poles of the elongatedejecta. we propose an asymmetric two-sided distribution of 56ni most dominantin the southern far quadrant of sn 1987a as the most probable explanation ofthe observed light echo spectra. this is evidence that the asymmetry ofhigh-velocity 56ni in the first few hundred days after explosion is correlatedto the geometry of the ejecta some 25 years later.

1303.2726	alma redshifts of millimeter-selected galaxies from the spt survey: the  redshift distribution of dusty star-forming galaxies	using the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma), we haveconducted a blind redshift survey in the 3 mm atmospheric transmission windowfor 26 strongly lensd dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected with thesouth pole telescope (spt). the sources were selected to have s_1.4mm&gt;20 mjyand a dust-like spectrum and, to remove low-z sources, not have bright radio(s_843mhz&lt;6mjy) or far-infrared counterparts (s_100um&lt;1 jy, s_60um&lt;200mjy). werobustly detect 44 line features in our survey, which we identify as redshiftedemission lines of 12co, 13co, [ci], h2o, and h2o+. we find one or more spectralfeatures in 23 sources yielding a ~90% detection rate for this survey; in 12 ofthese sources we detect multiple lines, while in 11 sources we detect only asingle line. for the sources with only one detected line, we break the redshiftdegeneracy with additional spectroscopic observations if available, or inferthe most likely line identification based on photometric data. this yieldssecure redshifts for ~70% of the sample. the three sources with no linesdetected are tentatively placed in the redshift desert between 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.0. theresulting mean redshift of our sample is &lt;z&gt;=3.5. this finding is in contrastto the redshift distribution of radio-identified dsfgs, which have asignificantly lower mean redshift of &lt;z&gt;=2.3 and for which only 10-15% of thepopulation is expected to be at z&gt;3. we discuss the effect of gravitationallensing on the redshift distribution and compare our measured redshiftdistribution to that of models in the literature.

1304.3320	super luminous ic supernovae: catching a magnetar by the tail	we report extensive observational data for five of the lowest redshiftsuper-luminous type ic supernovae (sl-sne ic) discovered to date, namelyptf10hgi, sn2011ke, ptf11rks, sn2011kf and sn2012il. photometric imaging of thetransients at +50 to +230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtractionreveals a luminous tail phase for four of these sl-sne. a high resolution,optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broadhe i $\lambda$10830 emission line in the spectrum (+50d) of sn2012il, revealingthat at least some sl-sne ic are not completely helium free. at first sight,the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with theradioactive decay of \co, and would require 1-4m of \ni to produce theluminosity. these \ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusiontimes at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. weinstead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source forthese objects. a semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from thespin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. themodel predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required arein reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. we derivemagnetar energies of $0.4\lesssim e$($10^{51}$erg) $\lesssim6.9$ and ejectamasses of $2.3\lesssim m_{ej}$(\m) $\lesssim 8.6$. the sample of five sl-sne icpresented here, combined with sn 2010gx - the best sampled sl-sne ic so far -point toward an explosion driven by a magnetar as a viable explanation for allsl-sne ic.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.3824	systematic uncertainties associated with the cosmological analysis of  the first pan-starrs1 type ia supernova sample	we probe the systematic uncertainties from 113 type ia supernovae (snia) inthe pan-starrs1 (ps1) sample along with 197 sn ia from a combination oflow-redshift surveys. the companion paper by rest et al. (2013) describes thephotometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the ps1 sample. thelargest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of theps1 and low-z samples. we increase the sample of observed calspec standardsfrom 7 to 10 used to define the ps1 calibration system. the ps1 and sdss-iicalibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag arerecovered. we find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colorsand reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. weestimate masses of host galaxies of ps1 supernovae and detect an insignificantdifference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037\pm0.031 mag forhost galaxies with high and low masses. assuming flatness in our analysis ofonly sne measurements, we find $w = {-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)}^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}}$. with additional constraints from bao,cmb(planck) and h0 measurements, we find $w = -1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ and$\omega_m=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ (statistical and systematic errors added inquadrature). significance of the inconsistency with $w=-1$ depends on whetherwe use planck or wmap measurements of the cmb:$w_{\textrm{bao+h0+sn+wmap}}=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$.

1310.3828	cosmological constraints from measurements of type ia supernovae  discovered during the first 1.5 years of the pan-starrs1 survey	we present griz light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed type iasupernovae ($0.03 &lt; z &lt;0.65$) discovered during the first 1.5 years of thepan-starrs1 medium deep survey. the pan-starrs1 natural photometric system isdetermined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument responsefunction and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. we find thatthe systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2\%without accounting for the uncertainty in the hst calspec definition of the absystem. a hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 sne iathat pass our light curve quality cuts. the cosmological fit to 310 sne ia (113ps1 sne ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z sne ia), using only sne andassuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields$w=-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)} ^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}$.when combined with bao+cmb(planck)+$h_0$, the analysis yields $\omega_{\rmm}=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ and $w=-1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ including allidentified systematics (see also scolnic et al. 2014). the value of $w$ isinconsistent with the cosmological constant value of $-1$ at the 2.3$\sigma$level. tension endures after removing either the bao or the $h_0$ constraint,though it is strongest when including the $h_0$ constraint. if we include wmap9cmb constraints instead of those from planck, we find$w=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$, which diminishes the discord to $&lt;2\sigma$. wecannot conclude whether the tension with flat $\lambda$cdm is a feature of darkenergy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. the fullpan-starrs1 supernova sample with $\sim\!\!$3 times as many sne should providemore conclusive results.

1310.4417	the superluminous supernova ps1-11ap: bridging the gap between low and  high redshift	we present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of thesuperluminous supernova (slsn) ps1-11ap, discovered with the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey at z = 0.524. this intrinsically blue transient rose slowly toreach a peak magnitude of m_u = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 x10^43 ergs^-1 before settling onto a relatively shallow gradient of decline.the observed decline is significantly slower than those of the superluminoustype ic sne which have been the focus of much recent attention. spectroscopicsimilarities with the lower redshift sn2007bi and a decline rate similar to56co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be acandidate for a pair instability supernova (pisn) explosion. overall thetransient appears quite similar to sn2007bi and the lower redshift objectptf12dam. the extensive data set, from 30 days before peak to 230 days after,allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of pisnexplosions. we find that the ps1-11ap data do not match these model explosionparameters well, supporting the recent claim that these sne are not pairinstability explosions. we show that ps1-11ap has many features in common withthe faster declining superluminous ic supernovae and the lightcurve evolutioncan also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin down model. at aredshift of z = 0.524 the observer frame optical coverage providescomprehensive restframe uv data and allows us to compare it with thesuperluminous sne recently found at high redshifts between z = 2-4. while thesehigh-z explosions are still plausible pisn candidates, they match thephotometric evolution of ps1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lowerredshift transient.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.0026	hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts have similar host galaxies	we present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-ir photometry of 31 hostgalaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including 15 eventsfrom the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey. our sample spans the redshift range0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specificsubclass of cosmic explosions. combining the multi-band photometry andemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, starformation rates and metallicities. we find that as a whole, the hosts of slsneare a low-luminosity (&lt;m_b&gt; ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (&lt;m_*&gt; ~ 2 x 10^8m_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (&lt;ssfr&gt; ~ 2gyr^-1). the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +log(o/h}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solarmetallicity. the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are statistically distinct fromthe hosts of goods core-collapse sne (which cover a similar redshift range),but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) interms of stellar mass, sfr, ssfr and metallicity. this result indicates thatthe environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbsare similar, and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in lowmetallicity environments. we speculate that the key ingredient is large coreangular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in slsne and anaccreting black hole in lgrbs.

1311.4953	optical spectroscopy and velocity dispersions of galaxy clusters from  the spt-sz survey	we present optical spectroscopy of galaxies in clusters detected through thesunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we reportour own measurements of $61$ spectroscopic cluster redshifts, and $48$ velocitydispersions each calculated with more than $15$ member galaxies. this catalogalso includes $19$ dispersions of spt-observed clusters previously reported inthe literature. the majority of the clusters in this paper are spt-discovered;of these, most have been previously reported in other spt cluster catalogs, andfive are reported here as spt discoveries for the first time. by performing aresampling analysis of galaxy velocities, we find that unbiased velocitydispersions can be obtained from a relatively small number of member galaxies($\lesssim 30$), but with increased systematic scatter. we use this analysis todetermine statistical confidence intervals that include the effect ofmembership selection. we fit scaling relations between the observed clustervelocity dispersions and mass estimates from sz and x-ray observables. in bothcases, the results are consistent with the scaling relation between velocitydispersion and mass expected from dark-matter simulations. we measure a$\sim$30% log-normal scatter in dispersion at fixed mass, and a $\sim$10%offset in the normalization of the dispersion-mass relation when compared tothe expectation from simulations, which is within the expected level ofsystematic uncertainty.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

(2012). by obtaining images and spectra at the same light echo positionbetween 2011 and 2014, we follow the evolution of the great eruption on athree-year timescale. we find remarkable changes in the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of the echo light. the $i$-band light curve shows adecline of $\sim 0.9$ mag in $\sim 1$ year after the peak observed in early2011 and a flattening at later times. the spectra show a pure-absorption earlyg-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the[ca ii] triplet develop strong p-cygni profiles and we see the appearance of[ca ii] 7291,7324 doublet in emission. these emission features and theirevolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some type iinsupernovae and supernova impostors. most surprisingly, starting $\sim 300$ daysafter peak brightness, the spectra show strong molecular transitions of cn at$\gtrsim 6800$ \aa. the appearance of these cn features can be explained if theejecta are strongly nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modernspectroscopic studies of the bipolar homunculus nebula. given the spectroscopicevolution of the light echo, velocities of the main features, and detection ofstrong cn, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to thehomunculus nebula.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1405.1325	super-luminous supernovae from pessto	we present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poorsuper-luminous supernovae followed by the public eso spectroscopic survey oftransient objects (pessto). time series spectroscopy from a few days aftermaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,with spectra dominated by ca ii, mg ii, fe ii and si ii, which evolve slowlyover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. we determine bolometric lightcurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy inputby magnetar spin-down, 56ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaquecircumstellar shell. we investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of oursample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain thepossible mechanisms behind these events. we have followed these events tobeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fadingsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diversebehaviour at this phase. models powered by radioactivity require unrealisticparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previousstudies. both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to beviable candidates. a large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phaseluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapiddrop in flux. this would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, orthat the x-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. the lightcurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d aftermaximum light. we argue that this could result either from multiple shells ofcircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of theejecta.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1407.2942	mass calibration and cosmological analysis of the spt-sz galaxy cluster  sample using velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ and x-ray $y_\textrm{x}$  measurements	we present a velocity dispersion-based mass calibration of the south poletelescope sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey (spt-sz) galaxy cluster sample.using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster candidates from 720 deg2of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and 16 x-ray yxmeasurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate themass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. thecalibrations using $\sigma_v$ and yx are consistent at the $0.6\sigma$ level,with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. we use the fullcluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. thespt cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the wmap9 orplanck+wmap9 polarization (wp) data, but assuming the sum of the neutrinomasses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ ev, we find the datasets to be consistent at the1.0$\sigma$ level for wmap9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for planck+wp. allowing for larger$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. when we combine the cluster andplanck+wp datasets with bao and snia, the preferred cluster masses are$1.9\sigma$ higher than the yx calibration and $0.8\sigma$ higher than the$\sigma_v$ calibration. given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23% in mass,respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension,indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of thedata. using the multi-probe dataset, we measure $\omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and$\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. within a $\nu$cdm model we find $\sum m_\nu =0.148\pm0.081$ ev. we present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of stateparameter $w$ to vary, we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$,demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with alcdm model ($\gamma=0.55; \,w=-1$).

1409.7728	the host galaxy and late-time evolution of the super-luminous supernova  ptf12dam	super-luminous supernovae of type ic have a tendency to occur in faint hostgalaxies which are likely to have low mass and low metallicity. ptf12dam is oneof the closest and best studied super-luminous explosions that has a broad andslowly fading lightcurve similar to sn 2007bi. here we present new photometryand spectroscopy for ptf12dam from 200-500 days (rest-frame) after peak and adetailed analysis of the host galaxy (sdss j142446.21+461348.6 at z = 0.107).using deep templates and image subtraction we show that the full lightcurve canbe fit with a magnetar model if escape of high-energy gamma rays is taken intoaccount. the full bolometric lightcurve from -53 to +399 days (with respect topeak) cannot be fit satisfactorily with the pair-instability models. analternative model of interaction with a dense csm produces a good fit to thedata although this requires a very large mass (~ 13 m_sun) of hydrogen freecsm. the host galaxy is a compact dwarf (physical size ~ 1.9 kpc) and with m_g= -19.33 +/- 0.10, it is the brightest nearby slsn ic host discovered so far.the host is a low mass system (2.8 x 10^8 m_sun) with a star-formation rate(5.0 m_sun/year), which implies a very high specific star-formation rate (17.9gyr^-1). the remarkably strong nebular lines provide detections of the [o iii]\lambda 4363 and [o ii] \lambda\lambda 7320,7330 auroral lines and an accurateoxygen abundance of 12 + log(o/h) = 8.05 +/- 0.09. we show here that they areat the extreme end of the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies andpropose that low metallicity is a requirement to produce these rare andpeculiar supernovae.

1411.1060	zooming in on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae with the hst	we present hubble space telescope (hst) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of thehost galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including11 events from the pan-starrs medium deep survey. taking advantage of thesuperb angular resolution of hst, we characterize the galaxies' morphologicalproperties, sizes and star formation rate (sfr) densities. we determine thesupernova (sn) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometricmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the snpositions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness. wefind that the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are irregular, compact dwarfgalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. the uv-derived sfrdensities are high (&lt;sigma_sfr&gt; ~ 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that slsneform in overdense environments. their locations trace the uv light of theirhost galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regionsof their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normalcore-collapse sne), though cannot be statistically distinguished from eitherwith the current sample size. taken together, this strengthens the picture thatslsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinarycore-collapse sne to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies asdo lgrbs. if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightestregions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate adifferent, potentially lower-mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1501.01314	selection of burst-like transients and stochastic variables using  multi-band image differencing in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey	we present a novel method for the light-curve characterization of pan-starrs1medium deep survey (ps1 mds) extragalactic sources into stochastic variables(sv) and burst-like (bl) transients, using multi-band image-differencingtime-series data. we select detections in difference images associated withgalaxy hosts using a star/galaxy catalog extracted from the deep ps1 mdsstacked images, and adopt a maximum a posteriori formulation to model theirdifference-flux time-series in four pan-starrs1 photometric bands g,r,i, and z.we use three deterministic light-curve models to fit burst-like transients andone stochastic light curve model, the ornstein-uhlenbeck process, in order tofit variability that is characteristic of active galactic nuclei (agn). weassess the quality of fit of the models band-wise source-wise, using theirestimated leave-out-one cross-validation likelihoods and corrected akaikeinformation criteria. we then apply a k-means clustering algorithm on thesestatistics, to determine the source classification in each band. the finalsource classification is derived as a combination of the individual filterclassifications. we use our clustering method to characterize 4361extragalactic image difference detected sources in the first 2.5 years of theps1 mds, into 1529 bl, and 2262 sv, with a purity of 95.00% for agn, and 90.97%for sn based on our verification sets. we combine our light-curveclassifications with their nuclear or off-nuclear host galaxy offsets, todefine a robust photometric sample of 1233 active galactic nuclei and 812supernovae. we use these samples to identify simple photometric priors thatwould enable their real-time identification in future wide-field synopticsurveys.

1501.05470	machine learning for transient discovery in pan-starrs1 difference  imaging	efficient identification and follow-up of astronomical transients is hinderedby the need for humans to manually select promising candidates from datastreams that contain many false positives. these artefacts arise in thedifference images that are produced by most major ground-based time domainsurveys with large format ccd cameras. this dependence on humans to rejectbogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys andsignificant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally.in this paper we explore a simple machine learning approach to real-bogusclassification by constructing a training set from the image data of ~32000real astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey. we derive our feature representation from the pixel intensityvalues of a 20x20 pixel stamp around the centre of the candidates. this differsfrom previous work in that it works directly on the pixels rather thancatalogued domain knowledge for feature design or selection. three machinelearning algorithms are trained (artificial neural networks, support vectormachines and random forests) and their performances are tested on a held-outsubset of 25% of the training data. we find the best results from the randomforest classifier and demonstrate that by accepting a false positive rate of1%, the classifier initially suggests a missed detection rate of around 10%.however we also find that a combination of bright star variability, nucleartransients and uncertainty in human labelling means that our best estimate ofthe missed detection rate is approximately 6%.

1502.06964	galex detection of shock breakout in type ii-p supernova ps1-13arp:  implications for the progenitor star wind	we present the galex detection of a uv burst at the time of explosion of anoptically normal type ii-p supernova (ps1-13arp) from the pan-starrs1 survey atz=0.1665. the temperature and luminosity of the uv burst match the theoreticalpredictions for shock breakout in a red supergiant, but with a duration afactor of ~50 longer than expected. we compare the $nuv$ light curve ofps1-13arp to previous galex detections of type iip sne, and find cleardistinctions that indicate that the uv emission is powered by shock breakout,and not by the subsequent cooling envelope emission previously detected inthese systems. we interpret the ~ 1 d duration of the uv signal with a shockbreakout in the wind of a red supergiant with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate of~ 10^-3 msun yr^-1. this mass-loss rate is enough to prolong the duration ofthe shock breakout signal, but not enough to produce an excess in the opticalplateau light curve or narrow emission lines powered by circumstellarinteraction. this detection of non-standard, potentially episodic highmass-loss in a rsg sn progenitor has favorable consequences for the prospectsof future wide-field uv surveys to detect shock breakout directly in thesesystems, and provide a sensitive probe of the pre-explosion conditions of snprogenitors.

1506.03115	detection of a type iin supernova in optical follow-up observations of  icecube neutrino events	the icecube neutrino observatory pursues a follow-up program selectinginteresting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagneticfollow-up observations. in march 2012, the most significant neutrino alertduring the first three years of operation was issued by icecube. in thefollow-up observations performed by the palomar transient factory (ptf), a typeiin supernova (sn) ptf12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alertdirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. it has a redshift of$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,\mathrm{mpc}$ and the pan-starrs1 survey shows that its explosion time was atleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that acausal connection is unlikely. the a posteriori significance of the chancedetection of both the neutrinos and the sn at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$within icecube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. also, a complementaryneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.therefore, we consider the sn detection coincidental and the neutrinosuncorrelated to the sn. however, the sn is unusual and interesting by itself:it is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the sn iin 2010jl,and shows signs of interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium. high-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shockacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific sn. in thispaper, we describe the sn ptf12csy and present both the neutrino andelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

1508.05361	supercal: cross-calibration of multiple photometric systems to improve  cosmological measurements with type ia supernovae	current cosmological analyses which use type ia supernova (sn ia)observations combine sn samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of asingle sample and increase the overall sample size. the inhomogeneousphotometric calibration between different sn samples is one of the largestsystematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. to placethese different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observationsof a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $hst$ system. we proposea complementary method, called `supercal', in which we use measurements ofsecondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the samestars in the pan-starrs1 (ps1) system, and determine offsets for each systemrelative to ps1, placing all sn observations on a single, consistentphotometric system. ps1 has observed $3\pi$ of the sky and has a relativecalibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\sim15&lt;griz&lt;21$ mag), making it anideal reference system. we use this process to recalibrate optical observationstaken by the following sn samples: ps1, snls, sdss, csp, and cfa1-4. we measurediscrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various opticalpassbands. we find that correcting for these differences changes recoveredvalues for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average$2.6\%$. this change is roughly half the size of current statisticalconstraints on $w$. the size of this effect strongly depends on the error inthe $b-v$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. the supercal method will allowfuture analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.

astro-ph;0102292	dusty nuclear disks and filaments in early type galaxies	we examine the dust properties of a nearby distance-limited sample of earlytype galaxies using the wfpc2 of the hubble space telescope. dust is detectedin 29 out of 67 galaxies (43%), including 12 with small nuclear dusty disks. ina separate sample of 40 galaxies biased for the detection of dust by virtue oftheir detection in the iras 100 micron band, dust is found in ~78% of thegalaxies, 15 of which contain dusty disks. in those galaxies with detectabledust, the apparent mass of the dust correlates with radio and far infraredluminosity, becoming more significant for systems with filamentary dust. amajority of iras and radio detections are also associated with dusty galaxiesrather than dustless galaxies. this indicates that thermal emission fromclumpy, filamentary dust is the main source of the far-ir radiation in earlytype galaxies. dust in small disk-like morphology tends to be well aligned withthe major axis of the host galaxies, while filamentary dust appears to be morerandomly distributed with no preference for alignment with any major galacticstructure. this suggests that, if the dusty disks and filaments have a commonorigin, the dust originates externally and requires time to dynamically relaxand settle in the galaxy potential in the form of compact disks. more galaxieswith visible dust than without dust display emission lines, indicative ofionized gas, although such nuclear activity does not show a preference fordusty disk over filamentary dust. there appears to be a weak relationshipbetween the mass of the dusty disks and central velocity dispersion of thegalaxy, suggesting a connection with a similar recently recognized relationshipbetween the latter and the black hole mass.

astro-ph;0409167	the supermacho microlensing survey	we present the first results from our next-generation microlensing survey,the supermacho project. we are using the ctio 4m blanco telescope and themosaic imager to carry out a search for microlensing toward the largemagellanic cloud (lmc). we plan to ascertain the nature of the populationresponsible for the excess microlensing rate seen by the macho project. ourobserving strategy is optimized to measure the differential microlensing rateacross the face of the lmc. we find this derivative to be relativelyinsensitive to the details of the lmc's internal structure but a strongdiscriminant between galactic halo and lmc self lensing. in december 2003 wecompleted our third year of survey operations. 2003 also marked the first yearof real-time microlensing alerts and photometric and spectroscopic followup. wehave extracted several dozen microlensing candidates, and we present somepreliminary light curves and related information. similar to the macho project,we find sne behind the lmc to be a significant contaminant - this backgroundhas not been completely removed from our current single-color candidate sample.our follow-up strategy is optimized to discriminate between sne and truemicrolensing.

astro-ph;0411357	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first two years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations of targets discoveredduring the first two years of the essence project. the goal of essence is touse a sample of ~200 type ia supernovae (sne ia) at moderate redshifts (0.2 &lt; z&lt; 0.8) to place constraints on the equation of state of the universe.spectroscopy not only provides the redshifts of the objects, but also confirmsthat some of the discoveries are indeed sne ia. this confirmation is criticalto the project, as techniques developed to determine luminosity distances tosne ia depend upon the knowledge that the objects at high redshift are the sameas the ones at low redshift. we describe the methods of target selection andprioritization, the telescopes and detectors, and the software used to identifyobjects. the redshifts deduced from spectral matching of high-redshift sne iawith low-redshift sne ia are consistent with those determined from host-galaxyspectra. we show that the high-redshift sne ia match well with low-redshifttemplates. we include all spectra obtained by the essence project, including 52sne ia, 5 core-collapse sne, 12 active galactic nuclei, 19 galaxies, 4 possiblyvariable stars, and 16 objects with uncertain identifications.

astro-ph;0508681	hubble space telescope observations of nine high-redshift essence  supernovae	we present broad-band light curves of nine supernovae ranging in redshiftfrom 0.5 to 0.8. the supernovae were discovered as part of the essence project,and the light curves are a combination of cerro tololo 4-m and hubble spacetelescope (hst) photometry. on the basis of spectra and/or light-curve fitting,eight of these objects are definitely type ia supernovae, while theclassification of one is problematic. the essence project is a five-yearendeavor to discover about 200 high-redshift type ia supernovae, with the goalof tightly constraining the time average of the equation-of-state parameter [w= p/(rho c^2)] of the "dark energy." to help minimize our systematic errors,all of our ground-based photometry is obtained with the same telescope andinstrument. in 2003 the highest-redshift subset of essence supernovae wasselected for detailed study with hst. here we present the first photometricresults of the survey. we find that all but one of the essence sne have slowlydeclining light curves, and the sample is not representative of thelow-redshift set of essence type ia supernovae. this is unlikely to be a signof evolution in the population. we attribute the decline-rate distribution ofhst events to a selection bias at the high-redshift edge of our sample and findthat such a bias will infect other magnitude-limited sn ia searches unlessappropriate precautions are taken.

astro-ph;0509240	testing lmc microlensing scenarios: the discrimination power of the  supermacho microlensing survey	characterizing the nature and spatial distribution of the lensing objectsthat produce the previously measured microlensing optical depth toward thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc) remains an open problem. we present an appraisalof the ability of the supermacho project, a next-generation microlensing surveydirected toward the lmc, to discriminate between various proposed lensingpopulations. we consider two scenarios: lensing by a uniform foreground screenof objects and self-lensing by lmc stars. we have carried out extensivesimulations, based upon data obtained during the first year of the project, toassess the supermacho survey's ability to discriminate between these twoscenarios. we find that the event rate itself shows significant sensitivity tothe choice of the lmc luminosity function, limiting the conclusions which canbe drawn from the absolute rate. if instead we determine the differential eventrate across the lmc, we will decrease the impact of these systematic biases andrender our conclusions more robust. with this approach the supermacho projectshould be able to distinguish between the two categories of lens populations.this will provide important constraints on the nature of the lensing objectsand their contributions to the galactic dark matter halo.

astro-ph;0510089	using line profiles to test the fraternity of type ia supernovae at high  and low redshifts	using archival data of low-redshift (z &lt; 0.01) type ia supernovae (sn ia) andrecent observations of high-redshift (0.16 &lt; z &lt;0.64; matheson et al. 2005) snia, we study the "uniformity'' of the spectroscopic properties of nearby anddistant sn ia. we find no difference in the measures we describe here. in thispaper, we base our analysis solely on line-profile morphology, focusing onmeasurements of the velocity location of maximum absorption (vabs) and peakemission (vpeak). we find that the evolution of vabs and vpeak for our samplelines (ca ii 3945, si ii 6355, and s ii 5454, 5640) is similar for both thelow- and high-redshift samples. we find that vabs for the weak s ii 5454, 5640lines, and vpeak for s ii 5454, can be used to identify fast-declining [dm15 &gt;1.7] sn ia, which are also subluminous. in addition, we give the first directevidence in two high-z sn ia spectra of a double-absorption feature in ca ii3945, an event also observed, though infrequently, in low-redshift sn iaspectra (6/22 sn ia in our local sample). we report for the first time theunambiguous and systematic intrinsic blueshift of peak emission of opticalp-cygni line profiles in type ia spectra, by as much as 8000 km/s. all thehigh-z sn ia analyzed in this paper were discovered and followed up by theessence collaboration, and are now publicly available.

astro-ph;0510738	echoes from ancient supernovae in the large magellanic cloud	in principle, the light from historical supernovae could still be visible asscattered-light echoes even centuries later. however, while echoes have beendiscovered around some nearby extragalactic supernovae well after theexplosion, targeted searches have not recovered any echoes in the regions ofhistorical galactic supernovae. the discovery of echoes can allow us topinpoint the supernova event both in position and age and, most importantly,allow us to acquire spectra of the echo light to type the supernova centuriesafter the direct light from the explosion first reached the earth. here wereport on the discovery of three faint new variable surface brightnesscomplexes with high apparent proper motion pointing back to well-definedpositions in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). these positions correspond tothree of the six smallest (and likely youngest) previously catalogued supernovaremnants, and are believed to be due to thermonuclear (type ia) supernovae.using the distance and proper motions of these echo arcs, we estimate ages of610 and 410 yr for the echoes #2 and #3.

astro-ph;0701041	observational constraints on the nature of the dark energy: first  cosmological results from the essence supernova survey	we present constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter,w=p/(rho c^2), using 60 type ia supernovae (sne ia) from the essence supernovasurvey. we derive a set of constraints on the nature of the dark energyassuming a flat universe. by including constraints on (omega_m, w) from baryonacoustic oscillations, we obtain a value for a static equation-of-stateparameter w=-1.05^{+0.13}_{-0.12} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.11 (sys) andomega_m=0.274^{+0.033}_{-0.020} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fit chi^2/dof of0.96. these results are consistent with those reported by the supernova legacysurvey in a similar program measuring supernova distances and redshifts. weevaluate sources of systematic error that afflict supernova observations andpresent monte carlo simulations that explore these effects. currently, thelargest systematic currently with the potential to affect our measurements isthe treatment of extinction due to dust in the supernova host galaxies.combining our set of essence sne ia with the supernova legacy survey sne ia, weobtain a joint constraint of w=-1.07^{+0.09}_{-0.09} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.12(sys), omega_m=0.267^{+0.028}_{-0.018} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fitchi^2/dof of 0.91. the current sn ia data are fully consistent with acosmological constant.

astro-ph;0701043	the essence supernova survey: survey optimization, observations, and  supernova photometry	we describe the implementation and optimization of the essence supernovasurvey, which we have undertaken to measure the equation of state parameter ofthe dark energy. we present a method for optimizing the survey exposure timesand cadence to maximize our sensitivity to the dark energy equation of stateparameter w=p/rho c^2 for a given fixed amount of telescope time. for oursurvey on the ctio 4m telescope, measuring the luminosity distances andredshifts for supernovae at modest redshifts (z~0.5 +- 0.2) is optimal fordetermining w. we describe the data analysis pipeline based on using reliableand robust image subtraction to find supernovae automatically and in nearreal-time. since making cosmological inferences with supernovae reliescrucially on accurate measurement of their brightnesses, we describe ourefforts to establish a thorough calibration of the ctio 4m natural photometricsystem. in its first four years, essence has discovered and spectroscopicallyconfirmed 102 type ia sne, at redshifts from 0.10 to 0.78, identified throughan impartial, effective methodology for spectroscopic classification andredshift determination. we present the resulting light curves for the all typeia supernovae found by essence and used in our measurement of w, presented inwood-vasey et al, 2007.

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.
