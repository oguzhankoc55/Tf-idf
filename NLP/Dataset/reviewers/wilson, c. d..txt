0704.1245	outflow and infall in a sample of massive star forming regions	we present single pointing observations of sio, hco$^+$ and h$^{13}$co$^+$from the james clerk maxwell telescope towards 23 massive star forming regionspreviously known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact hii regions. wedetected sio towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in theother nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and withoutongoing shocks to replenish the sio. we serendipitously detected so$_2$ towards17 sources in the same tuning as hco$^+$. we detected hco$^+$ towards allsources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. for seven infallcandidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and2$\times10^{-5}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. seven sources show both sio detections(young outflows) and hco$^+$ infall signatures. we also find that the abundanceof h$^{13}$co$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of sio in sourcesfor which we could determine abundances. we discuss these results with respectto current theories of massive star formation via accretion. from this survey,we suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretionmay be important in describing the evolution of a massive protostar (orprotostars) beyond the formation of an hii region.

0911.3369	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iii: comparisons of cold dust,  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, molecular gas, and atomic gas in ngc 2403	we used 3.6, 8.0, 70, 160 micron spitzer space telescope data, james clerkmaxwell telescope harp-b co j=(3-2) data, national radio astronomy observatory12 meter telescope co j=(1-0) data, and very large array hi data to investigatethe relations among pahs, cold (~20 k) dust, molecular gas, and atomic gaswithin ngc 2403, an sabcd galaxy at a distance of 3.13 mpc. the dust surfacedensity is mainly a function of the total (atomic and molecular) gas surfacedensity and galactocentric radius. the gas-to-dust ratio monotonicallyincreases with radius, varying from ~100 in the nucleus to ~400 at 5.5 kpc. theslope of the gas-to-dust ratio is close to that of the oxygen abundance,suggesting that metallicity strongly affects the gas-to-dust ratio within thisgalaxy. the exponential scale length of the radial profile for the co j=(3-2)emission is statistically identical to the scale length for the stellarcontinuum-subtracted 8 micron (pah 8 micron) emission. however, co j=(3-2) andpah 8 micron surface brightnesses appear uncorrelated when examining sub-kpcsized regions.

1003.1751	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey ii: warm molecular gas and star  formation in three field spiral galaxies	we present the results of large-area co j=3-2 emission mapping of threenearby field galaxies, ngc 628, ngc 3521, and ngc 3627, completed at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope as part of the nearby galaxies legacy survey. thesegalaxies all have moderate to strong co j=3-2 detections over large areas ofthe fields observed by the survey, showing resolved structure and dynamics intheir warm/dense molecular gas disks. all three galaxies were part of thespitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey sample, and as such have excellentpublished multi-wavelength ancillary data. these data sets allow us to examinethe star formation properties, gas content, and dynamics of these galaxies onsub-kiloparsec scales. we find that the global gas depletion times fordense/warm molecular gas in these galaxies is consistent with other results fornearby spiral galaxies, indicating this may be independent of galaxy propertiessuch as structures, gas compositions, and environments. similar to the resultsfrom the things hi survey, we do not see a correlation of the star formationefficiency with the gas surface density consistent with the schmidt-kennicuttlaw. finally, we find that the star formation efficiency of the dense moleculargas traced by co j=3-2 is potentially flat or slightly declining as a functionof molecular gas density, the co j=3-2/j=1-0 ratio (in contrast to thecorrelation found in a previous study into the starburst galaxy m83), and thefraction of total gas in molecular form.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.1611	far-infrared line imaging of the starburst ring in ngc 1097 with the  herschel/pacs spectrometer	ngc 1097 is a nearby sbb galaxy with a seyfert nucleus and a bright starburstring. we study the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in thering using spatially resolved far-infrared spectral maps of the circumnuclearstarburst ring of ngc 1097, obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board theherschel space telescope. in particular, we map the important ism cooling anddiagnostic emission lines of [oi] 63 $\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, [nii] 122$\mu$m, [cii] 158 $\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m. we observe that in the [oi] 63$\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, and [nii] 122 $\mu$m line maps, the emission isenhanced in clumps along the ne part of the ring. we observe evidence of rapidrotation in the circumnuclear ring, with a rotation velocity of ~220$ kms$^{-1}$ (inclination uncorrected) measured in all lines. the [oi] 63$\mu$m/[cii] 158 $\mu$m ratio varies smoothly throughout the central region,and is enhanced on the northeastern part of the ring, which may indicate astronger radiation field. this enhancement coincides with peaks in the [oi] 63$\mu$m and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m maps. variations of the [nii] 122 $\mu$m/[nii] 205$\mu$m ratio correspond to a range in the ionized gas density between 150 and400 cm$^{-3}$.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.3115	filamentary structures and compact objects in the aquila and polaris  clouds observed by herschel	our pacs and spire images of the aquila rift and part of the polaris flareregions, taken during the science demonstration phase of herschel discoveredfascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physicallyrelated to compact cores. we briefly describe a new multi-scale,multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measuretheir parameters in our herschel images. all of the extracted starless cores(541 in aquila and 302 in polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrowfilaments. with its combination of the far-ir resolution and sensitivity,herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in aquilaand 59 arcsec in polaris (9000 au in both regions). our first results ofobservations with herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores mayoriginate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thinfilaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. to unravel the roles of theprocesses, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;these follow-up observations are planned.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1008.4058	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey v: the co(j=3-2) distribution and  molecular outflow in ngc~4631	we have made the first map of co(j=3-2) emission covering the disk of theedge-on galaxy, ngc~4631, which is known for its spectacular gaseous halo. thestrongest emission, which we model with a gaussian ring,occurs within a radiusof 5 kpc. weaker disk emission is detected out to radii of 12 kpc, the mostextensive molecular component yet seen in this galaxy. from comparisons withinfrared data, we find that co(j=3-2) emission more closely follows the hotdust component, rather than the cold dust,consistent with it being a goodtracer of star formation. the first maps of $r_{3-2/1-0}$, h$_2$ mass surfacedensity and sfe have been made for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region. only 20\%of the sf occurs in this region and excitation conditions are typical of galaxydisks, rather than of central starbursts. the sfe suggests long gas consumptiontimescales ($&gt;$ $10^9$ yr).  the velocity field is dominated by a steeply rising rotation curve in theregion of the central molecular ring followed by a flatter curve in the disk. avery steep gradient in the rotation curve is observed at the nucleus, providingthe first evidence for a central concentration of mass:m$_{dyn}\,=\,5\,\times\,10^7$ m$_\odot$ within a radius of 282 pc. the velocityfield shows anomalous features indicating the presence of molecular outflows;one of them is associated with a previously observed co(j=1-0) expanding shell.consistent with these outflows is the presence of a thick ($z$ up to $1.4$ kpc)co(j=3-2) disk. we suggest that the interaction between ngc~4631 and itscompanion(s) has agitated the disk and also initiated star formation which waslikely higher in the past than it is now. these may be necessary conditions forseeing prominent halos.

1009.3279	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iv. velocity dispersions in the  molecular interstellar medium in spiral galaxies	an analysis of large-area co j=3-2 maps from the james clerk maxwelltelescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in themolecular component of the interstellar medium. the three lowest luminositygalaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radiuswhile the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-offwithin 0.2-0.4 r(25). correcting for the average contribution due to theinternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, theaverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previousmeasurements for the galaxy andm33. the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derivedfrom the co data is on average two times smaller than the hi velocitydispersion measured in the same galaxies. the low cloud-cloudvelocitydispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determiningthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especiallyin those regions of the disk which are h2 dominated. the cloud-cloud velocitydispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infraredluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the k-band absolutemagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. for three galaxies in the virgocluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typicalresolution of high redshift co observations) increases the measured velocitydispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measuredrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1. this comparison suggests that the mass andstar formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 andthat the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to thepresence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.4023	the displaced dusty ism of ngc 3077: tidal stripping in the m 81 triplet	we present the detection of extended (~30 kpc^2) dust emission in the tidal\hi\ arm near ngc 3077 (member of the m\,81 triplet) using spire on boardherschel. dust emission in the tidal arm is typically detected where the \hi\column densities are &gt;10^21 cm^-2. the spire band ratios show that the dust inthe tidal arm is significantly colder (~13 k) than in ngc 3077 itself (~31 k),consistent with the lower radiation field in the tidal arm. the total dust massin the tidal arm is ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun (assuming beta=2), i.e. substantiallylarger than the dust mass associated with ngc 3077 (~2 x 10^5 m_sun). wheredust is detected, the dust-to-gas ratio is 6+/-3 x 10^-3, consistent within theuncertainties with what is found in ngc 3077 and nearby spiral galaxies withgalactic metallicities. the faint hii regions in the tidal arm can not beresponsible for the detected enriched material and are not the main source ofthe dust heating in the tidal arm. we conclude that the interstellar medium(atomic hi, molecules and dust) in this tidal feature was pre-enriched andstripped off ngc 3077 during its recent interaction (~3 x 10^8 yr ago) with m82 and m 81. this implies that interaction can efficiently remove heavyelements and enriched material (dust, molecular gas) from galaxies. asinteractions were more frequent at large lookback times, it is conceivable thatthey could substantially contribute (along with galactic outflows) to theenrichment of the intergalactic medium.

1201.1016	resolving the far-ir line deficit: photoelectric heating and far-ir line  cooling in ngc 1097 and ngc 4559	the physical state of interstellar gas and dust is dependent on the processeswhich heat and cool this medium. to probe heating and cooling of the ism over alarge range of infrared surface brightness, on sub-kiloparsec scales, we employline maps of [c \ii] 158 $\mu$m, [o \one] 63 $\mu$m, and [n \ii] 122 $\mu$m inngc 1097 and ngc 4559, obtained with the pacs spectrometer onboard {\itherschel}. we matched new observations to existing spitzer-irs data that tracethe total emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). we confirm atsmall scales in these galaxies that the canonical measure of photoelectricheating efficiency, ([c \ii] + [o \one])/tir, decreases as the far-infraredcolor, $\nu f_\nu$(70 $\mu$m)/$\nu f_\nu$(100 $\mu$m), increases. in contrast,the ratio of far-infrared (far-ir) cooling to total pah emission, ([c \ii] + [o\one])/pah, is a near constant $\sim$6% over a wide range of far-infraredcolor, 0.5 \textless\ $\nu f_\nu$(70 $\mu$m)/$\nu f_\nu$(100 $\mu$m) $\lesssim$0.95. in the warmest regions, where $\nu f_\nu$(70 $\mu$m)/$\nu f_\nu$(100$\mu$m) $\gtrsim$ 0.95, the ratio ([c \ii] + [o \one])/pah drops rapidly to 4%.we derived representative values of the local uv radiation density, $g_0$, andthe gas density, $n_h$, by comparing our observations to models ofphotodissociation regions. the ratio $g_0/n_h$, derived from fine-structurelines, is found to correlate with the mean dust-weighted starlight intensity,$&lt;u&gt;$ derived from models of the ir sed. emission from regions that exhibit aline deficit is characterized by an intense radiation field, indicating thatsmall grains are susceptible to ionization effects. we note that there is ashift in the 7.7 / 11.3 $\mu$m pah ratio in regions that exhibit a deficit in([c \ii] + [o \one])/pah, suggesting that small grains are ionized in theseenvironments.

1201.2178	the dust &amp; gas properties of m83	we examine the dust and gas properties of the nearby, barred galaxy m83,which is part of the very nearby galaxy survey. using images from the pacs andspire instruments of herschel, we examine the dust temperature and dust masssurface density distribution. we find that the nuclear, bar and spiral armregions exhibit higher dust temperatures and masses compared to interarmregions. however, the distribution of dust temperature and mass are notspatially coincident. assuming a trailing spiral structure, the dusttemperature peaks in the spiral arms lie ahead of the dust surface densitypeaks. the dust mass surface density correlates well with the distribution ofmolecular gas as traced by co (j=3-2) images (jcmt) and the star formation rateas traced by h?2 with a correction for obscured star formation using 24 micronemission. using hi images from things to trace the atomic gas component, wemake total gas mass surface density maps and calculate the gas-to-dust ratio.we find a mean gas-to-dust ratio of 84 \pm 4 with higher values in the innerregion assuming a constant co-to-h2 conversion factor. we also examine thegas-to-dust ratio using co-to-h2 conversion factor that varies withmetallicity.

1202.5323	the gas-to-dust mass ratio of centaurus a as seen by herschel	we present photometry of the nearby galaxy ngc 5128 (centaurus a) observedwith the pacs and spire instruments on board the herschel space observatory, at70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, as well as new co j = 3-2 observations takenwith the harp-b instrument on the jcmt. using a single component modifiedblackbody, we model the dust spectral energy distribution within the disk ofthe galaxy using all five herschel wavebands, and find dust temperatures of ~30k towards the centre of the disk and a smoothly decreasing trend to ~20 k withincreasing radius. we find a total dust mass of (1.59 \pm 0.05) \times 10^7m\odot, and a total gas mass of (2.7 \pm 0.2) \times 10^9 m\odot. the averagegas-to-dust mass ratio is 103 \pm 8 but we find an interesting increase in thisratio to approximately 275 toward the centre of cen a. we discuss severalpossible physical processes that may be causing this effect, including dustsputtering, jet entrainment and systematic variables such as the xco factor.dust sputtering by x-rays originating in the agn or the removal of dust by thejets are our most favoured explanations.

1203.0001	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey vii: h\alpha{} imaging and  massive star formation properties	we present h\alpha{} fluxes, star formation rates (sfrs) and equivalentwidths (ews) for a sample of 156 nearby galaxies observed in the 12co j=3-2line as part of the james clerk maxwell telescope nearby galaxies legacysurvey. these are derived from images and values in the literature and from newh\alpha{} images for 72 galaxies which we publish here. we describe the sample,observations and procedures to extract the h\alpha{} fluxes and relatedquantities. we discuss the sfr properties of our sample and confirm thewell-known correlation with galaxy luminosity, albeit with high dispersion. oursfrs range from 0.1 to 11 msun yr-1 with a median sfr value for the completesample of 0.2 msun yr-1. this median values is somewhat lower than similarpublished measurements, which we attribute, in part, to our sample beinghi-selected and, thus, not biased towards high sfrs as has frequently been thecase in previous studies. additionally, we calculate internal absorptions forthe h\alpha{} line, a(h\alpha{}), which are lower than many of those used inprevious studies. our derived ews, which range from 1 to 880\aa{} with a medianvalue of 27\aa{}, show little dependence with luminosity but rise by a factorof five from early- to late-type galaxies. this paper is the first in a seriesaimed at comparing sfrs obtained from h\alpha{} imaging of galaxies withinformation derived from other tracers of star formation and atomic andmolecular gas.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1204.1264	herschel and jcmt observations of the early-type dwarf galaxy ngc 205	we present herschel dust continuum, james clerk maxwell telescope co(3-2)observations and a search for [cii] 158 micron and [oi] 63 micron spectral lineemission for the brightest early-type dwarf satellite of andromeda, ngc 205.while direct gas measurements (mgas ~ 1.5e+6 msun, hi + co(1-0)) have proven tobe inconsistent with theoretical predictions of the current gas reservoir inngc 205 (&gt; 1e+7 msun), we revise the missing interstellar medium mass problembased on new gas mass estimates (co(3-2), [cii], [oi]) and indirectmeasurements of the interstellar medium content through dust continuumemission. based on herschel observations, covering a wide wavelength range from70 to 500 micron, we are able to probe the entire dust content in ngc 205(mdust ~ 1.1-1.8e+4 msun at tdust ~ 18-22 k) and rule out the presence of amassive cold dust component (mdust ~ 5e+5 msun, tdust ~ 12 k), which wassuggested based on millimeter observations from the inner 18.4 arcsec. assuminga reasonable gas-to-dust ratio of ~ 400, the dust mass in ngc 205 translatesinto a gas mass mgas ~ 4-7e+6 msun. the non-detection of [oi] and the lowl_[cii]-to-l_co(1-0) line intensity ratio (~ 1850) imply that the molecular gasphase is well traced by co molecules in ngc 205. we estimate an atomic gas massof 1.5e+4 msun associated with the [cii] emitting pdr regions in ngc 205. fromthe partial co(3-2) map of the northern region in ngc 205, we derive amolecular gas mass of m_h2 ~ 1.3e+5 msun.

1205.0006	herschel-spire imaging spectroscopy of molecular gas in m82	we present new herschel-spire imaging spectroscopy (194-671 microns) of thebright starburst galaxy m82. covering the co ladder from j=4-3 to j=13-12,spectra were obtained at multiple positions for a fully sampled ~ 3 x 3arcminute map, including a longer exposure at the central position. we presentmeasurements of 12co, 13co, [ci], [nii], hcn, and hco+ in emission, along withoh+, h2o+ and hf in absorption and h2o in both emission and absorption, withdiscussion. we use a radiative transfer code and bayesian likelihood analysisto model the temperature, density, column density, and filling factor ofmultiple components of molecular gas traced by 12co and 13co, adding furtherevidence to the high-j lines tracing a much warmer (~ 500 k), less massivecomponent than the low-j lines. the addition of 13co (and [ci]) is new andindicates that [ci] may be tracing different gas than 12co. notemperature/density gradients can be inferred from the map, indicating that thesingle-pointing spectrum is descriptive of the bulk properties of the galaxy.at such a high temperature, cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen.photon-dominated region (pdr) models require higher densities than thoseindicated by our bayesian likelihood analysis in order to explain the high-j coline ratios, though cosmic-ray enhanced pdr models can do a better jobreproducing the emission at lower densities. shocks and turbulent heating arelikely required to explain the bright high-j emission.

1206.1629	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey viii. co data and the  l(co3-2)-l(fir) correlation in the sings sample	the james clerk maxwell telescope nearby galaxies legacy survey (ngls)comprises an hi-selected sample of 155 galaxies spanning all morphologicaltypes with distances less than 25 mpc. we describe the scientific goals of thesurvey, the sample selection, and the observing strategy. we also present anatlas and analysis of the co j=3-2 maps for the 47 galaxies in the ngls whichare also part of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey. we find a widerange of molecular gas mass fractions in the galaxies in this sample andexplore the correlation of the far-infrared luminosity, which traces starformation, with the co luminosity, which traces the molecular gas mass. bycomparing the ngls data with merging galaxies at low and high redshift whichhave also been observed in the co j=3-2 line, we show that the correlation offar-infrared and co luminosity shows a significant trend with luminosity. thistrend is consistent with a molecular gas depletion time which is more than anorder of magnitude faster in the merger galaxies than in nearby normalgalaxies. we also find a strong correlation of the l(fir)/l(co3-2) ratio withthe atomic to molecular gas mass ratio. this correlation suggests that some ofthe far-infrared emission originates from dust associated with atomic gas andthat its contribution is particularly important in galaxies where most of thegas is in the atomic phase.

1207.1301	mapping the cold dust temperatures and masses of nearby kingfish  galaxies with herschel	taking advantage of the sensitivity and angular resolution of the herschelspace observatory at far-infrared and submm wavelengths, we aim to characterizethe physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies and study therobustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbodymodels. for a pilot subsample of the kingfish program, we perform 2 temperaturefits of the spitzer and herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warmand a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.at global scales,we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and tc(19.1 to 25.1k).wecompute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustnessof the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. when the emissivityis fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.when theemissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniformfitted emissivities.gathering resolved elements in a tc-beta_c diagramunderlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.it remains difficultto assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, ormixing along the line of sight and in the beam. we finally observe in bothcases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and barends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in theselocations).we also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptionsabout the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverageused in the fits. we show that modified blackbody fits using a shallowemissivity (beta_c &lt; 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared tothe beta_c &lt; 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 forinstance.the working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: massesincrease from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.

1209.0804	the nature of the interstellar medium of the starburst low-metallicity  galaxy haro11: a multi-phase model of the infrared emission	(abridged) our goal is to describe the multi-phase ism of the ir brightlow-metallicity galaxy haro 11, dissecting the photoionised andphotodissociated gas components. we present observations of the mid- and far-irfine-structure cooling lines obtained with the spitzer/irs and herschel/pacsspectrometers. we use the spectral synthesis code cloudy to methodically modelthe ionised and neutral gas from which these lines originate. we find that themid- and far-ir lines account for ~1% of the total ir luminosity l_tir. haro 11is undergoing a phase of intense star formation, as traced by the brightestline [oiii] 88um, with l_[oiii]/l_tir ~0.3%, and high ratios of [neiii]/[neii]and [siv]/[siii]. due to their different origins, the observed lines require amulti-phase modeling comprising: a compact hii region, dense fragmentedphotodissociation regions (pdrs), a diffuse extended low-ionisation/neutral gaswhich has a volume filling factor of at least 90%, and porous warm dust inproximity to the stellar source. for a more realistic picture of the ism ofharo 11 we would need to model the clumpy source and gas structures. we combinethese 4 model components to explain the emission of 17 spectral lines,investigate the global energy balance of the galaxy through its spectral energydistribution, and establish a phase mass inventory. while the ionic emissionlines of haro 11 essentially originate from the dense hii region component, adiffuse low-ionisation gas is needed to explain the [neii], [nii], and [cii]line intensities. the [oiii] 88um line intensity is not fully reproduced by ourmodel, hinting towards the possible presence of yet another low-densityhigh-ionisation medium. the [oi] emission is consistent with a dense pdr of lowcovering factor, and we find no evidence for an x-ray dominated component. thepdr component accounts for only 10% of the [cii] emission.

1211.6668	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: blank-field number counts of  450um-selected galaxies and their contribution to the cosmic infrared  background	the first deep blank-field 450um map (1-sigma~1.3mjy) from the scuba-2cosmology legacy survey (s2cls), conducted with the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt) is presented. our map covers 140 arcmin^2 of the cosmos field,in the footprint of the hst candels area. using 60 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) detected at &gt;3.75-sigma, we evaluate the number counts of 450um-selectedgalaxies with flux densities s_450&gt;5mjy. the 8-arcsec jcmt beam and highsensitivity of scuba-2 now make it possible to directly resolve a largerfraction of the cosmic infrared background (cib, peaking at ~200um) into theindividual galaxies responsible for its emission than has previously beenpossible at this wavelength. at s_450&gt;5mjy we resolve (7.4[+/-]0.7)x10^-2mjy/sr of the cib at 450um (equivalent to 16[+/-]7% of the absolute brightnessmeasured by cobe at this wavelength) into point sources. a further ~40% of thecib can be recovered through a statistical stack of 24um emitters in thisfield, indicating that the majority (~60%) of the cib at 450um is emitted bygalaxies with s_450&gt;2mjy. the average redshift of 450um emitters identifiedwith an optical/near-infrared counterpart is estimated to be &lt;z&gt;=1.3, implyingthat the galaxies in the sample are in the ultraluminous class (l_ir~1.1x10^12l_sun). if the galaxies contributing to the statistical stack lie at similarredshifts, then the majority of the cib at 450um is emitted by galaxies in thelirg class with l_ir&gt;3.6x10^11 l_sun.

1212.1208	the co-to-h2 conversion factor and dust-to-gas ratio on kiloparsec  scales in nearby galaxies	we present kiloparsec (kpc) spatial resolution maps of the co-to-h2conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (dgr) in 26 nearby,star-forming galaxies. we have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and dgr byassuming that the dgr is approximately constant on kpc scales. with thisassumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, co integratedintensity and hi column density to solve for both alpha_co and dgr with noassumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolutionfar-ir maps from the herschel key program kingfish, 12co j=(2-1) maps from theiram 30m large program heracles and hi 21-cm line maps from things. we use afixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co resultson the more typically used 12co j=(1-0) scale and show using literaturemeasurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. intotal, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and dgr. on average,alpha_co = 3.1 msun pc^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standarddeviation of 0.3 dex. within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile ofalpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. however, most galaxies exhibita lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, onaverage. in some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10below the standard milky way (mw) value of alpha_co,mw =4.4 msun pc^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1. while for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,dgr is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriatealpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

1301.3805	herschel observations of the w3 gmc: clues to the formation of clusters  of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-massstar formation. we have used herschel data from the hobys key program toproduce and analyze column density and temperature maps. two preliminarycatalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map andfrom herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. herschel revealsthat among the compact sources (fwhm&lt;0.45 pc), w3 east, w3 west, and w3 (oh)are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.considering the unique properties of w3 east and w3 west, the only clumps withon-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructivefeedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasingage and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. thisprocess, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availabilityof material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of anenvironment suitable for the formation of trapezium-like systems. in commonwith other scenarios proposed in other hobys studies, our results indicate thatan active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, andconfinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/clusterformation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. theenvironmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form inwhich this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation couldarise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulentflows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

1301.6884	a detailed study of the radio--fir correlation in ngc6946 with  herschel-pacs/spire from kingfish	we derive the distribution of the synchrotron spectral index across ngc6946and investigate the correlation between the radio continuum (synchrotron) andfar-infrared (fir) emission using the kingfish herschel pacs and spire data.the radio--fir correlation is studied as a function of star formation rate,magnetic field strength, radiation field strength, and the total gas surfacebrightness. the synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and theso-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. the synchrotronspectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\alpha_n \sim 1$), whileit is flat in places of giant h{\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy($\alpha_n \sim 0.6-0.7$). the map of $\alpha_n$ provides an observationalevidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in thedisk of the galaxy. variations in the synchrotron--fir correlation across thegalaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.we find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather thanwith warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the mainheating source of dust. the synchrotron--fir correlation suggests a couplingbetween the magnetic field and the gas density. ngc6946 shows a power-lawbehavior between the total (turbulent) magnetic field strength b and the starformation rate surface density $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ with an index of0.14\,(0.16)$\pm$0.01. this indicates an efficient production of the turbulentmagnetic field with the increasing gas turbulence expected in actively starforming regions. the scale-by-scale analysis of the synchrotron--fircorrelation indicates that the ism affects the propagation of old/diffusedcosmic ray electrons, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of $d_0=4.6\times10^{28}$\,cm$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for 2.2\,gev cres.

1304.3128	star formation &amp; dust heating in the fir bright sources of m83	we investigate star formation and dust heating in the compact fir brightsources detected in the herschel maps of m83. we use the source extraction codegetsources to detect and extract sources in the fir, as well as theirphotometry in the mir and h{\alpha}. by performing infrared sed fitting andapplying an h{\alpha} based star formation rate (sfr) calibration, we derivethe dust masses and temperatures, sfrs, gas masses and star formationefficiencies (sfes). the detected sources lie exclusively on the spiral armsand represent giant molecular associations (gmas), with gas masses and sizes of10^6-10^8 solar masses and 200-300 pc, respectively. the inferred parametersshow little to no radial dependence and there is only a weak correlationbetween the sfrs and gas masses, which suggests that more massive clouds areless efficient at forming stars. dust heating is mainly due to local starformation. however, although the sources are not optically thick, the totalintrinsic young stellar population luminosity can almost completely account forthe dust luminosity. this suggests that other radiation sources contribute tothe dust heating as well and approximately compensate for the unabsorbedfraction of uv light.

0801.2764	clarifying the nature of the brightest submillimetre sources:  interferometric imaging of lh850.02	we present high-resolution interferometric imaging of lh850.02, the brightest850- and 1200-micron submillimetre (submm) galaxy in the lockman hole. ourobservations were made at 890 micron with the submillimetre array (sma). ourhigh-resolution submm imaging detects lh850.02 at &gt;6-sigma as a single compact(size &lt; 1 arcsec or &lt; 8 kpc) point source and yields its absolute position to~0.2-arcsec accuracy. lh850.02 has two alternative radio counterparts withinthe scuba beam (lh850.02n &amp; s), both of which are statistically very unlikelyto be so close to the scuba source position by chance. however, the preciseastrometry from the sma shows that the submm emission arises entirely fromlh850.02n, and is not associated with lh850.02s (by far the brighter of the twoalternative identifications at 24-micron). fits to the optical-infraredmulti-colour photometry of lh850.02n &amp; s indicate that both lie at z~3.3, andare therefore likely to be physically associated. at these redshifts, the 24micron--to--submm flux density ratios suggest that lh850.02n has an arp220-typestarburst-dominated far-ir sed, while lh850.02s is more similar to mrk231, withless dust-enshrouded star-formation activity, but a significant contribution at24-micron (rest-frame ~5-6 micron) from an active nucleus. this complex mix ofstar-formation and agn activity in multi-component sources may be common in thehigh redshift ultraluminous galaxy population, and highlights the need forprecise astrometry from high resolution interferometric imaging for a morecomplete understanding.

1308.3702	regional variations in the dense gas heating and cooling in m51 from  herschel far-infrared spectroscopy	we present herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy of the most importantfar-infrared cooling lines in m51, [cii](158 \mu m), [nii](122 &amp; 205 \mu m),[oi](63 and 145 \mu m) and [oiii](88 \mu m). we compare the observed flux ofthese lines with the predicted flux from a photon dominated region model todetermine characteristics of the cold gas such as density, temperature and thefar-ultraviolet radiation field, g_0, resolving details on physical scales ofroughly 600 pc. we find an average [cii]/f_tir of 4 x 10^{-3}, in agreementwith previous studies of other galaxies. a pixel-by-pixel analysis of fourdistinct regions of m51 shows a radially decreasing trend in both thefar-ultraviolet (fuv) radiation field, g_0 and the hydrogen density, n, peakingin the nucleus of the galaxy, then falling off out to the arm and interarmregions. we see for the first time that the fuv flux and gas density aresimilar in the differing environments of the arm and interarm regions,suggesting that the inherent physical properties of the molecular clouds inboth regions are essentially the same.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1309.6338	cold dust but warm gas in the unusual elliptical galaxy ngc 4125	data from the herschel space observatory have revealed an unusual ellipticalgalaxy, ngc 4125, which has strong and extended submillimeter emission fromcold dust but only very strict upper limits to its co and hi emission.depending on the dust emissivity, the total dust mass is 2-5x10^6 msun. whilethe neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is extremely low (&lt; 12-30), including theionized gas traced by [cii] emission raises this limit to &lt; 39-100. the dustemission follows a similar r^{1/4} profile to the stellar light and the dust tostellar mass ratio is towards the high end of what is found in nearbyelliptical galaxies. we suggest that ngc 4125 is currently in an unusual phasewhere evolved stars produced in a merger-triggered burst of star formation arepumping large amounts of gas and dust into the interstellar medium. in thisscenario, the low neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is explained by the gas beingheated to temperatures &gt;= 10^4 k faster than the dust is evaporated. ifgalaxies like ngc 4125, where the far-infrared emission does not trace neutralgas in the usual manner, are common at higher redshift, this could havesignificant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies andgalaxy evolution.

1401.3693	dissecting the origin of the submillimeter emission in nearby galaxies  with herschel and laboca	we model the infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distribution of 11nearby galaxies of the kingfish sample using spitzer and herschel data andcompare model extrapolations at 870um (using different fitting techniques) withlaboca 870um observations. we investigate how the differences betweenpredictions and observations vary with model assumptions or environment. atglobal scales, we find that modified blackbody models using realistic coldemissivity indices (beta_c=2 or 1.5) are able to reproduce the 870um observedemission within the uncertainties for most of the sample. low values(beta_c&lt;1.3) would be required in ngc0337, ngc1512 and ngc7793. at localscales, we observe a systematic 870um excess when using beta_=2.0. thebeta_c=1.5 or the draine and li (2007) models can reconcile predictions withobservations in part of the disks. some of the remaining excesses occur towardsthe centres and can be partly or fully accounted for by non-dust contributionssuch as co(3-2) or, to a lesser extent, free-free or synchrotron emission. inthree non-barred galaxies, the remaining excesses rather occur in the diskoutskirts. this could be a sign of a flattening of the submm slope (anddecrease of the effective emissivity index) with radius in these objects.

1402.5967	a resolved analysis of cold dust and gas in the nearby edge-on spiral  ngc 891	we investigate the connection between dust and gas in the nearby edge-onspiral galaxy ngc 891. high resolution herschel pacs and spire 70, 100, 160,250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m images are combined with jcmt scuba 850 $\mu$mobservations to trace the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energydistribution (sed). maps of the hi 21 cm line and co(j=3-2) emission trace theatomic and molecular hydrogen gas, respectively. we fit one-component modifiedblackbody models to the integrated sed, finding a global dust mass of8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 k. wealso fit the pixel-by-pixel seds to produce maps of the dust mass andtemperature. the dust mass distribution correlates with the total stellarpopulation as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission. the derived dust temperature,which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 k, is found to correlate with the 24$\mu$m emission. allowing the dust emissivity index to vary, we find an averagevalue of $\beta$ = 1.9$\pm$0.3. we confirm an inverse relation between the dustemissivity spectral index and dust temperature, but do not observe anyvariation of this relationship with vertical height from the mid-plane of thedisk. a comparison of the dust properties with the gaseous components of theism reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities ofdust and the molecular hydrogen and total gas surface densities. observedasymmetries in the dust temperature, and the h$_{2}$-to-dust and totalgas-to-dust ratios hint that an enhancement in the star formation rate may bethe result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel starformation in the ne compared to the sw. whilst the asymmetry likely arises fromdust obscuration due to the geometry of the line-of-sight projection of thespiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star formation rate in thene side of the disk.

1404.0403	the physical characteristics of the gas in the disk of centaurus a using  the herschel space observatory	we search for variations in the disk of centaurus a of the emission fromatomic fine structure lines using herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy. inparticular we observe the [c ii](158 $\mu$m), [n ii](122 and 205 $\mu$m), [oi](63 and 145 $\mu$m) and [o iii](88 $\mu$m) lines, which all play an importantrole in cooling the gas in photo-ionized and photodissociation regions. wedetermine that the ([c ii]+[o i]$_{63}$)/$f_{tir}$ line ratio, a proxy for theheating efficiency of the gas, shows no significant radial trend across theobserved region, in contrast to observations of other nearby galaxies. wedetermine that 10 - 20% of the observed [c ii] emission originates in ionizedgas. comparison between our observations and a pdr model shows that thestrength of the far-ultraviolet radiation field, $g_0$, varies between$10^{1.75}$ and $10^{2.75}$ and the hydrogen nucleus density varies between$10^{2.75}$ and $10^{3.75}$ cm$^{-3}$, with no significant radial trend ineither property. in the context of the emission line properties of thegrand-design spiral galaxy m51 and the elliptical galaxy ngc 4125, the gas incen a appears more characteristic of that in typical disk galaxies rather thanelliptical galaxies.

1404.2310	a multiwavelength analysis of the clumpy fir-bright sources in m33	we present a multiwavelength study of a sample of far-infrared (fir) sourcesdetected on the herschel broad--band maps of the nearby galaxy m33. we performsource photometry on the fir maps as well as mid-infrared (mir), h$\alpha$,far-ultraviolet and integrated hi and co line emission maps. by fitting mir/firdust emission spectra, the source dust masses, temperatures and luminositiesare inferred. the sources are classified based on their h$\alpha$ morphology(substructured versus not-substructured) and on whether they have a significantco detection ($s/n&gt;$3$\sigma$). we find that the sources have dust masses inthe range 10$^2$-10$^4$~m$_\odot$ and that they present significant differencesin their inferred dust/star formation/gas parameters depending on theirh$\alpha$ morphology and co detection classification. the results suggestsdifferences in the evolutionary states or in the number of embedded hii regionsbetween the subsamples. the source background--subtracted dust emission seemsto be predominantly powered by local star formation, as indicated by a strongcorrelation between the dust luminosity and the dust-corrected h$\alpha$luminosity and the fact that the extrapolated young stellar luminosity is highenough to account for the observed dust emission. finally, we do not find astrong correlation between the dust-corrected h$\alpha$ luminosity and the dustmass of the sources, consistent with previous results on the breakdown ofsimple scaling relations at sub-kpc scales. however, the scatter in therelation is significantly reduced by correcting the h$\alpha$ luminosity forthe age of the young stellar populations in the star--forming regions.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1410.3874	quantifying the heating sources for mid-infrared dust emissions in  galaxies: the case of m 81	with the newly available spire images at 250 and 500 micron from herschelspace observatory, we study quantitative correlations over a sub-kpc scaleamong three distinct emission components in the interstellar medium of thenearby spiral galaxy m 81 (ngc 3031): (a) $i_{8}$ or $i_{24}$, the surfacebrightness of the mid-infrared emission observed in the spitzer irac 8 or mips24 micron band, with $i_8$ and $i_{24}$ being dominated by the emissions frompolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and very small grains (vsgs) of dust,respectively; (b) $i_{500}$, that of the cold dust continuum emission in theherschel spire 500 micron band, dominated by the emission from large dustgrains heated by evolved stars, and (c) $i_{{\rm h}\alpha}$, a nominal surfacebrightness of the h$\alpha$ line emission, from gas ionized by newly formedmassive stars. the results from our correlation study, free from any assumptionon or modeling of dust emissivity law or dust temperatures, present solidevidence for significant heating of pahs and vsgs by evolved stars. in the caseof m 81, about 67% (48%) of the 8 micron (24 micron) emission derives itsheating from evolved stars, with the remainder attributed to radiation heatingassociated with ionizing stars.

1410.6156	insights into gas heating and cooling in the disc of ngc 891 from  herschel far-infrared spectroscopy	we present herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy of the most importantfar-infrared cooling lines in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy, ngc 891: [cii]158 $\mu$m, [nii] 122, 205 $\mu$m, [oi] 63, 145 $\mu$m, and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m.we find that the photoelectric heating efficiency of the gas, traced via the([cii]+[oii]63)/$f_{\mathrm{tir}}$ ratio, varies from a mean of3.5$\times$10$^{-3}$ in the centre up to 8$\times$10$^{-3}$ at increasingradial and vertical distances in the disc. a decrease in([cii]+[oii]63)/$f_{\mathrm{tir}}$ but constant([cii]+[oi]63)/$f_{\mathrm{pah}}$ with increasing fir colour suggests thatpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) may become important for gas heating inthe central regions. we compare the observed flux of the fir cooling lines andtotal ir emission with the predicted flux from a pdr model to determine the gasdensity, surface temperature and the strength of the incident far-ultraviolet(fuv) radiation field, $g_{0}$. resolving details on physical scales of ~0.6kpc, a pixel-by-pixel analysis reveals that the majority of the pdrs in ngc891's disc have hydrogen densities of 1 &lt; log ($n$/cm$^{-3}$) &lt; 3.5experiencing an incident fuv radiation field with strengths of 1.7 &lt; log $g_0$&lt; 3. although these values we derive for most of the disc are consistent withthe gas properties found in pdrs in the spiral arms and inter-arm regions ofm51, observed radial trends in $n$ and $g_0$ are shown to be sensitive tovarying optical thickness in the lines, demonstrating the importance ofaccurately accounting for optical depth effects when interpreting observationsof high inclination systems. with an empirical relationship between the mips 24$\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m emission, we estimate an enhancement of the fuvradiation field strength in the far north-eastern side of the disc.

1512.02702	a pilot askap survey of radio transient events in the region around the  intermittent pulsar psr j1107-5907	we use observations from the boolardy engineering test array (beta) of theaustralian square kilometre array pathfinder (askap) telescope to search fortransient radio sources in the field around the intermittent pulsar psrj1107-5907. the pulsar is thought to switch between an "off" state in which noemission is detectable, a weak state and a strong state. we ran threeindependent transient detection pipelines on two-minute snapshot images from a13 hour beta observation in order to 1) study the emission from the pulsar, 2)search for other transient emission from elsewhere in the image and 3) tocompare the results from the different transient detection pipelines. thepulsar was easily detected as a transient source and, over the course of theobservations, it switched into the strong state three times giving a typicaltimescale between the strong emission states of 3.7 hours. after the firstswitch it remained in the strong state for almost 40 minutes. the other strongstates lasted less than 4 minutes. the second state change was confirmed usingobservations with the parkes radio telescope. no other transient events werefound and we place constraints on the surface density of such events on thesetimescales. the high sensitivity parkes observations enabled us to detectindividual bright pulses during the weak state and to study the strong stateover a wide observing band. we conclude by showing that future transientsurveys with askap will have the potential to probe the intermittent pulsarpopulation.

astro-ph;0005208	high-resolution imaging of molecular gas and dust in the antennae (ngc  4038/39): super giant molecular complexes	we present new aperture synthesis co maps of the antennae (ngc 4038/39)obtained with the caltech millimeter array. these sensitive images showmolecular emission associated with the two nuclei and a partial ring of starformation to the west of ngc 4038, as well as revealing the large extent of theextra-nuclear region of star formation (the ``overlap region''), whichdominates the co emission from this system. the largest molecular complexeshave masses of 3-6x10^8 m_sun, typically an order of magnitude larger than thelargest structures seen to date in more quiescent galaxy disks. the extremelyred luminous star clusters identified previously with hst are well-correlatedwith the co emission, which supports the conclusion that they are highlyembedded young objects rather than old globular clusters. there is an excellentcorrelation between the co emission and the 15 micron emission seen with iso,particularly for the brightest regions. the most massive complexes in theoverlap region have similar [neiii]/[neii] ratios, which implies that all theseregions are forming many massive stars. however, only the brightestmid-infrared peak shows strong, rising continuum emission longward of 10microns, indicative of very small dust grains heated to high temperatures bytheir proximity to nearby luminous stars. since these grains are expected to beremoved rapidly from the immediate environment of the massive stars, it ispossible that this region contains very young (&lt; 1 myr) sites of starformation. alternatively, fresh dust grains could be driven into the sphere ofinfluence of the massive stars, perhaps by the bulk motions of two giantmolecular complexes. the kinematics and morphology of the co emission in thisregion provide some support for this second scenario.

astro-ph;0006413	physical conditions and spatial structure in the molecular interstellar  medium of m33	in this review, i discuss recent detailed studies of individual molecularclouds in m33 in higher rotational transitions of co, 13co, and the finestructure line of atomic carbon. these data reveal that the temperature anddensity of the molecular gas is correlated with the presence of nearby massivestar formation, with clouds with more intense star formation having highertemperatures and lower densities. this effect is most likely due to post-starformation processing of the molecular gas. a comparison of 13co observationsfor m33 and individual molecular clouds in the milky way suggests that asignificant fraction of the molecular interstellar medium resides in low columndensity regions and accounts for 30-60% of the co luminosity. finally, adetailed map of a single molecular cloud in the giant hii region ngc 604reveals an offset between the atomic carbon and co emission, which indicatesthat the dominant source of atomic carbon in this cloud is likelyphotodissociation of co by ultraviolet photons from the massive stars. acomplete map of the co emission in m33 would be extremely helpful to guidefurther detailed studies.

astro-ph;0208165	interferometric observations of the nuclear region of arp220 at  submillimeter wavelengths	we report the first submillimeter interferometric observations of anultraluminous infrared galaxy. we observed arp220 in the co j=3-2 line and342ghz continuum with the single baseline cso-jcmt interferometer consisting ofthe caltech submillimeter observatory (cso) and the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt). models were fit to the measured visibilities to constrain thestructure of the source. the morphologies of the co j=3-2 line and 342ghzcontinuum emission are similar to those seen in published maps at 230 and110ghz. we clearly detect a binary source separated by about 1 arcsec in theeast-west direction in the 342ghz continuum. the co j=3-2 visibilityamplitudes, however, indicate a more complicated structure, with evidence for acompact binary at some velocities and rather more extended structure at others.less than 30% of the total co j=3-2 emission is detected by the interferometer,which implies the presence of significant quantities of extended gas. we alsoobtained single-dish co j=2-1, co j=3-2 and hcn j=4-3 spectra. the hcn j=4-3spectrum, unlike the co spectra, is dominated by a single redshifted peak. thehcn j=4-3/co j=3-2, hcn j=4-3/hcn j=1-0 and co j=3-2/2-1 line ratios are largerin the redshifted (eastern) source, which suggests that the two sources mayhave different physical conditions. this result might be explained by thepresence of an intense starburst that has begun to deplete or disperse thedensest gas in the western source, while the eastern source harbors undispersedhigh density gas.

astro-ph;0306192	ism properties in low-metallicity environments ii. the dust spectral  energy distribution of ngc 1569	we present new 450 and 850 microns scuba data of the dwarf galaxy ngc 1569.we construct the mid-infrared to millimeter sed of ngc 1569, using isocam,isophot, iras, kao, scuba and mambo data, and model the sed in order to explorethe nature of the dust in low metallicity environments. the detailed modelingis performed in a self-consistent way, synthesizing the global isrf of thegalaxy using an evolutionary synthesis model with further constraints providedby the observed mir ionic lines and a photoionisation model. our results showthat the dust properties are different in this low metallicity galaxy comparedto other more metal rich galaxies. the results indicate a paucity of pahsprobably due to the destructive effects of the isrf penetrating a clumpyenvironment and a size-segregation of grains where the emission is dominated bysmall grains of size ~3 nm, consistent with the idea of shocks having adramatic effect on the dust properties in ngc 1569. a significant millimetreexcess is present in the dust sed which can be explained by the presence ofubiquitous very cold dust (t = 5-7 k). this dust component accounts for 40 to70 % of the total dust mass in the galaxy (1.6 - 3.4 10^5 msol) and could bedistributed in small clumps (size a few pc) throughout the galaxy. we find agas-to-dust mass ratio of 740 - 1600, larger than that of the galaxy and adust-to-metals ratio of 1/4 to 1/7. we generate an extinction curve for ngc1569, consistent with the modeled dust size distribution. this extinction curvehas relatively steep fuv rise and smaller 2175 angstroms bump, resembling theobserved extinction curve of some regions in the large magellanic cloud.

astro-ph;0308545	the mass function of super giant molecular complexes and implications  for forming young massive star clusters in the antennae (ngc 4038/39)	we have used previously published observations of the co emission from theantennae (ngc 4038/39) to study the detailed properties of the super giantmolecular complexes with the goal of understanding the formation of youngmassive star clusters. over a mass range from 5e6 to 9e8 solar masses, themolecular complexes follow a power-law mass function with a slope of -1.4 +/-0.1, which is very similar to the slope seen at lower masses in molecularclouds and cloud cores in the galaxy. compared to the spiral galaxy m51, whichhas a similar surface density and total mass of molecular gas, the antennaecontain clouds that are an order of magnitude more massive. many of theyoungest star clusters lie in the gas-rich overlap region, where extinctions ashigh as av~100 imply that the clusters must lie in front of the gas. combiningdata on the young clusters, thermal and nonthermal radio sources, and themolecular gas suggests that young massive clusters could have formed at aconstant rate in the antennae over the last 160 myr and that sufficient gasexists to sustain this cluster formation rate well into the future. however,this conclusion requires that a very high fraction of the massive clusters thatform initially in the antennae do not survive as long as 100 myr. finally, wecompare our data with two models for massive star cluster formation andconclude that the model where young massive star clusters form from dense coreswithin the observed super giant molecular complexes is most consistent with ourcurrent understanding of this merging system.

astro-ph;0407509	extended molecular gas in the nearby starburst galaxy maffei 2	we present a 9'x9' fully-sampled map of the co j=1-0 emission in the nearbystarburst galaxy maffei 2 obtained at the five college radio astronomyobservatory. the map reveals previously known strong co emission in the centralstarburst region as well as an extended asymmetric distribution with bright colines at the ends of the bar and in a feature at the north-east edge of themolecular disk. this northern feature, proposed previously to be an interactingcompanion galaxy, could be a dwarf irregular galaxy, although the co data arealso consistent with the feature being simply an extension of one of the spiralarms. we estimate the total molecular gas mass of maffei 2 to be (1.4-1.7)x10^9mo or ~3-4% of its dynamical mass. adopting the recently determined lower valuefor the co-to-h2 conversion factor in the central region, our data lead to thesurprising result that the largest concentrations of molecular gas in maffei 2lie at the bar ends and in the putative dwarf companion rather than in thecentral starburst. a gravitational stability analysis reveals that the extendeddisk of maffei 2 lies above the critical density for star formation; however,whether the central region is also gravitationally unstable depends both on thedetails of the rotation curve and the precise value of the co-to-h2 conversionfactor in this region.

astro-ph;0503190	high mass star formation i: the mass distribution of submillimeter  clumps in ngc 7538	we present submillimeter continuum maps at 450 and 850 microns of a 12 x 8arcminute region of the ngc 7538 high-mass star-forming region, made using thesubmillimeter common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerk maxwelltelescope. we used an automated clump-finding algorithm to identify 67 clumpsin the 450 micron image and 77 in the 850 micron image. contrary to previousstudies, we find a positive correlation between high spectral index, alpha, andhigh submillimeter flux, with the difference being accounted for by differenttreatments of the error beam. we interpret the higher spectral index atsubmillimeter peaks as a reflection of elevated dust temperature, particularlywhen there is an embedded infrared source, though it may also reflect changingdust properties. the clump mass-radius relationship is well-fit by a power lawof the form m \propto r^(-x) with x = 1.5-2.1, consistent with theories ofturbulently-supported clumps. according to our most reliable analysis, thehigh-mass end (approx. 100-2700 m_sun) of the submillimeter clump mass functionin ngc 7538 follows a salpeter-like power law with index 2.0 +/- 0.3. thisresult agrees well with similar studies of lower-mass regions rho oph and orionb. we interpret the apparent invariance of the shape of the clump mass functionover a broad range of parent cloud masses as evidence for the self-similarityof the physical processes which determine it. this result is consistent withmodels which suggest that turbulent fragmentation, acting at early times, issufficient to set the clump mass function.

astro-ph;0603330	high mass star formation. ii. the mass function of submillimeter clumps  in m17	we have mapped an approximately 5.5 by 5.5 pc portion of the m17 massivestar-forming region in both 850 and 450 micron dust continuum emission usingthe submillimeter common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerkmaxwell telescope (jcmt). the maps reveal more than 100 dusty clumps withdeconvolved linear sizes of 0.05--0.2 pc and masses of 0.8--120 solar masses,most of which are not associated with known mid-infrared point sources. fittingthe clump mass function with a double power law gives a mean power law exponentof alpha_high = -2.4 +/- 0.3 for the high-mass power law, consistent with theexponent of the salpeter stellar mass function. we show that a lognormal clumpmass distribution with a peak at about 4 solar masses produces as good a fit tothe clump mass function as does a double power law. this 4 solar mass peak massis well above the peak masses of both the stellar initial mass function and themass function of clumps in low-mass star-forming regions. despite thedifference in intrinsic mass scale, the shape of the m17 clump mass functionappears to be consistent with the shape of the core mass function in low-massstar-forming regions. thus, we suggest that the clump mass function inhigh-mass star-forming regions may be a scaled-up version of that in low-massregions, instead of its extension to higher masses.

astro-ph;0702474	molecular oxygen in the rho ophiuchi cloud	molecular oxygen, o2 has been expected historically to be an abundantcomponent of the chemical species in molecular clouds and, as such, animportant coolant of the dense interstellar medium. however, a number ofattempts from both ground and from space have failed to detect o2 emission. thework described here uses heterodyne spectroscopy from space to search formolecular oxygen in the interstellar medium. the odin satellite carries a 1.1 msub-millimeter dish and a dedicated 119 ghz receiver for the ground state lineof o2. starting in 2002, the star forming molecular cloud core rho oph a wasobserved with odin for 34 days during several observing runs. we detect aspectral line at v(lsr) = 3.5 km/s with dv(fwhm) = 1.5 km/s, parameters whichare also common to other species associated with rho ohp a. this feature isidentified as the o2 (n_j = 1_1 - 1_0) transition at 118 750.343 mhz. theabundance of molecular oxygen, relative to h2,, is 5e-8 averaged over the odinbeam. this abundance is consistently lower than previously reported upperlimits.

astro-ph;0703632	upper limits to the water abundance in starburst galaxies	we have searched for emission from the 557 ghz ortho-water line in theinterstellar medium of six nearby starburst galaxies. we used the odinsatellite to observe the 1_10-1_01 transition of o-h2o in the galaxies ngc253,ic342, m82, ngc4258, cena, and m51. none of the galaxies in our sample wasdetected. we derive three sigma upper limits to the h2o abundance relative toh2 ranging from 2e-9 to 1e-8. the best of these upper limits are comparable tothe measured abundance of h$_2$o in the galactic star forming region w3.however, if only 10% of the molecular gas is in very dense cores, then thewater abundance limits in the cores themselves would be larger by a factor of10 i.e. 2e-8 to 1e-7. these observations suggest that detections of h2oemission in galaxies with the upcoming herschel space observatory are likely torequire on-source integration times of an hour or more except in the verybrightest extragalactic targets such as m82 and ngc253.

astro-ph;9403008	diffuse molecular clouds and the molecular interstellar medium from 13co  observations of m33	we have obtained 12co and 13co j=1-0 observations of the nearby spiral galaxym33 to try to resolve the long-standing discrepancy between 12co/13co lineratios measured in galactic giant molecular clouds and external galaxies.interferometer maps of the molecular cloud mc20 give a 12co/13co line ratio of7.5+/-2.1, which agrees reasonably well with the line ratio measured ingalactic giant molecular clouds. in contrast, the 12co/13co line ratio obtainedfrom single dish data is 10.0+/-0.9, significantly higher than galactic valuesbut in good agreement with line ratios measured in other galaxies. theinterferometer map of mc20 reveals that the cloud has similar spatial andvelocity extents in the two lines, and thus the high single dish line ratiocannot be due to different filling factors in the two lines. in addition, thesingle dish data show no evidence for significant variations in the line ratiowith metallicity, which eliminates abundance changes as the explanation for thehigh single dish line ratio. we conclude that the high 12co/13co line ratio sobserved in m33, and in the disks of spiral galaxies in general, are due to thepresence of a population of diffuse molecular clouds. the lower limit to thefraction of the total 12co emission from m33 that originates in the diffuseclouds is 30+/-30%, while the upper limit is ~60%.

astro-ph;9506106	are galaxies optically thin to their own lyman continuum radiation? i.  m33	halpha and ubv photometry of the inner kpc of m33 are used to study thedistribution of ob stars and hii regions in the galaxy and to determine whetherindividual regions of the galaxy are in a state of ionization balance. based onthe surface brightness of the halpha emission, we identify three distinctionized gas environments (bright, halo and field). we find that 50% of the obstars are located in the field, so that 1/2 of the lifetime of ob stars must bespent outside recognizable hii regions. if ob stars escape from bright hiiregions by destroying their parent molecular clouds, this result would implythat molecular cloud lifetimes after forming ob stars could be as low as 5e6yrs or 1/2 the typical lifetime of ob stars. halpha fluxes predicted fromionization models reveal that none of the regions are in ionization balance:predicted fluxes are a factor of 3-7 greater than observed. the heaviest lossof ionizing photons appears to be taking place in the field. our resultssuggest that star formation rates obtained from halpha luminosities mustunderestimate the true star formation rate in these regions of m33.

astro-ph;9901134	the large-scale j=3-2 and j=2-1 co emission from m17 and its  implications for extragalactic co observations	we observed a 10x20 pc region of the molecular cloud m17 in the 12co and 13coj=3-2 and j=2-1 transitions to determine their global behavior and to assessthe reliability of using ratios of co line intensities integrated over anentire cloud to determine the physical conditions within the cloud. both the12co/13co j=2-1 and j=3-2 line ratios correlate with the 13co integratedintensity, with smaller line ratios observed at locations with large integratedintensities. this correlation is likely due to variations in the column densityfrom one position to another within m17. the 12co and 13co (j=3-2/j=2-1) lineratios show no significant variation from place to place within m17, even onthe peak of the photon-dominated region. a large velocity gradient analysis ofglobally averaged line ratios gives results in reasonable agreement with theresults obtained for individual lines-of-sight through the cloud, whichsuggests that the typical physical conditions in a molecular cloud can bedetermined using co line ratios integrated over the entire cloud. there appearsto be a clear trend of increasing 12co/13co j=2-1 and j=3-2 line ratios as onemoves from galactic molecular cloud cores to entire galactic molecular cloudsto normal galaxies. the most likely explanation of the high line ratios fornormal galaxies is a significant contribution to the co emission by low columndensity material, such as diffuse molecular clouds or the outer envelopes ofgiant molecular clouds.
