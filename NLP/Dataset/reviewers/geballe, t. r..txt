0901.2134	spectroscopic detection of carbon monoxide in two late-type t dwarfs	m band spectra of two late-type t dwarfs, 2mass j09373487+2931409, and gliese570d, confirm evidence from photometry that photospheric co is present atabundance levels far in excess of those predicted from chemical equilibrium.these new and unambiguous detections of co, together with an earlierspectroscopic detection of co in gliese 229b and existing m band photometry ofa large selection of t dwarfs, suggest that vertical mixing in the photospheredrives the co abundance out of chemical equilibrium and is a common, and likelyuniversal feature of mid-to-late type t dwarfs. the m band spectra allowdeterminations of the time scale of vertical mixing in the atmosphere of eachobject, the first such measurements of this important parameter in late tdwarfs. a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution of 2massj09373487+2931409 results in the following values for metallicity, temperature,surface gravity, and luminosity: [m/h]~-0.3, t_eff=925-975k, log g=5.20-5.47,log l/l_sun=-5.308 +/- 0.027. the age is 3-10 gyr and the mass is in the range45-69 m_jup.

0906.2991	the 0.8-14.5 micron spectra of mid-l to mid-t dwarfs: diagnostics of  effective temperature, grain sedimentation, gas transport, and surface  gravity	we present new 5.2-14.5 micron low-resolution spectra of 14 mid-l to mid-tdwarfs, as well as 3.0-4.1 micron spectra for five of these dwarfs. these dataare supplemented by existing red and near-infrared spectra (0.6-2.5 micron), aswell as red through mid-infrared spectroscopy of seven other l and t dwarfspresented by cushing et al. (2008). we compare these spectra to those generatedfrom the model atmospheres of saumon &amp; marley (2008). the models reproduce theobserved spectra well, except in the case of one very red l3.5 dwarf, 2massj22244381-0158521. the broad wavelength coverage allows us to constrain almostindependently the four parameters used to describe these photospheres in ourmodels: effective temperature (teff), surface gravity, grain sedimentationefficiency (fsed) and vertical gas transport efficiency (kzz).  the sample of l3.5 to t5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 &lt; teff &lt; 1000 k, withan l-t transition (spectral types l7-t4) that lies between 1400 k and 1100k fordwarfs with typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 kwarmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. in thismodel analysis, fsed increases rapidly between types t0 and t4, indicating thatincreased sedimentation can explain the rapid disappearance of clouds at thisstage of brown dwarf evolution. there is a suggestion that the transition todust-free atmospheres happens at lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.

0906.4885	the 3-5 micron spectrum of ngc 1068 at high angular resolution:  distribution of emission and absorption features across the nuclear continuum  source	we report moderate resolution 3-5 micron spectroscopy of the nucleus of ngc1068 obtained at 0.3 arcsec (20 pc) resolution with the spectrograph slitaligned approximately along the ionization cones of the agn. the deconvolvedfwhm of the nuclear continuum source in this direction is 0.3 arcsec. fourcoronal lines of widely different excitations were detected; the intensity ofeach peaks near radio knot c, approximately 0.3 arcsec north of the infraredcontinuum peak, where the radio jet changes direction. together with thebroadened line profiles observed near that location, this suggests thatshock-ionization is the dominant excitation mechanism of the coronal lines. thedepth of the 3.4 micron hydrocarbon absorption is maximum at and just south ofthe continuum peak, similar to the 10 micron silicate absorption. that and thesimilar and rapid variations of the optical depths of both features across thenucleus suggest that substantial portions of both arise in a dusty environmentjust in front of the continuum source(s). a new and tighter limit is set on thecolumn density of co. although clumpy models of the dust screen might explainthe shallowness of the silicate feature, the presence of the 3.4 micron featureand the absence of co are strongly reminiscent of galactic diffuse cloudenvironments and a consistent explanation for them and the observed silicatefeature is found if all three phenomena occur in such an environment, existingas close as 10 pc from the central engine.

1002.1315	constraining the environment of ch+ formation with ch3+ observations	the formation of ch+ in the interstellar medium has long been an outstandingproblem in chemical models. in order to probe the physical conditions of theism in which ch+ forms, we propose the use of ch3+ observations. the pathway toforming ch3+ begins with ch+, and a steady state analysis of ch3+ and thereaction intermediary ch2+ results in a relationship between the ch+ and ch3+abundances. this relationship depends on the molecular hydrogen fraction, f_h2,and gas temperature, t, so observations of ch+ and ch3+ can be used to inferthe properties of the gas in which both species reside. we present observationsof both molecules along the diffuse cloud sight line toward cyg ob2 no. 12.using our computed column densities and upper limits, we put constraints on thef_h2 vs. t parameter space in which ch+ and ch3+ form. we find that average,static, diffuse molecular cloud conditions (i.e. f_h2&gt;0.2, t~60 k) are excludedby our analysis. however, current theory suggests that non-equilibrium effectsdrive the reaction c+ + h_2 --&gt; ch+ + h, endothermic by 4640 k. if we considera higher effective temperature due to collisions between neutrals andaccelerated ions, the ch3+ partition function predicts that the overallpopulation will be spread out into several excited rotational levels. as aresult, observations of more ch3+ transitions with higher signal-to-noiseratios are necessary to place any constraints on models where magneticacceleration of ions drives the formation of ch+.

1005.1671	strong absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride: herschel/hifi  observations of the sight-line to g10.6-0.4 (w31c)	we report the detection of strong absorption by interstellar hydrogenfluoride along the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source g10.6-0.4(w31c). we have used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, toobserve the 1232.4763 ghz j=1-0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band5a receiver. the resultant spectrum shows weak hf emission from g10.6-0.4 atlsr velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption byforeground material at lsr velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. the spectrumis similar to that of the 1113.3430 ghz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,although at some frequencies the hf (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearlyexceeds that of para-h2o. the optically-thick hf absorption that we haveobserved places a conservative lower limit of 1.6e+14 cm-2 on the hf columndensity along the sight-line to g10.6-0.4. our lower limit on the hf abundance,6e-9 relative to hydrogen nuclei, implies that hydrogen fluoride accounts forbetween ~ 30 and 100% of the fluorine nuclei in the gas phase along thissight-line. this observation corroborates theoretical predictions that -because the unique thermochemistry of fluorine permits the exothermic reactionof f atoms with molecular hydrogen - hf will be the dominant reservoir ofinterstellar fluorine under a wide range of conditions.

1007.0987	herschel/hifi observations of interstellar oh+ and h2o+ towards w49n: a  probe of diffuse clouds with a small molecular fraction	we report the detection of absorption by interstellar hydroxyl cations andwater cations, along the sight-line to the bright continuum source w49n. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the972 ghz n = 1 - 0 transition of oh+ and the 1115 ghz 1(11) - 0(00) transitionof ortho-h2o+. the resultant spectra show absorption by ortho-h2o+, and strongabsorption by oh+, in foreground material at velocities in the range 0 to 70km/s with respect to the local standard of rest. the inferred oh+/h2o+abundance ratio ranges from ~ 3 to ~ 15, implying that the observed oh+ arisesin clouds of small molecular fraction, in the 2 - 8% range. this conclusion isconfirmed by the distribution of oh+ and h2o+ in doppler velocity space, whichis similar to that of atomic hydrogen, as observed by means of 21 cm absorptionmeasurements, and dissimilar from that typical of other molecular tracers. theobserved oh+/h abundance ratio of a few e-8 suggests a cosmic ray ionizationrate for atomic hydrogen of (0.6 - 2.4) e-16 s-1, in good agreement withestimates inferred previously for diffuse clouds in the galactic disk fromobservations of interstellar h3+ and other species.

1007.2148	detection of hydrogen fluoride absorption in diffuse molecular clouds  with herschel/hifi: a ubiquitous tracer of molecular gas	we discuss the detection of absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride (hf)along the sight line to the submillimeter continuum sources w49n and w51. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the1232.4762 ghz j = 1 - 0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band 5areceiver. we detected foreground absorption by hf toward both sources over awide range of velocities. optically thin absorption components were detected onboth sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limiton - the column density of hf for the first time. as in previous observationsof hf toward the source g10.6-0.4, the derived hf column density is typicallycomparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance ofoxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. we usedthe rather uncertain n(ch)-n(h2) relationship derived previously toward diffusemolecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the cloudsexhibiting hf absorption. within the uncertainties, we find that the abundanceof hf with respect to h2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that hfis the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. thus, hydrogenfluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small h2 column density. indeed,the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of alow column density diffuse molecular cloud along the w51 sight line, at an lsrvelocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorptionline studies prior to the launch of herschel.

1010.3252	investigating the cosmic-ray ionization rate near the supernova remnant  ic 443 through h3+ observations	observational and theoretical evidence suggests that high-energy galacticcosmic rays are primarily accelerated by supernova remnants. if also true forlow-energy cosmic rays, the ionization rate near a supernova remnant should behigher than in the general galactic interstellar medium (ism). we have searchedfor h3+ absorption features in 6 sight lines which pass through molecularmaterial near ic 443---a well-studied case of a supernova remnant interactingwith its surrounding molecular material---for the purpose of inferring thecosmic-ray ionization rate in the region. in 2 of the sight lines (toward als8828 and hd 254577) we find large h3+ column densities, n(h3+)~3*10^14 cm^-2,and deduce ionization rates of zeta_2~2*10^-15 s^-1, about 5 times larger thaninferred toward average diffuse molecular cloud sight lines. however, the 3sigma upper limits found for the other 4 sight lines are consistent withtypical galactic values. this wide range of ionization rates is likely theresult of particle acceleration and propagation effects, which predict that thecosmic-ray spectrum and thus ionization rate should vary in and around theremnant. while we cannot determine if the h3+ absorption arises in post-shock(interior) or pre-shock (exterior) gas, the large inferred ionization ratessuggest that ic 443 is in fact accelerating a large population of low-energycosmic rays. still, it is unclear whether this population can propagate farenough into the ism to account for the ionization rate inferred in diffusegalactic sight lines.

1102.2488	ices in the quiescent ic 5146 dense cloud	this paper presents spectra in the 2 to 20 micron range of quiescent cloudmaterial located in the ic 5146 cloud complex. the spectra were obtained withnasa's infrared telescope facility (irtf) spex instrument and the spitzer spacetelescope's infrared spectrometer. we use these spectra to investigate dust andice absorption features in pristine regions of the cloud that are unaltered byembedded stars. we find that the h2o-ice threshold extinction is 4.03+/-0.05mag. once foreground extinction is taken into account, however, the thresholddrops to 3.2 mag, equivalent to that found for the taurus dark cloud, generallyassumed to be the touchstone quiescent cloud against which all other densecloud and embedded young stellar object observations are compared. substructurein the trough of the silicate band for two sources is attributed to ch3oh andnh3 in the ices, present at the ~2% and ~5% levels, respectively, relative toh2o-ice. the correlation of the silicate feature with the e(j-k) color excessis found to follow a much shallower slope relative to lines of sight that probediffuse clouds, supporting the previous results by chiar et al.

1104.2902	absorption line survey of h3+ toward the galactic center sources iii.  extent of the warm and diffuse clouds	we present follow-up observations to those of geballe &amp; oka (2010), who foundhigh column densities of h3+ ~100 pc off of the galactic center (gc) on thelines of sight to 2mass j17432173-2951430 (j1743) and 2mass j17470898-2829561(j1747). the wavelength coverages on these sightlines have been extended inorder to observe two key transitions of h3+, r(3,3)l and r(2,2)l, thatconstrain the temperatures and densities of the environments. the profiles ofthe h3+ r(3,3)l line, which is due only to gas in the gc, closely matches thedifferences between the h3+ r(1,1)l and co line profiles, just as it does forpreviously studied sightlines in the gc. absorption in the r(2,2)l line of h3+is present in j1747 at velocities between -60 and +100 km/s. this is the secondclear detection of this line in the interstellar medium after gcirs 3 in thecentral cluster. the temperature of the absorbing gas in this velocity range is350 k, significantly warmer than in the diffuse clouds in other parts of thecentral molecular zone. this indicates that the absorbing gas is local to sgr bmolecular cloud complex. the warm and diffuse gas revealed by oka et al. (2005)apparently extends to ~100 pc, but there is a hint that its temperature issomewhat lower in the line of sight to j1743 than elsewhere in the gc. theobservation of h3+ toward j1747 is compared with the recent herschelobservation of h2o+ toward sgr b2 and their chemical relationship andremarkably similar velocity profiles are discussed.

1110.3235	the circumstellar environment of r coronae borealis: white dwarf merger  or final helium shell flash?	in 2007, r coronae borealis (r crb) went into an historically deep and longdecline. in this state, the dust acts like a natural coronagraph at visiblewavelengths, allowing faint nebulosity around the star to be seen. imaging hasbeen obtained from 0.5 to 500 micron with gemini/gmos, hst/wfpc2, spitzer/mips,and herschel/spire. several of the structures around r crb are cometaryglobules caused by wind from the star streaming past dense blobs. the estimateddust mass of the knots is consistent with their being responsible for the r crbdeclines if they form along the line of sight to the star. in addition, thereis a large diffuse shell extending up to 4 pc away from the star containingcool 25 k dust that is detected all the way out to 500 micron. the sed of r crbcan be well fit by a 150 au disk surrounded by a very large diffuse envelopewhich corresponds to the size of the observed nebulosity. the total masses ofthe disk and envelope are 10^-4 and 2 m(sun), respectively, assuming agas-to-dust ratio of 100. the evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger ora final-helium-shell flash origin for r crb is contradictory. the shell and thecometary knots are consistent with a fossil planetary nebula. along with thefact that r crb shows significant lithium in its atmosphere, this supports thefinal-helium-shell flash. however, the relatively high inferred mass of r crband its high fluorine abundance support a white-dwarf merger.

1111.0613	infrared diffuse interstellar bands in the galactic centre region	the spectrum of any star viewed through a sufficient quantity of diffuseinterstellar material reveals a number of absorption features collectivelycalled diffuse interstellar bands (dibs). the first dibs were reported 90 yearsago, and currently well over 500 are known. none of them has been convincinglyidentified with any specific element or molecule, although recent studiessuggest that the dib carriers are polyatomic molecules containing carbon. mostof the dibs currently known are at visible and very near-infrared wavelengths,with only two previously known at wavelengths beyond one micron (10,000angstroms), the longer of which is at 1.318 microns. here we report thediscovery of thirteen diffuse interstellar bands in the 1.5-1.8 micron intervalon high extinction sightlines toward stars in the galactic centre. we arguethat they originate almost entirely in the galactic centre region, aconsiderably warmer and harsher environment than where dibs have been observedpreviously. the relative strengths of these dibs toward the galactic centre andthe cygnus ob2 diffuse cloud are consistent with their strengths scaling mainlywith extinction by diffuse material.

0705.0701	the early spectrophotometric evolution of v1186 scorpii (nova scorpii  2004 #1)	we report optical photometry and optical through mid-infrared spectroscopy ofthe classical nova v1186 sco. this slowly developing nova had an complex lightcurve with multiple secondary peaks similar to those seen in pw vul. the timeto decline 2 magnitudes, t$_2$, was 20 days but the erratic nature of the lightcurve makes determination of intrinsic properties based on the decline time(e.g., luminosity) problematic, and the often cited mmrd relationship of dellavalle and livio (1995) fails to yield a plausible distance. spectra covering0.35 to 35 $\mu$m were obtained in two separate epochs during the first year ofoutburst. the first set of spectra, taken about 2 months after visible maximum,are typical of a co-type nova with narrow line emission from \ion{h}{1},\ion{fe}{2}, \ion{o}{1} and \ion{he}{1}. later data, obtained between 260 and380 days after maximum, reveal an emerging nebular spectrum. \textit{spitzer}spectra show weakening hydrogen recombination emission with the emergence of[\ion{ne}{2}] (12.81 $\mu$m) as the strongest line. strong emission from[\ion{ne}{3}] (15.56 $\mu$m) is also detected. photoionization models with loweffective temperature sources and only marginal neon enhancement (ne $\sim$ 1.3ne$_{\odot}$) are consistent with these ir fine-structure neon lines indicatingthat v1186 sco did not occur on a onemg white dwarf. in contrast, the slow anderratic light curve evolution, spectral development, and photoionizationanalysis of the ejecta imply the outburst occurred on a low mass co whitedwarf. we note that this is the first time strong [\ion{ne}{2}] lines have beendetected so early in the outburst of a co nova and suggests that the presenceof mid-infrared neon lines is not directly indicative of a onemg nova event.

astro-ph;0008293	spectroscopy of the candidate luminous blue variable at the center of  the ring nebula g79.29+0.46	we report optical and near-infrared spectra of the central star of the radiosource g79.29+0.46, a candidate luminous blue variable. the spectra containnumerous narrow (fwhm &lt; 100 km/s emission lines of which the low-lying hydrogenlines are the strongest, and resemble spectra of other lbvc's and b[e]supergiants. a few prominent infrared lines are unidentified. the terminal windspeed is determined from h alpha to be 110 km/s. the strength of h alphaimplies the presence of a very dense wind. extended emission from h alpha and[n ii] was detected but appears to be associated with the cygnus x regionrather than the radio source. both diffuse interstellar bands and interstellarabsorption lines are present in the optical spectrum of the central star,suggesting that there are both diffuse and molecular cloud components to theextinction and implying a minimum distance of 1 kpc and minimum luminosity of\~10^5 l(sun) for the star. the new spectra and their analysis indicate a lowexcitation, dense, and slowly expanding wind and support the lbvcclassification.

astro-ph;0011297	a search for possible interactions between ejections from grs 1915+105  and the surrounding interstellar medium	we have observed an extended region surrounding the first discovered galacticsuperluminal source grs 1915+105, seeking evidence of interaction between therelativistic ejecta of that object and the interstellar medium. we find tworadio sources axisymmetrically aligned along the sub-arcsecond relativisticejecta of grs 1915+105 and roughly 17' distant from it, which coincide with theluminous iras sources 19124+1106 and 19132+1035. we have observed these sourcesat centimeter (vla), millimeter (iram 30m), and infrared (iso, ukirt, eso/mpi2.2m) wavelengths in both line and continuum emission. at centimeterwavelengths a non-thermal jet-like feature aligned along the outflow axis islocated adjacent to the inner edge of the southern source. strong densityenhancements are found in the millimeter tracers co and h13co+ at the positionsof both sources and some of the morphology is reminiscent of shock-likeinteractions; however, linewidths are narrow. at infrared wavelengths stronghydrogen recombination lines and weak lines of molecular hydrogen are observedat the southern source. we discuss these results as possible evidence of thesought-after interaction, both in terms of the regions undergoing ongoingshock-heating and in terms of them being locations of shock-induced starformation. the evidence for each of these is inconclusive. millimeter linemapping of a portion of w 50 where the relativistic jets of the x-ray binary ss433 interact with the interstellar medium shows roughly similar morphology asgrs 1915+105, suggesting that the phenomena observed at the iras sources maynot be unusual for such a long distance interaction.

astro-ph;0011340	optical and infrared spectroscopy of the type iin sn 1998s : days 3-127	we present contemporary infrared and optical spectroscopic observations ofthe type iin sn 1998s for the period between 3 and 127 days after discovery. inthe first week the spectra are characterised by prominent broad emission lineswith narrow peaks superimposed on a very blue continuum(t~24000k). in thefollowing two weeks broad, blueshifted absorption components appeared in thespectra and the temperature dropped. by day 44, broad emission components in hand he reappeared in the spectra. these persisted to 100-130d, becomingincreasingly asymmetric. we agree with leonard et al. (2000) that the broademission lines indicate interaction between the ejecta and circumstellarmaterial (csm) and deduce that progenitor of sn 1998s appears to have gonethrough at least two phases of mass loss, giving rise to two csm zones.examination of the spectra indicates that the inner zone extended to &lt;90au,while the outer csm extended from 185au to over 1800au. analysis of highresolution spectra shows that the outer csm had a velocity of 40-50 km/s.assuming a constant velocity, we can infer that the outer csm wind commencedmore than 170 years ago, and ceased about 20 years ago, while the inner csmwind may have commenced less than 9 years ago. during the era of the outer csmwind the outflow was high, &gt;2x10^{-5}m_{\odot}/yr corresponding to a mass lossof at least 0.003m_{\odot} and suggesting a massive progenitor. we also modelthe co emission observed in sn 1998s. we deduce a co mass of ~10^{-3} m_{\odot}moving at ~2200km/s, and infer a mixed metal/he core of ~4m_{\odot}, againindicating a massive progenitor.

astro-ph;0102059	infrared spectroscopy of brown dwarfs: the onset of methane absorption  in l dwarfs and the l/t transition	we present infrared spectra of brown dwarfs with spectral types from mid-l tot. the 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m spectra of three dwarfs found by the sloan digital skysurvey contain absorption bands of both methane and carbon monoxide and bridgethe gap between late l and previously observed t dwarfs. these dwarfs form aclear spectral sequence, with ch$_{4}$ absorption increasing as the coabsorption decreases. water vapor band strengths increase in parallel with themethane bands and thus also link the l and t types. we suggest that objectswith detectable co and ch$_{4}$ in the h and k bands should define the earliestt subclasses. from observations of bright (k~$\leq$~13 mag) l dwarfs found by2mass, we find that the onset of detectable amounts of ch$_{4}$ occurs nearspectral type l5. for this spectral type methane is observable in the3.3~$\mu$m $\nu$$_{3}$ band only, and not in the overtone and combination bandsat h and k.

astro-ph;0108443	towards spectral classification of l and t dwarfs: infrared and optical  spectroscopy and analysis	we present 0.6-2.5um, r~400 spectra of twenty-seven cool, low luminositystars and substellar objects. based on these and previously published spectrawe develop a preliminary spectral classification system for l and t dwarfs. forlate l and t types the classification system is based entirely on four spectralindices in the 1-2.5um interval. two of these indices are derived from waterabsorption bands at 1.15um and 1.4um, the latter of which shows a smoothincrease in depth through the l and t sequences and can be used to classifyboth spectral types. the other two indices make use of methane absorptionfeatures in the h and k bands, with the k band index also applicable to mid tolate l dwarfs. continuum indices shortward of 1um used by previous authors toclassify l dwarfs are found to be useful only through mid l subclasses. weemploy the 1.5um water index and the 2.2um methane index to complete the lclassification through l9.5 and to link the new system with a modified versionof the 2mass ``color-d'' index. by correlating the depths of the methane andwater absorption features, we establish a t spectral sequence from types t0 tot8, based on all four indices, which is a smooth continuation of the lsequence. we reclassify two 2mass l8 dwarfs as l9 and l9.5 and identify onesdss object as l9. in the proposed system methane absorption appears in the kband approximately at l8, two subclasses earlier than its appearance in the hband. the l and t spectral classes are distinguished by the absence andpresence, respectively, of h band methane absorption.

astro-ph;0109331	infrared classification of l and t dwarfs	we use new and published medium resolution 0.6--2.5 $\mu$m spectra of l and tdwarfs to develop a unified classification system for both of these newspectral classes. two indices of the system at 1.2 $\mu$m and 1.5 $\mu$m arebased on nearby absorption bands of water vapor and two are associated withmethane bands near 1.6 $\mu$m and 2.2 $\mu$m. the 1.5 $\mu$m index is monotonicthrough the l and t sequences, and forms the backbone of the system; theindices for the other bands provide extensive, but only partial, coverage. wecorrelate the 1.5 $\mu$m index with continuum indices shortward of 1 $\mu$mdevised by others for classifying l dwarfs, in order to obtain a tight linkbetween optical and infrared classifications. our proposed system defines tenspectral subclasses for l (l0--l9) and nine for t (t0--t8). the boundarybetween l and t is defined to be the onset of absorption by methane in the hband. methane absorption in the k band near 2.2 $\mu$m is found to beginapproximately at l8.

astro-ph;0302106	enhanced cosmic-ray flux toward zeta persei inferred from laboratory  study of h3+ - e- recombination rate	the h3+ molecular ion plays a fundamental role in interstellar chemistry, asit initiates a network of chemical reactions that produce many interstellarmolecules. in dense clouds, the h3+ abundance is understood using a simplechemical model, from which observations of h3+ yield valuable estimates ofcloud path length, density, and temperature. on the other hand, observations ofdiffuse clouds have suggested that h3+ is considerably more abundant thanexpected from the chemical models. however, diffuse cloud models have beenhampered by the uncertain values of three key parameters: the rate of h3+destruction by electrons, the electron fraction, and the cosmic-ray ionisationrate. here we report a direct experimental measurement of the h3+ destructionrate under nearly interstellar conditions. we also report the observation ofh3+ in a diffuse cloud (towards zeta persei) where the electron fraction isalready known. taken together, these results allow us to derive the value ofthe third uncertain model parameter: we find that the cosmic-ray ionisationrate in this sightline is forty times faster than previously assumed. if such ahigh cosmic-ray flux is indeed ubiquitous in diffuse clouds, the discrepancybetween chemical models and the previous observations of h3+ can be resolved.

astro-ph;0510090	a unified near infrared spectral classification scheme for t dwarfs	a revised near infrared classification scheme for t dwarfs is presented,based on and superseding prior schemes developed by burgasser et al. andgeballe et al., and defined following the precepts of the mk process. drawingfrom two large spectroscopic libraries of t dwarfs identified largely in thesloan digital sky survey and the two micron all sky survey, nine primaryspectral standards and five alternate standards spanning spectral types t0 tot8 are identified that match criteria of spectral character, brightness,absence of a resolved companion and accessibility from both northern andsouthern hemispheres. the classification of t dwarfs is formally made by thedirect comparison of near infrared spectral data of equivalent resolution tothe spectra of these standards. alternately, we have redefined five keyspectral indices measuring the strengths of the major h$_2$o and ch$_4$ bandsin the 1-2.5 micron region that may be used as a proxy to direct spectralcomparison. two methods of determining t spectral type using these indices areoutlined and yield equivalent results. these classifications are alsoequivalent to those from prior schemes, implying that no revision of existingspectral type trends is required. the one-dimensional scheme presented hereprovides a first step toward the observational characterization of the lowestluminosity brown dwarfs currently known. future extensions to incorporatespectral variations arising from differences in photospheric dust content,gravity and metallicity are briefly discussed. a compendium of all currentlyknown t dwarfs with updated classifications is presented.

astro-ph;0605037	sdss j1534+1615ab: a novel t dwarf binary found with keck laser guide  star adaptive optics and the potential role of binarity in the l/t transition	we have resolved the newly discovered t dwarf sdss j1534+1615 into a 0.11''binary using the keck sodium laser guide star adaptive optics system. with anintegrated-light spectral type of t3.5, this binary provides a new benchmarkfor studying the distinctive j-band brightening previously noted among earlyand mid-t dwarfs, using two brown dwarfs with different spectral types buthaving a common metallicity and age and very similar surface gravities. weestimate spectral types of t1.5+/-0.5 and t5.5+/-0.5 for the two componentsbased on their near-ir colors, consistent with modeling the integrated-lightspectrum as the blend of two components. the observed near-ir flux ratios areunique compared to all previously known substellar binaries: the component thatis fainter at h and k' is brighter at j. this inversion of the near-ir fluxesis a manifestation of the j-band brightening within this individual binarysystem. therefore, sdss 1534+1615 demonstrates that the brightening can beintrinsic to ultracool photospheres (e.g., arising from cloud disruption and/orrapid increase in cloud sedimentation) and does not necessarily result fromphysical variations among the observed ensemble of t dwarfs (e.g., a range inmasses, ages and/or metallicities). we suggest that the apparently largeamplitude of the j-band brightening may be due to a high incidence ofunresolved binaries and that the true amplitude of the phenomenon could be moremodest. this scenario would imply that truly single objects in these spectralsubclasses are relatively rare, in agreement with the small effectivetemperature range inferred for the l/t transition.

astro-ph;0703453	very large excesses of 18o in hydrogen-deficient carbon and r coronae  borealis stars: evidence for white dwarf mergers	we have found that at least seven hydrogen-deficient carbon (hdc) and rcoronae borealis (rcb) stars, have 16o/18o ratios close to and in some casesless than unity, values that are orders of magnitude lower than measured inother stars (the solar value is 500). greatly enhanced 18o is evident in everyhdc and rcb we have measured that is cool enough to have detectable co bands.the three hdc stars measured have 16o/18o &lt; 1, lower values than any of the rcbstars. these discoveries are important clues in determining the evolutionarypathways of hdc and rcb stars, for which two models have been proposed: thedouble degenerate (white dwarf (wd) merger), and the final helium-shell flash(ff). no overproduction of 18o is expected in the ff scenario. we havequantitatively explored the idea that hdc and rcb stars originate in themergers of co- and he-wds. the merger process is estimated to take only a fewdays, with accretion rates of 150 msun/ yr producing temperatures at the baseof the accreted envelope of 1.2 - 1.9 x 10^8 k. analysis of a simplifiedone-zone calculation shows that nucleosynthesis in the dynamically accretingmaterial may provide a suitable environment for a significant production of18o, leading to very low values of 16o/18o, similar to those observed. we alsofind qualitative agreement with observed values of 12c/13c and with the cnoelemental ratios. h-admixture during the accretion process from the smallh-rich c/o wd envelope may play an important role in producing the observedabundances. overall our analysis shows that wd mergers may very well be theprogenitors of o18-rich rcb and hdc stars, and that more detailed simulationsand modeling are justified.

astro-ph;9803027	temporal variations of mid-ir spectra in late-type stars	new multi-epoch, mid-infrared (8-13 microns) spectrophotometric observationsare presented for 30~late-type stars. the observations were collected over afour year period (1994-1997), permitting an investigation of the mid-infraredspectral shape as a function of the pulsation cycle (typically 1-2 years). thespectra of stars with little excess infrared emission and those withcarbon-rich dust show the least spectral variability, while stars with evidencefor dusty, oxygen-rich envelopes are most likely to show discernible variationsin their spectral profile. most significantly, a large fraction of variablestars with strong 9.7 micron emission features show clear spectral profilechanges which repeat from one cycle to the next. the significant sharpening ofthe silicate feature near maximum light can not be fully explained by heatingand cooling of the circumstellar dust shell during the pulsational cycle,suggesting that the dust optical properties themselves must also be varying. inaddition, the appearance of a narrow emission feature near the silicate peakfor a few stars may require the production of especially ``pure'' silicate dustnear maximum light. the general narrowing of the silicate feature observed mayreflect the evolution of the pre-existing dirty grains whose surface impuritieshave been evaporated off when the grain temperature rises preceding maximumlight. an improved theory of dust formation which can explain the observedchanges in the grain properties around a single, pulsating star may lead to adefinitive explanation for the diversity of silicate emission profiles observedamongst oxygen-rich, late-type stars.

astro-ph;9903487	new three micron spectra of young stellar objects with h_2o ice bands	we present new groundbased 3 $\mu$m spectra of 14 young stellar objects withh_2o ice absorption bands. the broad absorption feature at 3.47 $\mu$m wasdetected toward all objects and its optical depth is correlated with theoptical depth of h_2o ice, strengthening an earlier finding. the broadabsorption feature at 3.25 $\mu$m was detected toward two more sources and anupper limit is given for a third source. the optical depths of the 3.25 $\mu$mfeature obtained to date are better correlated with the optical depth of therefractory silicate dust than with that of h_2o ice. if this trend isconfirmed, this would support our proposed identification of the feature as thec--h stretch of aromatic hydrocarbons at low temperature. an absorption featureat 3.53 $\mu$m due to solid methanol was detected for the first time towardmonr2/irs2, as well as toward w33a and gl 2136. the wavelengths of the ch_3ohfeatures toward w33a, gl 2136, and ngc7538/irs9 can be fit by ch_3oh-rich ices,while the wavelength of the feature toward monr2/irs2 suggests an h_2o-rich iceenvironment. solid methanol abundances toward gl 2136, ngc7538/irs9, andmonr2/irs2 are 3-5 % relative to h_2o ice. there is an additional narrowabsorption feature near 3.47 $\mu$m toward w33a. for the object w51/irs2,spatially resolved spectra from 2 to 4 $\mu$m indicate that the h_2o ice islocated predominantly in front of the eastern component and that the h_2o iceextinction is much deeper than previously estimated. for the object rno 91,spectra from 2 to 4 $\mu$m reveal stellar (or circumstellar) co gas absorptionand deeper h_2o ice extinction than previously estimated.

astro-ph;9904034	mid-infrared spectra of late-type stars: long-term evolution	recent ground-based mid-infrared spectra of 29 late-type stars, most withsubstantial dust shells, are compared to ground-based spectra of these starsfrom the 1960s and 1970s and to iras-lrs spectra obtained in 1983. the spectraof about half the stars show no detectable changes, implying that theirdistributions of circumstellar material and associated dust grain propertieshave changed little over this time interval. however, many of the stars withstrong silicate features showed marked changes. in nearly all cases thesilicate peak has strengthened with respect to the underlying continuum,although there is one case (vy~cma) in which the silicate feature has almostcompletely disappeared. this suggests that, in general, an oxygen-rich starexperiences long periods of gradual silicate feature strengthening, punctuatedby relatively rare periods when the feature weakens. we discuss variousmechanisms for producing the changes, favoring the slow evolution of theintrinsic dust properties (i.e., the chemical composition or grain structure).although most iras spectra agree well with ground-based spectra, there are anumber of cases where they fall well outside the expected range of uncertainty.in almost all such cases the slopes of the red and blue lrs spectra do notmatch in their region of overlap.

astro-ph;9904286	the x-ray, optical and infrared counterpart to grb 980703	we report on x-ray, optical and infrared follow-up observations of grb980703. we detect a previously unknown x-ray source in the grb error box;assuming a power law decline we find for its decay index alpha &lt; -0.91(3-sigma). we invoke host galaxy extinction to match the observed spectralslope with the slope expected from `fireball' models. we find no evidence for aspectral break in the infrared to x-ray spectral range on 1998 july 4.4, anddetermine a lower limit of the cooling break frequency: nu_c &gt; 1.3 x 10^{17}hz. for this epoch we obtain an extinction of a_v = 1.50 +/- 0.11. from thex-ray data we estimate the optical extinction to be a_v = 20.2 +12.3 -7.3,inconsistent with the former value. our optical spectra confirm the redshift ofz = 0.966 found by djorgovski et al. (1998). we compare the afterglow of grb980703 with that of grb 970508 and find that the fraction of the energy in themagnetic field, epsilon_b &lt; 6x10^{-5}, is much lower in the case of grb 980703,which is a consequence of the high frequency of the cooling break.

astro-ph;9906479	high resolution infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the pistol nebula:  evidence for ejection	we present new nicmos/hst infrared images and cgs4/ukirt br-alpha (4.05 um)spectroscopy of the pistol star and its associated nebula, finding strongevidence to support the hypothesis that the pistol nebula was ejected from thepistol star. the pa-alpha nicmos image shows that the nebula completelysurrounds the pistol star, although the line intensity is much stronger on itsnorthern and western edges. the br-alpha spectra show the classical ring-likesignature of quasi-spherical expansion, with weak blueshifted emission (v_maxapprox -60 km/s) and strong redshifted emission (v_max approx +10 km/s), wherethe velocities are with respect to the velocity of the pistol star; further,the redshifted emission appears to be "flattened" in the position-velocitydiagram. these data suggest that the nebula was ejected from the star severalthousand years ago, with a velocity between the current terminal velocity ofthe stellar wind (95 km/s) and the present expansion velocity of gas in theouter shell of the nebula (60 km/s). the pa-alpha image reveals severalemission-line stars in the region, including two newly-identified emission-linestars north of the pistol star with spectral types earlier than wc8 (t_eff &gt;50,000 k). the presence of these stars, the morphology of the pa-alphaemission, and the velocity field in the gas suggest that the side of the nebulafurthest from us is approaching, and being ionized by, the hot stars of thequintuplet, and that the highest velocity redshifted gas has been deceleratedby winds from the quintuplet stars. we also discuss the possibility that thenebular gas might be magnetically confined by the ambient magnetic fielddelineated by the nearby nonthermal filaments.
