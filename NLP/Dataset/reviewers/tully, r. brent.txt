0901.3554	the near-ir luminosity function and bimodal surface brightness  distribution of virgo cluster galaxies	we have acquired deep, h-band, imaging for a sample of 286 virgo clustergalaxies with b &lt;= 16 mag and extracted surface photometry from optical g,r,i,zsloan digital sky survey images of 742 virgo cluster catalog galaxies,including those with h-band images. we confirm the detection of a dip in theluminosity function indicative of a discontinuity in the cluster galaxypopulation; the dip is more pronounced at redder wavelengths. we find, inagreement with earlier works of tully &amp; verheijen and ours for ursa majorcluster galaxies, a clear dichotomy between high and low surface brightnessgalaxy disks. the difference between the low and high brightness peaks of virgodisk galaxies is ~2 h-mag arcsec^-2, significantly larger than any systematicerrors. the high surface brightness disk galaxies have two distinct classes ofhigh and low concentration bulges, while low surface brightness galaxies haveonly low concentration bulges. early-type galaxies exhibit a similar structuralbimodality though offset from that of the spiral galaxies towards highersurface brightnesses. both the early- and late-type structural bimodalities areuncorrelated with colour or any other structural parameter except, possibly,circular velocity. the structural bimodality may be linked to dynamicalproperties of galaxies. low angular momentum systems may collapse to formdynamically important disks with high surface brightness, while high angularmomentum systems would end up as low surface brightness galaxies dominated bythe dark halo at all radii. the confirmation of structural bimodality forgas-rich and gas-poor galaxies in the high-density virgo cluster as well as thelow-density uma cluster suggests that this phenomenon is independent ofenvironment.

0902.2835	properties of dark matter revealed by astrometric measurements of the  milky way and local galaxies	the fact that dark matter (dm), thus far, has revealed itself only on scalesof galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and theresponsibility to confront the age old mystery "what is the nature of matter?"by deriving basic data on the nature of dm - e.g., mass of its particle(s),present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in theuniverse, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering theproperties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantlyextending the standard models of particle physics. determining the mass of thedm particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle familyto which it (or they) belongs. beyond mass, there are issues of stability. thedm particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may becomeunstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. in bothcases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component.  some key parameters of dm can most accurately be measured in the very nearbyuniverse because dm dominates the mass in the outer milky way (mw), in othergalaxies in the local group, and in the local group in its entirety. thepresence and amount of dm can be quantified by study of dynamical processesobservable in fine detail within these entities. precise measurements of 3-dvelocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellarsystems out to the edge of the galaxy can reveal "what is the shape,orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo" as well as"what is the total mass of the galaxy?"

1005.3300	the hst/acs coma cluster survey. ii. data description and source  catalogs	the coma cluster was the target of a hst-acs treasury program designed fordeep imaging in the f475w and f814w passbands. although our survey wasinterrupted by the acs instrument failure in 2007, the partially completedsurvey still covers ~50% of the core high-density region in coma. observationswere performed for 25 fields that extend over a wide range of cluster-centricradii (~1.75 mpc) with a total coverage area of 274 arcmin^2. the majority ofthe fields are located near the core region of coma (19/25 pointings) with sixadditional fields in the south-west region of the cluster. in this paper wepresent reprocessed images and sextractor source catalogs for our surveyfields, including a detailed description of the methodology used for objectdetection and photometry, the subtraction of bright galaxies to measure faintunderlying objects, and the use of simulations to assess the photometricaccuracy and completeness of our catalogs. we also use simulations to performaperture corrections for the sextractor kron magnitudes based only on themeasured source flux and half-light radius. we have performed photometry for~73,000 unique objects; one-half of our detections are brighter than the10-sigma point-source detection limit at f814w=25.8 mag (ab). the slightmajority of objects (60%) are unresolved or only marginally resolved by acs. weestimate that coma members are 5-10% of all source detections, which consist ofa large population of unresolved objects (primarily gcs but also ucds) and awide variety of extended galaxies from a cd galaxy to dwarf lsb galaxies. thered sequence of coma member galaxies has a constant slope and dispersion across9 magnitudes (-21&lt;m_f814w&lt;-13). the initial data release for the hst-acs comatreasury program was made available to the public in 2008 august. the imagesand catalogs described in this study relate to our second data release.

1009.3950	ucds in the coma cluster	as part of the hst/acs coma cluster treasury survey, we have undertaken akeck/lris spectroscopic campaign to determine membership for faint dwarfgalaxies. in the process, we discovered a population of ultra compact dwarfgalaxies (ucds) in the core region of the coma cluster. at the distance ofcoma, ucds are expected to have angular sizes 0.01 &lt; r_e &lt; 0.2 arcsec. with acsimaging, we can resolve all but the smallest ones with careful fitting.candidate ucds were chosen based on magnitude, color, and degree of resolution.we spectroscopically confirm 27 objects as bona fide ucd members of the comacluster, a 60% success rate for objects targeted with m_r &lt; -12. we attributethe high success rate in part to the high resolution of hst data and to anapparent large population of ucds in coma. we find that the ucds tend to bestrongly clustered around giant galaxies, at least in the core region of thecluster, and have a distribution and colors that are similar to globularclusters. these findings suggest that ucds are not independent galaxies, butrather have a star cluster origin. this current study provides the denseenvironment datapoint necessary for understanding the ucd population.

1010.3788	the luminosity function in groups of galaxis	with targeted imaging of groups in the local volume, the regions of collapsearound bright galaxies can be clearly identified by the distribution of dwarfsand luminosity functions can be established to very faint levels. in the caseof the m81 group there is completion to m_r ~ -9. in all well studied cases,the faint end slopes are in the range -1.35 &lt; alpha &lt; -1.2, much flatter thanthe slope for the bottom end of the halo mass spectrum anticipated by lambdacdmhierarchical clustering theory. small but significant variations are found withenvironment. interestingly, the populations of dwarf galaxies are roughlyconstant per unit halo mass. with the numbers of dwarfs as an anchor point,evolved environments (dominated by early morphological types) have relativelyfewer intermediate luminosity systems and at least one relatively moreimportant galaxy at the core. the variations with environment are consistentwith a scenario of galaxy merging. however it is questionable if the universaldearth of visible dwarf systems is a consequence of an astrophysical processlike reionization.

1106.5828	ultra-compact dwarfs in the coma cluster	we have undertaken a spectroscopic search for ultra compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) in the dense core of the dynamically evolved, massive coma cluster aspart of the hst/acs coma cluster treasury survey. ucd candidates were initiallychosen based on color, magnitude, degree of resolution within the acs images,and the known properties of fornax and virgo ucds. follow-up spectroscopy withkeck/lris confirmed 27 candidates as members of the coma cluster, a successrate &gt; 60% for targeted objects brighter than m_r = -12. another 14 candidatesmay also prove to be coma members, but low signal-to-noise spectra preventdefinitive conclusions. an investigation of the properties and distribution ofthe coma ucds finds these objects to be very similar to ucds discovered inother environments. the coma ucds tend to be clustered around giant galaxies inthe cluster core and have colors/metallicity that correlate with the hostgalaxy. with properties and a distribution similar to that of the coma clusterglobular cluster population, we find strong support for a star cluster originfor the majority of the coma ucds. however, a few ucds appear to have stellarpopulation or structural properties which differentiate them from the old starcluster populations found in the coma cluster, perhaps indicating that ucds mayform through multiple formation channels.

1109.3856	3d velocity and density reconstructions of the local universe with  cosmicflows-1	this paper presents an analysis of the local peculiar velocity field based onthe wiener filter reconstruction method. we used our currently availablecatalog of distance measurements containing 1,797 galaxies within 3000 km/s:cosmicflows-1. the wiener filter method is used to recover the full 3d peculiarvelocity field from the observed map of radial velocities and to recover theunderlying linear density field. the velocity field within a data zone of 3000km/s is decomposed into a local component that is generated within the datazone and a tidal one that is generated by the mass distribution outside thatzone. the tidal component is characterized by a coherent flow toward thenorma-hydra-centaurus (great attractor) region while the local component isdominated by a flow toward the virgo cluster and away from the local void. adetailed analysis shows that the local flow is predominantly governed by thelocal void and the virgo cluster plays a lesser role. the analysis procedurewas tested against a mock catalog. it is demonstrated that the wiener filteraccurately recovers the input velocity field of the mock catalog on the scaleof the extraction of distances and reasonably recovers the velocity field onsignificantly larger scales. the bayesian wiener filter reconstruction iscarried out within the ?cdm wmap5 framework. the wiener filter reconstructiondraws particular attention to the importance of voids in proximity to ourneighborhood. the prominent structure of the local supercluster is wrapped in ahorseshoe collar of under density with the local void as a major component.

1207.3023	atomic hydrogen, star formation and feedback in the lowest mass blue  compact dwarf galaxies	we present the results from a search for hi emission from a sample of newlydiscovered dwarf galaxies in the m81 group. hi is detected in three galaxies,all of which are classified as bcds. the hi masses of these galaxies are ~ 10^6m_sun, making these some of the lowest mass bcds known. for these threegalaxies fuv images (from galex) and h-alpha images (from the russian 6m btatelescope) are available.the h-alpha emission is very faint, and, in principlecould be produced by a single o star. further, in all cases we find offsetsbetween the peak of the fuv emission and that of the h-alpha emission. offsetsbetween the most recent sites of star formation (i.e. those traced by h-alpha)and the older sites (i.e. those traced by fuv) would be natural if the starformation is stochastic. in spite of the expectation that the effects ofmechanical feedback from star formation would be most directly seen in thesmallest galaxies with low gravitational potentials, we only see tentativeevidence of outflowing hi gas associated with the star forming region in one ofthe galaxies.

1208.3309	the mid-infrared tully-fisher relation: spitzer surface photometry	the availability of photometric imaging of several thousand galaxies with thespitzer space telescope enables a mid-infrared calibration of the correlationbetween luminosity and rotation in spiral galaxies. the most importantadvantage of the new calibration in the 3.6 micron band, irac ch.1, isphotometric consistency across the entire sky. additional advantages areminimal obscuration, observations of flux dominated by old stars, andsensitivity to low surface brightness levels due to favorable backgrounds.through spitzer cycle 7 roughly 3000 galaxies had been observed and images ofthese are available at the spitzer archive. in cycle 8 a program called cosmicflows with spitzer has been initiated that will increase by 1274 the availablesample of spiral galaxies with inclinations greater than 45 degrees fromface-on suitable for distance measurements. this paper describes proceduresbased on the photometry package archangel that are being employed to analyzeboth the archival and the new data in a uniform way. we give results for 235galaxies, our calibrator sample for the tully-fisher relation. galaxymagnitudes are determined with uncertainties held below 0.05 mag for normalspiral systems. a subsequent paper will describe the calibration of the [3.6]luminosity-rotation relation.

1301.4833	calibration of the mid-infrared tully-fisher relation	distance measures on a coherent scale around the sky are required to addressthe outstanding cosmological problems of the hubble constant and of departuresfrom the mean cosmic flow. the correlation between galaxy luminosities androtation rates can be used to determine distances to many thousands of galaxiesin a wide range of environments potentially out to 200 mpc. mid-infrared (3.6microns) photometry with the spitzer space telescope is particularly valuableas the source of the luminosities because it provides products of uniformquality across the sky. from a perch above the atmosphere, essentially thetotal magnitude of targets can be registered in exposures of a few minutes.extinction is minimal and the flux is dominated by the light from old starswhich is expected to correlate with the mass of the targets.  in spite of the superior photometry, the correlation between mid-infraredluminosities and rotation rates extracted from neutral hydrogen profiles isslightly degraded from the correlation found with i band luminosities. a colorcorrection recovers a correlation that provides comparable accuracy to thatavailable at i band (~20% 1sigma in an individual distance) while retaining theadvantages identified above. without the color correction the relation betweenlinewidth and [3.6] magnitudes is m^{b,i,k,a}_{[3.6]} = -20.34 - 9.74 (logw_{mx}^{i} -2.5). this description is found with a sample of 213 galaxies in 13clusters that define the slope and 26 galaxies with cepheid or tip of the redgiant branch distances that define the zero point. a color corrected parameterm_{c_{[3.6]}} is constructed that has reduced scatter: m_{c_{[3.6]}} = -20.34 -9.13 (log w_{mx}^{i} -2.5). consideration of the 7 calibration clusters beyond50 mpc, outside the domain of obvious peculiar velocities, provides apreliminary hubble constant estimate of h_0=74+/-5 km/s/mpc.

1307.4297	the formation of the local group planes of galaxies	the confinement of most satellite galaxies in the local group to thin planespresents a challenge to the theory of hierarchical galaxy clustering. thepandas collaboration has identified a particularly thin configuration withkinematic coherence among companions of m31 and there have been long standingclaims that the dwarf companions to the milky way lie in a plane roughlyorthogonal to the disk of our galaxy. this discussion investigates the possibleorigins of four local group planes: the plane similar, but not identical tothat identified by pandas, an adjacent slightly tilted plane, and two planesnear the milky way: one with nearer galaxies and the other with more distantones. plausible orbits are found by using a combination of numerical actionmethods and a backward in time integration procedure. for m31, m33, ic10, andleoi, solutions are found that are consistent with measurements of their propermotions. for galaxies in planes, there must be commonalities in their propermotions, and this constraint greatly limits the number of physically plausiblesolutions. key to the formation of the planar structures has been theevacuation of the local void and consequent build-up of the local sheet, a wallof this void. most of the m31 companion galaxies were born in early-formingfilamentary or sheet-like substrata that chased m31 out of the void. m31 is amoving target because of its attraction toward the milky way, and the resulthas been alignments stretched toward our galaxy. in the case of theconfiguration around the milky way, it appears that our galaxy was in athree-way competition for companions with m31 and centaurus a. only thosewithin a modest band fell our way. the milky ways' attraction toward the virgocluster resulted in alignments along the milky way-virgo cluster line.

1311.2253	simulations of the local universe constrained by observational peculiar  velocities	peculiar velocities, obtained from direct distance measurements, are data ofchoice to achieve constrained simulations of the local universe reliable downto a scale of a few megaparsecs. unlike redshift surveys, peculiar velocitiesare direct tracers of the underlying gravitational field as they trace bothbaryonic and dark matter. this paper presents the first attempt to use solelyobservational peculiar velocities to constrain cosmological simulations of thenearby universe. in order to set up initial conditions, a reverse zel'dovichapproximation (rza) is used to displace constraints from their positions at z=0to their precursors' locations at higher redshifts. an additional new featurereplaces original observed radial peculiar velocity vectors by their full 3dreconstructions provided by the wiener-filter (wf) estimator. subsequently, theconstrained realization of gaussian fields technique (cr) is applied to buildvarious realizations of the initial conditions. the wf/rza/cr method is firsttested on realistic mock catalogs built from a reference simulation similar tothe local universe. these mocks include errors on peculiar velocities, ondata-point positions and a large continuous zone devoid of data in order tomimic galactic extinction. large scale structures are recovered with a typicalaccuracy of 5 megaparsecs/h in position, the best realizations reaching a 2-3mpc/h precision, the limit imposed by the rza linear theory. then, the methodis applied to the first observational radial peculiar velocity catalog of theproject cosmicflows. this paper is a proof of concept that the wf/rza/cr methodcan be applied to observational peculiar velocities to successfully buildconstrained initial conditions.

1409.0880	the laniakea supercluster of galaxies	galaxies congregate in clusters and along filaments, and are missing fromlarge regions referred to as voids. these structures are seen in maps derivedfrom spectroscopic surveys that reveal networks of structure that areinterconnected with no clear boundaries. extended regions with a highconcentration of galaxies are called 'superclusters', although this term is notprecise. there is, however, another way to analyse the structure. if thedistance to each galaxy from earth is directly measured, then the peculiarvelocity can be derived from the subtraction of the mean cosmic expansion, theproduct of distance times the hubble constant, from observed velocity. thepeculiar velocity is the line-of-sight departure from the cosmic expansion andarises from gravitational perturbations; a map of peculiar velocities can betranslated into a map of the distribution of matter. here we report a map ofstructure made using a catalogue of peculiar velocities. we find locationswhere peculiar velocity flows diverge, as water does at watershed divides, andwe trace the surface of divergent points that surrounds us. within the volumeenclosed by this surface, the motions of galaxies are inward after removal ofthe mean cosmic expansion and long range flows. we define a supercluster to bethe volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our homesupercluster, which we call laniakea. a key component of this paper is anaccompanying movie that can be viewed (also in 3d) and downloaded athttp://irfu.cea.fr/laniakea or http://vimeo.com/pomarede/laniakea

1411.1511	galaxy groups	galaxy groups can be characterized by the radius of decoupling from cosmicexpansion, the radius of the caustic of second turnaround, and the velocitydispersion of galaxies within this latter radius. these parameters can be achallenge to measure, especially for small groups with few members. in thisstudy, results are gathered pertaining to particularly well studied groups overfour decades in group mass. scaling relations anticipated from theory aredemonstrated and coefficients of the relationships are specified. there is anupdate of the relationship between light and mass for groups, confirming thatgroups with mass of a few times 10^12 msun are the most lit up while groupswith more and less mass are darker. it is demonstrated that there is aninteresting one-to-one correlation between the number of dwarf satellites in agroup and the group mass. there is the suggestion that small variations in theslope of the luminosity function in groups are caused by the degree ofdepletion of intermediate luminosity systems rather than variations in thenumber per unit mass of dwarfs. finally, returning to the characteristic radiiof groups, the ratio of first to second turnaround depends on the dark matterand dark energy content of the universe and a crude estimate can be made fromthe current observations of omega_matter ~ 0.15 in a flat topology, with a 68%probability of being less than 0.44.

1503.05422	cosmic bulk flow and the local motion from cosmicflows-2	full sky surveys of peculiar velocity are arguably the best way to map thelarge scale structure out to distances of a few times 100 mpc/h. using thelargest and most accurate ever catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities"cosmicflows-2", the large scale structure has been reconstructed by means ofthe wiener filter and constrained realizations assuming as a bayesian priormodel the lcdm model with the wmap inferred cosmological parameters. thepresent paper focuses on studying the bulk flow of the local flow field,defined as the mean velocity of top-hat spheres with radii ranging out to r=500mpc/h. the estimated large scale structures, in general, and the bulk flow, inparticular, are determined by the tension between the observational data andthe assumed prior model. a prerequisite for such an analysis is the requirementthat the estimated bulk flow is consistent with the prior model. such aconsistency is found here. at r=50(150) mpc/h the estimated bulk velocity is250+/-21 (239+/-38) km/s. the corresponding cosmic variance at these radii is126(60)km/s, which implies that these estimated bulk flows are dominated by thedata and not by the assumed prior model. the estimated bulk velocity isdominated by the data out to r~200 mpc/h, where the cosmic variance on theindividual supergalactic cartesian components (of the r.m.s. values) exceedsthe variance of the constrained realizations by at least a factor of 2. thesupergalactic sgx and sgy components of the cmb dipole velocity are recoveredby the wiener filter velocity field down to a very few km/s. the sgz componentof the estimated velocity, the one that is most affected by the zone ofavoidance, is off by 126 km/s (an almost 2 sigma discrepancy).

1503.05915	planes of satellite galaxies and the cosmic web	recent observational studies have demonstrated that the majority of satellitegalaxies tend to orbit their hosts on highly flattened, vast, possiblyco-rotating planes. two nearly parallel planes of satellites have beenconfirmed around the m31 galaxy and around the centaurus a galaxy, while themilky way also sports a plane of satellites. it has been argued that such analignment of satellites on vast planes is unexpected in the standard({\lambda}cdm) model of cosmology if not even in contradiction to its genericpredictions. guided by {\lambda}cdm numerical simulations, which suggest thatsatellites are channeled towards hosts along the axis of the slowest collapseas dictated by the ambient velocity shear tensor, we re-examine the planes oflocal satellites systems within the framework of the local shear tensor derivedfrom the cosmicflows-2 dataset. the analysis reveals that the local group andcentaurus a reside in a filament stretched by the virgo cluster and compressedby the expansion of the local void. four out of five thin planes of satellitegalaxies are indeed closely aligned with the axis of compression induced by thelocal void. being the less massive system, the moderate misalignment of themilky way's satellite plane can likely be ascribed to its greatersusceptibility to tidal torques, as suggested by numerical simulations. thealignment of satellite systems in the local universe with the ambient shearfield is thus in general agreement with predictions of the {\lambda}cdm model.

0805.1250	discovery of new dwarf galaxies in the m81 group	an order of magnitude more dwarf galaxies are expected to inhabit the localgroup, based on currently accepted galaxy formation models, than have beenobserved. this discrepancy has been noted in environments ranging from thefield to rich clusters. however, no complete census of dwarf galaxies exist inany environment. the discovery of the smallest and faintest dwarfs is hamperedby the limitations in detecting such faint and low surface brightness galaxies.an even greater difficulty is establishing distances to or group/clustermembership for such faint galaxies. the m81 group provides an almost uniqueopportunity for establishing membership for galaxies in a low density regioncomplete to magnitudes as faint as m_{r'} = -10. with a distance modulus of27.8, the tip of the red giant branch just resolves in ground-based surveys. wehave surveyed a 65 square degree region around m81 with the cfht/megacam. fromthese images we have detected 22 new dwarf galaxy candidates. photometric,morphological, and structural properties are presented for the candidates. thegroup luminosity function has a faint end slope characterized by the parameteralpha = -1.27+/-0.06. we discuss implications of this dwarf galaxy populationon cosmological models.

1505.07454	filaments from the galaxy distribution and from the velocity field in  the local universe	the cosmic web that characterizes the large-scale structure of the universecan be quantified by a variety of methods. for example, large redshift surveyscan be used in combination with point process algorithms to extract longcurvilinear filaments in the galaxy distribution. alternatively, given a full3d reconstruction of the velocity field, kinematic techniques can be used todecompose the web into voids, sheets, filaments and knots. in this paper welook at how two such algorithms - the bisous model and the velocity shear web -compare with each other in the local universe (within 100 mpc), finding goodagreement. this is both remarkable and comforting, given that the two methodsare radically different in ideology and applied to completely independent anddifferent data sets. unsurprisingly, the methods are in better agreement whenapplied to unbiased and complete data sets, like cosmological simulations, thanwhen applied to observational samples. we conclude that more observational datais needed to improve on these methods, but that both methods are most likelyproperly tracing the underlying distribution of matter in the universe.

1508.00015	the influence of galaxy surface brightness on the mass-metallicity  relation	we study the effect of surface brightness on the mass-metallicity relationusing nearby galaxies whose gas content and metallicity profiles are available.previous studies using fiber spectra indicated that lower surface brightnessgalaxies have systematically lower metallicity for their stellar mass, but theresults were uncertain because of aperture effect. with stellar masses andsurface brightnesses measured at wise w1 and w2 bands, we re-investigate thesurface brightness dependence with spatially-resolved metallicity profiles andfind the similar result. we further demonstrate that the systematicaldifference cannot be explained by the gas content of galaxies. for two galaxieswith similar stellar and gas masses, the one with lower surface brightnesstends to have lower metallicity. using chemical evolution models, weinvestigate the inflow and outflow properties of galaxies of different massesand surface brightnesses. we find that, on average, high mass galaxies havelower inflow and outflow rates relative to star formation rate. on the otherhand, lower surface brightness galaxies experience stronger inflow than highersurface brightness galaxies of similar mass. the surface brightness effect ismore significant for low mass galaxies. we discuss implications on thedifferent inflow properties between low and high surface brightness galaxies,including star formation efficiency, environment and mass assembly history.

1512.02236	the alignment of galaxy spin with the shear field in observations	tidal torque theory suggests that galaxies gain angular momentum in thelinear stage of structure formation. such a theory predicts alignments betweenthe spin of haloes and tidal shear field. however, non-linear evolution andangular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. in thispaper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic shear field from observed peculiarvelocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within $115\,\mathrm{mpc} $ ($\sim8000 \, {\mathrm {km}}{\mathrm s}^{-1}$) from 2mrscatalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes ofshear field. although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked atsimilar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments withvelocity-shear field. ellipticals in the 2mrs sample, show a statisticallysignificant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. ingeneral, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis ofgreatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression.spiral galaxies show no signal. such an alignment is significantly strengthenedwhen considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity fieldreconstruction. when examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axisof greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. this resultindicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairlynoisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strongenough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered -especially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.

astro-ph;0205060	the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function	we present and discuss optical measurements of the faint end of the galaxyluminosity function down to m_r = -10 in five different local environments ofvarying galaxy density and morphological content. the environments we studied,in order of decreasing galaxy density, are the virgo cluster, the ngc 1407group, the coma i group, the leo group and the ngc 1023 group. our results comefrom a deep wide-angle survey with the naoj subaru 8 m telescope on mauna keaand are sensitive down to very faint surface-brightness levels. galaxies wereidentified as group or cluster members on the basis of their surface brightnessand morphology. the faintest galaxies in our sample have r ~ 22.5. there werethousands of fainter galaxies but we cannot distinguish cluster members frombackground galaxies at these faint limits so do not attempt to determine aluminosity function fainter than m_r = -10.  in all cases, there are far fewer dwarfs than the numbers of low mass halosanticipated by cold dark matter theory. the mean logarithmic slope of theluminosity function between m_r = -18 and m_r = -10 is alpha ~ -1.2, farshallower than the cold dark matter mass function slope of alpha ~ -1.8. wewould therefore need to be missing about 90 per cent of the dwarfs at the faintend of our sample in all the environments we study to achieve consistency withcdm theory.

astro-ph;0312441	light to mass variations with environment	large and well defined variations exist between the distribution of mass andthe light of stars on extragalactic scales. mass concentrations in the range10^12 - 10^13 m_sun manifest the most light per unit mass. group halos in thisrange are typically the hosts of spiral and irregular galaxies with ongoingstar formation. on average m/l_b ~ 90 m_sun/l_sun in these groups . moremassive halos have less light per unit mass. within a given mass range, halosthat are dynamically old as measured by crossing times and galaxy morphologieshave distinctly less light per unit mass. at the other end of the massspectrum, below 10^12 m_sun, there is a cutoff in the manifestation of light.group halos in the range 10^11 - 10^12 m_sun can host dwarf galaxies but withsuch low luminosities that m/l_b values can range from several hundred toseveral thousand. it is suspected that there must be completely dark halos atlower masses. given the form of the halo mass function, it is the low relativeluminosities of the high mass halos that has the greatest cosmologicalimplications. of order half the clustered mass may reside in halos with greaterthan 10^14 m_sun. by contrast, only 5-10% of clustered mass would lie inentities with less than 10^12 m_sun.

0705.4139	our peculiar motion away from the local void	the peculiar velocity of the local group of galaxies manifested in the cosmicmicrowave background dipole is found to decompose into three dominantcomponents. the three components are clearly separated because they arise ondistinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in theirinfluences. the nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at~7 mpc, arises from the evacuation of the local void. we lie in the local sheetthat bounds the void. random motions within the local sheet are small. ourgalaxy participates in the bulk motion of the local sheet away from the localvoid. the component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to thevirgo cluster and its surroundings, 17 mpc away. the third and largestcomponent is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered nearthe direction of the centaurus cluster. the amplitudes of the three componentsare 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s inthe reference frame of the local sheet. taking the nearby influences intoaccount causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observedconcentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motionattributed to their pull. on small scales, in addition to the motion of ourlocal sheet away from the local void, the nearest adjacent filament, the leospur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence withour filament. finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the localvoid reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away fromthe void center. given the velocities expected from gravitational instabilitytheory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of thelocal void must be at least 23 mpc from our position. the local void is large!

astro-ph;0512321	mapping large-scale structures behind the galactic plane: the second  ciza subsample	we present the latest results of the clusters in the zone of avoidance (ciza)survey, which is mapping the large-scale matter distribution behind the milkyway by performing the first systematic search for x-ray luminous galaxyclusters at low galactic latitudes. the survey's approach, which uses x-rayemission to locate cluster candidates, overcomes the problems faced byoptically selected cluster surveys which have traditionally avoided this regionof the sky due to the severe extinction present along the galactic plane. wehere present the second flux-limited ciza cluster catalog containing 60 x-rayluminous galaxy clusters, 88% of which are new discoveries. we also examine thedegree to which known superclusters extend into the zone of avoidance andhighlight newly discovered structures which have previously gone unnoticed. weshow that the survey has found far fewer rich clusters in the great attractorregion than would be expected given the region's proposed mass. instead, wefind a significant increase in the number of clusters behind the greatattractor, with the most notable being an association of clusters near theshapley supercluster. we propose these clusters trace an extension of thelarge-scale filament network in which the shapley concentration is embedded. wealso highlight an association of clusters near the galactic anticenter, whichis the first supercluster found to be completely hidden by the milky way. ourfinding of a less massive great attractor and the detection of significantstructures behind the complex supports studies which suggest the motion ofnearby galaxies, including that of the local group, is due, in part, to alarge-scale bulk flow which is induced by overdensities beyond the greatattractor region.

astro-ph;0603792	dwarf galaxies in the dynamically evolved ngc 1407 group	the ngc 1407 group stands out among nearby structures by its properties thatsuggest it is massive and evolved. it shares properties with entities that havebeen called fossil groups: the 1.4 magnitude differential between the dominantelliptical galaxy and the second brightest galaxy comes close to satisfying thedefinition that has been used to define the fossil class. there are fewintermediate luminosity galaxies, but a large number of dwarfs in the group. weestimate there are 250 group members to the depth of our survey. the slope ofthe faint end of the luminosity function (reaching m_r = -12) is alpha = -1.35.velocities for 35 galaxies demonstrate that this group with one dominant galaxyhas a mass of 7 x 10^13 m_sun and m/l_r = 340. two galaxies in close proximityto ngc 1407 have very large blueshifts. the most notable is the secondbrightest galaxy, ngc 1400, with a velocity of -1072 km/s with respect to thegroup mean. we report the detection of x-ray emission from this galaxy and fromthe group.

astro-ph;0701518	tip of the red giant branch distances. ii. zero-point calibration	the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch (trgb) provides anexcellent measure of galaxy distances and is easily determined in the resolvedimages of nearby galaxies observed with hubble space telescope. there is now alarge amount of archival data relevant to the trgb methodology and which offerscomparisons with other distance estimators. zero-point issues related to thetrgb distance scale are reviewed in this paper. consideration is given to themetallicity dependence of the trgb, the transformations between hst flightsystems and johnson-cousins photometry, the absolute magnitude scale based onhorizontal branch measurements, and the effects of reddening. the zero-point ofthe trgb is established with a statistical accuracy of 1%, modulo theuncertainty in the magnitude of the horizontal branch, with a typical rmsuncertainty of 3% in individual galaxy distances at high galactic latitude. thezero-point is consistent with the cepheids period-luminosity relation scale butinvites reconsideration of the claimed metallicity dependence with that method.the maser distance to ngc 4258 is consistent with trgb but presently has loweraccuracy.

astro-ph;9506144	action principle solutions for galaxy motions within 3000 km/s	the numerical action variational principle is used to find fully nonlinearsolutions for the orbits of the mass tracers given their present redshifts andangular positions and the cosmological boundary condition that the peculiarvelocities are small at high redshift. a solution predicts the distances of themass tracers, and is tested by a comparison with measured distances. thecurrent numerical results use 289 luminosity-linewidth distance measurementsdesigned to be close to unbiased. a catalog of 1138 tracers approximates theluminosity distribution of galaxies in the vicinity of the local supercluster,at redshifts cz &lt; 3000 km/s. these mass tracers include groups with crossingtimes less than the hubble time and isolated galaxies. the measure of merit ofa solution is the sum of the mean square differences between the predicted andobserved distance moduli. in the 3000 km/s sample, this reduced $\chi^2$statistic has a well-defined minimum value at m/l=175 and $t_0 = 10.0$ gyr, and$\chi^2$ at the minimum is about 1.29 times the value expected from just thestandard deviation of the distance measurements. we have tested for the effectof the mass at greater distance by using the positions of abell clusters as amodel for the large-scale mass distribution. this external mass model reducesthe minimum value of $\chi^2$ by about 10\% ($\sim 1 \sigma$). the value of thecosmological density parameter $\omega_0$ is determined by the global meanmass-to-light ratio. our preliminary analysis yields $\omega_0= 0.17 \pm 0.10$at one standard deviation. a tighter bound is expected to come out of a largersample of measured distances now available.

astro-ph;9703029	the ursa major cluster of galaxies. ii. bimodality of the distribution  of central surface brightnesses	the ursa major cluster appears to be unevolved and made up of hi-rich spiralgalaxies. b,r,i,k' photometry has been obtained for 79 galaxies, including 62in a complete sample with m(b)&lt;-16.5 mag. the k' information is particularlyimportant for the present discussion because it is not seriously affected byobscuration. there is reasonably convincing evidence that the distribution ofexponential disk central surface brightnesses is bimodal. disks avoid thedomain between the high and low surface brightness zones. the few intermediatesurface brightness examples in the sample all have significant nearbyneighbors. the high surface brightness (hsb) galaxies exhibit a range-21&lt;m(b)&lt;-17 while the low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies are found with-19&lt;m(b) down to the completion limit. hsb and lsb galaxies in the overlapregime -19&lt;m(b)&lt;-17 that are indistinguishable in luminosity-line width plotshave very distinct locations in surface brightness-scale length plots. theexistence of separate hsb and lsb families suggests that there are discreteradial configurations that are stable. galaxies are driven into one of theseregimes. the hsb state has a lower luminosity cutoff. it is likely that the hsbgalaxies are dominated by dissipational matter at their centers while the lsbgalaxies are dark matter dominated. the hsb family subdivides into those with,and without, substantial bulges. evidently, there are two thresholds probablycontrolled by angular momentum content or transfer. passing from high to lowspecific angular momentum, there is first the transition from lsb to hsbregimes, then the transition from exponential disk to disk plus bulge regimes.

astro-ph;9802026	the cosmological parameters h_0 and omega_0	the first section discusses a recalibration of the luminosity-linewidthtechnique and its use in a determination of h_0. the recalibration introduces(i) new cluster calibration data, (ii) new corrections for reddening as afunction of inclination, and (iii) a new zero-point calibration using 13galaxies with distances determined via the cepheid period-luminosity method. itis found that h_0=82+/-16 km/s/mpc (95% confidence). the second sectionconcerns a dynamic measurement of omega_0. the non-linear least action methodcan be used to reconstruct the orbits galaxies have followed to reach theircurrent positions. the three free parameters of the models are m/l, age of theuniverse, and a measure of the possible extended nature of dark halos comparedwith the distribution of light. models are constrained by 900 observeddistances. best chi^2 fits are for models with m/l values consistent withomega_0=0.25+/-0.2. the concept of `antibiasing' is introduced in an attempt toreconcile this low estimate of omega_0 with the results from linear analyses.it is argued that m/l values in elliptical-rich regions are a factor of 7larger than those in spiral-rich regions. hence, whereas it is commonly thoughtthat there is the bias that mass is more extended than light, there may be acosmologically important regime where there is the antibias of mass moreconcentrated than light. this possibility makes the inferrance of omega_0 frombeta unclear.

astro-ph;9802247	global extinction in spiral galaxies	magnitude-limited samples of spiral galaxies drawn from the ursa major andpisces clusters are used to determine their extinction properties as a functionof inclination. imaging photometry is available for 87 spirals in b,r,i and k'bands. extinction causes systematic scatter in color-magnitude plots. a strongluminosity dependence is found. relative edge-on to face-on extinction of up to1.7 mag is found at b for the most luminous galaxies but is unmeasurably smallfor faint galaxies. at r the differential absorption with inclination reaches1.3 mag, at i it reaches 1.0 mag, and at k' the differential absorption can inthe extreme be as great as 0.3 mag.  the luminosity dependence of reddening can be translated into a dependence onrotation rate which is a distance-independent observable. hence, correctionscan be made that are useful for distance measurements. the strong dependence ofthe corrections on luminosity act to steepen luminosity-linewidth correlations.the effect is greatest toward the blue, with the consequence thatluminosity-linewidth slope dependencies are now only weakly a function ofcolor.

astro-ph;9911052	distances to galaxies from the correlation between luminosities and  linewidths. iii. cluster template and global measurements of h0	the correlation between the luminosities and rotation velocities of galaxiescan be used to estimate distances to late-type galaxies. it is an appropriatemoment to re-evaluate this method given the great deal of new informationavailable. the major improvements described here include: (a) the templaterelations can now be defined by large, complete samples, (b) the samples aredrawn from a wide range of environments, (c) the relations are defined byphotometric information at b,r,i and k' bands, (d) the multi-band informationclarifies problems associated with internal reddening, (e) the templatezero-points are defined by 24 galaxies with accurately known distances, and (f)the relations are applied to 12 clusters scattered across the sky and out tovelocities of 8,000 km/s. the biggest change from earlier calibrations areassociated with point (e). roughly a 15% increase in the distance scale hascome about with the five-fold increase in the number of zero-point calibrators.the overall increase in the distance scale from the luminosity--linewidthmethodology is about 10% after consideration of all factors. modulo an assumeddistance to the large magellanic cloud of 50 kpc and no metallicity correctionsto the cepheid calibration, the resulting value of the hubble constant is h0 =77 +- 8 km/s/mpc where the error is the 95% probable statistical error.cummulative systematic errors internal to this analysis should not exceed 10%.uncertainties in the distance scale ladder external to this analysis areestimated at 10%. if the cepheid calibration is shifted from the lmc to ngc4258 with a distance established by observations of circum-nuclear masers thenh0 is larger by 12%.

0810.3658	cosmic flow from 2mass redshift survey: the origin of cmb dipole and  implications for lcdm cosmology	we generate the peculiar velocity field for the 2mass redshift survey (2mrs)catalog using an orbit-reconstruction algorithm. the reconstructed velocitiesof individual objects in 2mrs are well-correlated with the peculiar velocitiesobtained from high-precision observed distances within 3,000 km/s. we estimatethe mean matter density to be 0.31 +/- 0.05 by comparing observed toreconstructed velocities in this volume. the reconstructed motion of the localgroup in the rest frame established by distances within 3,000 km/s agrees withthe observed motion and is generated by fluctuations within this volume, inagreement with observations. then, we reconstruct the velocity field of 2mrs insuccessively larger radii, to study the problem of convergence towards the cmbdipole. we find that less than half of the amplitude of the cmb dipole isgenerated within a volume enclosing the hydra-centaurus-norma supercluster ataround 40 mpc/h. although most of the amplitude of the cmb dipole seems to berecovered by 120 mpc/h, the direction does not agree and hence we observe noconvergence up to this scale.  we develop a statistical model which allows us to estimate cosmological parameters from the reconstructed growth of convergence of the velocity of thelocal group towards the cmb dipole motion. for scales up to 60 mpc/h, assuminga local group velocity of 627 km/s, we estimate omega_m h^2 = 0.11 +/- 0.06 andsigma_8=0.9 +/- 0.4, in agreement with wmap5 measurements at the 1-sigma level.however, for scales up to 100 mpc/h, we obtain omega_m h^2 = 0.08 +/- 0.03 andsigma_8=1.0 +/- 0.4, which agrees at the 1 to 2-sigma level with wmap5 results.(abridged)

0810.5530	bulge-disk decompositions and structural bimodality of ursa major  cluster spiral galaxies	we present bulge and disk (b/d) decompositions of existing k'-band surfacebrightness profiles for 65 ursa major cluster spiral galaxies. this improvesupon the disk-only fits of tully et al. (1996). the 1996 disk fits were used bytully &amp; verheijen (1997) for their discovery of the bimodality of structuralparameters in the uma cluster galaxies. it is shown that our new 1d b/ddecompositions yield disk structural parameters that differ only slightly fromthe basic fits of tully et al. and evidence for structural bimodality of umagalaxies is maintained. our b/d software for the decomposition of 1d surfacebrightness profiles of galaxies uses a non-linear minimization scheme torecover the best fitting sersic bulge and exponential disk while accounting forthe possible presence of a compact nucleus and spiral arms and for the effectsof seeing and disk truncations. in agreement with tully &amp; verheijen, we findthat the distribution of near-infrared disk central surface brightnesses isbimodal with an f-test confidence of 80%. there is also strong evidence for alocal minimum in the luminosity function at m_k' ~ -22. a connection betweenthe brightness bimodality and a dynamical bimodality, based on new hi linewidths, is identified. the b/d parameters are presented in an appendix.
