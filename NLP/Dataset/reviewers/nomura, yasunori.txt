hep-th;0302192	explicit supersymmetry breaking on boundaries of warped extra dimensions	explicit supersymmetry breaking is studied in higher dimensional theories byhaving boundaries respect only a subgroup of the bulk symmetry. if the boundarysymmetry is the maximal subgroup allowed by the boundary conditions imposed onthe fields, then the symmetry can be consistently gauged; otherwise gaugingleads to an inconsistent theory. in a warped fifth dimension, an explicitbreaking of all bulk supersymmetries by the boundaries is found to beinconsistent with gauging; unlike the case of flat 5d, complete supersymmetrybreaking by boundary conditions is not consistent with supergravity. despitethis result, the low energy effective theory resulting from boundarysupersymmetry breaking becomes consistent in the limit where gravity decouples,and such models are explored in the hope that some way of successfullyincorporating gravity can be found. a warped constrained standard model leadsto a theory with one higgs boson with mass expected close to the experimentallimit. a unified theory in a warped fifth dimension is studied with boundarybreaking of both su(5) gauge symmetry and supersymmetry. the usualsupersymmetric prediction for gauge coupling unification holds even though thetev spectrum is quite unlike the mssm. such a theory may unify matter and higgsin the same su(5) hypermultiplet.

0901.2926	dark matter signals from cascade annihilations	a leading interpretation of the electron/positron excesses seen by pamela andatic is dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo. depending on theannihilation channel, the electron/positron signal could be accompanied by agalactic gamma ray or neutrino flux, and the non-detection of such fluxesconstrains the couplings and halo properties of dark matter. in this paper, westudy the interplay of electron data with gamma ray and neutrino constraints inthe context of cascade annihilation models, where dark matter annihilates intolight degrees of freedom which in turn decay into leptons in one or more steps.electron and muon cascades give a reasonable fit to the pamela and atic data.compared to direct annihilation, cascade annihilations can soften gamma rayconstraints from final state radiation by an order of magnitude. however, ifdark matter annihilates primarily into muons, the neutrino constraints arerobust regardless of the number of cascade decay steps. we also examine theelectron data and gamma ray/neutrino constraints on the recently proposed"axion portal" scenario.

0910.2235	a finely-predicted higgs boson mass from a finely-tuned weak scale	if supersymmetry is broken directly to the standard model at energies notvery far from the unified scale, the higgs boson mass lies in the range 128-141gev. the end points of this range are tightly determined. theories with thehiggs boson dominantly in a single supermultiplet predict a mass at the upperedge, (141 \pm 2) gev, with the uncertainty dominated by the experimentalerrors on the top quark mass and the qcd coupling. this edge prediction isremarkably insensitive to the supersymmetry breaking scale and tosupersymmetric threshold corrections so that, in a wide class of theories, thetheoretical uncertainties are at the level of \pm 0.4 gev. a reduction in theuncertainties from the top quark mass and qcd coupling to the level of \pm 0.3gev may be possible at future colliders, increasing the accuracy of theconfrontation with theory from 1.4% to 0.4%. verification of this predictionwould provide strong evidence for supersymmetry, broken at a very high scale of~ 10^{14 \pm 2} gev, and also for a higgs boson that is elementary up to thishigh scale, implying fine-tuning of the higgs mass parameter by ~ 20-28 ordersof magnitude. currently, the only known explanation for such fine-tuning is themultiverse.

0912.3942	environmentally selected wimp dark matter with high-scale supersymmetry  breaking	we explore the possibility that both the weak scale and the thermal relicdark matter abundance are environmentally selected in a multiverse. anunderlying supersymmetric theory containing the states of the mssm andsinglets, with supersymmetry and r symmetry broken at unified scales, has justtwo realistic low energy effective theories. one theory, (sm + \tilde{w}), isthe standard model augmented only by the wino, having a mass near 3 tev, andhas a higgs boson mass in the range of (127 - 142) gev. the other theory, (sm +\tilde{h}/\tilde{s}), has higgsinos and a singlino added to the standard model.the higgs boson mass depends on the single new yukawa coupling of the theory,y, and is near 141 gev for small y but grows to be as large as 210 gev as thisnew coupling approaches strong coupling at high energies. much of the parameterspace of this theory will be probed by direct detection searches for darkmatter that push two orders of magnitude below the present bounds; furthermore,the dark matter mass and cross section on nucleons are correlated with thehiggs boson mass. the indirect detection signal of monochromatic photons fromthe galactic center is computed, and the range of parameters that may beaccessible to lhc searches for trilepton events is explored. taking a broaderview, allowing the possibility of r symmetry protection to the tev scale oraxion dark matter, we find four more theories: (sm + axion), two versions ofsplit supersymmetry, and the e-mssm, where a little supersymmetric hierarchy ispredicted. the special higgs mass value of (141 \pm 2) gev appears in symmetrylimits of three of the six theories, (sm + axion), (sm + \tilde{w}) and (sm +\tilde{h}/\tilde{s}), motivating a comparison of other signals of these threetheories.

1004.4637	a definitive signal of multiple supersymmetry breaking	if the lightest observable-sector supersymmetric particle (losp) is chargedand long-lived, then it may be possible to indirectly measure the planck massat the lhc and provide a spectacular confirmation of supergravity as a symmetryof nature. unfortunately, this proposal is only feasible if the gravitino isheavy enough to be measured at colliders, and this condition is in directconflict with constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn). in this work, weshow that the bbn bound can be naturally evaded in the presence of multiplesectors which independently break supersymmetry, since there is a new decaychannel of the losp to a goldstino. certain regions of parameter space allowfor a direct measurement of losp decays into both the goldstino and thegravitino at the lhc. if the goldstino/gravitino mass ratio is measured to be2, as suggested by theory, then this would provide dramatic verification of theexistence of multiple supersymmetry breaking and sequestering. a variety ofconsistent cosmological scenarios are obtained within this framework. inparticular, if an r symmetry is imposed, then the gauge-gaugino-goldstinointeraction vertices can be forbidden. in this case, there is no bound on thereheating temperature from goldstino overproduction, and thermal leptogenesiscan be accommodated consistently with gravitino dark matter.

1008.5153	singlet portal to the hidden sector	ultraviolet physics typically induces a kinetic mixing between gauge singletswhich is marginal and hence non-decoupling in the infrared. in singletextensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, e.g. thenext-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model, this furnishes a well motivatedand distinctive portal connecting the visible sector to any hidden sector whichcontains a singlet chiral superfield. in the presence of singlet kineticmixing, the hidden sector automatically acquires a light mass scale in therange 0.1 - 100 gev induced by electroweak symmetry breaking. in theories withr-parity conservation, superparticles produced at the lhc invariably cascadedecay into hidden sector particles. since the hidden sector singlet couples tothe visible sector via the higgs sector, these cascades necessarily produce ahiggs boson in an order 0.01 - 1 fraction of events. furthermore,supersymmetric cascades typically produce highly boosted, low-mass hiddensector singlets decaying visibly, albeit with displacement, into the heavieststandard model particles which are kinematically accessible. we studyexperimental constraints on this broad class of theories, as well as the roleof singlet kinetic mixing in direct detection of hidden sector dark matter. wealso present related theories in which a hidden sector singlet interacts withthe visible sector through kinetic mixing with right-handed neutrinos.

1104.2324	physical theories, eternal inflation, and quantum universe	we present a framework in which well-defined predictions are obtained in aneternally inflating multiverse, based on the principles of quantum mechanics.we show that the entire multiverse is described purely from the viewpoint of asingle "observer," who describes the world as a quantum state defined onhis/her past light cones bounded by the (stretched) apparent horizons. we findthat quantum mechanics plays an essential role in regulating infinities. theframework is "gauge invariant," i.e. predictions do not depend on how spacetimeis parametrized, as it should be in a theory of quantum gravity. our frameworkprovides a fully unified treatment of quantum measurement processes and themultiverse. we conclude that the eternally inflating multiverse and many worldsin quantum mechanics are the same. other important implications include: globalspacetime can be viewed as a derived concept; the multiverse is a transientphenomenon during the world relaxing into a supersymmetric minkowski state. wealso present a theory of "initial conditions" for the multiverse. byextrapolating our framework to the extreme, we arrive at a picture that theentire multiverse is a fluctuation in the stationary, fractal"mega-multiverse," in which an infinite sequence of multiverse productionsoccurs. the framework discussed here does not suffer from problems/paradoxesplaguing other measures proposed earlier, such as the youngness paradox, theboltzmann brain problem, and a peculiar "end" of time.

1110.4630	quantum mechanics, spacetime locality, and gravity	quantum mechanics introduces the concept of probability at the fundamentallevel, yielding the measurement problem. on the other hand, recent progress incosmology has led to the "multiverse" picture, in which our observed universeis only one of the many, bringing an apparent arbitrariness in definingprobabilities, called the measure problem.  in this paper, we discuss how these two problems are intimately related witheach other, developing a complete picture for quantum measurement andcosmological histories in the quantum mechanical universe. on one hand, quantummechanics eliminates the arbitrariness of defining probabilities in themultiverse, as discussed in arxiv:1104.2324. on the other hand, the multiverseallows for understanding why we observe an ordered world obeying consistentlaws of physics, by providing an infinite-dimensional hilbert space. thisresults in the irreversibility of quantum measurement, despite the fact thatthe evolution of the multiverse state is unitary.  in order to describe the cosmological dynamics correctly, we need to identifythe structure of the hilbert space for a system with gravity. we argue that inorder to keep spacetime locality, the hilbert space for dynamical spacetimemust be defined only in restricted spacetime regions: in and on the (stretched)apparent horizon as viewed from a fixed reference frame. this requirementarises from eliminating all the redundancies and overcountings in a generalrelativistic, global spacetime description of nature. it is responsible forhorizon complementarity as well as the "observer dependence" ofhorizons/spacetime---these phenomena arise to represent changes of thereference frame in the relevant hilbert space. this can be viewed as anextension of the poincare transformation in the quantum gravitational context,as the lorentz transformation is viewed as an extension of the galileantransformation.

1111.4519	spread supersymmetry	in the multiverse the scale of susy breaking, \tilde{m} = f_x/m_*, may scanand environmental constraints on the dark matter density may exclude a largerange of \tilde{m} from the reheating temperature after inflation down tovalues that yield a lsp mass of order a tev. after selection effects, thedistribution for \tilde{m} may prefer larger values. a single environmentalconstraint from dark matter can then lead to multi-component dark matter,including both axions and the lsp, giving a tev-scale lsp lighter than thecorresponding value for single-component lsp dark matter.  if susy breaking is mediated to the sm sector at order x^* x, only squarks,sleptons and one higgs doublet acquire masses of order \tilde{m}. the gravitinomass is lighter by a factor of m_*/m_pl and the gaugino masses are suppressedby a further loop factor. this spread susy spectrum has two versions; thehiggsino masses are generated in one from supergravity giving a wino lsp and inthe other radiatively giving a higgsino lsp. the environmental restriction ondark matter fixes the lsp mass to the tev domain, so that the squark andslepton masses are order 10^3 tev and 10^6 tev in these two schemes. we studythe spectrum, dark matter and collider signals of these two versions of spreadsusy. the higgs is sm-like and lighter than 145 gev; monochromatic photons incosmic rays arise from dark matter annihilations in the halo; exotic shortcharged tracks occur at the lhc, at least for the wino lsp; and there are theeventual possibilities of direct detection of dark matter and detailedexploration of the tev-scale states at a future linear collider. gauge couplingunification is as in minimal susy theories.  if susy breaking is mediated at order x, a much less hierarchical spectrumresults---similar to that of the mssm, but with the superpartner masses 1--2orders of magnitude larger than in natural theories.

1112.3043	higgs descendants	we define a higgs descendant $\chi$ to be a particle beyond the standardmodel whose mass arises predominantly from the vacuum expectation value of thehiggs boson. higgs descendants arise naturally from new physics whose intrinsicmass scale is unrelated to the electroweak scale. the coupling of $\chi$ to thehiggs boson is fixed by the mass and spin of $\chi$, yielding a highlypredictive setup in which there may be substantial modifications to theproperties of the higgs boson. for example, if the decay of the higgs boson to$\chi$ is kinematically allowed, then this branching ratio is largelydetermined. depending on the stability of $\chi$, higgs decays may result in avariety of possible visible or invisible final states. alternatively, loops of$\chi$ may affect higgs boson production or its decays to standard modelparticles. if $\chi$ is stable dark matter, then the mandatory coupling between$\chi$ and the higgs boson gives a lower bound on the direct detection crosssection as a function of the $\chi$ mass. we also present a number of explicitmodels which are examples of higgs descendants. finally, we comment on higgsdescendants in the context of the excesses near 125 gev recently observed atatlas and cms.

1202.6339	supersymmetry with light stops	recent lhc data, together with the electroweak naturalness argument, suggestthat the top squarks may be significantly lighter than the other sfermions. wepresent supersymmetric models in which such a split spectrum is obtainedthrough "geometries": being "close to" electroweak symmetry breaking impliesbeing "away from" supersymmetry breaking, and vice versa. in particular, wepresent models in 5d warped spacetime, in which supersymmetry breaking andhiggs fields are located on the ultraviolet and infrared branes, respectively,and the top multiplets are localized to the infrared brane. the hierarchy ofthe yukawa matrices can be obtained while keeping near flavor degeneracybetween the first two generation sfermions, avoiding stringent constraints fromflavor and cp violation. through the ads/cft correspondence, the models can beinterpreted as purely 4d theories in which the top and higgs multiplets arecomposites of some strongly interacting sector exhibiting nontrivial dynamicsat a low energy. because of the compositeness of the higgs and top multiplets,landau pole constraints for the higgs and top couplings apply only up to thedynamical scale, allowing for a relatively heavy higgs boson, including m_h =125 gev as suggested by the recent lhc data. we analyze electroweak symmetrybreaking for a well-motivated subset of these models, and find that fine-tuningin electroweak symmetry breaking is indeed ameliorated. we also discuss a flatspace realization of the scenario in which supersymmetry is broken by boundaryconditions, with the top multiplets localized to a brane while other mattermultiplets delocalized in the bulk.

1203.6876	what can the observation of nonzero curvature tell us?	the eternally inflating multiverse provides a consistent framework tounderstand coincidences and fine-tuning in the universe. as such, it providesthe possibility of finding another coincidence: if the amount of slow-rollinflation was only slightly more than the anthropic threshold, then spatialcurvature might be measurable. we study this issue in detail, particularlyfocusing on the question: "if future observations reveal nonzero curvature,what can we conclude?" we find that whether an observable signal arises or notdepends crucially on three issues: the cosmic history just before theobservable inflation, the measure adopted to define probabilities, and thenature of the correlation between the tunneling and slow-roll parts of thepotential. we find that if future measurements find positive curvature at\omega_k &lt; -10^-4, then the framework of the eternally inflating multiverse isexcluded with high significance. if the measurements instead reveal negativecurvature at \omega_k &gt; 10^-4, then we can conclude (1) diffusive (new orchaotic) eternal inflation did not occur in our immediate past; (2) ouruniverse was born by a bubble nucleation; (3) the probability measure does notreward volume increase; and (4) the origin of the observed slow-roll inflationis an accidental feature of the potential, not due to a theoretical mechanism.discovery of \omega_k &gt; 10^-4 would also give us nontrivial information aboutthe correlation between tunneling and slow-roll; e.g. a strong correlationfavoring large n would be excluded in certain measures. we also ask whether thecurrent constraint on \omega_k is consistent with multiverse expectations,finding that the answer is yes, except for certain cases. in the course of thiswork we were led to consider vacuum decay branching ratios, and found that itis more likely than one might guess that the decays are dominated by a singlechannel.

1210.2395	spread supersymmetry with wino lsp: gluino and dark matter signals	the discovery of a higgs boson near 125 gev, together with the absence of lhcsignals for supersymmetry or direct detection signals of dark matter, motivatefurther study of a particular theory of split supersymmetry. in arguably thetheoretically simplest implementation of split, the superpartner spectrum isspread over several decades. the squarks and sleptons are heavier than thegravitino and higgsinos by a factor m_pl/m_*, where m_* is the mediation scaleof supersymmetry breaking and is high, between unified and planck scales. onthe other hand the gaugino masses are 1-loop smaller than the gravitino andhiggsino masses, arising from both anomaly mediation and a higgsino loop. winodark matter arises from three sources: gravitino production by scattering athigh temperatures, gravitino production from squark decays, and thermalfreeze-out. for reheating temperatures larger than the squark mass, theseconspire to require that the squarks are lighter than about 10^4 tev, whilecollider limits on gaugino masses require squarks to be heavier than about 100tev. whether winos constitute all or just a fraction of the dark matter, alarge fraction of the allowed parameter space has the gluino within reach ofthe lhc with 0.1 mm &lt; c\tau_{\~g} &lt; 10 cm, leading to displaced vertices. inaddition, events with cascades via \~w^+- lead to disappearing charged trackswith c\tau_{\~w^+-} \sim 10 cm. the squarks and sleptons are predicted to bejust heavy enough to solve the supersymmetric flavor and cp problems. thusgluino decay modes may typically violate flavor and involve heavy quarks:[\bar{t}(t,c,u)+\bar{b}(b,s,d)] \~w^0 and[\bar{t}(b,s,d)+(\bar{t},\bar{c},\bar{u})b] \~w^+-. the electron electricdipole moment is expected to be of order 10^-29 ecm, two orders of magnitudebelow the current limit. the ams-02 search for cosmic ray antiprotons willprobe an interesting region of parameter space.

1210.6348	black holes, information, and hilbert space for quantum gravity	a coarse-grained description for the formation and evaporation of a blackhole is given within the framework of a unitary theory of quantum gravitypreserving locality, without dropping the information that manifests asmacroscopic properties of the state at late times. the resulting picturedepends strongly on the reference frame one chooses to describe the process. inone description based on a reference frame in which the reference point staysoutside the black hole horizon for sufficiently long time, a late black holestate becomes a superposition of black holes in different locations and withdifferent spins, even if the back hole is formed from collapsing matter thathad a well-defined classical configuration with no angular momentum. theinformation about the initial state is partly encoded in relativecoefficients---especially phases---of the terms representing macroscopicallydifferent geometries. in another description in which the reference pointenters into the black hole horizon at late times, an s-matrix description inthe asymptotically minkowski spacetime is not applicable, but it sill allowsfor an "s-matrix" description in the full quantum gravitational hilbert spaceincluding singularity states. relations between different descriptions aregiven by unitary transformations acting on the full hilbert space, and they ingeneral involve superpositions of "distant" and "infalling" descriptions.despite the intrinsically quantum mechanical nature of the black hole state,measurements performed by a classical physical observer are consistent withthose implied by general relativity. in particular, the recently-consideredfirewall phenomenon can occur only for an exponentially fine-tuned (andintrinsically quantum mechanical) initial state, analogous to an entropydecreasing process in a system with large degrees of freedom.

0712.2454	evidence for the multiverse in the standard model and beyond	in any theory it is unnatural if the observed parameters lie very close tospecial values that determine the existence of complex structures necessary forobservers. a naturalness probability, p, is introduced to numerically evaluatethe unnaturalness. if p is small in all known theories, there is an observernaturalness problem. in addition to the well-known case of the cosmologicalconstant, we argue that nuclear stability and electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb) represent significant observer naturalness problems. the naturalnessprobability associated with nuclear stability is conservatively estimated asp_nuc &lt; 10^{-(3-2)}, and for simple ewsb theories p_ewsb &lt; 10^{-(2-1)}. thispattern of unnaturalness in three different arenas, cosmology, nuclear physics,and ewsb, provides evidence for the multiverse. in the nuclear case the problemis largely solved even with a flat multiverse distribution, and with nontrivialdistributions it is possible to understand both the proximity to neutronstability and the values of m_e and m_d - m_u in terms of the electromagneticcontribution to the proton mass. it is reasonable that multiverse distributionsare strong functions of lagrangian parameters due to their dependence onvarious factors. in any ewsb theory, strongly varying distributions typicallylead to a little or large hierarchy, and in certain multiverses the size of thelittle hierarchy is enhanced by a loop factor. since the correct theory of ewsbis unknown, our estimate for p_ewsb is theoretical. the lhc will determinep_ewsb more robustly, which may remove or strengthen the observer naturalnessproblem of ewsb. for each of the three arenas, the discovery of a naturaltheory would eliminate the evidence for the multiverse; but in the absence ofsuch a theory, the multiverse provides a provisional understanding of the data.

1304.0448	low energy description of quantum gravity and complementarity	we consider a framework in which low energy dynamics of quantum gravity isdescribed preserving locality, and yet taking into account the effects that arenot captured by the naive global spacetime picture, e.g. those associated withblack hole complementarity. our framework employs a "special relativistic"description of gravity; specifically, gravity is treated as a force measured bythe observer tied to the coordinate system associated with a freely fallinglocal lorentz frame. we identify, in simple cases, regions of spacetime inwhich low energy local descriptions are applicable as viewed from the freelyfalling frame; in particular, we identify a surface called the gravitationalobserver horizon on which the local proper acceleration measured in theobserver's coordinates becomes the cutoff (string) scale. this allows forseparating between the "low-energy" local physics and "trans-planckian"intrinsically quantum gravitational (stringy) physics, and allows fordeveloping physical pictures of the origins of various effects. we explore thestructure of the hilbert space in which the proposed scheme is realized in asimple manner, and classify its elements according to certain horizons theypossess. we also discuss implications of our framework on the firewall problem.we conjecture that the complementarity picture may persist due to properties oftrans-planckian physics.

1308.4121	black holes or firewalls: a theory of horizons	we present a quantum theory of black hole (and other) horizons, in which thestandard assumptions of complementarity are preserved without contradictinginformation theoretic considerations. after the scrambling time, the quantummechanical structure of a black hole becomes that of an eternal black hole atthe microscopic level. in particular, the stretched horizon degrees of freedomand the states entangled with them can be mapped into the near-horizon modes inthe two exterior regions of an eternal black hole, whose mass is taken to bethat of the evolving black hole at each moment. salient features arising fromthis picture include: (i) the number of degrees of freedom needed to describe ablack hole is e^{a/2 l_p^2}, where a is the area of the horizon; (ii) blackhole states having smooth horizons span only an e^{a/4 l_p^2}-dimensionalsubspace of the relevant e^{a/2 l_p^2}-dimensional hilbert space; (iii)internal dynamics of the horizon is such that an infalling observer finds asmooth horizon with probability 1 if a state stays in this subspace. weidentify the structure of local operators in the exterior and interiorspacetime regions, and show that this structure avoids firewall arguments---thehorizon can keep being smooth throughout the evolution. we discuss the fate offalling observers under various circumstances, especially when they manipulatedegrees of freedom before entering the horizon, and find that an observer cannever see a firewall by making a measurement on early hawking radiation. wealso consider the framework in an infalling reference frame, and argue thatminkowski-like vacua are not unique. in particular, the number of trueminkowski vacua is infinite, although the label discriminating these vacuacannot be accessed in usual non-gravitational quantum field theory. anapplication to de sitter horizons is also discussed.

1310.7564	the entropy of a vacuum: what does the covariant entropy count?	we argue that a unitary description of the formation and evaporation of ablack hole implies that the bekenstein-hawking entropy is the "entropy of avacuum": the logarithm of the number of possible independent ways in whichquantum field theory on a fixed classical spacetime background can emerge in afull quantum theory of gravity. in many cases, the covariant entropy countsthis entropy--the degeneracy of emergent quantum field theories in full quantumgravity--with the entropy of particle excitations in each quantum field theorygiving only a tiny perturbation. in the rindler description of a (black hole)horizon, the relevant vacuum degrees of freedom manifest themselves as an extrahidden quantum number carried by the states representing the second exteriorregion; this quantum number is invisible in the emergent quantum field theory.in a distant picture, these states arise as exponentially degenerate ground andexcited states of the intrinsically quantum gravitational degrees of freedom onthe stretched horizon. the formation and evaporation of a black hole involveprocesses in which the entropy of collapsing matter is transformed into that ofa vacuum and then to that of final-state hawking radiation. in the intermediatestage of this evolution, entanglement between the vacuum and (early) hawkingradiation develops, which is transferred to the entanglement among final-statehawking quanta through the evaporation process. the horizon is kept smooththroughout the evolution; in particular, no firewall develops. similarconsiderations also apply for cosmological horizons, for example for thehorizon of a meta-stable de-sitter space.

1403.8138	grand unification, axion, and inflation in intermediate scale  supersymmetry	a class of supersymmetric grand unified theories is introduced that has asingle scale below the cutoff, that of the supersymmetry breaking masses$\tilde{m}$. for a wide range of the dimensionless parameters, agreement withthe observed mass of the higgs boson determines $\tilde{m} \sim 10^9-10^{13}{\rm gev}$, yielding intermediate scale supersymmetry. we show that within thisframework it is possible for seesaw neutrino masses, axions, and inflation tobe described by the scale $\tilde{m}$, offering the possibility of a unifiedorigin of disparate phenomena. neutrino masses allowing for thermalleptogenesis can be obtained, and the axion decay constant lies naturally inthe range $f_a \sim 10^9-10^{11} {\rm gev}$, consistent with a recentobservational suggestion of high scale inflation. a minimal $su(5)$ model ispresented that illustrates these features. in this model, the only states atthe grand unified scale are those of the heavy gauge supermultiplet. the grandunified partners of the higgs doublets have a mass of order $\tilde{m}$,leading to the dominant proton decay mode $p \rightarrow \bar{\nu} k^+$, whichmay be probed in upcoming experiments. dark matter may be winos, with massenvironmentally selected to the tev scale, and/or axions. gauge couplingunification is found to be successful, especially if the wino is at the tevscale.

1412.7538	relativeness in quantum gravity: limitations and frame dependence of  semiclassical descriptions	consistency between quantum mechanical and general relativistic views of theworld is a longstanding problem, which becomes particularly prominent in blackhole physics. we develop a coherent picture addressing this issue by studyingthe quantum mechanics of an evolving black hole. after interpreting thebekenstein-hawking entropy as the entropy representing the degrees of freedomthat are coarse-grained to obtain a semiclassical description from themicroscopic theory of quantum gravity, we discuss the properties these degreesof freedom exhibit when viewed from the semiclassical standpoint. we are led tothe conclusion that they show features which we call extreme relativeness andspacetime-matter duality---a nontrivial reference frame dependence of theirspacetime distribution and the dual roles they play as the "constituents" ofspacetime and as thermal radiation. we describe black hole formation andevaporation processes in distant and infalling reference frames, showing thatthese two properties allow us to avoid the arguments for firewalls and to makethe existence of the black hole interior consistent with unitary evolution inthe sense of complementarity. our analysis provides a concrete answer to howinformation can be preserved at the quantum level throughout the evolution of ablack hole, and gives a basic picture of how general coordinate transformationsmay work at the level of full quantum gravity beyond the approximation ofsemiclassical theory.

astro-ph;0405596	acceleressence: dark energy from a phase transition at the seesaw scale	simple models are constructed for "acceleressence" dark energy: the latentheat of a phase transition occurring in a hidden sector governed by the seesawmass scale v^2/m_pl, where v is the electroweak scale and m_pl thegravitational mass scale. in our models, the seesaw scale is stabilized bysupersymmetry, implying that the lhc must discover superpartners with aspectrum that reflects a low scale of fundamental supersymmetry breaking.newtonian gravity may be modified by effects arising from the exchange offields in the acceleressence sector whose compton wavelengths are typically oforder the millimeter scale. there are two classes of models. in the first classthe universe is presently in a metastable vacuum and will continue to inflateuntil tunneling processes eventually induce a first order transition. in thesimplest such model, the range of the new force is bounded to be larger than 25microns in the absence of fine-tuning of parameters, and for couplings of orderunity it is expected to be \approx 100 microns. in the second class of modelsthermal effects maintain the present vacuum energy of the universe, but onfurther cooling, the universe will "soon" smoothly relax to a matter dominatedera. in this case, the range of the new force is also expected to be of orderthe millimeter scale or larger, although its strength is uncertain. a firmprediction of this class of models is the existence of additional energydensity in radiation at the ev era, which can potentially be probed inprecision measurements of the cosmic microwave background. an interestingpossibility is that the transition towards a matter dominated era has occurredin the very recent past, with the consequence that the universe is currentlydecelerating.

hep-ph;0102090	finite radiative electroweak symmetry breaking from the bulk	a new physical origin for electroweak symmetry breaking is proposed,involving compact spatial dimensions of scale 1/r \approx 1 tev. the higherdimensional theory is supersymmetric, and hence requires the top-quark yukawacoupling to be localized on some ``yukawa brane'' in the bulk. the shortdistance divergence in the higgs-boson mass is regulated because supersymmetryis unbroken in the vicinity of this yukawa brane. a finite, negative higgsmass-squared is generated radiatively by the top-quark supermultipletpropagating a distance of order r from the yukawa brane to probe supersymmetrybreaking. the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking is therefore closelyrelated to this top propagation across the bulk, and is dominated by the massscale 1/r, with exponential insensitivity to higher energy scales. the massesof the superpartners and the kaluza-klein resonances are also set by the massscale 1/r, which is naturally larger than the w boson mass by a loop factor.  explicit models are constructed which are highly constrained and predictive.the finite radiative correction to the higgs mass is computed, and the higgssector briefly explored. the superpartner and kaluza-klein resonance spectraare calculated, and the problem of flavor violation from squark and sleptonexchange is solved. important collider signatures include highly ionizingcharged tracks from stable top squarks, and events with two higgs bosons andmissing transverse energy.

hep-ph;0509244	(mu b)-driven electroweak symmetry breaking	we consider a scenario in which the dominant quartic coupling for the higgsdoublets arises from the f-term potential, rather than the conventional su(2)_lx u(1)_y d-term potential, in supersymmetric theories. the quartic couplingarises from a superpotential interaction between the two higgs doublets and asinglet field, but unlike the case in the next-to-minimal supersymmetricstandard model the singlet field is not responsible for the generation of thesupersymmetric or holomorphic supersymmetry-breaking masses for the higgsdoublets. we find that this naturally leads to a deviation from theconventional picture of top-yukawa driven electroweak symmetry breaking --electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the holomorphic supersymmetrybreaking mass for the higgs doublets (the \mu b term). this allows asignificant improvement for fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking, sincethe top squarks do not play a major role in raising the higgs boson mass or intriggering electroweak symmetry breaking and thus can be light. the amount offine-tuning is given by the squared ratio of the lightest higgs boson mass tothe charged higgs boson mass, which can be made better than 20%. solidimplications of the scenario include a small value for tan\beta, less thanabout 3, and relatively light top squarks.

hep-ph;0510273	natural little hierarchy from a partially goldstone twin higgs	we construct a simple theory in which the fine-tuning of the standard modelis significantly reduced. radiative corrections to the quadratic part of thescalar potential are constrained to be symmetric under a global u(4) x u(4)'symmetry due to a discrete z_2 "twin" parity, while the quartic part does notpossess this symmetry. as a consequence, when the global symmetry is broken thehiggs fields emerge as light pseudo-goldstone bosons, but with sizable quarticself-interactions. this structure allows the cutoff scale, \lambda, to beraised to the multi-tev region without significant fine-tuning. in the minimalversion of the theory, the amount of fine-tuning is about 15% for \lambda = 5tev, while it is about 30% in an extended model. this provides a solution tothe little hierarchy problem. in the minimal model, the "visible" particlecontent is exactly that of the two higgs doublet standard model, while theextended model also contains extra vector-like fermions with masses ~(1-2)tev.at the lhc, our minimal model may appear exactly as the two higgs doubletstandard model, and new physics responsible for cutting off the divergences ofthe higgs mass-squared parameter may not be discovered. several possibleprocesses that may be used to discriminate our model from the simple two higgsdoublet model are discussed for the lhc and for a linear collider.

hep-ph;0602096	supersymmetry, naturalness, and signatures at the lhc	weak scale supersymmetry is often said to be fine-tuned, especially if thematter content is minimal. this is not true if there is a large a term for thetop squarks. we present a systematic study on fine-tuning in minimalsupersymmetric theories and identify low energy spectra that do not lead tosevere fine-tuning. characteristic features of these spectra are: a large aterm for the top squarks, small top squark masses, moderately large tan\beta,and a small \mu parameter. there are classes of theories leading to thesefeatures, which are discussed. in one class, which allows a completeelimination of fine-tuning, the higgsinos are the lightest among all thesuperpartners of the standard model particles, leading to three nearlydegenerate neutralino/chargino states. this gives interesting signals at thelhc -- the dilepton invariant mass distribution has a very small endpoint andshows a particular shape determined by the higgsino nature of the two lightestneutralinos. we demonstrate that these signals are indeed useful in realisticanalyses by performing monte carlo simulations, including detector simulationsand background estimations. we also present a method that allows thedetermination of all the relevant superparticle masses without using input fromparticular models, despite the limited kinematical information due to shortcascades. this allows us to test various possible models, which is demonstratedin the case of a model with mixed moduli-anomaly mediation. we also give asimple derivation of special renormalization group properties associated withmoduli mediated supersymmetry breaking, which are relevant in a model withoutfine-tuning.

hep-ph;0605014	holographic grand unification	we present a framework for grand unification in which the grand unifiedsymmetry is broken spontaneously by strong gauge dynamics, and yet the physicsat the unification scale is described by (weakly coupled) effective fieldtheory. these theories are formulated, through the gauge/gravitycorrespondence, in truncated 5d warped spacetime with the uv and ir branessetting the planck and unification scales, respectively. in most of thesetheories, the higgs doublets arise as composite states of strong gaugedynamics, corresponding to degrees of freedom localized to the ir brane, andthe observed hierarchies of quark and lepton masses and mixings are explainedby the wavefunction profiles of these fields in the extra dimension. we presentseveral realistic models in this framework. we focus on one in which thedoublet-triplet splitting of the higgs fields is realized within the dynamicalsector by the pseudo-goldstone mechanism, with the associated global symmetrycorresponding to a bulk gauge symmetry in the 5d theory. alternatively, thelight higgs doublets can arise as a result of dynamics on the ir brane, withoutbeing accompanied by their triplet partners. gauge coupling unification andproton decay can be studied in these models using higher dimensional effectivefield theory. the framework also sets a stage for further studies of, e.g.,proton decay, fermion masses, and supersymmetry breaking.

hep-ph;0606134	supersymmetry with small mu: connections between naturalness, dark  matter, and (possibly) flavor	weak scale supersymmetric theories often suffer from several naturalnessproblems: the problems of reproducing the correct scale for electroweaksymmetry breaking, the correct abundance for dark matter, and small rates forflavor violating processes. we argue that the first two problems point toparticular regions of parameter space in models with weak scale supersymmetry:those with a small mu term. this has an interesting implication on direct darkmatter detection experiments. we find that, if the signs of the three gauginomass parameters are all equal, we can obtain a solid lower bound on thespin-independent neutralino-nucleon cross section, \sigma. in the case that thegaugino masses satisfy the unified mass relations, we obtain \sigma &gt; 4 x10^{-46} cm^2 (1 x 10^{-46} cm^2) for fine-tuning in electroweak symmetrybreaking no worse than 10% (5%). we also discuss a possibility that the threeproblems listed above are all connected to the hierarchy of fermion masses.this occurs if supersymmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking (thehiggs fields) are coupled to matter fields with similar hierarchicalstructures. the discovery of mu -&gt; e transition processes in near futureexperiments is predicted in such a framework.

hep-ph;0607332	supersymmetry without a light higgs boson	motivated by the absence, so far, of any direct signal of conventionallow-energy supersymmetry, we explore the consequences of making the lightesthiggs boson in supersymmetry relatively heavy, up to about 300 gev, in the moststraightforward way, i.e. via the introduction of a chiral singlet s with asuperpotential interaction with the higgs doublets, \lambda s h_1 h_2. thecoupling \lambda dominates over all the other couplings and, to maintain thesuccessful perturbative analysis of the electroweak precision tests, is onlyrestricted to remain perturbative up to about 10 tev. the general features ofthis "\lambda susy" framework, which deviates significantly from the mssm orthe standard nmssm, are analyzed in different areas: electroweak precisiontests, dark matter, naturalness bounds on superparticle masses, and lhcsignals. there is a rich higgs/higgsino sector in the (200-700)gev mass region,which may include lsp higgsino dark matter. all other superpartners, apart fromthe top squarks, may naturally be heavier than 1-2 tev. this picture can bemade consistent with gauge coupling unification.

hep-ph;0608253	supersymmetry without the desert	naturalness of electroweak symmetry breaking in weak scale supersymmetrictheories may suggest the absence of the conventional supersymmetric desert. wepresent a simple, realistic framework for supersymmetry in which (most of) thevirtues of the supersymmetric desert are naturally reproduced without having alarge energy interval above the weak scale. the successful supersymmetricprediction for the low-energy gauge couplings is reproduced due to a gauged rsymmetry present in the effective theory at the weak scale. the observablesector superpotential naturally takes the form of the next-to-minimalsupersymmetric standard model, but without being subject to the landau poleconstraints up to the conventional unification scale. supersymmetry breakingmasses are generated by the f-term and d-term vevs of singlet and u(1)_r gaugefields, as well as by anomaly mediation, at a scale not far above the weakscale. we study the resulting patten of supersymmetry breaking masses indetail, and find that it can be quite distinct. we construct classes ofexplicit models within this framework, based on higher dimensional unifiedtheories with tev-sized extra dimensions. a similar model based on a non-rsymmetry is also presented. these models have a rich phenomenology at the tevscale, and allow for detailed analyses of, e.g., electroweak symmetry breaking.
