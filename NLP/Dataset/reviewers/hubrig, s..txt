0903.0611	stratification and isotope separation in cp stars	we investigate the elemental and isotopic stratification in the atmospheresof selected chemically peculiar (cp) stars of the upper main sequence.reconfiguration of the uves spectrograph in 2004 has made it possible toexamine all three lines of the ca ii infrared triplet. much of the materialanalyzed was obtained in 2008.  we support the claim of ryabchikova, kochukhov &amp; bagnulo (rkb) that thecalcium isotopes have distinct stratification profiles for the stars 10 aql, hr1217, and hd 122970, with the heavy isotope concentrated toward the higherlayers. better observations are needed to learn the extent to which ca-40dominates in the deepest layers of all or most cp stars that show the presenceof ca-48. there is little evidence for ca-40 in the spectra of some hgmn stars,and the infrared triplet in the magnetic star hd 101065 is well fit by pureca-48. in hr 5623 (hd 133792) and hd 217522 it is likely that the heavy isotopedominates, though models are possible where this is not the case.  while elemental stratification is surely needed in many cases, we point outthe importance of including adjustments in the assumed teff and log(g) values,in attempts to model stratification. we recommend emphasis on profiles of thestrongest lines, where the influence of stratification is most evident.  isotopic mixtures, involving the 4 stable calcium nuclides with massesbetween 40 and 48 are plausible, but are not emphasized.

0903.4060	the x-ray emission from z cma during an fuor-like outburst and the  detection of its x-ray jet	accretion shocks have been recognized as important x-ray emission mechanismfor pre-main sequence stars. yet the x-ray properties of fuor outbursts, eventsthat are caused by violent accretion, have been given little attention. we haveobserved the fuor object z cma during optical outburst and quiescence withchandra. no significant changes in x-ray brightness and spectral shape arefound, suggesting that the x-ray emission is of coronal nature. due to thebinary nature of z cma the origin of the x-ray source is ambiguous. however,the moderate hydrogen column density derived from our data makes it unlikelythat the embedded primary star is the x-ray source. the secondary star, whichis the fuor object, is thus responsible for both the x-ray emission and thepresently ongoing accretion outburst, which seem however to be unrelatedphenomena. the secondary is also known to drive a large outflow and jet, thatwe detect here for the first time in x-rays. the distance of the x-ray emittingoutflow source to the central star is higher than in jets of low-mass stars.

0903.5182	a high resolution study of isotopic composition and chemical abundances  of blue horizontal branch stars in the globular clusters ngc6397 and ngc6752	large abundance anomalies have been previously detected in horizontal branchb-type stars. we present the first high resolution study of isotopic anomaliesand chemical abundances in six horizontal branch b-type stars in globularclusters ngc6397 and ngc6752 and compare them to those observed in hgmn stars.  we obtained high-resolution (up to r~115000) uves spectra of a representativesample of six b-type stars (t183, t191, t193, b652, b2151, b2206).  it is the first time an abundance analysis is performed for all elements forwhich spectral lines were detected in uves spectra of horizontal branch b-typestars. our study of these stars revealed no signs of he isotopic anomalieswhich would produce a ^3he/^4he ratio different from the solar one. theisotopic anomaly of ca is detected in all six studied stars. the chemicalabundance analysis reveals an overabundance over the solar values of p, ti, mn,fe, and y and an overabundance over the cluster metallicity of mg, ca, and cr.this behaviour is very similar in all six studied stars of both clusters with afew exceptions: the na abundance is by more than 1.4dex larger than the clustermetallicity in b652, and by more than 0.8dex larger than the clustermetallicity in b2206; the co abundance is 1.0dex over the solar abundance fort191, while zr is overabundant over the solar abundance by 0.4dex in b2206. nolines of hg or other heavy elements were observed in the spectra. weak emissionlines of ti ii, similar to those frequently observed in hgmn stars werediscovered in one horizontal branch b-type star t191. further, we detected aradial velocity change of 0.9km s^-1 from one night to the next for t183 and0.4km s^-1 for b2151.

0905.0864	searching for a link between the magnetic nature and other observed  properties of herbig ae/be stars and stars with debris disks	among the 21 herbig ae/be stars studied, new detections of a magnetic fieldwere achieved in six stars. for three herbig ae/be stars, we confirm previousmagnetic field detections. the largest longitudinal magnetic field, &lt;b_z&gt; =-454+-42g, was detected in the herbig ae/be star hd101412 using hydrogen lines.no field detection at a significance level of 3sigma was achieved in stars withdebris disks. our study does not indicate any correlation of the strength ofthe longitudinal magnetic field with disk orientation, disk geometry, or thepresence of a companion. we also do not see any simple dependence on themass-accretion rate. however, it is likely that the range of observed fieldvalues qualitatively supports the expectations from magnetospheric accretionmodels giving support for dipole-like field geometries. both the magnetic fieldstrength and the x-ray emission show hints for a decline with age in the rangeof ~2-14myrs probed by our sample supporting a dynamo mechanism that decayswith age. however, our study of rotation does not show any obvious trend of thestrength of the longitudinal magnetic field with rotation period. furthermore,the stars seem to obey the universal power-law relation between magnetic fluxand x-ray luminosity established for the sun and main-sequence active dwarfstars.

0912.3889	the nature of the recent extreme outburst of the herbig be/fu ori binary  z cma	z cma is a binary system which consists of two young stars: a herbig aebecomponent "z cma nw" embedded in a dust cocoon and a less massive component "zcma se", which is classified as a fu orionis type star. recently, the systemshowed the largest outburst reported during the almost 90 years of availableobservations. during the recent outburst we detect that the z cma system ispolarized by 2.6% in the continuum and emission line spectrum, with a positionangle still perpendicular to the jet. from the high level of polarization weconclude that the outburst is associated with the dust embedded herbig aebe nwcomponent. the main result of our studies is that the bolometric luminosity ofz cma remained surprisingly constant during the recent "outburst". we concludethat either the geometry of the cavity through which the light escapes from thecocoon has opened a new path, or that the screen of dust, which reflects thelight toward the observer became more efficient causing the observed increaseof the visual brightness by about 2.5 magnitudes.

1002.3037	the exceptional herbig ae star hd101412: the first detection of resolved  magnetically split lines and the presence of chemical spots in a herbig star	we obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise uves and a few lowerquality harps spectra revealing the presence of resolved magnetically splitlines. hd101412 is the first herbig ae star for which the rotational dopplereffect was found to be small in comparison to the magnetic splitting. themeasured mean magnetic field modulus varies from 2.5 to 3.5kg, while the meanquadratic field was found to vary in the range of 3.5 to 4.8kg. to determinethe period of variations, we used radial velocity, equivalent width, linewidth, and line asymmetry measurements of variable spectral lines of severalelements, as well as magnetic field measurements. the most pronouncedvariability was detected for spectral lines of he i and the iron peak elements,whereas the spectral lines of cno elements are only slightly variable. fromspectral variations and magnetic field measurements we derived a potentialrotation period p_rot=13.86d, which has to be proven in future studies with alarger number of observations. it is the first time that the presence ofelement spots is detected on the surface of a herbig ae/be star. our previousstudy of herbig ae stars revealed a trend towards stronger magnetic fields foryounger herbig ae stars, confirmed by statistical tests. this is in contrast toa few other (non-statistical) studies claiming that magnetic herbig ae starsare progenitors of the magnetic ap stars. new developments in mhd theory showthat the measured magnetic field strengths are compatible with a current-driveninstability of toroidal fields generated by differential rotation in thestellar interior. this explanation for magnetic intermediate-mass stars couldbe an alternative to a frozen-in fossil field.

0708.0860	establishing the nature of companion candidates to x-ray emitting late  b-type stars	the most favored interpretation for the detection of x-ray emission from lateb-type stars is that these stars have a yet undiscovered late-type companion(or an unbound nearby late-type star) that produces the x-rays. several faintir objects at (sub)-arcsecond separation from b-type stars have been uncoveredin our earlier adaptive optics imaging observations, and some of them have beenfollowed up with the high spatial resolution of the chandra x-ray observatory,pinpointing the x-ray emitter. however, firm conclusions on their naturerequires a search for spectroscopic signatures of youth. here we report on ourrecent isaac observations carried out in low resolution spectroscopic mode.equivalent widths have been used to obtain information on spectral types of thecompanions. all eight x-ray emitting systems with late b-type primaries studiedcontain dwarf like companions with spectral types later than a7. the onlysystem in the sample where the companion turns out to be of early spectral typeis not an x-ray source. these results are consistent with the assumption thatthe observed x-ray emission from late b-type stars is produced by an activepre-main sequence companion star.

1008.1601	abundances in the herbig ae star hd 101412: abundance anomalies; lambda  boo-vega characteristics?	context: recent attention has been directed to abundance variations amongvery young stars.  aims: to perform a detailed abundance study of the herbig ae star hd 101412,taking advantage of its unusually sharp spectral lines.  methods: high-resolution spectra are measured for accurate wavelengths andequivalent widths. balmer-line fits and ionization equlibria give a relationbetween teff, and log(g). abundance anomalies and uncertain reddening precludethe use of spectral type or photometry to fix teff. excitation temperatures areused to break the degeneracy between teff and log(g).  results: strong lines are subject to an anomalous saturation that cannot beremoved by assuming a low microturbulence. by restricting the analysis to weak(&lt;= 20 m[a]) lines, we find consistent results for neutral and ionized species,based on a model with teff = 8300k, and log(g)=3.8. the photosphere is depletedin the most refractory elements, while volatiles are normal or, in the case ofnitrogen, overabundant with respect to the sun. the anomalies are unlike thoseof ap or am stars.  conclusions: we suggest the anomalous saturation of strong lines arises fromheating of the upper atmospheric layers by infalling material from a disk. theoverall abundance pattern may be related to those found for the lambda boostars, though the depletions of the refractory elements are milder, more likethose of vega. however, the intermediate volatile zinc is depleted, precludinga straightforward interpretation of the abundance pattern in terms of gas-grainseparation.

1110.6908	spectroscopic variability and magnetic fields of hgmn stars	the discovery of exotic abundances, chemical inhomogeneities, and weakmagnetic fields on the surface of late b-type primaries in spectroscopicbinaries has important implications not only for our understanding of theformation mechanisms of stars with hg and mn peculiarities themselves, but alsofor the general understanding of b-type star formation in binary systems. theorigin of the abundance anomalies observed in late b-type stars with hgmnpeculiarity is still poorly understood. the connection between hgmn peculiarityand membership in binary and multiple systems is supported by our observationsduring the last decade. the important result achieved in our studies of a largesample of hgmn stars is the finding that most hgmn stars exhibit spectralvariability of various chemical elements, proving that the presence of aninhomogeneous distribution on the surface of these stars is a rather commoncharacteristic and not a rare phenomenon. further, in the studied systems, wefound that all components are chemically peculiar with different abundancepatterns. generally, he and si variable bp stars possess large-scale organisedmagnetic fields that in many cases appear to occur essentially in the form of asingle large dipole located close to the centre of the star. the presence ofmagnetic fields in the atmospheres of hgmn stars has been demonstrated inseveral studies. in addition to the measurements of longitudinal and quadraticmagnetic fields, this work also showed evidence for a relative magneticintensification of fe ii lines produced by different magnetic desaturationsinduced by different zeeman-split components.

1111.1323	the absorption and emission spectrum of the magnetic herbig ae star hd  190073	we determine abundances from the absorption spectrum of the magnetic herbigae star hd 190073 (v1295 aql). the observations are primarily from harpsspectra obtained at a single epoch. we accept arguments that the presence ofnumerous emission lines does not vitiate a classical abundance analysis, thoughit likely reduces the achievable accuracy. most abundances are closely solar,but several elements show departures of a factor of two to three, as an earlierstudy has also shown. we present quantitative measurements of more than 60emission lines, peak intensities, equivalent widths, and fwhm's. the latterrange from over 200 km/s (h-alpha, he d3) down to 10--20 km/s (forbiddenlines). metallic emission lines have intermediate widths. we eschew modeling,and content ourselves with a presentation of the observations a successfulmodel must explain. low-excitation features such as the na i d-lines and [o i]appear with he i d3, suggesting proximate regions with widely differing te andne as found in the solar chromosphere. the [o i] and [ca ii] lines show sharp,violet-shifted features. additionally, [fe ii] lines appear to be weaklypresent in emission.

1208.0480	multiplicity of rapidly oscillating ap stars	rapidly oscillating ap (roap) stars have rarely been found in binary orhigher order multiple systems. this might have implications for their origin.  we intend to study the multiplicity of this type of chemically peculiarstars, looking for visual companions in the range of angular separation between0.05" and 8".  we carried out a survey of 28 roap stars using diffraction-limitednear-infrared imaging with naos-conica at the vlt. additionally, we observedthree non-oscillating magnetic ap stars.  we detected a total of six companion candidates with low chance projectionprobabilities. four of these are new detections, the other two areconfirmations. an additional 39 companion candidates are very likely chanceprojections. we also found one binary system among the non-oscillating magneticap stars. the detected companion candidates have apparent k magnitudes between6.8 and 19.5 and angular separations ranging from 0.23" to 8.9", correspondingto linear projected separations of 30-2400au.  while our study confirms that roap stars are indeed not very often members ofbinary or multiple systems, we have found four new companion candidates thatare likely physical companions. a confirmation of their status will helpunderstanding the origin of the roap stars.

0712.0173	magnetic fields in x-ray emitting a-type stars	a common explanation for the observed x-ray emission of a-type stars is thepresence of a hidden late-type companion. while this hypothesis can be shown tobe correct in some cases, there is also evidence suggesting that low-masscompanions cannot be the proper cause for the observed x-ray activity in allcases. babel &amp; montmerle (1997) presented a theoretical framework to explainthe x-ray emission for magnetic ap/bp stars, focusing on the a0p star iq aur.we test if this theoretical model is capable to explain the observed x-rayemissions. we present observations of 13 a-type stars that have been associatedwith x-ray emission detected by rosat. to determine the mean longitudinalmagnetic field strength we measured the circular polarization in the wings ofthe balmer lines using fors 1. although the emission of those objects withmagnetic fields fits the prediction of the babel &amp; montmerle model, not allx-ray detections are related to the presence of a magnetic field. additionally,the strengths of magnetic fields do not correlate with the x-ray luminosity andthus the magnetically confined wind shock model cannot explain the x-rayemission from all investigated stars.

1301.4376	exploring the origin of magnetic fields in massive stars: ii. new  magnetic field measurements in cluster and field stars	theories on the origin of magnetic fields in massive stars remain poorlydeveloped, because the properties of their magnetic field as function ofstellar parameters could not yet be investigated.  to investigate whether magnetic fields in massive stars are ubiquitous orappear only in stars with a specific spectral classification, certain ages, orin a special environment, we acquired 67 new spectropolarimetric observationsfor 30 massive stars. among the observed sample, roughly one third of the starsare probable members of clusters at different ages, whereas the remaining starsare field stars not known to belong to any cluster or association.  spectropolarimetric observations were obtained during four different nightsusing the low-resolution spectropolarimetric mode of fors2 (focal reducer lowdispersion spectrograph) mounted on the 8-m antu telescope of the vlt.furthermore, we present a number of follow-up observations carried out with thehigh-resolution spectropolarimeters sofin mounted at the nordic opticaltelescope (not) and harps mounted at the eso 3.6m between 2008 and 2011. toassess the membership in open clusters and associations, we used astrometriccatalogues with the highest quality kinematic and photometric data currentlyavailable.  the presence of a magnetic field is confirmed in nine stars previouslyobserved with fors1/2: hd36879, hd47839, cpd-282561, cpd-472963, hd93843,hd148937, hd149757, hd328856, and hd164794. new magnetic field detections at asignificance level of at least 3sigma were achieved in five stars: hd92206c,hd93521, hd93632, cpd-468221, and hd157857. among the stars with a detectedmagnetic field, five stars belong to open clusters with high membershipprobability. according to previous kinematic studies, five magnetic o-typestars in our sample are candidate runaway stars.

1311.4370	a search for pulsations in the hgmn star hd 45975 with corot photometry  and ground-based spectroscopy	the existence of pulsations in hgmn stars is still being debated. to providethe first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class ofchemically peculiar objects, the bright star hd 45975 was monitored for nearlytwo months by the corot satellite. independent analyses of the light curveprovides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d anda peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. multisite, ground-based spectroscopicobservations overlapping the corot observations show the star to be along-period, single-lined binary. furthermore, with the notable exception ofmercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line momentsof chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., mn and y). incontrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. as foundin other hgmn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bumpmoving redwards across the line profiles. we argue that the photometric andspectroscopic changes are more consistent with an interpretation in terms ofrotational modulation of spots at the stellar surface. in this framework, theexistence of pulsations producing photometric variations above the ~50 ppmlevel is unlikely in hd 45975. this provides strong constraints on theexcitation/damping of pulsation modes in this hgmn star.

1408.3000	weak magnetic fields in central stars of planetary nebulae?	it is not yet clear whether magnetic fields play an essential role in shapingplanetary nebulae (pne), or whether stellar rotation alone and/or a closebinary companion can account for the variety of the observed nebularmorphologies. in a quest for empirical evidence verifying or disproving therole of magnetic fields in shaping pne, we follow up on previous attempts tomeasure the magnetic field in a representative sample of pn central stars. weobtained low-resolution polarimetric spectra with fors 2 at vlt for a sample oftwelve bright central stars of pne with different morphology, including tworound nebulae, seven elliptical nebulae, and three bipolar nebulae. two targetsare wolf-rayet type central stars. for the majority of the observed centralstars, we do not find any significant evidence for the existence of surfacemagnetic fields. however, our measurements may indicate the presence of weakmean longitudinal magnetic fields of the order of 100 gauss in the central starof the young elliptical planetary nebula ic 418, as well as in the wolf-rayettype central star of the bipolar nebula hen2-113 and the weak emission linecentral star of the elliptical nebula hen2-131. a clear detection of a 250 gmean longitudinal field is achieved for the a-type companion of the centralstar of ngc 1514. some of the central stars show a moderate night-to-nightspectrum variability, which may be the signature of a variable stellar windand/or rotational modulation due to magnetic features. we conclude that strongmagnetic fields of the order of kg are not widespread among pne central stars.nevertheless, simple estimates based on a theoretical model of magnetized windbubbles suggest that even weak magnetic fields below the current detectionlimit of the order of 100 g may well be sufficient to contribute to the shapingof pne throughout their evolution.

1502.00227	new spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of the a0 supergiant  hd92207	our recent search for the presence of a magnetic field in the bright earlya-type supergiant hd92207 using fors2 in spectropolarimetric mode revealed thepresence of a longitudinal magnetic field of the order of a few hundred gauss.however, the definite confirmation of the magnetic nature of this objectremained pending due to the detection of short-term spectral variabilityprobably affecting the position of line profiles in left- and right-handpolarized spectra. we present new magnetic field measurements of hd92207obtained on three different epochs in 2013 and 2014 using fors2 inspectropolarimetric mode. a 3sigma detection of the mean longitudinal magneticfield using the entire spectrum, &lt;b_z&gt;_all=104+-34g, was achieved inobservations obtained in 2014 january. at this epoch, the position of thespectral lines appeared stable. our analysis of spectral line shapes recordedin opposite circularly polarized light, i.e. in light with opposite sense ofrotation, reveals that line profiles in the light polarized in a certaindirection appear slightly split. the mechanism causing such a behaviour in thecircularly polarized light is currently unknown. trying to settle the issue ofshort-term variability, we searched for changes in the spectral line profileson a time scale of 8-10min using harps polarimetric spectra and on a time scaleof 3-4min using time series obtained with the coralie spectrograph. nosignificant variability was detected on these time scales during the epochsstudied.

1502.05498	the prevalence of weak magnetic fields in herbig ae stars: the case of  pds2	models of magnetically driven accretion and outflows reproduce manyobservational properties of t tauri stars, but the picture is much less clearfor the herbig ae/be stars, due to the poor knowledge of their magnetic fieldstrength and topology. the herbig ae star pds2 was previously included in twomagnetic studies based on low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations. onlyin one of these studies the presence of a weak mean longitudinal magnetic fieldwas reported. in the present study, for the first time, high-resolution harpsspectropolarimetric observations of pds2 are used to investigate the presenceof a magnetic field. a firm detection of a weak longitudinal magnetic field isachieved using the multi-line singular value decomposition method for stokesprofile reconstruction (&lt;b_z&gt;=33+-5g). to gain better knowledge of typicalmagnetic field strengths in late herbig be and herbig ae stars, we compiledprevious magnetic field measurements, revealing that only very few stars havefields stronger than 200g, and half of the sample possesses fields of about100g and less. these results challenge our current understanding of themagnetospheric accretion in intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars as theyindicate that the magnetic fields in herbig ae/be stars are by far weaker thanthose measured in t tauri stars.

1507.03591	b fields in ob stars (bob): detection of a strong magnetic field in the  o9.7 v star hd54879	the number of magnetic stars detected among massive stars is small;nevertheless, the role played by the magnetic field in stellar evolution cannotbe disregarded. links between line profile variability, enhancements/depletionsof surface chemical abundances, and magnetic fields have been identified forlow-mass b-stars, but for the o-type domain this is almost unexplored. based onfors2 and harps spectropolarimetric data, we present the first detection of amagnetic field in hd54879, a single slowly rotating o9.7 v star. using twoindependent and different techniques we obtained the firm detection of asurface average longitudinal magnetic field with a maximum amplitude of about600 g, in modulus. a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the star with thestellar atmosphere code fastwind results in an effective temperature and asurface gravity of 33000$\pm1000$ k and 4.0$\pm0.1$ dex. the abundances ofcarbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium are found to be slightly lowerthan solar, but compatible within the errors. we investigate line-profilevariability in hd54879 by complementing our spectra with spectroscopic datafrom other recent ob-star surveys. the photospheric lines remain constant inshape between 2009 and 2014, although h$\alpha$ shows a variable emission. theh$\alpha$ emission is too strong for a standard o9.7 v and is probably linkedto the magnetic field and the presence of circumstellar material. its normalchemical composition and the absence of photospheric line profile variationsmake hd54879 the most strongly magnetic, non-variable single o-star detected todate.

1508.00750	b fields in ob stars (bob): low-resolution fors2 spectropolarimetry of  the first sample of 50 massive stars	within the context of the collaboration "b fields in ob stars (bob)", we usedthe fors2 low-resolution spectropolarimeter to search for a magnetic field in50 massive stars, including two reference magnetic massive stars. because ofthe many controversies of magnetic field detections obtained with the forsinstruments, we derived the magnetic field values with two completelyindependent reduction and analysis pipelines. we compare and discuss theresults obtained from the two pipelines. we obtained a general good agreement,indicating that most of the discrepancies on magnetic field detections reportedin the literature are caused by the interpretation of the significance of theresults (i.e., 3-4 sigma detections considered as genuine, or not), instead ofby significant differences in the derived magnetic field values. by combiningour results with past fors1 measurements of hd46328, we improve the estimate ofthe stellar rotation period, obtaining p = 2.17950+/-0.00009 days. forhd125823, our fors2 measurements do not fit the available magnetic field model,based on magnetic field values obtained 30 years ago. we repeatedly detect amagnetic field for the o9.7v star hd54879, the hd164492c massive binary, andthe he-rich star cpd -57 3509. we obtain a magnetic field detection rate of6+/-4%, while by considering only the apparently slow rotators we derive adetection rate of 8+/-5%, both comparable with what was previously reported byother similar surveys. we are left with the intriguing result that, althoughthe large majority of magnetic massive stars is rotating slowly, our detectionrate is not a strong function of the stellar rotational velocity.

1510.09108	harps spectropolarimetry of three sharp-lined herbig ae stars: new  insights	several arguments have been presented that favour a scenario in which the lowdetection rate of magnetic fields in herbig ae stars can be explained by theweakness of these fields and rather large measurement uncertainties.spectropolarimetric studies involving sharp-lined herbig ae stars appear to bepromising for the detection of such weak magnetic fields. these studies offer aclear spectrum interpretation with respect to the effects of blending, localvelocity fields, and chemical abundances, and allow us to identify a propersample of spectral lines appropriate for magnetic field determination.high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the three sharp-linedherbig ae stars hd101412, hd104237, and hd190073 have been obtained in recentyears with the harps. we used these archival observations to investigate thebehaviour of their longitudinal magnetic fields. to carry out the magneticfield measurements, we used the multi-line singular value decomposition method.we discovered that different line lists for hd101412 yield differences in boththe shape of the stokes v signatures and their field strengths. they could beinterpreted in the context of the impact of the circumstellar matter andelemental abundance inhomogeneities on the measurements of the magnetic field.due to the small size of the zeeman features on the first three epochs and thelack of near-ir observations, circumstellar and photospheric contributionscannot be estimated unambiguously. in the stokes v spectrum of hd104237, wedetect that the secondary component, a t tauri star, possesses a rather strongmagnetic field &lt;b_z&gt;=129g, while no significant field is present in the primarycomponent. our measurements of hd190073 confirm the presence of a variablemagnetic field and indicate that the circumstellar environment may have asignificant impact on the observed polarization features.

0807.2067	new insights into the nature of the peculiar star theta carinae	we acquired high resolution spectroscopic and low resolutionspectropolarimetric observations to achieve the following goals: a) to improvethe orbital parameters to allow a more in-depth discussion on the possibilityof mass transfer in the binary system, b) to carry out a non-localthermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) abundance analysis, and c) to search for thepresence of a magnetic field.  the study of the radial velocities using coralie spectra allowed us tosignificantly improve the orbital parameters. a comparative nlte abundanceanalysis was undertaken for theta car and two other early b-type stars withrecently detected magnetic fields, tau sco and xi^1 cma. the analysis revealedsignificantly different abundance patterns: a one-order-of-magnitude nitrogenoverabundance and carbon depletion was found in theta car, while the oxygenabundance is roughly solar. for the stars xi^1 cma and tau sco the carbonabundance is solar and, while an n excess is also detected, it is of muchsmaller amplitude (0.4-0.6dex). such an n overabundance is typical of thevalues already found for other slowly-rotating (magnetic) b-type dwarfs. fortheta car, we attribute instead the chemical peculiarities to a past episode ofmass transfer between the two binary components. the results of the search fora magnetic field using fors1 at the vlt consisting of 26 measurements over atime span of ~1.2h are rather inconclusive: only few measurements have asignificance level of 3sigma. although we detect a periodicity of the order of~8.8min in the dataset involving the measurements on all hydrogen balmer lineswith the exception of the halpha and hbeta lines, these results have to beconfirmed by additional time-resolved magnetic field observations.

0808.2039	magnetic field measurements of o stars with fors1 at the vlt	the presence of magnetic fields in o-type stars has been suspected for a longtime. the discovery of such fields would explain a wide range of welldocumented enigmatic phenomena in massive stars, in particular cyclical windvariability, h alpha emission variations, chemical peculiarity, narrow x-rayemission lines and non-thermal radio/x-ray emission.  to investigate the incidence of magnetic fields in o stars, we acquired 38new spectropolarimetric observations with fors1 (focal reducer low dispersionspectrograph) mounted on the 8-m kueyen telescope of the vlt.  spectropolarimetric observations have been obtained at different phases for asample of 13 o stars. 10 stars were observed in the spectral range 348-589nm,hd36879 and hd148937 were observed in the spectral region 325-621nm, andhd155806 was observed in both settings. to prove the feasibility of the fors1spectropolarimetric mode for the measurements of magnetic fields in hot stars,we present in addition 12 fors1 observations of the mean longitudinal magneticfield in theta^1 ori c and compare them with measurements obtained with themusicos, espadons and narval spectropolarimeters.  most stars in our sample which have been observed on different nights show achange of the magnetic field polarity, but a field at a significance level of3sigma has been detected only in four stars, hd36879, hd148937, hd152408, andhd164794. the largest longitudinal magnetic field, &lt;b_z&gt; = -276+-88g, wasdetected in the of?p star hd148937. we conclude that large-scale organisedmagnetic fields with polar field strengths larger than 1kg are not widespreadamong o-type stars.

astro-ph;0206090	measuring starspots on magnetically active stars with the vlti	we present feasibility studies to directly image stellar surface features,which are caused by magnetic activity, with the very large telescopeinterferometer (vlti). we concentrate on late type magnetically active stars,for which the distribution of starspots on the surface has been inferred fromphotometric and spectroscopic imaging analysis. the study of the surface spotevolution during consecutive rotation cycles will allow first directmeasurements (apart from the sun) of differential rotation which is the centralingredient of magnetic dynamo processes. the vlti will provide baselines of upto 200 m, and two scientific instruments for interferometric studies at near-and mid-infrared wavelengths. imaging capabilities will be made possible byclosure-phase techniques. we conclude that a realistically modeled cool surfacespot can be detected on stars with angular diameters exceeding ~2 mas using thevlti with the first generation instrument amber. the spot parameters can thenbe derived with reasonable accuracy. we discuss that the lack of knowledge ofmagnetically active stars of the required angular size, especially in thesouthern hemisphere, is a current limitation for vlti observations of thesesurface features.

astro-ph;0602517	testing the companion hypothesis for the origin of the x-ray emission  from intermediate-mass main-sequence stars	there is no straightforward explanation for intrinsic x-ray emission fromintermediate-mass main-sequence stars. therefore the observed emission is ofteninterpreted in terms of (hypothesized) late-type magnetically active companionstars. we use chandra imaging observations to spatially resolve in x-rays asample of main-sequence b-type stars with recently discovered companions atarcsecond separation. we find that all spatially resolved companions are x-rayemitters, but seven out of eleven intermediate-mass stars are also x-raysources. if this emission is interpreted in terms of additional sub-arcsecondor spectroscopic companions, this implies a high multiplicity of b-type stars.firm results on b star multiplicity pending, the alternative, that b starsproduce intrinsic x-rays, can not be discarded. the appropriate scenario inthis vein is might be a magnetically confined wind, as suggested for the x-rayemission of the magnetic ap star iq aur. however, the only ap star in thechandra sample is not detected in x-rays, and therefore does not support thispicture.

astro-ph;0702111	on the co-existence of chemically peculiar bp stars, slowly pulsating b  stars and constant b stars in the same part of the h-r diagram	aims. in order to better model massive b-type stars, we need to understandthe physical processes taking place in slowly pulsating b (spb) stars,chemically peculiar bp stars, and non-pulsating normal b stars co-existing inthe same part of the h-r diagram.  methods. we carry out a comparative study between samples of confirmed andwell-studied spb stars and a sample of well-studied bp stars with known periodsand magnetic field strengths. we determine their evolutionary state usingaccurate hipparcos parallaxes and geneva photometry. we discuss the occurrenceand strengths of magnetic fields as well as the occurrence of stellar pulsationamong both groups. further, we make a comparison of geneva photometricvariability for both kinds of stars.  results. the group of bp stars is significantly younger than the group of spbstars. longitudinal magnetic fields in spb stars are weaker than those of bpstars, suggesting that the magnetic field strength is an important factor for btype stars to become chemically peculiar. the strongest magnetic fields appearin young bp stars, indicating a magnetic field decay in stars at advanced ages.rotation periods of bp and pulsation periods of spb stars are of the same orderand the behaviour of geneva photometric variability of some bp stars cannot bedistinguished from the variability of spb stars, illustrating the difficulty tointerpret the observed variability of the order of days for b-type stars. weconsider the possibility that pulsation could be responsible for thevariability among chemically peculiar stars. in particular, we show that anon-linear pulsation model is not excluded by photometry for the bp starhd175362.

astro-ph;0703227	heavy calcium in cp stars	large wavelength shifts of infrared triplet lines of ca ii have been observedin the spectra of hgmn and magnetic ap stars. they have been attributed to theheavy calcium isotopes, including ca-48. one member of the triplet,$\lambda$8542, had been either unavailable, or of poor quality in earlierspectra. the present material shows conclusively that the stellar $\lambda$8542shifts are consistent with an interpretation in terms of ca-48. we find norelation between isotopic shifts of the ca ii triplet lines, and those of hg ii$\lambda$3984. there is a marginal indication that the shifts are {\itanticorrelated} with the surface field strengths of the magnetic stars. we seesparse evidence for ca-48 in other chemically peculiar stars, e.g. am's,metal-poor stars, or chemically peculiar red giants. however, the sample isstill very small, and the wavelengths of all three triplet lines, includingthose in the sun, show slight positive shifts with respect to terrestrialpositions.  some profiles of the ca ii infrared triplet in the magnetic stars showextensive wings beyond a well-defined core. we can obtain reasonable fits tothese profiles using a stratified calcium abundance similar to that used byprevious workers. there is no indication that either the stratification or thezeeman effect significantly disturbs the measurement of isotope shifts.

astro-ph;0703229	detection of variable si ii, mn ii and fe ii emission lines in the  magnetic bp star a centauri	the nature of non-variable high-excitation emission lines detected in theoptical spectra of normal late-b type and chemically peculiar hgmn and pgastars is still poorly understood.  to better understand the origin of the weak emission lines in b type stars itis especially important to investigate the spectra of a variety of stars tosearch for correlations between the emergence of these lines and fundamentalstellar parameters.  we have acquired high resolution uves spectra for the sharp-lined magnetichelium-variable star a cen over the rotation period of 8.82 d to search for thepresence of weak emission lines.  for the first time we present observational evidence for the appearance ofvariable high-excitation si ii, mn ii and fe ii emission lines in a magnetic bpstar. si ii emissions are the strongest at the phase corresponding to themaximum strength of he i lines. mn ii and fe ii emissions vary in antiphase tothe he i lines. a correlation is found between the probable location of mn andfe surface spots and the strength of the emission lines. on the basis of thecurrently available data it seems possible that the same kind of selectiveexcitation process is working in the atmospheres of objects within a broadparameter space which could be defined by age, effective temperature, chemicalcomposition, rotational velocity, and magnetic field. neutral iron linespreviously reported to appear broad and shallow at certain phases are notdetected in our spectra, although two of them are identified as he i forbiddenlines, showing maximum strength at the phase of the passage of the he richregion across the visible disk.
