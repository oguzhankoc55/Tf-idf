0904.3909	astrometric redshifts for quasars	the wavelength dependence of atmospheric refraction causes differentialchromatic refraction (dcr), whereby objects imaged at different optical/uvwavelengths are observed at slightly different positions in the plane of thedetector. strong spectral features induce changes in the effective wavelengthsof broad-band filters that are capable of producing significant positionaloffsets with respect to standard dcr corrections. we examine such offsets forbroad-emission-line (type 1) quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)spanning 0&lt;z&lt;5 and an airmass range of 1.0 to 1.8. these offsets are in goodagreement with those predicted by convolving a composite quasar spectrum withthe sdss bandpasses as a function of redshift and airmass. this astrometricinformation can be used to break degeneracies in photometric redshifts ofquasars (or other emission-line sources) and, for extreme cases, may besuitable for determining "astrometric redshifts". on the sdss's southernequatorial stripe, where it is possible to average many multi-epochmeasurements, more than 60% of quasars have emission-line-induced astrometricoffsets larger than the sdss's relative astrometric errors of 25-35 mas.folding these astrometric offsets into photometric redshift estimates yields animprovement of 9% within delta z+/-0.1. future multi-epoch synoptic surveyssuch as lsst and pan-starrs could benefit from intentionally making ~10observations at relatively high airmass (am~1.4) in order to improve theirphotometric redshifts for quasars.

0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0911.2689	spectro-perfectionism: an algorithmic framework for photon noise-limited  extraction of optical fiber spectroscopy	we describe a new algorithm for the "perfect" extraction of one-dimensionalspectra from two-dimensional (2d) digital images of optical fiberspectrographs, based on accurate 2d forward modeling of the raw pixel data. thealgorithm is correct for arbitrarily complicated 2d point-spread functions(psfs), as compared to the traditional optimal extraction algorithm, which isonly correct for a limited class of separable psfs. the algorithm results instatistically independent extracted samples in the 1d spectrum, and preservesthe full native resolution of the 2d spectrograph without degradation. both thestatistical errors and the 1d resolution of the extracted spectrum areaccurately determined, allowing a correct chi-squared comparison of any modelspectrum with the data. using a model psf similar to that found in the redchannel of the sloan digital sky survey spectrograph, we compare theperformance of our algorithm to that of cross-section based optimal extraction,and also demonstrate that our method allows coaddition and foregroundestimation to be carried out as an integral part of the extraction step. thiswork demonstrates the feasibility of current- and next-generation multi-fiberspectrographs for faint galaxy surveys even in the presence of strong night-skyforegrounds. we describe the handling of subtleties arising from fiber-to-fibercrosstalk, discuss some of the likely challenges in deploying our method to theanalysis of a full-scale survey, and note that our algorithm could begeneralized into an optimal method for the rectification and combination ofastronomical imaging data.

0707.4473	stellar seds from 0.3-2.5 microns: tracing the stellar locus and  searching for color outliers in sdss and 2mass	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and two micron all sky survey (2mass) arerich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure andformation history of the galaxy. as new surveys and instruments adopt similarfilter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of theugrizjhks stellar locus, both to inform studies of `normal' main sequence starsas well as for robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. using asample of ~600,000 point sources detected by sdss and 2mass, we tabulate theposition and width of the ugrizjhks stellar locus as a function of g-i color,and provide accurate polynomial fits. we map the morgan-keenan spectral typesequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectralstandards and by analyzing 3000 sdss stellar spectra with a custom spectraltyping pipeline. we develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimumseparation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and useit to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurioussdss/2mass matches. analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliersidentifies 370 white-dwarf/m dwarf (wdmd) pairs, 93 qsos, and 90 m giant/carbonstar candidates, and demonstrates that wdmd pairs and qsos can be distinguishedon the basis of their j-ks and r-z colors. we also identify a group of objectswith correlated offsets in the u-g vs. g-r and g-r vs. r-i color-color spaces,but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects.future applications of this algorithm to a matched sdss-ukidss catalog may wellidentify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areasof color-magnitude space.

1009.4933	the blue tip of the stellar locus: measuring reddening with the sdss	we present measurements of reddening due to dust using the colors of stars inthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we measure the color of main sequenceturn-off stars by finding the "blue tip" of the stellar locus: the prominentblue edge in the distribution of stellar colors. the method is sensitive tocolor changes of order 18, 12, 7, and 8 mmag of reddening in the colors u-g,g-r, r-i, and i-z, respectively, in regions measuring 90' by 14'. we presentmaps of the blue tip colors in each of these bands over the entire sdssfootprint, including the new dusty southern galactic cap data provided by thesdss-iii. the results disfavor the best fit o'donnell (1994) and cardelli etal. (1989) reddening laws, but are well described by a fitzpatrick (1999)reddening law with r_v = 3.1. the sfd dust map is found to trace the dust well,but overestimates reddening by factors of 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 in u-g, g-r,r-i, and i-z, largely due to the adopted reddening law. in select dusty regionsof the sky, we find evidence for problems in the sfd temperature correction. adust map normalization difference of 15% between the galactic north and southsky may be due to these dust temperature errors.

1011.6392	think outside the color box: probabilistic target selection and the  sdss-xdqso quasar targeting catalog	we present the sdss-xdqso quasar targeting catalog for efficient flux-basedquasar target selection down to the faint limit of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) catalog, even at medium redshifts (2.5 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 3) where the stellarcontamination is significant. we build models of the distributions of stars andquasars in flux space down to the flux limit by applying theextreme-deconvolution method to estimate the underlying density. we convolvethis density with the flux uncertainties when evaluating the probability thatan object is a quasar. this approach results in a targeting algorithm that ismore principled, more efficient, and faster than other similar methods. weapply the algorithm to derive low-redshift (z &lt; 2.2), medium-redshift (2.2 &lt;= z&lt;= 3.5), and high-redshift (z &gt; 3.5) quasar probabilities for all 160,904,060point sources with dereddened i-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag inthe 14,555 deg^2 of imaging from sdss data release 8. the catalog can be usedto define a uniformly selected and efficient low- or medium-redshift quasarsurvey, such as that needed for the sdss-iii's baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey project. we show that the xdqso technique performs as well as thecurrent best photometric quasar-selection technique at low redshift, andoutperforms all other flux-based methods for selecting the medium-redshiftquasars of our primary interest. we make code to reproduce the xdqso quasartarget selection publicly available.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1203.5306	the clustering of intermediate redshift quasars as measured by the  baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	we measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range2.2&lt;z&lt;2.8 using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we use ahomogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopicredshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements atthese redshifts to date. the sample covers 3,600 square degrees, correspondingto a comoving volume of 9.7(gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial lambdacdm cosmology,and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. afteraccounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlationfunction is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm0.5)mpc/h over the range 3&lt;s&lt;25mpc/h. the projected correlation function, whichintegrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fitwell by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)mpc/h over the range4&lt;r&lt;16mpc/h. there is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependenceto the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range inour sample. our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previousmeasurements at similar redshifts. our measurement of the quasar clusteringamplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. we compare thedata to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matterhalos at z~2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit halos with a characteristicmass of &lt;m&gt;~10^{12}msun/h with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 percent.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1301.3459	measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lyman-alpha forest  fluctuations in boss data release 9	we use the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9(dr9) to detect and measure the position of the baryonic acoustic oscillation(bao) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the lyman-alphaforest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. the feature is clearly detectedat significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model andmethod of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent withpredictions of the standard lcdm model. we assess the biases in our method,stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. wefit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple thebroadband and acoustic scale information. for an isotropic dilation factor, wemeasure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0(syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits)with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flatlcdm with omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). when fitting separately for the radial andtransversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1)= -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2} (stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). the dilationfactor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlationcoefficient of ~ -0.55. errors become significantly non-gaussian for deviationsover 3 standard deviations from best fit value. because of the data cuts andanalysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previousbao analysis of the boss dr9 lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an importantconsistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.

1306.5896	the one-dimensional ly-alpha forest power spectrum from boss	we have developed two independent methods to measure the one-dimensionalpower spectrum of the transmitted flux in the lyman-$\alpha$ forest. the firstmethod is based on a fourier transform, and the second on a maximum likelihoodestimator. the two methods are independent and have different systematicuncertainties. the determination of the noise level in the data spectra wassubject to a novel treatment, because of its significant impact on the derivedpower spectrum.  we applied the two methods to 13,821 quasar spectra from sdss-iii/boss dr9selected from a larger sample of over 60,000 spectra on the basis of their highquality, large signal-to-noise ratio, and good spectral resolution. the powerspectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelveredshift bins from $&lt;z&gt; = 2.2$ to $&lt;z&gt; = 4.4$, and scales from 0.001$\rm(km/s)^{-1}$ to $0.02 \rm(km/s)^{-1}$. we determine the methodological andinstrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements.  we provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurementsusing available hydrodynamical simulations. the improvement in precision overpreviously published results from sdss is a factor 2--3 for constraints onrelevant cosmological parameters. for a $\lambda$cdm model and using aconstraint on $h_0$ that encompasses measurements based on the local distanceladder and on cmb anisotropies, we infer $\sigma_8 =0.83\pm0.03$ and $n_s=0.97\pm0.02$ based on \ion{h}{i} absorption in the range $2.1&lt;z&lt;3.7$.

1310.0615	measuring galaxy [oii] emission line doublet with future ground-based  wide-field spectroscopic surveys	the next generation of wide-field spectroscopic redshift surveys will map thelarge-scale galaxy distribution in the redshift range 0.7&lt; z&lt;2 to measurebaryonic acoustic oscillations (bao). the primary optical signature used inthis redshift range comes from the [oii] emission line doublet, which providesa unique redshift identification that can minimize confusion with other singleemission lines. to derive the required spectrograph resolution for theseredshift surveys, we simulate observations of the [oii] (3727,3729) doublet forvarious instrument resolutions, and line velocities. we foresee two strategiesabout the choice of the resolution for future spectrographs for bao surveys.for bright [oii] emitter surveys ([oii] flux ~30.10^{-17} erg /cm2/s likesdss-iv/eboss), a resolution of r~3300 allows the separation of 90 percent ofthe doublets. the impact of the sky lines on the completeness in redshift isless than 6 percent. for faint [oii] emitter surveys ([oii] flux ~10.10^{-17}erg /cm2/s like desi), the detection improves continuously with resolution, sowe recommend the highest possible resolution, the limit being given by thenumber of pixels (4k by 4k) on the detector and the number of spectroscopicchannels (2 or 3).

1312.4611	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: testing gravity with redshift-space distortions using  the power spectrum multipoles	we analyse the anisotropic clustering of the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) cmass data release 11 (dr11) sample, which consists of $690\,827$galaxies in the redshift range $0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ and has a sky coverage of$8\,498\,\text{deg}^2$. we perform our analysis in fourier space using a powerspectrum estimator suggested by yamamoto et al. (2006). we measure themultipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in thesense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and theintegral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic powerspectrum and without the need to split the survey into sub-regions. the maincosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the baryon acousticoscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which aredistorted by the alcock-paczynski effect. together, these signals allow us toconstrain the distance ratio $d_v(z_{\rm eff})/r_s(z_d) = 13.89\pm 0.18$, thealcock-paczynski parameter $f_{\rm ap}(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.679\pm0.031$ and thegrowth rate of structure $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.419\pm0.044$at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. we did not find significantsystematic uncertainties for $d_v/r_s$ or $f_{\rm ap}$ but include a systematicerror for $f\sigma_8$ of $3.1\%$. combining our dataset with planck to testgeneral relativity (gr) through the simple $\gamma$-parameterisation, reveals a$\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the data and the prediction by gr. the tensionbetween our result and gr can be traced back to a tension in the clusteringamplitude $\sigma_8$ between cmass and planck.

1312.4854	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: cosmological implications of the full shape of the  clustering wedges in the data release 10 and 11 galaxy samples	we explore the cosmological implications of the angle-averaged correlationfunction, xi(s), and the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s) and xi_para(s), of thelowz and cmass galaxy samples from data release 10 and 11 of the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. our results show no significantevidence for a deviation from the standard lcdm model. the combination of theinformation from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmicmicrowave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the universeto omega_k = 0.0010 +- 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to sum m_nu &lt; 0.23 ev(95% confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species ton_eff=3.31 +- 0.27, and the dark energy equation of state to w_de = -1.051 +-0.076. these limits are further improved by adding information from type iasupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. in particular,this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent darkenergy equation of state, in which case we find w_de=-1.024 +- 0.052. weexplore the constraints on the growth-rate of cosmic structures assumingf(z)=omega_m(z)^gamma and obtain gamma=0.69 +- 0.15, in agreement with thepredictions from general relativity of gamma=0.55.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1312.4899	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey (boss): measuring growth rate and geometry with  anisotropic clustering	we use the observed anisotropic clustering of galaxies in the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 11 cmass sample to measurethe linear growth rate of structure, the hubble expansion rate and the comovingdistance scale. our sample covers 8498 ${\rm deg}^2$ and encloses an effectivevolume of 6.0 ${\rm gpc}^3$ at an effective redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.57$. wefind $f\sigma_8 = 0.441 \pm 0.044$, $h = 93.1 \pm 3.0\ {\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{mpc}^{-1}}$ and $d_{\rm a} = 1380 \pm 23\ {\rm mpc}$when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. when we fix thebackground expansion to the one predicted by spatially-flat $\lambda$cdm modelin agreement with recent planck results, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.447 \pm 0.028$(6 per cent accuracy). while our measurements are generally consistent with thepredictions of $\lambda$cdm and general relativity, they mildly favor models inwhich the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what ispredicted by general relativity. combining our measurements with recent cosmicmicrowave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmologicalparameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. separatelyvarying these parameters, we find $w = -0.983 \pm 0.075$ (8 per cent accuracy)and $\gamma = 0.69 \pm 0.11$ (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equationof state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. bothconstraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of $w=-1$ and$\gamma = 0.554$.

1404.1801	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly{\alpha} forest of boss dr11  quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in theflux-correlation function of the ly{\alpha} forest of high-redshift quasarswith a statistical significance of five standard deviations. the study uses137,562 quasars in the redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the data release11 (dr11) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of sdss-iii.this sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previousstudies. the measured position of the bao peak determines the angular distance,$d_a(z=2.34)$ and expansion rate, $h(z=2.34)$, both on a scale set by the soundhorizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$. we find$d_a/r_d=11.28\pm0.65(1\sigma)^{+2.8}_{-1.2}(2\sigma)$ and$d_h/r_d=9.18\pm0.28(1\sigma)\pm0.6(2\sigma)$ where $d_h=c/h$. the optimalcombination, $\sim d_h^{0.7}d_a^{0.3}/r_d$ is determined with a precision of$\sim2\%$. for the value $r_d=147.4~{\rm mpc}$, consistent with the cmb powerspectrum measured by planck, we find $d_a(z=2.34)=1662\pm96(1\sigma)~{\rm mpc}$and $h(z=2.34)=222\pm7(1\sigma)~{\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$. tests with mockcatalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematicuncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. our results agree with thepreviously reported bao measurement at the same redshift using thequasar-ly{\alpha} forest cross-correlation. the auto-correlation andcross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite differentimpact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. the combinedconstraints from the two correlation functions imply values of $d_a/r_d$ and$d_h/r_d$ that are, respectively, 7% low and 7% high compared to thepredictions of a flat $\lambda$cdm cosmological model with the best-fit planckparameters. with our estimated statistical errors, the significance of thisdiscrepancy is $\approx 2.5\sigma$.

1410.7397	wise photometry for 400 million sdss sources	we present photometry of images from the wide-field infrared survey explorer(wise; wright et al. 2010) of over 400 million sources detected by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss; york et al. 2000). we use a "forced photometry"technique, using measured sdss source positions, star-galaxy separation andgalaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in thewise images. we perform photometry with the tractor image modeling code,working on our "unwise" coaddds and taking account of the wise point-spreadfunction and a noise model. the result is a measurement of the flux of eachsdss source in each wise band. many sources have little flux in the wise bands,so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero. however, for manysources we get three- or four-sigma measurements; these sources would not bereported by the wise pipeline and will not appear in the wise catalog, yet theycan be highly informative for some scientific questions. in addition, thesesmall-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at catalog level.the forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistentset of sources between sdss and wise, taking advantage of the resolution anddepth of the sdss images to interpret the wise images; objects that areresolved in sdss but blended together in wise still have accurate measurementsin our photometry. our results, and the code used to produce them, are publiclyavailable at http://unwise.me.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1504.04088	large-scale clustering of lyman-alpha emission intensity from sdss/boss	(abridged) we detect the large-scale structure of lya emission in theuniverse at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of lya surfacebrightness with quasars in sdss/boss. we use a million spectra targetingluminous red galaxies at z&lt;0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxyspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift lya surfacebrightness. the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shapeconsistent with a lambdacdm model with omega_m =0.30^+0.10-0.07. the predictedamplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the meanlya surface brightness, &lt;mu_alpha&gt;, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and thequasar and lya emission bias factors. using known values, we infer&lt;mu_alpha&gt;(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 a^-1 arcsec^-2,where b_alpha is the lya emission bias factor. if the dominant sources of lyaemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_sfr = (0.28 +/- 0.07)(3/b_alpha) /yr/mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. for b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected lya emitters,although consistent with the total rho_sfr derived from dust-corrected,continuum uv surveys. 97% of the lya emission in the universe at theseredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of lya emitters. ourmeasurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halossurrounding previously detected lya emitters, but we speculate that it arisesfrom similar lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. we alsodetect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation,finding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,consistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (zheng et al.(2011)). our measurements represent the first application of the intensitymapping technique to optical observations.

0805.1931	the sloan lens acs survey. v. the full acs strong-lens sample	we present the definitive data for the full sample of 131 stronggravitational lens candidates observed with the advanced camera for surveys(acs) aboard the hubble space telescope by the sloan lens acs (slacs) survey.all targets were selected for higher-redshift emission lines and lower-redshiftcontinuum in a single sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectrum. the foregroundgalaxies are primarily of early-type morphology, with redshifts fromapproximately 0.05 to 0.5 and velocity dispersions from 160 km/s to 400 km/s;the faint background emission-line galaxies have redshifts ranging from about0.2 to 1.2. we confirm 70 systems showing clear evidence of multiple imaging ofthe background galaxy by the foreground galaxy, as well as an additional 19systems with probable multiple imaging. for 63 clear lensing systems, wepresent singular isothermal ellipsoid and light-traces-mass gravitational lensmodels fitted to the acs imaging data. these strong-lensing mass measurementsare supplemented by magnitudes and effective radii measured from acssurface-brightness photometry and redshifts and velocity dispersions measuredfrom sdss spectroscopy. these data constitute a unique resource for thequantitative study of the inter-relations between mass, light, and kinematicsin massive early-type galaxies. we show that the slacs lens sample isstatistically consistent with being drawn at random from a parent sample ofsdss galaxies with comparable spectroscopic parameters and effective radii,suggesting that the results of slacs analyses can be generalized to the massiveearly-type population.

0805.1932	the sloan lens acs survey. vii. elliptical galaxy scaling laws from  direct observational mass measurements	we use a sample of 53 massive early-type strong gravitational lens galaxieswith well-measured redshifts (ranging from z=0.06 to 0.36) and stellar velocitydispersions (between 175 and 400 km/s) from the sloan lens acs (slacs) surveyto derive numerous empirical scaling relations. the ratio between centralstellar velocity dispersion and isothermal lens-model velocity dispersion isnearly unity within errors. the slacs lenses define a fundamental plane (fp)that is consistent with the fp of the general population of early-typegalaxies. we measure the relationship between strong-lensing mass m_lens withinone-half effective radius (r_e/2) and the dimensional mass variable m_dim =g^-1 sigma_e2^2 r_e/2 to be log_10 [m_lens/10^11 m_sun] = (1.03 +/- 0.04)log_10 [m_dim/10^11 m_sun] + (0.54 +/- 0.02) (where sigma_e2 is the projectedstellar velocity dispersion within r_e/2). the near-unity slope indicates thatthe mass-dynamical structure of massive elliptical galaxies is independent ofmass, and that the "tilt" of the slacs fp is due entirely to variation in total(luminous plus dark) mass-to-light ratio with mass. our results imply thatdynamical masses serve as a good proxies for true masses in massive ellipticalgalaxies. regarding the slacs lenses as a homologous population, we find thatthe average enclosed 2d mass profile goes as log_10 [m(&lt;r)/m_dim] = (1.10 +/-0.09) log_10 [r/r_e] + (0.85 +/- 0.03), consistent with an isothermal (flatrotation curve) model when de-projected into 3d. this measurement isinconsistent with the slope of the average projected aperture luminosityprofile at a confidence level greater than 99.9%, implying a minimumdark-matter fraction of f_dm = 0.38 +/- 0.07 within one effective radius.(abridged)

astro-ph;0004175	detection of a far ir excess with dirbe at 60 and 100 microns	from analysis of the dirbe weekly averaged sky maps, we have detectedsubstantial flux in the 60 and 100 micron channels in excess of expectedzodiacal and galactic emission. two methods are used to separate zodiacal lightfrom more distant emission. method i makes use of the time-dependence of thenorth-south annual variation observed at the ecliptic poles. this method isrobust against errors in the inter-planetary dust (ipd) model, but does notdemonstrate isotropy of the background. method ii measures the eclipticlatitude dependence of the dust over a range of ecliptic latitudes at solarelongation e=90 degrees. this allows the excess to be determined in each weekof the dirbe mission for high redundancy, but the results depend weakly on theipd model. both methods give consistent results at 60 and 100 microns. theobserved signal is consistent with an isotropic background at the level \nui_\nu = 28.1 +- 1.8 +- 7(syst) nw/m^2/sr at 60 microns and 24.6 +- 2.5 +- 8nw/m^2/sr at 100 microns.  the ir excess detected at 140 and 240 microns by these methods agrees withprevious measurements, which are thought to be the cosmic infra-red background(cib). the detections at 60 and 100 microns are new. while this new excess isnot necessarily the cib, we have ruled out all known sources of emission in thesolar system and galaxy. we therefore tentatively interpret this signal as thecib and consider the implications of such energy production from the viewpointof star formation efficiency and black hole accretion efficiency. however, their excess exceeds limits on the cib derived from the inferred opacity of theigm to observed tev photons, thus casting doubt on this interpretation. thereis currently no satisfactory explanation for the 60-100 micron excess.

astro-ph;0205243	estimating fixed frame galaxy magnitudes in the sdss	broad-band measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measuredifferent regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. certain astronomicalquestions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies,require transforming these magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. toprepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail insubsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (seds) to broad bandphotometric observations, in the context of the optical observations of thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). linear combinations of four spectral templatescan reproduce the five sdss magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of thephotometry. expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of thecoefficients multiplying the templates is planar, and in fact nearly linear.the resulting reconstructed seds can be used to recover fixed frame magnitudesover a range of redshifts. this process yields consistent results, in the sensethat within each sample the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies arenearly constant with redshift. we compare our results to simpler interpolationmethods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the sdss. the software that generatesthese results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide rangeof galaxy observations.

astro-ph;0501042	active galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey: ii.  emission-line luminosity function	the emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (agn) ismeasured from about 3000 agn included in the main galaxy sample of the sloandigital sky survey within a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.15$. the $\ha$ and[oiii]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for seyferts cover luminosity rangeof $10^{5-9}$$l_\odot$ in h$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken powerlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. assuming a universalconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred bband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the agn luminosityfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity functionderived from the 2df redshift survey. the inferred agn number density isapproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the totallight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. the numbersof seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at highluminosity, seyfert 1s outnumber seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. in making theluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity isindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it aposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. given the relationshipbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack ofcorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variablethat determines the agn luminosity is the eddington ratio, not the black holemass. this appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likelyto be shining near the eddington limit.

astro-ph;0504535	binary quasars in the sloan digital sky survey: evidence for excess  clustering on small scales	we present a sample of 218 new quasar pairs with proper transverseseparations r_prop &lt; 1 mpc/h over the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, discoveredfrom an extensive follow up campaign to find companions around the sloandigital sky survey and 2df quasar redshift survey quasars. this sample includes26 new binary quasars with separations r_prop &lt; 50 kpc/h (theta &lt; 10arcseconds), more than doubling the number of such systems known. we define astatistical sample of binaries selected with homogeneous criteria and computeits selection function, taking into account sources of incompleteness. thefirst measurement of the quasar correlation function on scales 10 kpc/h &lt;r_prop &lt; 400 kpc/h is presented. for r_prop &lt; 40 kpc/h, we detect an order ofmagnitude excess clustering over the expectation from the large scale r_prop &gt;3 mpc/h quasar correlation function, extrapolated down as a power law to theseparations probed by our binaries. the excess grows to ~ 30 at r_prop ~ 10kpc/h, and provides compelling evidence that the quasar autocorrelationfunction gets progressively steeper on sub-mpc scales. this small scale excesscan likely be attributed to dissipative interaction events which trigger quasaractivity in rich environments. recent small scale measurements of galaxyclustering and quasar-galaxy clustering are reviewed and discussed in relationto our measurement of small scale quasar clustering.

astro-ph;0603742	quasars probing quasars i: optically thick absorbers near luminous  quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we search 149 moderate resolution background quasar spectra, from gemini, keck,the mmt, and the sdss to survey lyman limit systems (llss) and damped ly-alphasystems (dlas) in the vicinity of 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 4.0 luminous foreground quasars. asample of 27 new quasar-absorber pairs is uncovered with column densities, 17.2&lt; log (n_hi/cm^2) &lt; 20.9, and transverse (proper) distances of 22 kpc/h &lt; r &lt;1.7 mpc/h, from the foreground quasars. if they emit isotropically, the impliedionizing photon fluxes are a factor of ~ 5-8000 times larger than the ambientextragalactic uv background over this range of distances. the observedprobability of intercepting an absorber is very high for small separations: sixout of eight projected sightlines with transverse separations r &lt; 150 kpc/hhave an absorber coincident with the foreground quasar, of which four have logn_hi &gt; 10^19. the covering factor of log n_hi &gt; 10^19 absorbers is thus ~ 50 %(4/8) on these small scales, whereas &lt; 2% would have been expected at random.there are many cosmological applications of these new sightlines: they providelaboratories for studying fluorescent ly-alpha recombination radiation fromllss, constrain the environments, emission geometry, and radiative histories ofquasars, and shed light on the physical nature of llss and dlas.

astro-ph;9710327	maps of dust ir emission for use in estimation of reddening and cmbr  foregrounds	we present a full sky 100 micron map that is a reprocessed composite of thecobe/dirbe and iras/issa maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed pointsources removed. before using the issa maps, we remove the remaining artifactsfrom the iras scan pattern. using the dirbe 100 micron and 240 micron data, wehave constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map canbe converted to a map proportional to dust column density. the result of thesemanipulations is a map with dirbe-quality calibration and iras resolution.  to generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal lightcontamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (cib). this isdone via a regression analysis of the 100 micron dirbe map against the leiden-dwingeloo map of h_i emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via asuitable expansion of the dirbe 25 micron flux. for the 100 micron map, nosignificant cib is detected. in the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where thezodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the cib at surprisingly high fluxlevels of 32 \pm 13 nw/m^2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 \pm 4 nw/m^2/sr at 240micron (95% confidence). this integrated flux is ~2 times that extrapolatedfrom optical galaxies in the hubble deep field.  the primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of galacticextinction. we demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the olderburstein-heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. these dustmaps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminatescmbr experiments and for estimating soft x-ray absorption.

astro-ph;9905128	extrapolation of galactic dust emission at 100 microns to cmbr  frequencies using firas	we present predicted full-sky maps of submillimeter and microwave emissionfrom the diffuse interstellar dust in the galaxy. these maps are extrapolatedfrom the 100 micron emission and 100/240 micron flux ratio maps that schlegel,finkbeiner, &amp; davis (1998; sfd98) generated from iras and cobe/dirbe data.results are presented for a number of physically plausible emissivity models.  we find that no power law emissivity function fits the firas data from 200 -2100 ghz. in this paper we provide a formalism for a multi-component model forthe dust emission. a two-component model with a mixture of silicate andcarbon-dominated grains (motivated by pollack et al., 1994}) provides a fit toan accuracy of about 15% to all the firas data over the entire high-latitudesky. small systematic differences are found between the atomic and molecularphases of the ism.  our predictions for the thermal (vibrational) emission from galactic dust at\nu &lt; 3000 ghz are available for general use. these full-sky predictions can bemade at the dirbe resolution of 40' or at the higher resolution of 6.1 arcminfrom the sfd98 dirbe-corrected iras maps.
