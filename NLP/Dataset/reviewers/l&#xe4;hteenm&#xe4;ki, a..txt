1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2040	planck early results. v. the low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the processing of data from the low frequency instrument (lfi)used in production of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc). in particular, we discuss the steps involved in reducing the data fromtelemetry packets to cleaned, calibrated, time-ordered data (tod) and frequencymaps. data are continuously calibrated using the modulation of the temperatureof the cosmic microwave background radiation induced by the motion of thespacecraft. noise properties are estimated from tod from which the sky signalhas been removed using a generalized least square map-making algorithm.measured 1/f noise knee-frequencies range from 100mhz at 30ghz to a few tens ofmhz at 70ghz. a destriping code (madam) is employed to combine radiometric dataand pointing information into sky maps, minimizing the variance of correlatednoise. noise covariance matrices required to compute statistical uncertaintieson lfi and planck products are also produced. main beams are estimated down tothe approx -10db level using jupiter transits, which are also used forgeometrical calibration of the focal plane.

1101.2041	planck early results. vii. the early release compact source catalog	(abridged) a brief description of the methodology of construction, contentsand usage of the planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc),including the early cold cores (ecc) and the early sunyaev-zeldovich (esz)cluster catalogue is provided. the catalogue is based on data that consist ofmapping the entire sky once and 60% of the sky a second time by planck, therebycomprising the first high sensitivity radio/submillimetre observations of theentire sky. a monte-carlo algorithm based on the injection and extraction ofartificial sources into the planck maps was implemented to select reliablesources among all extracted candidates such that the cumulative reliability ofthe catalogue is &gt;=90%. the 10sigma photometric flux density limit of thecatalogue at |b|&gt;30 deg is 0.49, 1.0, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33, 0.28, 0.25, 0.47 and0.82 jy at each of the nine frequencies between 30 and 857 ghz. sources whichare up to a factor of ~2 fainter than this limit, and which are present in"clean" regions of the galaxy where the sky background due to emission from theinterstellar medium is low, are included in the ercsc if they meet the highreliability criterion. the planck ercsc sources have known associations tostars with dust shells, stellar cores, radio galaxies, blazars, infraredluminous galaxies and galactic interstellar medium features. a significantfraction of unclassified sources are also present in the catalogs. in addition,two early release catalogs that contain 915 cold molecular cloud corecandidates and 189 sz cluster candidates that have been generated usingmulti-frequency algorithms are presented. the entire source list, with morethan 15000 unique sources, is ripe for follow-up characterisation withherschel, atca, vla, sofia, alma and other ground-based observing facilities.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1106.1376	planck early results xxvi: detection with planck and confirmation by  xmm-newton of plck g266.6-27.3, an exceptionally x-ray luminous and massive  galaxy cluster at z~1	we present first results on plck g266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the planck all sky survey. anxmm-newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. with these x-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be m_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. plck g266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of l_x(0.5-2.0 kev)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z &gt; 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, plck g266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. this observationconfirms planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

1107.1093	the long-lasting activity of 3c 454.3. gasp-webt and satellite  observations in 2008-2010	we present multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 from april 2008 to march2010. the radio to optical data are mostly from the gasp-webt, uv and x-raydata from swift, and gamma-ray data from the agile and fermi satellites. weimproved the calibration of optical-uv data from the uvot and om instrumentsand estimated the lyalpha flux to disentangle the contributions from differentcomponents in this spectral region. the observations reveal prominentvariability above 8 ghz. in the optical-uv band, the variability amplitudedecreases with increasing frequency due to a steadier radiation from both abroad line region and an accretion disc. the optical flux reaches nearly thesame levels in the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 observing seasons; the mm one showssimilar behaviour, whereas the gamma and x-ray flux levels rise in the secondperiod. two prominent gamma-ray flares in mid 2008 and late 2009 show adouble-peaked structure, with a variable gamma/optical flux ratio. the x-rayflux variations seem to follow the gamma-ray and optical ones by about 0.5 and1 d, respectively. we interpret the multifrequency behaviour in terms of aninhomogeneous curved jet, where synchrotron radiation of increasing wavelengthis produced in progressively outer and wider jet regions, which can changetheir orientation in time. in particular, we assume that the long-termvariability is due to this geometrical effect. by combining the optical and mmlight curves to fit the gamma and x-ray ones, we find that the gamma (x-ray)emission may be explained by inverse-comptonisation of synchrotron optical (ir)photons by their parent relativistic electrons (ssc process). a slight,variable misalignment between the synchrotron and comptonisation zones wouldexplain the increased gamma and x-ray flux levels in 2009-2010, as well as thechange in the gamma/optical flux ratio during the outbursts peaks.

1109.5844	correlation between fermi/lat gamma-ray and 37 ghz radio properties of  northern agn averaged over 11 months	although the fermi mission has increased our knowledge of gamma-ray agn, manyquestions remain, such as the site of gamma-ray production, the emissionmechanism, and the factors that govern the strength of the emission. using datafrom a high radio band, 37 ghz, uncontaminated by other radiation componentsbesides the jet emission, we study these questions with averaged flux densitiesover the the first year of fermi operations. we look for possible correlationsbetween the 100 mev - 100 gev band used by the fermi satellite and 37 ghz radioband observed at the aalto university metsahovi radio telescope, as well as fordifferences between the gamma-ray emission of different agn subsamples. we usedata averaged over the 1fgl period. our sample includes 249 northern agn,including a complete sample of 68 northern agn with a measured average fluxdensity exceeding 1 jy. we find significant correlation between both the fluxdensities and luminosities in gamma and radio bands. the fermi luminosity isinversely correlated with the peak frequency of the synchrotron component ofthe agn spectral energy distributions. we also calculate the gamma dominances,defined as the ratio between the gamma and radio flux densities, and find anindication that high-energy blazars are more gamma-dominated than low-energyblazars. after studying the distributions of gamma and radio luminosities, itis clear that bl lacertae objects are different from quasars, withsignificantly lower luminosities. it is unclear whether this is an intrinsicdifference, an effect of variable relativistic boosting across the synchrotronpeak frequency range, or the result of fermi being more sensitive to hardspectrum sources like bl lacertae objects. our results suggest that the gammaradiation is produced co-spatially with the 37 ghz emission, i.e., in the jet.

1111.4960	agile detection of cygnus x-3 {\gamma}-ray active states during the  period mid-2009/mid-2010	cygnus x-3 (cyg x-3) is a well-known microquasar producing variable emissionat all wavelengths. cyg x-3 is a prominent x-ray binary producing relativisticjets, and studying its high energy emission is crucial for the understanding ofthe fundamental acceleration processes in accreting compact objects. aims. ourgoal is to study extreme particle acceleration and {\gamma}-ray productionabove 100 mev during special spectral states of cyg x- 3 usually characterizedby a low hard x-ray flux and enhanced soft x-ray states. we observed cyg x-3with the agile satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 jun.-jul., and2009 nov.-2010 jul. we report here the results of the agile {\gamma}-raymonitoring of cyg x-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelengthcampaigns involving radio (ratan-600, ami-la and mets\"{a}hovi radioobservatories) and x-ray monitoring data (xte and swift). we detect a series ofrepeated {\gamma}-ray flaring activity from cyg x-3 that correlate with thesoft x-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard x-rayemission. furthermore, we detect {\gamma}-ray enhanced emission that tends tobe associated with radio flares greater than 1 jy at 15 ghz, confirming a trendalready detected in previous observations. the source remained active above 100mev for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 jun.-jul. and 1month in 2010 may). we study in detail the short timescale {\gamma}-ray flaresthat occurred before or near the radio peaks. our results confirm the transientnature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar cyg x-3. aseries of repeated {\gamma}-ray flares shows correlations with radio and x-rayemission confirming a well established trend of emission. we compare ourresults with fermi-lat and magic tev observations of cyg x-3.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1211.2608	the simultaneous low state spectral energy distribution of 1es 2344+514  from radio to very high energies	[abridged] context. to construct and interpret the spectral energydistribution (sed) of bl lacertae objects, simultaneous broad-band observationsare mandatory. aims. we present the results of a dedicated multi-wavelengthstudy of the high-frequency peaked bl lacertae (hbl) object and known tevemitter 1es 2344+514 by means of a pre-organised campaign. methods. theobservations were conducted during simultaneous visibility windows of magic andagile in late 2008. the measurements were complemented by mets\"ahovi,ratan-600, kva+tuorla, swift and vlba pointings. additional coverage wasprovided by the ongoing long-term f-gamma and mojave programs, the ovro 40-mand crao telescopes as well as the fermi satellite. the obtained seds aremodelled using a one-zone as well as a self-consistent two-zone synchrotronself-compton model. results. 1es 2344+514 was found at very low flux states inboth x-rays and very high energy gamma rays. variability was detected in thelow frequency radio and x-ray bands only, where for the latter a small flarewas observed. the x-ray flare was possibly caused by shock accelerationcharacterised by similar cooling and acceleration time scales. mojave vlbamonitoring reveals a static jet whose components are stable over time scales ofeleven years, contrary to previous findings. there appears to be no significantcorrelation between the 15 ghz and r-band monitoring light curves. theobservations presented here constitute the first multi-wavelength campaign on1es 2344+514 from radio to vhe energies and one of the few simultaneous sedsduring low activity states. the quasi-simultaneous fermi-lat data poses somechallenges for sed modelling, but in general the seds are described well byboth applied models. the resulting parameters are typical for tev emittinghbls. consequently it remains unclear whether a so-called quiescent state wasfound in this campaign.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1301.5839	planck intermediate results. xii: diffuse galactic components in the  gould belt system	we perform an analysis of the diffuse low-frequency galactic components inthe southern part of the gould belt system (130^\circ\leq l\leq 230^\circ and-50^\circ\leq b\leq -10^\circ). strong ultra-violet (uv) flux coming from thegould belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds thatwe observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve ourknowledge of the galactic emission. free-free emission and anomalous microwaveemission (ame) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu &lt; 40 ghz),while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. we separate diffusefree-free emission and ame from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emissionby using planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the "correlatedcomponent analysis" (cca) component separation method and we compare with theresults of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.we estimate the electron temperature t_e from h$\alpha$ and free-free emissionusing two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and weobtain t_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 k, for an effective fraction of absorbingdust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). we estimate the frequencyspectrum of the diffuse ame and we recover a peak frequency (in flux densityunits) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 ghz. we verify the reliability of this result withrealistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral modelfor the ame and in the free-free template. by combining physical models forvibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from thethermal dust spectrum from planck and iras we are able to get a gooddescription of the frequency spectrum of the ame for plausible values of thelocal density and radiation field.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5063	planck 2013 results. ii. low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the data processing pipeline of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi) data processing centre (dpc) to create and characterizefull-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44 and 70ghz. in particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,starting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. data are continuouslycalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. skysignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based onsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. noise propertiesare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. a destriping code(madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information intosky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. noise covariancematrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on lfi and planckproducts, are also produced. main beams are estimated down to the -20 db levelusing jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration ofthe focal plane.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1401.0464	magic long-term study of the distant tev blazar pks 1424+240 in a  multiwavelength context	we present a study of the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-rayemission of the blazar pks 1424+240 observed with the magic telescopes. theprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization andmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recentdiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z &gt; 0.6 and makes it a promisingcandidate to be the most distant vhe source. the source has been observed withthe magic telescopes in vhe gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 hfrom 2009 to 2011. the source was marginally detected in vhe gamma rays during2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an opticaloutburst in 2011. the combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2sigma. the differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can bedescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0+/- 1.7. the magic spectra corrected for the absorption due to theextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, withthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the fermi-lat. theabsorption-corrected magic spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to400 gev. the multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio andoptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of thejet. the large separation between the two peaks of the constructednon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely highdoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-compton model is applied. wefind that a two-component synchrotron self-compton model describes the spectralenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

1403.4723	planck intermediate results. xviii the millimetre and sub-millimetre  emission from planetary nebulae	late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-lossevents whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (cse).planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on asample of galactic planetary nebulae (pne) in the important and relativelyunexplored observational band between 30 and 857ghz. planck enables theassembly of comprehensive pne spectral energy distributions (seds) from radio{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. modelling of the derived seds provides uswith information on physical properties of cses and the mass content of bothmain components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-ir emission. in particular,the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. such quantities havealso been estimated for the very young pn crl618, where the strong variabilityobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented theconstruction of its sed. a morphological study of the helix nebula has alsobeen performed. planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatialdistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify differentcomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope isinteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1501.07407	a combined radio and gev gamma-ray view of the 2012 and 2013 flares of  mrk 421	in 2012 markarian 421 underwent the largest flare ever observed in thisblazar at radio frequencies. in the present study, we start exploring thisunique event and compare it to a less extreme event in 2013. we use 15 ghzradio data obtained with the owens valley radio observatory 40-m telescope, 95ghz millimeter data from the combined array for research in millimeter-waveastronomy, and gev gamma-ray data from the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. theradio light curves during the flaring periods in 2012 and 2013 have verydifferent appearances, both in shape and peak flux density. assuming that theradio and gamma-ray flares are physically connected, we attempt to model themost prominent sub-flares of the 2012 and 2013 activity periods by using thesimplest possible theoretical framework. we first fit a one-zone synchrotronself-compton (ssc) model to the less extreme 2013 flare and estimate parametersdescribing the emission region. we then model the major gamma-ray and radioflares of 2012 using the same framework. the 2012 gamma-ray flare shows twodistinct spikes of similar amplitude, so we examine scenarios associating theradio flare with each spike in turn. in the first scenario, we cannot explainthe sharp radio flare with a simple ssc model, but we can accommodate this byadding plausible time variations to the doppler beaming factor. in the secondscenario, a varying doppler factor is not needed, but the ssc model parametersrequire fine tuning. both alternatives indicate that the sharp radio flare, ifphysically connected to the preceding gamma-ray flares, can be reproduced onlyfor a very specific choice of parameters.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1503.02980	the high energy spectrum of 3c 273	aims. the high energy spectrum of 3c 273 is usually understood in terms ofinverse-compton emission in a relativistic leptonic jet. this model predictsvariability patterns and delays that could be tested with simultaneousobservations from the radio to the gev range. methods. the instruments ibis,spi, jem-x on board integral, pca on board rxte, and lat on board fermi haveenough sensitivity to follow the spectral variability of 3c 273 from the kev tothe gev. we looked for correlations between the different energy bands,including radio data at 37 ghz collected at the mets\"ahovi radio observatoryand built quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength spectra in the high energy domainwhen the source is flaring either in the x-rays or in the {\gamma} rays.results. both temporal and spectral analysis suggest a two-component model toexplain the complete high energy spectrum. x-ray emission is likely dominatedby a seyfert-like component while the {\gamma}-ray emission is dominated by ablazar-like component produced by the relativistic jet. the variability of theblazar-like component is discussed, comparing the spectral parameters in thetwo different spectral states. changes of the electron lorentz factor are foundto be the most likely source of the observed variability.

1507.04287	locating the gamma-ray emission site in fermi/lat blazars from  correlation analysis between 37 ghz radio and gamma-ray light curves	we address the highly debated issue of constraining the gamma-ray emissionregion in blazars from cross-correlation analysis using discrete correlationfunction between radio and gamma-ray light curves. the significance of thecorrelations is evaluated using two different approaches: simulating lightcurves and mixed source correlations. the cross-correlation analysis yielded 26sources with significant correlations. in most of the sources, the gamma-raypeaks lead the radio with time lags in the range +20 and +690 days, whereas insources 1633+382 and 3c 345 we find the radio emission to lead the gamma raysby -15 and -40 days, respectively. apart from the individual source study, westacked the correlations of all sources and also those based on sub-samples.the time lag from the stacked correlation is +80 days for the whole sample andthe distance travelled by the emission region corresponds to 7 pc. we alsocompared the start times of activity in radio and gamma rays of the correlatedflares using bayesian block representation. this shows that most of the flaresat both wavebands start at almost the same time, implying a co-spatial originof the activity. the correlated sources show more flares and are brighter inboth bands than the uncorrelated ones.

0805.3411	the multiwavelength variability of 3c 273	we present an update of 3c 273's database hosted by the isdc, completed withdata from radio to gamma-ray observations over the last 10 years. we use thislarge data set to study the multiwavelength properties of thisquasar,especially focussing on its variability behaviour. we study theamplitude of the variations and the maximum variability time scales across thebroad-band spectrum and correlate the light curves in different bands,specifically with the x-rays, to search for possible connections between theemission at different energies. 3c 273 shows variability at all frequencies,with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being thesignatures of the different emission mechanisms. the variability properties ofthe x-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly aseyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timingproperties to account for the x-ray emission below and above ~20 kev. thedominant hard x-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons acceleratedby the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with theflaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescalevariations in the optical. this optical component is consistent with beingoptically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hardx-rays would be produced through inverse compton processes (ssc and/or ec) bythe same electron population. we show evidence that this synchrotron componentextends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended byemission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-yearfrom the ultraviolet source.

1511.02654	locating the gamma-ray emission site in fermi/lat blazars. ii  multifrequency correlations	in an attempt to constrain and understand the emission mechanism of gammarays, we perform a cross-correlation analysis of 15 blazars using light curvesin millimetre, optical and gamma rays. we use discrete correlation function andconsider only correlations significant at 99 per cent level. a strongcorrelation was found between 37 and 95 ghz with a near-zero time delay in mostof the sources, and ~1 month or longer in the rest. a similar result wasobtained between the optical and gamma-ray bands. of the 15 sources, less than50 per cent showed a strong correlation between the millimetre and gamma-ray ormillimetre and optical bands. the primary reason for the lack of statisticallysignificant correlation is the absence of a major outburst in the millimetrebands of most of the sources during the 2.5 yr time period investigated in ourstudy. this may indicate that only the long-term variations or large flares arecorrelated between these bands. the variability of the sources at everywaveband was also inspected using fractional rms variability. the fractionalrms variability displays an increase with frequency reaching its maximum in thegamma rays.

1512.00192	multiwavelength survey of a sample of flat-spectrum radio-loud  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we report on a multiwavelength survey of a sample of 42 flat-spectrumradio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s). this is the largest knownsample of this type of active galactic nucleus (agn) to date. we found that 17%of sources were detected at high-energy gamma rays (e&gt;100 mev), and 90% atx-rays (0.3-10 kev). the masses of the central black holes are in the range$\sim 10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than the values of blazars. the diskluminosities are about 1-49% of the eddington value, with one outlier at 0.3%,comparable with the luminosities observed in flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). the jet powers are $\sim 10^{42-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable with bllac objects, yet relatively smaller than fsrqs. however, once renormalized bythe mass of the central black hole, the jet powers of rlnls1s, bl lacs, andfsrqs are consistent each other, indicating the scalability of the jets. wefound episodes of extreme variability at high energies on time scales of hours.in some cases, dramatic spectral and flux changes are interpreted as theinterplay between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk. we concludethat, despite the distinct observational properties, the central engines ofrlnls1s are similar to those of blazars.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

0811.4278	doppler factors, lorentz factors and viewing angles for quasars, bl  lacertae objects and radio galaxies	we have calculated variability doppler boosting factors, lorentz factors, andviewing angles for a large sample of sources by using total flux densityobservations at 22 and 37 ghz and vlbi data. we decomposed the flux curves intoexponential flares and determined the variability brightness temperatures ofthe fastest flares. by assuming the same intrinsic brightness temperature foreach source, we calculated the doppler boosting factors for 87 sources. inaddition we used new apparent jet speed data to calculate the lorentz factorsand viewing angles for 67 sources. we find that all quasars in our sample aredoppler-boosted and that the doppler boosting factors of bl lacertae objectsare lower than of quasars. the new lorentz factors are about twice as high asin earlier studies, which is mainly due to higher apparent speeds in ouranalyses. the jets of bl lacertae objects are slower than of quasars. there aresome extreme sources with very high derived lorentz factors of the order of ahundred. these high lorentz factors could be real. it is also possible that thesources exhibit such rapid flares that the fast variations have remainedundetected in monitoring programmes, or else the sources have a complicated jetstructure that is not amenable to our simple analysis. almost all the sourcesare seen in a small viewing angle of less than 20 degrees. our results followthe predictions of basic unification schemes for agn.
