0901.2277	the molecular environment of the massive star forming region ngc 2024:  multi co transition analysis	ngc 2024, a sites of massive star formation, have complex internal structurescaused by cal heating by young stars, outflows, and stellar winds. thesecomplex cloud structures lead to intricate emission line shapes. the goal ofthis paper is to show that the complex line shapes of 12 co lines in ngc 2024can be explained consistently with a model, whose temperature and velocitystructure are based on the well-established scenario of a pdr and the blistermodel. we present velocity-resolved spectra of seven co lines ranging from j=3to j=13, and we combined these data with co high-frequency data from the isosatellite. we find that the bulk of the molecular cloud associated with ngc2024 consists of warm (75 k) and dense (9e5 cm-3) gas. an additional hot (~ 300k) component, located at the interface of the hii region and the molecularcloud, is needed to explain the emission of the high-j co lines. deepabsorption notches indicate that very cold material (20 k) exists in front ofthe warm material, too. a temperature and column density structure consistentwith those predicted by pdr models, combined with the velocity structure of ablister model, appropriately describes the observed emission line profiles ofthis massive star forming region. this case study of ngc 2024 shows that, withphysical insights into these complex regions and careful modeling, multi-lineobservations of co can be used to derive detailed physical conditions inmassive star forming regions.

0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0908.3446	apex-champ+ high-j co observations of low-mass young stellar objects:  ii. distribution and origin of warm molecular gas	the origin and heating mechanisms of warm (50&lt;t&lt;200 k) molecular gas inlow-mass young stellar objects (ysos) are strongly debated. both passiveheating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as wellas active heating by shocks and by uv associated with the outflows or accretionhave been proposed. we aim to characterize the warm gas within protostellerobjects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolaroutflows and the quiescent cloud. high-j co maps (12co j=6--5 and 7--6) of theimmediate surroundings (up to 10,000 au) of eight low-mass ysos are obtainedwith the champ+ 650/850 ghz array receiver mounted on the apex telescope. inaddition, isotopologue observations of the 13co j=6--5 transition and [c i]3p_2-3p_1 line were taken. strong quiescent narrow-line 12co 6--5 and 7--6emission is seen toward all protostars. in the case of hh~46 and ced 110 irs 4,the on-source emission originates in material heated by uv photons scattered inthe outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. warmquiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by uv photons fromshocks. shock-heated warm gas is only detected for class 0 flows and the moremassive class i sources such as hh~46. outflow temperatures, estimated from theco 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 k, close to model predictions, with theexception of the l~1551 irs 5 and iras 12496-7650, for which temperatures &lt;50 kare found. apex-champ+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar'sfeedback on its accreting envelope gas in terms of heating, photodissociation,and outflow dispersal by mapping 1'x1' regions in high-j co and [c i] lines.

1003.5102	initial phases of massive star formation in high infrared extinction  clouds. i. physical parameters	the earliest phases of massive star formation are found in cold and denseinfrared dark clouds (irdcs). since the detection method of irdcs is verysensitive to the local properties of the background emission, we present herean alternative method to search for high column density in the galactic planeby using infrared extinction maps. we find clouds between 1 and 5 kpc, of whichmany were missed by previous surveys. by studying the physical conditions of asubsample of these clouds, we aim at a better understanding of the initialconditions of massive star formation. we made extinction maps of the galacticplane based on the 3.6-4.5 microns color excess between the two shortestwavelength spitzer irac bands, reaching to visual extinctions of ~100 mag andcolumn densities of 9x10^22 cm^-2. from this we compiled a new sample of coldand compact high extinction clouds. we used the mambo array at the iram 30mtelescope to study the morphology, masses and densities of the clouds and thedense clumps within them. the latter were followed up by pointed ammoniaobservations with the 100m effelsberg telescope, to determine rotationaltemperatures and kinematic distances. extinction maps of the galactic planetrace large scale structures such as the spiral arms. the 1.2 mm emission mapsreveal that the high extinction clouds contain extended cold dust emission,from filamentary structures to still diffuse clouds. most of the clouds aredark in 24 microns, but several show already signs of star formation via maseremission or bright infrared sources, suggesting that the high extinction cloudscontain a variety of evolutionary stages. the observations suggest anevolutionary scheme from dark, cold and diffuse clouds, to clouds with astronger 1.2 mm peak and to finally clouds with many strong 1.2 mm peaks, whichare also warmer, more turbulent and already have some star formation signposts.

1004.2822	chemical study of intermediate-mass (im) class 0 protostars. co  depletion and n2h+ deuteration	we are carrying out a physical and chemical study of the protostellarenvelopes in a representative sample of im class 0 protostars. in our firstpaper (crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. here, westudy the co depletion and n2h+ deuteration. we observed the millimeter linesof c18o, c17o, n2h+ and n2d+ toward the protostars using the iram 30mtelescope. based on these observations, we derived the c18o, n2h+ and n2d+radial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfercode. in addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. allthe c18o 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the c18o abundance decreasesinwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the coevaporation temperature, 20-25k, where the co is released back to the gasphase. the n2h+ deuterium fractionation in class 0 ims is[n2d+]/[n2h+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental[d/h] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than inpre-stellar clumps. chemical models account for the c18o and n2h+ observationsif we assume the co abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in theinner envelope. this could be the consequence of the co being converted intoch3oh on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or thephotodissociation of co by the stellar uv radiation. the deuteriumfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. this discrepancy is very likelycaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry andneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and uvradiation from the star. more important, the deuterium fractionation isdependent on the ortho-to-para h2 ratio, which is not likely to reach thesteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2903	water abundance variations around high-mass protostars: herschel-hifi  observations of the dr21 region	water is a key molecule in the star formation process, but its spatialdistribution in star-forming regions is not well known. we study thedistribution of dust continuum and h2o and 13co line emission in dr21, aluminous star-forming region with a powerful outflow and a compact hii region.herschel-hifi spectra near 1100 ghz show narrow 13co 10-9 emission and h2o1(11)-0(00) absorption from the dense core and broad emission from the outflowin both lines. the h2o line also shows absorption by a foreground cloud knownfrom ground-based observations of low-j co lines. the dust continuum emissionis extended over 36" fwhm, while the 13co and h2o lines are confined to ~24" orless. the foreground absorption appears to peak further north than the othercomponents. radiative transfer models indicate very low abundances of ~2e-10for h2o and ~8e-7 for 13co in the dense core, and higher h2o abundances of~4e-9 in the foreground cloud and ~7e-7 in the outflow. the high h2o abundancein the warm outflow is probably due to the evaporation of water-rich icy grainmantles, while the h2o abundance is kept down by freeze-out in the dense coreand by photodissociation in the foreground cloud.

1007.1413	herschel/hifi deepens the circumstellar nh3 enigma	circumstellar envelopes (cses) of a variety of evolved stars have been foundto contain ammonia (nh3) in amounts that exceed predictions from conventionalchemical models by many orders of magnitude. the observations reported herewere performed in order to better constrain the nh3 abundance in the cses offour, quite diverse, oxygen-rich stars using the nh3 ortho j_k = 1_0 - 0_0ground-state line. we used the heterodyne instrument for the far infraredaboard herschel to observe the nh3 j_k = 1_0 - 0_0 transition near 572.5 ghz,simultaneously with the ortho-h2o j_ka,kc = 1_1,0 -1_0,1 transition, toward vycma, oh 26.5+0.6, irc+10420, and ik tau. we conducted non-lte radiativetransfer modeling with the goal to derive the nh3 abundance in these objects'cses. for the latter two stars, very large array imaging of nh3radio-wavelength inversion lines were used to provide further constraints,particularly on the spatial extent of the nh3-emitting regions. results. wefind remarkably strong nh3 emission in all of our objects with the nh3 lineintensities rivaling those obtained for the ground state h2o line. the nh3abundances relative to h2 are very high and range from 2 x 10-7 to 3 x 10-6 forthe objects we have studied. our observations confirm and even deepen thecircumstellar nh3 enigma. while our radiative transfer modeling does not yieldsatisfactory fits to the observed line profiles, it leads to abundanceestimates that confirm the very high values found in earlier studies. new waysto tackle this mystery will include further herschel observations of more nh3lines and imaging with the expanded very large array.

1007.1539	herschel/hifi observations of spectrally resolved methylidyne signatures  toward the high-mass star-forming core ngc6334i	in contrast to extensively studied dense star-forming cores, little is knownabout diffuse gas surrounding star-forming regions. we study molecular gas inthe high-mass star-forming region ngc6334i, which contains diffuse, quiescentcomponents that are inconspicuous in widely used molecular tracers such as co.we present herschel/hifi observations of ch toward ngc6334i observed as part ofthe chess key program. hifi resolves the hyperfine components of its j=3/2-1/2transition, observed in both emission and absorption. the ch emission appearsclose to the systemic velocity of ngc6334i, while its measured linewidth of 3km/s is smaller than previously observed in dense gas tracers such as nh3 andsio. the ch abundance in the hot core is 7 10^-11, two to three orders ofmagnitude lower than in diffuse clouds. while other studies find distinctoutflows in, e.g., co and h2o toward ngc6334i, we do not detect outflowsignatures in ch. to explain the absorption signatures, at least two absorbingcomponents are needed at -3.0 and +6.5 km/s with n(ch)=7 10^13 and 3 10^13cm^-2. two additional absorbing clouds are found at +8.0 and 0.0 km/s, bothwith n(ch)=2 10^13 cm^-2. turbulent linewidths for the four absorptioncomponents vary between 1.5 and 5.0 km/s in fwhm. we constrain physicalproperties of our ch clouds by matching our ch absorbers with other absorptionsignatures. in the hot core, molecules such as h2o and co trace gas that isheated and dynamically influenced by outflow activity, whereas ch traces morequiescent material. the four ch absorbers have column densities and turbulentproperties consistent with diffuse clouds: two are located near ngc6334, andtwo are unrelated foreground clouds. local density and dynamical effectsinfluence the chemical composition of physical components of ngc6334, causingsome components to be seen in ch but not in other tracers, and vice versa.

1007.3031	water in low-mass star-forming regions with herschel: hifi spectroscopy  of ngc1333	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a key programmededicated to studying the role of water and related species during thestar-formation process and constraining the physical and chemical properties ofyoung stellar objects. the heterodyne instrument for the far-infrared (hifi) onthe herschel space observatory observed three deeply embedded protostars in thelow-mass star-forming region ngc1333 in several h2-16o, h2-18o, and cotransitions. line profiles are resolved for five h16o transitions in eachsource, revealing them to be surprisingly complex. the line profiles aredecomposed into broad (&gt;20 km/s), medium-broad (~5-10 km/s), and narrow (&lt;5km/s) components. the h2-18o emission is only detected in broad 1_10-1_01 lines(&gt;20 km/s), indicating that its physical origin is the same as for the broadh2-16o component. in one of the sources, iras4a, an inverse p cygni profile isobserved, a clear sign of infall in the envelope. from the line profiles alone,it is clear that the bulk of emission arises from shocks, both on small (&lt;1000au) and large scales along the outflow cavity walls (~10 000 au). the h2o lineprofiles are compared to co line profiles to constrain the h2o abundance as afunction of velocity within these shocked regions. the h2o/co abundance ratiosare measured to be in the range of ~0.1-1, corresponding to h2o abundances of~10-5-10-4 with respect to h2. approximately 5-10% of the gas is hot enough forall oxygen to be driven into water in warm post-shock gas, mostly at highvelocities.

1007.3986	water in massive star-forming regions: hifi observations of w3 irs5	we present herschel observations of the water molecule in the massivestar-forming region w3 irs5. the o-h17o 110-101, p-h18o 111-000, p-h2o 22202-111, p-h2o 111-000, o-h2o 221-212, and o-h2o 212-101 lines, covering afrequency range from 552 up to 1669 ghz, have been detected at high spectralresolution with hifi. the water lines in w3 irs5 show well-definedhigh-velocity wings that indicate a clear contribution by outflows. moreover,the systematically blue-shifted absorption in the h2o lines suggests expansion,presumably driven by the outflow. no infall signatures are detected. the p-h2o111-000 and o-h2o 212-101 lines show absorption from the cold material (t ~ 10k) in which the high-mass protostellar envelope is embedded. one-dimensionalradiative transfer models are used to estimate water abundances and to furtherstudy the kinematics of the region. we show that the emission in the rareisotopologues comes directly from the inner parts of the envelope (t &gt; 100 k)where water ices in the dust mantles evaporate and the gas-phase abundanceincreases. the resulting jump in the water abundance (with a constant innerabundance of 10^{-4}) is needed to reproduce the o-h17o 110-101 and p-h18o111-000 spectra in our models. we estimate water abundances of 10^{-8} to10^{-9} in the outer parts of the envelope (t &lt; 100 k). the possibility of twoprotostellar objects contributing to the emission is discussed.

1007.4119	water abundances in high-mass protostellar envelopes: herschel  observations with hifi	we derive the dense core structure and the water abundance in four massivestar-forming regions which may help understand the earliest stages of massivestar formation. we present herschel-hifi observations of the para-h2o 1_11-0_00and 2_02-1_11 and the para-h2-18o 1_11-0_00 transitions. the envelopecontribution to the line profiles is separated from contributions by outflowsand foreground clouds. the envelope contribution is modelled using monte-carloradiative transfer codes for dust and molecular lines (mc3d and ratran), withthe water abundance and the turbulent velocity width as free parameters. whilethe outflows are mostly seen in emission in high-j lines, envelopes are seen inabsorption in ground-state lines, which are almost saturated. the derived waterabundances range from 5e-10 to 4e-8 in the outer envelopes. we detect coldclouds surrounding the protostar envelope, thanks to the very high quality ofthe herschel-hifi data and the unique ability of water to probe them. severalforeground clouds are also detected along the line of sight. the low h2oabundances in massive dense cores are in accordance with the expectation thathigh densities and low temperatures lead to freeze-out of water on dust grains.the spread in abundance values is not clearly linked to physical properties ofthe sources.

1007.4226	the distribution of water in the high-mass star-forming region ngc 6334i	we present observations of twelve rotational transitions of h2o-16, h2o-18,and h2o-17 toward the massive star-forming region ngc 6334 i, carried out withherschel/hifi as part of the guaranteed time key program chemical herschelsurveys of star forming regions (chess). we analyze these observations toobtain insights into physical processes in this region.  we identify three main gas components (hot core, cold foreground, andoutflow) in ngc 6334 i and derive the physical conditions in these components.  the hot core, identified by the emission in highly excited lines, shows ahigh excitation temperature of 200 k, whereas water in the foreground componentis predominantly in the ortho- and para- ground states. the abundance of watervaries between 4 10^-5 (outflow) and 10^-8 (cold foreground gas). thisvariation is most likely due to the freeze-out of water molecules onto dustgrains. the h2o-18/h2o-17 abundance ratio is 3.2, which is consistent with theo-18/o-17 ratio determined from co isotopologues. the ortho/para ratio in waterappears to be relatively low 1.6(1) in the cold, quiescent gas, but close tothe equilibrium value of three in the warmer outflow material (2.5(0.8)).

1007.4691	first detection of nd in the solar-mass protostar iras16293-2422	in the past decade, much progress has been made in characterising theprocesses leading to the enhanced deuterium fractionation observed in the ismand in particular in the cold, dense parts of star forming regions such asprotostellar envelopes. very high molecular d/h ratios have been found forsaturated molecules and ions. however, little is known about the deuteriumfractionation in radicals, even though simple radicals often represent anintermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. theimidogen radical nh is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesisin the gas phase. herschel/hifi represents a unique opportunity to study thedeuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observablefrom the ground. we searched here for the deuterated radical nd in order todetermine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuterationmechanism of this species. we observed the solar-mass class 0 protostariras16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument hifi as part of the herschel keyprogramme chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions). thedeuterated form of the imidogen radical nd was detected and securely identifiedwith 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorptionagainst the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. the 3groups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart nh were alsodetected in absorption. we derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an[nd]/[nh] ratio of between 30 and 100%. the deuterium fractionation of imidogenis of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggeststhat an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. we discuss twopossible formation pathways for nd, by means of either the reaction of n+ withhd, or deuteron/proton exchange with nh.

1105.0004	probing the initial conditions of high-mass star formation. ii.  fragmentation, stability, and chemistry	we present a new high-resolution study of pre-protocluster regions in tracersexclusively probing the coldest and dense gas (nh_2d). the data are used toconstrain the chemical, thermal, kinematic, and physical conditions (i.e.,densities) in g29.96e and g35.20w. nh_3, nh_2d, and continuum emission weremapped using the vla, and pdbi. in particular, nh_2d is a unique tracer ofcold, precluster gas at high densities, while nh_3 traces both the cold andwarm gas of modest-to-high densities. in g29.96e, spitzer images reveal twomassive filaments, one of them in extinction (infrared dark cloud). we observevery low line widths in nh_3 (fwhm &lt;1km/s). these multi-wavelength,high-resolution observations of high-mass pre-protocluster regions show thatthe target regions are characterized by (i) turbulent jeans fragmentation ofmassive clumps into cores (from a jeans analysis); (ii) cores and clumps thatare "over-bound/subvirial", i.e. turbulence is too weak to support them againstcollapse, meaning that (iii) some models of monolithic cloud collapse arequantitatively inconsistent with data; (iv) accretion from the core onto amassive star, which can (for observed core sizes and velocities) be sustainedby accretion of envelope material onto the core, suggesting that (similar tocompetitive accretion scenarios) the mass reservoir for star formation is notnecessarily limited to the natal core; (v) high deuteration ratios([nh_2d/nh_3]&gt;6%), which make the above discoveries possible; (vi) and thedestruction of nh_2d toward embedded stars.

1107.2924	gas and dust in a submillimeter galaxy at z = 4.24 from the herschel  atlas	we report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source,id141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the h-atlas cosmologicalsurvey. id141 was observed using the iram 30-meter telescope and plateau debure interferometer (pdbi), the submillimeter array (sma) and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) submillimeter telescope to measure the dustcontinuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon([c i] and [c ii]). the detection of strong co emission lines with the pdbiconfirms that id141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). the strength ofthe continuum and emission lines suggests that id141 is gravitationally lensed.the width (delta v (fwhm) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the co andcarbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. the propertiesderived for id141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (l_fir ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x10^13/mu_l lsun, where mu_l is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)and warm (t_kin ~ 40k) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rateof (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_l msun/yr. the carbon emission lines indicate a dense(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) photo-dominated region, illuminated by a far-uv radiationfield a few thousand times more intense than that in our galaxy. in conclusion,the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, id141, are remarkably similar tothose of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

1112.1009	the apex-champ+ view of the orion molecular cloud 1 core - constraining  the excitation with submillimeter co multi-line observations	a high density portion of the orion molecular cloud 1 (omc-1) contains theprominent, warm kleinmann-low (kl) nebula that is internally powered by anenergetic event plus a farther region in which intermediate to high mass starsare forming. its outside is affected by ultraviolet radiation from theneighboring orion nebula cluster and forms the archetypical photon-dominatedregion (pdr) with the prominent bar feature. its nearness makes the omc-1 coreregion a touchstone for research on the dense molecular interstellar medium andpdrs. using the atacama pathfinder experiment telescope (apex), we have imagedthe line emission from the multiple transitions of several carbon monoxide (co)isotopologues over the omc-1 core region. our observations employed the 2x7pixel submillimeter champ+ array to produce maps (~ 300 arcsec x 350 arcsec) of12co, 13co, and c18o from mid-j transitions (j=6-5 to 8-7). we also obtainedthe 13co and c18o j=3-2 images toward this region. the 12co line emission showsa well-defined structure which is shaped and excited by a variety of phenomena,including the energetic photons from hot, massive stars in the nearby orionnebula's central trapezium cluster, active high- and intermediate-mass starformation, and a past energetic event that excites the kl nebula. radiativetransfer modeling of the various isotopologic co lines implies typical h2densities in the omc-1 core region of ~10^4-10^6 cm^-3 and generally elevatedtemperatures (~ 50-250 k). we estimate a warm gas mass in the omc-1 core regionof 86-285 solar masses.

1112.4609	galactic structure based on the atlasgal 870mum survey	the atlasgal 870mum continuum survey conducted with the apex telescope is thefirst survey covering the whole inner galactic plane (60deg&gt;l&gt;-60deg &amp;b&lt;1.5deg) in submm continuum emission tracing the cold dust of dense and youngstar-forming regions. here, we present the overall distribution of sourceswithin our galactic disk. the submm continuum emission is confined to a narrowrange around the galactic plane, but shifted on average by ~0.07deg below theplane. source number counts show strong enhancements toward the galacticcenter, the spiral arms and toward prominent star-forming regions. comparingthe distribution of atlasgal dust continuum emission to that of youngintermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (ysos) derived from spitzerdata, we find similarities as well as differences. in particular, thedistribution of submm dust continuum emission is significantly more confined tothe plane than the yso distribution (fwhm of 0.7 and 1.1deg, corresponding tomean physical scale heights of approximately 46 and 80pc, respectively). whilethis difference may partly be caused by the large extinction from the densesubmm cores, gradual dispersal of stellar distributions after their birth couldalso contribute to this effect. compared to other tracers of galacticstructure, the atlasgal data are strongly confined to a narrow latitude striparound the galactic plane.

0710.4238	multi-line (sub)millimetre observations of the high-mass proto cluster  iras 05358+3543	since most high- and intermediate-mass protostars are at great distance andform in clusters, high linear resolution observations are needed to investigatetheir physical properties. to study the gas in the innermost region around theprotostars in the proto-cluster iras 05358+3543, we observed the source inseveral transitions of methanol and other molecular species with the plateau debure interferometer and the submillimeter array, reaching a linear resolutionof 1100 au. we determine the kinetic temperature of the gas around theprotostars through an lvg and lte analysis of their molecular emission; thecolumn densities of ch3oh, ch3cn and so2 are also derived. constrains on thedensity of the gas are estimated for two of the protostellar cores. we findthat the dust condensations are in various evolutionary stages. the powerhouseof the cluster, mm1a, harbours a hot core with t~220 (75&lt;t&lt;330) k. adouble-peaked profile is detected in several transitions toward mm1a, and wefound a velocity gradient along a linear structure which could be perpendicularto one of the outflows from the vicinity of mm1a. since the size of thedouble-peaked emission is less than 1100 au, we suggest that mm1a might host amassive circumstellar disk. the other sources are in earlier stages of starformation. the least active source, mm3, could be a starless massive core,since it is cold (t&lt;20 k), with a large reservoir of accreting material (m ~ 19m_\odot), but no molecular emission peaks on it.

1201.4732	search for starless clumps in the atlasgal survey	in this study, we present an unbiased sample of the earliest stages ofmassive star formation across 20 square-degree of the sky. within the region10deg &lt; l &lt; 20deg and |b| &lt; 1deg, we search the atlasgal survey at 870 micronfor dense gas condensations. these clumps are carefully examined forindications of ongoing star formation using ysos from the glimpse sourcecatalog as well as sources in the 24 micron mipsgal images, to search forstarless clumps. we calculate the column densities as well as the kinematicdistances and masses for sources where the v_lsr is known from spectroscopicobservations. within the given region, we identify 210 starless clumps withpeak column densities &gt; 1 x 10e23 cm^(-2). in particular, we identify potentialstarless clumps on the other side of the galaxy. the sizes of the clumps rangebetween 0.1 pc and 3 pc with masses between a few tens of solar masses up toseveral ten thousands of solar masses. most of them may form massive stars, butin the 20 square-degree we only find 14 regions massive enough to form starsmore massive than 20 solar masses and 3 regions with the potential to formstars more massive than 40 40 solar masses. the slope of the high-mass tail ofthe clump mass function for clumps on the near side of the galaxy is 2.2 and,therefore, salpeter-like. we estimate the lifetime of the most massive starlessclumps to be 60000 yr. the sample offers a uniform selection of starlessclumps. in the large area surveyed, we only find a few potential precursors ofstars in the excess of 40 solar masses. it appears that the lifetime of theseclumps is somewhat shorter than their free-fall times, although both valuesagree within the errors. in addition, these are ideal objects for detailedstudies and follow-up observations.

1203.1890	high-j co emission in the cepheus e protostellar outflow observed with  sofia/great	we present and analyze two spectrally resolved high-j co lines towards themolecular outflow cep e, driven by an intermediate-mass class 0 protostar.using the great receiver on board sofia, we observed the co (12--11) and(13--12) transitions (e_u ~ 430 and 500 k, respectively) towards one positionin the blue lobe of this outflow, that had been known to display high-velocitymolecular emission. we detect the outflow emission in both transitions, up toextremely high velocities (~ 100 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity).we divide the line profiles into three velocity ranges that each haveinteresting spectral features: standard, intermediate, and extremelyhigh-velocity. one distinct bullet is detected in each of the last two. a largevelocity gradient analysis for these three velocity ranges provides constraintson the kinetic temperature and volume density of the emitting gas, &gt;~ 100 k and&gt; ~ 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. these results are in agreement with previous isoobservations and are comparable with results obtained by herschel for similarobjects. we conclude that high-j co lines are a good tracer of molecularbullets in protostellar outflows. our analysis suggests that different physicalconditions are at work in the intermediate velocity range compared with thestandard and extremely high-velocity gas at the observed position.

1203.4987	sofia observations of far-infrared hydroxyl emission toward classical  ultracompact hii/oh maser regions	the hydroxyl radical (oh) is found in various environments within theinterstellar medium (ism) of the milky way and external galaxies, mostly eitherin diffuse interstellar clouds or in the warm, dense environments of newlyformed low-mass and high-mass stars, i.e, in the dense shells of compact andultracompact hii regions (uchiirs). until today, most studies of interstellaroh involved the molecule's radio wavelength hyperfine structure (hfs)transitions. these lines are generally not in lte and either masing orover-cooling complicates their interpretation. in the past, observations oftransitions between different rotational levels of oh, which are atfar-infrared wavelengths, have suffered from limited spectral and angularresolution. since these lines have critical densities many orders of magnitudehigher than the radio wavelength ground state hfs lines and are emitted fromlevels with more than 100 k above the ground state, when observed in emission,they probe very dense and warm material. we probe the warm and dense molecularmaterial surrounding the uchiir/oh maser sources w3(oh), g10.62-0.39 and ngc7538 irs1 by studying the $^2\pi_{{1/2}}, j = {3/2} - {1/2}$ rotationaltransition of oh in emission and, toward the last source also the molecule's$^2\pi_{3/2}, j = 5/2 - 3/2$ ground-state transition in absorption. we used thestratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy (sofia) to observe these ohlines, which are near 1.84 thz ($163 \mu$m) and 2.51 thz ($119.3 \mu$m). weclearly detect the oh lines, some of which are blended with each other.employing non-lte radiative transfer calculations we predict line intensitiesusing models of a low oh abundance envelope versus a compact, high-abundancesource corresponding to the origin of the radio oh lines.

1204.0009	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish): ii. evolution of 557  ghz 110-101 emission in low-mass protostars	(abridged) water is a key tracer of dynamics and chemistry in low-massprotostars, but spectrally resolved observations have so far been limited insensitivity and angular resolution. in this first systematic survey ofspectrally resolved water emission in low-mass protostellar objects, h2o wasobserved in the ground-state transition at 557 ghz with hifi on herschel in 29embedded class 0 and i protostars. complementary far-ir and sub-mm continuumdata (including pacs data from our program) are used to constrain the spectralenergy distribution of each source. h2o intensities are compared to inferredenvelope and outflow properties and co 3-2 emission. h2o emission is detectedin all objects except one. the line profiles are complex and consist of severalkinematic components. the profiles are typically dominated by a broad gaussianemission feature, indicating that the bulk of the water emission arises inoutflows, not the quiescent envelope. several sources show multiple shockcomponents in either emission or absorption, thus constraining the internalgeometry of the system. furthermore, the components include inverse p-cygniprofiles in 7 sources (6 class 0, 1 class i) indicative of infalling envelopes,and regular p-cygni profiles in 4 sources (3 class i, 1 class 0) indicative ofexpanding envelopes. "bullets" moving at &gt;50 km/s are seen in 4 class 0sources; 3 of these are new detections. in the outflow, the h2o/co abundanceratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasingfrom 10^-3 at &lt;5 km/s to &gt;10^-1 at &gt;10 km/s. the h2o abundance in the outerenvelope is low, ~10^-10. the different h2o profile components show a clearevolutionary trend: in the class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflowcomponents originating inside an infalling envelope. when the infall diminishesduring the class i phase, the outflow weakens and h2o emission disappears.

1204.0397	the massive protostar w43-mm1 as seen by herschel-hifi water spectra:  high turbulence and accretion luminosity	we present herschel/hifi observations of fourteen water lines in w43-mm1, amassive protostellar object in the luminous star cluster-forming region w43. weanalyze the gas dynamics from the line profiles using herschel-hifiobservations (wish-kp) of fourteen far-ir water lines (h2o, h217o, h218o),cs(11-10), and c18o(9-8) lines, and using our modeling of the continuumspectral energy distribution. as for lower mass protostellar objects, themolecular line profiles are a mix of emission and absorption, and can bedecomposed into 'medium', and 'broad' velocity components. the broad componentis the outflow associated with protostars of all masses. our modeling showsthat the remainder of the water profiles can be well fitted by an infalling andpassively heated envelope, with highly supersonic turbulence varying from 2.2km/s in the inner region to 3.5 km/s in the outer envelope. also, w43-mm1 has ahigh accretion rate, between 4.0 x 10^{-4} and 4.0 x 10^{-2} \msun /yr, derivedfrom the fast (0.4-2.9 km/s) infall observed. we estimate a lower mass limit ofgaseous water of 0.11 \msun and total water luminosity of 1.5 \lsun (in the 14lines presented here). the central hot core is detected with a water abundanceof 1.4 x 10^{-4} while the water abundance for the outer envelope is 8x10^{-8}. the latter value is higher than in other sources, most likely relatedto the high turbulence and the micro-shocks created by its dissipation.examining water lines of various energies, we find that the turbulent velocityincreases with the distance to the center. while not in clear disagreement withthe competitive accretion scenario, this behavior is predicted by the turbulentcore model. moreover, the estimated accretion rate is high enough to overcomethe expected radiation pressure.

0711.1999	nh3 observations of the infrared dark cloud g28.34+0.06	we present observations of the \nh3 (j,k) = (1,1) and (2,2) inversiontransitions toward the infrared dark cloud g28.34+0.06, using the very largearray. strong nh3 emission is found to coincide well with the infraredabsorption feature in this cloud. the northern region of g28.34+0.06 isdominated by a compact clump (p2) with a high rotation temperature (29 k),large line width (4.3 km s$^{-1}$), and is associated with strong water maser(240 jy) and a 24 $\mu$m point source with far ir luminosity of $10^3$ \lsun.we infer that p2 has embedded massive protostars although it lies in the 8$\mu$m absorption region. the southern region has filamentary structures. therotation temperature in the southern region decreases with the increase of theintegrated nh3 intensity, which indicates an absence of strong internal heatingin these clumps. in addition, the compact core p1 in the south has small linewidth (1.2 km s$^{-1}$) surrounded by extended emission with larger line width(1.8 km s$^{-1}$), which suggests a dissipation of turbulence in the dense partof the cloud. thus, we suggest that p1 is at a much earlier evolutionary stagethan p2, possibly at a stage that begins to form a cluster with massive stars.

1209.0284	mid-j co emission from the orion bn/kl explosive outflow	high spatial resolution low-j 12co observations have shown that thewide-angle outflow seen in the orion bn/kl region correlates with the famous h2fingers. recently, high-resolution large-scale mappings of mid- and higher-j coemissions have been reported toward the orion molecular cloud 1 core regionusing the apex telescope. therefore, it is of interest to investigate thisoutflow in the higher-j 12co emission, which is likely excited by shocks. theobservations were carried out using the dual-color heterodyne array champ+ onthe apex telescope. the images of the orion bn/kl region were obtained in the12co j=6-5 and j=7-6 transitions with angular resolutions of 8.6 and 7.4arcsec, respectively. the results show a good agreement between our higher-j12co emission and sma low-j 12co data, which indicates that this wide-angleoutflow in orion bn/kl is likely the result of an explosive event that isrelated to the runaway objects from a dynamically decayed multiple system. fromour observations, we estimate that the kinetic energy of this explosive outflowis about 1-2x10^47 erg. in addition, a scenario has been proposed where part ofthe outflow is decelerated and absorbed in the cloud to explain the lack of cobullets in the southern part of bn/kl, which in turn induces the methanolmasers seen in this region.

1211.3554	the distribution of warm gas in the g327.3--0.6 massive star-forming  region	most studies of high-mass star formation focus on massive luminous clumps,but the physical properties of their larger scale environment are poorly known.in this work, we aim at characterising the effects of clustered star formationand feedback of massive stars on the surrounding medium by studying thedistribution of warm gas through mid-j 12co and 13co data. we present apex12co(6-5), (7-6), 13co(6-5), (8-7) and hifi 13co(10-9) maps of the star formingregion g327.36-0.6. we infer the physical properties of the emitting gas onlarge scales through a lte analysis, while we apply a more sophisticated lvgapproach on selected positions. maps of all lines are dominated in intensity bythe pdr around the hii region g327.3-0.5. mid-j 12co emission is detected overthe whole extent of the maps with excitation temperatures ranging from 20k upto 80k in the gas around the hii region, and h2 column densities from few 10^21cm-2 in the inter-clump gas to 3 10^22 cm-2 towards the hot core g327.3-0.6.the warm gas (traced by 12 and 13co(6-5) emission) is only a small percentage(10%) of the total gas in the irdc, while it reaches values up to 35% of thetotal gas in the ring surrounding the hii region. the 12co ladders arequalitatively compatible with pdr models for high density gas, but the muchweaker than predicted 13co emission suggests that it comes from a large numberof clumps along the line of sight. all lines are detected in the inter-clumpgas when averaged over a large region with an equivalent radius of 50"(~0.8pc), implying that the mid-j 12co and 13co inter-clump emission is due tohigh density components with low filling factor. finally, the detection of the13co(10-9) line allows to disentangle the effects of gas temperature and gasdensity on the co emission, which are degenerate in the apex observationsalone.

1301.4658	herschel-hifi observations of high-j co and isotopologues in  star-forming regions: from low- to high-mass	context; our understanding of the star formation process has traditionallybeen confined to certain mass or luminosity boundaries because most studiesfocus only on low-, intermediate- or high-mass star-forming regions. as part ofthe "water in star-forming regions with herschel" (wish) key program, water andother important molecules, such as co and oh, have been observed in 51 embeddedyoung stellar objects (ysos). the studied sample covers a range of luminositiesfrom &lt;1 to &gt;10^5 l_sol. aims; we analyse the co line emission towards a largesample of protostars in terms of both line intensities and profiles. methods;herschel-hifi spectra of the 12co 10-9, 13co 10-9 and c18o 5-4, 9-8 and 10-9lines are analysed for a sample of 51 ysos. in addition, jcmt spectra of 12co3-2 and c18o 3-2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. results; allobserved co and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation betweenthe logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders ofmagnitude on both axes. this suggests that the high-j co lines primarily tracethe amount of dense gas associated with ysos. this relation can be extended tolarger (extragalactic) scales. the majority of the detected 12co line profilescan be decomposed into a broad and a narrow gaussian component, while the c18ospectra are mainly fitted with a single gaussian. a broadening of the lineprofile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, whichis due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). the widths of thebroad 12co 3-2 and 10-9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrowc18o 9-8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelopemotions are related independent of the mass of the protostar. these resultsindicate that physical processes in protostellar envelopes have similarcharacteristics across the studied luminosity range.

1302.2538	atlasgal --- environments of 6.7\,ghz methanol masers	using the 870-$\mu$m apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal), we have identified 577 submillimetre continuum sources with masersfrom the methanol multibeam (mmb) survey in the region $280\degr &lt; \ell &lt;20\degr$; $|\,b\,| &lt; 1.5\degr$. 94\,per\,cent of methanol masers in the regionare associated with sub-millimetre dust emission. we estimate masses for ~450maser-associated sources and find that methanol masers are preferentiallyassociated with massive clumps. these clumps are centrally condensed, withenvelope structures that appear to be scale-free, the mean maser position beingoffset from the peak column density by 0.0 \pm 4". assuming a kroupa initialmass function and a star-formation efficiency of ~30\,per\,cent, we find thatover two thirds of the clumps are likely to form clusters with masses&gt;20\,\msun. furthermore, almost all clumps satisfy the empirical mass-sizecriterion for massive star formation. bolometric luminosities taken from theliterature for ~100 clumps range between ~100 and 10$^6$\,\lsun. this confirmsthe link between methanol masers and massive young stars for 90\,per\,cent ofour sample. the galactic distribution of sources suggests that thestar-formation efficiency is significantly reduced in the galactic-centreregion, compared to the rest of the survey area, where it is broadly constant,and shows a significant drop in the massive star-formation rate density in theouter galaxy. we find no enhancement in source counts towards the southernscutum-centaurus arm tangent at $\ell ~ 315\degr$, which suggests that this armis not actively forming stars.

1304.5852	the unusual afterglow of the gamma-ray burst 100621a	in order to constrain the broad-band spectral energy distribution of theafterglow of grb 100621a, dedicated observations were performed in theoptical/near-infrared with the 7-channel "gamma-ray burst optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpg/eso telescope, in thesub-millimeter band with the large bolometer array laboca at apex, and at radiofrequencies with atca. utilizing also swift x-ray observations, we attempt aninterpretation of the observational data within the fireball scenario.  the afterglow of grb 100621a shows a very complex temporal as well asspectral evolution. we identify three different emission components, the mostspectacular one causing a sudden intensity jump about one hour after the promptemission. the spectrum of this component is much steeper than the canonicalafterglow. we interpret this component using the prescription of vlasis et al.(2011) for a two-shell collision after the first shell has been decelerated bythe circumburst medium. we use the fireball scenario to derive constraints onthe microphysical parameters of the first shell. long-term energy injectioninto a narrow jet seems to provide an adequate description. another noteworthyresult is the large ($a_v$ = 3.6 mag) line-of-sight host extinction of theafterglow in an otherwise extremely blue host galaxy.

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

1311.6644	far-infrared molecular lines from low- to high-mass star forming regions  observed with herschel	(abridged) we study the response of the gas to energetic processes associatedwith high-mass star formation and compare it with studies on low- andintermediate-mass young stellar objects (ysos) using the same methods. thefar-ir line emission and absorption of co, h$_2$o, oh, and [oi] reveals theexcitation and the relative contribution of different species to the gascooling budget. herschel-pacs spectra covering 55-190 um are analyzed for tenhigh-mass star forming regions of various luminosities and evolutionary stagesat spatial scales of ~10^4 au. radiative transfer models are used to determinethe contribution of the envelope to the far-ir co emission.  the close environments of high-mass ysos show strong far-ir emission frommolecules, atoms, and ions. water is detected in all 10 objects even up to highexcitation lines. co lines from j=14-13 up to typically 29-28 show a singletemperature component, trot~300 k. typical h$_2$o temperatures are trot~250 k,while oh has trot~80 k. far-ir line cooling is dominated by co (~75 %) and to asmaller extent by oi (~20 %), which increases for the most evolved sources.h$_2$o is less important as a coolant for high-mass sources because many linesare in absorption. emission from the envelope is responsible for ~45-85 % ofthe total co luminosity in high-mass sources compared with only ~10 % forlow-mass ysos. the highest-j lines originate most likely from shocks, based onthe strong correlation of co and h$_2$o with physical parameters of the sourcesfrom low- to high-masses. excitation of warm co is very similar for all massregimes, whereas h$_2$o temperatures are ~100 k higher for high-mass sourcesthan the low-mass ysos. molecular cooling is ~4 times more important thancooling by [oi]. the total far-ir line luminosity is about 10$^{-3}$ and10$^{-5}$ times lower than the dust luminosity for the low- and high-mass ysos.

1312.0937	the atlasgal survey: a catalog of dust condensations in the galactic  plane	the formation processes and the evolutionary stages of high-mass stars arepoorly understood compared to low-mass stars. large-scale surveys are needed toprovide an unbiased census of high column density sites which can potentiallyhost precursors to high-mass stars. here we use the atlasgal survey covering420 sq. degree of the galactic plane at 870 $\mu$m; and use the mre-glc methodto identify the population of embedded sources throughout the inner galaxy. weidentify in total 10861 compact sub-millimeter sources with fluxes above 5sigma. completeness tests show that our catalogue is 97% complete above 5 sigmaand &gt;99% complete above 7$\sigma$. we correlate this sample with mid-infraredpoint source catalogues (msx at 21.3 $\mu$m and wise at 22 $\mu$m) anddetermine a lower limit of ~33% that are associated with embedded protostellarobjects. we note that the proportion of clumps associated with mid-infraredsources increases with increasing flux density, achieving a rather constantfraction of ~75% of all clumps with fluxes over 5 jy/beam being associated withstar-formation. examining the source counts as a function of galactic longitudewe are able to identify the most prominent star forming regions in the galaxy.from the fraction of the likely massive quiescent clumps (~25%) we estimate aformation time-scale of ~7.5+/-2.5 $\times$ 10$^4$yr for the deeply embeddedphase before the emergence of luminous ysos. such a short duration for theformation of high-mass stars in massive clumps clearly proves that the earliestphases have to be dynamic with supersonic motions.

1406.5078	atlasgal --- towards a complete sample of massive star forming clumps	by matching infrared-selected, massive young stellar objects (mysos) andcompact hii regions in the rms survey to massive clumps found in thesubmillimetre atlasgal survey, we have identified ~1000 embedded young massivestars between 280\degr &lt; $\ell$ &lt; 350\degr and 10degr &lt; $\ell$ &lt; 60\degr with|b|&lt;1.5degr. combined with an existing sample of radio-selected methanol masersand compact hii regions, the result is a catalogue of ~1700 massive starsembedded within ~1300 clumps located across the inner galaxy, containing threeobservationally distinct subsamples, methanol-maser, myso and hii-regionassociations, covering the most important tracers of massive star formation,thought to represent key stages of evolution. we find that massive starformation is strongly correlated with the regions of highest column density inspherical, centrally condensed clumps. we find no significant differencesbetween the three samples in clump structure or the relative location of theembedded stars, which suggests that the structure of a clump is set before theonset of star formation, and changes little as the embedded object evolvestowards the main sequence. there is a strong linear correlation between clumpmass and bolometric luminosity, with the most massive stars forming in the mostmassive clumps. we find that the myso and hii-region subsamples are likely tocover a similar range of evolutionary stages and that the majority are near theend of their main accretion phase. we find few infrared-bright mysos associatedwith the most massive clumps, probably due to very short pre-main sequencelifetimes in the most luminous sources.

1407.2215	atlasgal-selected massive clumps in the inner galaxy: i. co depletion  and isotopic ratios	in the low-mass regime, it is found that the gas-phase abundances ofc-bearing molecules in cold starless cores rapidly decrease with increasingdensity, as the molecules form mantles on dust grains. we study co depletion in102 massive clumps selected from the atlasgal 870 micron survey, andinvestigate its correlation with evolutionary stage and with the physicalparameters of the sources. moreover, we study the gradients in [12c]/[13c] and[18o]/[17o] isotopic ratios across the inner galaxy, and the virial stabilityof the clumps. we use low-j emission lines of co isotopologues and the dustcontinuum emission to infer the depletion factor fd. ratran one-dimensionalmodels were also used to determine fd and to investigate the presence ofdepletion above a density threshold. the isotopic ratios and optical depth werederived with a bayesian approach. we find a significant number of clumps with alarge fd, up to ~20. larger values are found for colder clumps, thus forearlier evolutionary phases. for massive clumps in the earliest stages ofevolution we estimate the radius of the region where co depletion is importantto be a few tenths of a pc. clumps are found with total masses derived fromdust continuum emission up to ~20 times higher than the virial mass, especiallyamong the less evolved sources. these large values may in part be explained bythe presence of depletion: if the co emission comes mainly from the low-densityouter layers, the molecules may be subthermally excited, leading to anoverestimate of the dust masses. co depletion in high-mass clumps seems tobehave as in the low-mass regime, with less evolved clumps showing largervalues for the depletion than their more evolved counterparts, and increasingfor denser sources. the c and o isotopic ratios are consistent with previousdeterminations, and show a large intrinsic scatter.

1412.4818	observations of water with herschel/hifi toward the high-mass protostar  afgl 2591	water is a sensitive tracer of physical conditions in star-forming regionsbecause of its large abundance variations between hot and cold regions. we usespectrally resolved observations of rotational lines of h$_2$o and itsisotopologs with herschel/hifi to constrain the physical conditions of thewater emitting region toward the high-mass protostar afgl2591. we useanalytical estimates and rotation diagrams to estimate t$_{ex}$ and columndensities of h$_2$o of the envelope, the outflow, and a foreground cloud.furthermore, we use the non-lte radiative transfer code to estimate thetemperature and volume density of the h$_2$o emitting gas. assuming lte, weestimate an t$_{ex}$ of 42 k and a column density of 2$\times$10$^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ for the envelope and 45 k and 4$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ for theoutflow, in beams of 4" and 30", respectively. non-lte models indicate akinetic temperature of 60-230 k and a volume density of 7$\times$10$^6$-10$^8$cm$^{-3}$ for the envelope, and a kinetic temperature of 70-90 k and a gasdensity of 10$^7$-10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ for the outflow. the o/p ratio of theforeground absorption is 1.9$\pm$0.4, suggesting a low temperature. incontrast, the o/p ratio seen in absorption by the outflow is 3.5$\pm$1.0, asexpected for warm gas. the water abundance in the envelope is 10$^{-9}$,similar to the low values found for other high- and low-mass protostars,suggesting that this abundance is constant during the embedded phase ofhigh-mass star formation. the water abundance in the outflow is 10$^{-10}$,which is 10$\times$ lower than in the envelope and in the outflows of high- andlow-mass protostars. since beam size effects can only increase this estimate bya factor of 2, we suggest that the water in the outflow is affected bydissociating uv radiation due to the low extinction in the outflow lobe.

1506.03235	a 1.3 cm line survey toward orion kl	orion kl has served as a benchmark for spectral line searches throughout the(sub)millimeter regime. the main goal is to systematically study spectralcharacteristics of orion kl in the 1.3 cm band. we carried out a spectral linesurvey (17.9 ghz to 26.2 ghz) with the effelsberg-100 m telescope towards orionkl. we find 261 spectral lines, yielding an average line density of about 32spectral features per ghz above 3$\sigma$. the identified lines include 164radio recombination lines (rrls) and 97 molecular lines. a total of 23molecular transitions from species known to exist in orion kl are detected forthe first time in the interstellar medium. non-metastable 15nh3 transitions aredetected in orion kl for the first time. based on the velocity information ofdetected lines and the alma images, the spatial origins of molecular emissionare constrained and discussed. a narrow feature is found in so2($8_{1,7}-7_{2,6}$), possibly suggesting the presence of a maser line. columndensities and fractional abundances relative to h2 are estimated for 12molecules with lte methods. rotational diagrams of non-metastable 14nh3transitions with j=k+1 to j=k+4 yield different results; metastable 15nh3 isfound to have a higher excitation temperature than non-metastable 15nh3,indicating that they may trace different regions. elemental and isotopicabundance ratios are estimated: 12c/13c=63+-17, 14n/15n=100+-51,d/h=0.0083+-0.0045. the dispersion of the he/h ratios derived fromh$\alpha$/he$\alpha$ pairs to h$\delta$/he$\delta$ pairs is very small, whichis consistent with theoretical predictions that the departure coefficients bnfactors for hydrogen and helium are nearly identical. based on a non-lte codeneglecting excitation by the infrared radiation field and a likelihoodanalysis, we find that the denser regions have lower kinetic temperature, whichfavors an external heating of the hot core.

1507.01937	outflow forces in intermediate mass star formation	intermediate mass protostarsprovide a bridge between theories of low- andhigh-mass star formation. emerging molecular outflows can be used to determinethe influence of fragmentation and multiplicity on protostellar evolutionthrough the correlation of outflow forces of intermediate mass protostars withthe luminosity. the aim of this paper is to derive outflow forces from outflowsof six intermediate mass protostellar regions and validate the apparentcorrelation between total luminosity and outflow force seen in earlier work, aswell as remove uncertainties caused by different methodology. by comparing co6--5 observations obtained with apex with non-lte radiative transfer modelpredictions, optical depths, temperatures, densities of the gas of themolecular outflows are derived. outflow forces, dynamical timescales andkinetic luminosities are subsequently calculated. outflow parameters, includingthe forces, were derived for all sources. temperatures in excess of 50 k werefound for all flows, in line with recent low-mass results. however, comparisonwith other studies could not corroborate conclusions from earlier work onintermediate mass protostars which hypothesized that fragmentation enhancesoutflow forces in clustered intermediate mass star formation. any enhancementin comparison with the classical relation between outflow force and luminositycan be attributed the use of a higher excitation line and improvement inmethods; they are in line with results from low-mass protostars using similartechniques. the role of fragmentation on outflows is an important ingredient tounderstand clustered star formation and the link between low and high-mass starformation. however, detailed information on spatial scales of a few 100 au,covering all individual members is needed to make the necessary progress.

1507.05808	infrared dark clouds on the far side of the galaxy	context: infrared dark clouds are the coldest and densest portions of giantmolecular clouds. the most massive ones represent some of the most likelybirthplaces for the next generation of massive stars in the milky way. becausea strong mid-ir background is needed to make them appear in absorption, theyare usually assumed to be nearby.  aims: we use thz absorption spectroscopy to solve the distance ambiguityassociated with kinematic distances for the ir-dark clouds in the top100atlasgal sample, a flux-limited selection of massive clumps in differentevolutionary phases of star formation.  methods: the para-h2o ground state transition at 1113.343 ghz, observed withherschel/hifi, was used to investigate the occurrence of foreground absorptionalong the line of sight directly towards infrared-dark clouds. additionalconsistency checks were performed using malt90 and higal archival data andtargeted mopra and apex spectroscopic observations.  results: we report the first discovery of five irdcs in the top100 lyingconclusively at the far kinematic distance, showing that the mere presence oflow-contrast mid-ir absorption is not sufficient to unequivocally resolve thenear/far ambiguity in favour of the former. all irdcs are massive and activelyforming high-mass stars; four of them also show infall signatures.  conclusions: we give a first estimate of the fraction of dark sources at thefar distance (~11% in the top100) and describe their appearance and properties.the assumption that all dark clouds lie at the near distance may lead, in somecases, to underestimating masses, sizes, and luminosities, possibly causingclouds to be missed that will form very massive stars and clusters.

1510.06225	on the accretion process in a high-mass star forming region - a  multitransitional thz herschel-hifi study of ammonia toward g34.26+0.15	[abridged] our aim is to explore the gas dynamics and the accretion processin the early phase of high-mass star formation. the inward motion of moleculargas in the massive star forming region g34.26+0.15 is investigated by usinghigh-resolution profiles of seven transitions of ammonia at thz frequenciesobserved with herschel-hifi. the shapes and intensities of these lines areinterpreted in terms of radiative transfer models of a spherical, collapsingmolecular envelope. an accelerated lambda iteration (ali) method is used tocompute the models. the seven ammonia lines show mixed absorption and emissionwith inverse p-cygni-type profiles that suggest infall onto the central source.a trend toward absorption at increasingly higher velocities for higherexcitation transitions is clearly seen in the line profiles. the $j =3\leftarrow2$ lines show only very weak emission, so these absorption profilescan be used directly to analyze the inward motion of the gas. this is the firsttime a multitransitional study of spectrally resolved rotational ammonia lineshas been used for this purpose. broad emission is, in addition, mixed with theabsorption in the $1_0-0_0$ ortho-nh$_3$ line, possibly tracing a molecularoutflow from the star forming region. the best-fitting ali model reproduces thecontinuum fluxes and line profiles, but slightly underpredicts the emission andabsorption depth in the ground-state ortho line $1_0-0_0$. the derivedortho-to-para ratio is approximately 0.5 throughout the infalling cloud coresimilar to recent findings for translucent clouds in sight lines toward w31cand w49n. we find evidence of two gas components moving inwards toward thecentral region with constant velocities: 2.7 and 5.3 km$\,$s$^{-1}$, relativeto the source systemic velocity. the inferred mass accretion rates derived aresufficient to overcome the expected radiation pressure from g34.26+0.15.

1510.08374	infall through the evolution of high-mass star-forming clumps	with the great receiver at the stratospheric observatory for infraredastronomy (sofia), nine massive molecular clumps have been observed in theammonia $3_{2+}- 2_{2-}$ line at 1.8~thz in a search for signatures of infall.the sources were selected from the atlasgal submillimeter dust continuum surveyof our galaxy. clumps with high masses covering a range of evolutionary stagesbased on their infrared properties were chosen. the ammonia line was detectedin all sources, leading to five new detections and one confirmation of aprevious detection of redshifted absorption in front of their strong thzcontinuum as a probe of infall in the clumps. these detections include twoclumps embedded in infrared dark clouds. the measured velocity shifts of theabsorptions compared to optically thin \cseo\ (3--2) emission are0.3--2.8~km/s, corresponding to fractions of 3\%\ to 30\% of the free-fallvelocities of the clumps. the ammonia infall signature is compared withcomplementary data of different transitions of hcn, hnc, cs, and hco$^+$, whichare often used to probe infall via their blue-skewed line profiles. the bestagreement with the ammonia results is found for the hco$^+$ (4--3) transitions,but the latter is still strongly blended with emission from associatedoutflows. this outflow signature is far less prominent in the thz ammonialines, which confirms it as a powerful probe of infall in molecular clumps.infall rates in the range from 0.3 to 16~$10^{-3}\,m_\odot/$yr were derivedwith a tentative correlation with the virial parameters of the clumps. the newobservations show that infall on clump scales is ubiquitous through a widerange of evolutionary stages, from $l/m$ covering about ten to severalhundreds.

1511.00357	linking low- to high-mass ysos with herschel-hifi observations of water	water probes the dynamics in young stellar objects (ysos) effectively,especially shocks in molecular outflows. it is a key molecule for exploringwhether the physical properties of low-mass protostars can be extrapolated tomassive ysos. as part of the wish key programme, we investigate the dynamicsand the excitation conditions of shocks along the outflow cavity wall asfunction of source luminosity. velocity-resolved herschel-hifi spectra of theh2o 988, 752, 1097 ghz and 12co j=10-9, 16-15 lines were analysed for 52 ysoswith bolometric luminosities (l_bol) ranging from &lt;1 to &gt;10^5 l_sun. theprofiles of the h2o lines are similar, indicating that they probe the same gas.we see two main gaussian emission components in all ysos: a broad componentassociated with non-dissociative shocks in the outflow cavity wall (cavityshocks) and a narrow component associated with quiescent envelope material.more than 60% of the total integrated intensity of the h2o lines (l_h2o) comesfrom the cavity shock component. the h2o line widths are similar for all ysos,whereas those of 12co 10-9 increase slightly with l_bol. the excitationanalysis of the cavity shock component, performed with the non-lte radiativetransfer code radex, shows stronger 752 ghz emission for high-mass ysos, likelydue to pumping by an infrared radiation field. as previously found for co, astrong correlation with slope unity is measured between log(l_h2o) andlog(l_bol), which can be extrapolated to extragalactic sources. we concludethat the broad component of h2o and high-j co lines originate in shocks in theoutflow cavity walls for all ysos, whereas lower-j co transitions mostly traceentrained outflow gas. the higher uv field and turbulent motions in high-massobjects compared to their low-mass counterparts may explain the slightlydifferent kinematical properties of 12co 10-9 and h2o lines from low- tohigh-mass ysos.

astro-ph;0508395	trans-ethyl methyl ether in space - a new look at a complex molecule in  selected hot core regions	an extensive search for the complex molecule trans-ethyl methyl ether towardsseveral hot core regions has been performed. using the iram 30m telescope andthe sest 15m we looked at several frequencies where trans-ethyl methyl etherhas strong transitions, as well as lines which are particularly sensitive tothe physical conditions in which the molecule can be found. we included g34.26,ngc6334(i), orion kl, and w51e2 which have previously been proven to have arich chemistry of complex molecules. our observations cannot confirm thetentative orion kl detection made by charnley et al. (2001) within their statedcolumn density limits, but we confirm the existence of the trans-ethyl methylether towards w51e2 with a column density of 2x10^14 cm-2. the dimethylether/methanol ratio of 0.6 as well as the newly found ethyl methylether/ethanol ratio of 0.13 indicate relative high abundances of ethers towardw51e2. furthermore, the observation of ethyl methyl ether also confirms theimportance of ethanol as a grain mantle constituent. we present new upperlimits of around 8x10^13 cm-2 for the column densities of the molecule towardorion kl, g34.26, ngc6334(i) and estimate the column density towards sgrb2(n)to be of the same order. the w51e2 observations are discussed in more detail.

astro-ph;0508421	high mass starless cores	we report the identification of a sample of potential high-mass starlesscores (hmscs). the cores were discovered by comparing images of the fieldscontaining candidate high-mass protostellar objects (hmpos) at 1.2mm andmid-infrared (8.3um; mir) wavelengths. while the hmpos are detected at bothwavelengths, several cores emitting at 1.2mm in the same fields show absorptionor no emission at the mir wavelength. we argue that the absorption is caused bycold dust. the estimated masses of a few 10^2msun - 10^3 msun and the lack ofir emission suggests that they may be massive cold cores in a pre-stellarphase, which could presumably form massive stars eventually. ammonia (1,1) and(2,2) observations of the cores indicate smaller velocity dispersions and lowerrotation temperatures compared to hmpos and uchii regions suggesting aquiescent pre-stellar stage. we propose that these newly discovered cores aregood candidates for the hmsc stage in high-mass star-formation. this sample ofcores will allow us to study the high-mass star and cluster formation processesat the earliest evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0605386	co and ch3oh observations of the bhr71 outflows with apex	context : highly-collimated outflows are believed to be the earliest stage inoutflow evolution, so their study is essential for understanding the processesdriving outflows. the bhr71 bok globule is known to harbour such ahighly-collimated outflow, which is powered by a protostar belonging to aprotobinary system. aims : we aimed at investigating the interaction ofcollimated outflows with the ambient molecular cloud by using moleculartracers. methods : we mapped the bhr71 highly-collimated outflow in co(3-2)with the apex telescope, and observed several bright points of the outflow inthe molecular transitions co(4-3), 13co(3-2), c18o(3-2), and ch3oh(7-6). we usean lvg code to characterise the temperature enhancements in these regions.results : in our co(3-2) map, the second outflow driven by irs2, which is thesecond source of the binary system, is completely revealed and shown to bebipolar. we also measure temperature enhancements in the lobes. the co andmethanol lvg modelling points to temperatures between 30 and 50k in the irs1outflow, while the irs2 outflow seems to be warmer (up to 300k).

astro-ph;0605667	revealing the environs of the remarkable southern hot core g327.3-0.6	we present a submm study of the massive hot core g327.3-0.6 that constrainsits physical parameters and environment. the apex telescope was used to imageco and n2h+ emission, to observe lines from other molecules toward a hot and acold molecular core, and to measure the continuum flux density of the hot core.in the c18o j=3-2 line, two clumps were found, one associated with the hiiregion g327.3-0.5 and the other associated with the hot core. an additionalcold clump is found 30 arcsec (0.4 pc) northeast of the hot core in bright n2h+emission. from the the continuum data, we calculate a mass of 420 msol and asize of 0.1 pc for the hot core. a new, more accurate position of the hot coreis reported, which allows the association of the core with a brightmid-infrared source. the luminosity of the hot core is estimated to be between5 and 15 10^4 lsol. this study revealed several different evolutionary stagesof massive star formation in the g327.3-0.6 region.

astro-ph;0605713	the high velocity outflow in ngc6334i	we observed the high velocity outflow originating from ngc6334i in several cotransitions with the apex telescope, with the goal of deriving the physicalparameters of the gas. using an lvg analysis, we studied line ratios betweenthe co(3-2), co(4-3), and co(7-6) data as a function of the density and of thekinetic temperature of the gas. an upper limit on the co column density isderived by comparison with 13co data. we constrained the temperature to behigher than 50 k and the h_2 density to values higher than n~10^4 cm^{-3}towards the peak position in the red lobe, while t&gt;15 k and n&gt;10^3 cm^{-3} arederived towards the peak position in the blue lobe. the physical parameters ofthe outflow, its mass and its energetics, have been computed using thetemperatures derived from this analysis. we conclude that high kinetictemperatures are present in the outflow and traced by high excitation co lines.observations of high-j co lines are thus needed to infer reliable values of thekinetic temperatures and of the other physical parameters in outflows.

astro-ph;0606560	first observations with condor, a 1.5 thz heterodyne receiver	the thz atmospheric windows centered at roughly 1.3 and 1.5~thz, containnumerous spectral lines of astronomical importance, including three high-j colines, the n+ line at 205 microns, and the ground transition of para-h2d+. theco lines are tracers of hot (several 100k), dense gas; n+ is a cooling line ofdiffuse, ionized gas; the h2d+ line is a non-depleting tracer of cold (~20k),dense gas. as the thz lines benefit the study of diverse phenomena (fromhigh-mass star-forming regions to the wim to cold prestellar cores), we havebuilt the co n+ deuterium observations receiver (condor) to further explore thethz windows by ground-based observations. condor was designed to be used at theatacama pathfinder experiment (apex) and stratospheric observatory for infraredastronomy (sofia). condor was installed at the apex telescope and testobservations were made to characterize the instrument. the combination ofcondor on apex successfully detected thz radiation from astronomical sources.condor operated with typical trec=1600k and spectral allan variance times of30s. condor's first light observations of co 13-12 emission from the hot coreorion fir4 (= omc1 south) revealed a narrow line with t(mb) = 210k anddelta(v)=5.4km/s. a search for n+ emission from the ionization front of theorion bar resulted in a non-detection. the successful deployment of condor atapex demonstrates the potential for making observations at thz frequencies fromground-based facilities.

astro-ph;0702548	probing the initial conditions of high mass star formation -- i.  deuteration and depletion in high mass pre/protocluster clumps	ultracompact hii regions are signposts of high mass star formation. sincehigh-mass star formation occurs in clusters, one expects to find even earlierphases of massive star formation in the vicinity of ultracompact hii regions.here, we study the amount of deuteration and depletion toward pre/protoclusterclumps found in a wide-field (10 x 10 arcmin) census of clouds in 32 massivestar-forming regions that are known to harbour uchii regions.  we find that 65% of the observed sources have strong nh2d emission and morethan 50% of the sources exhibit a high degree of deuteration, (0.1 &lt; nh2d/nh3 &lt;0.7), 0.7 being the highest observed deuteration of nh3 reported to date. oursearch for nhd2 in two sources did not result in a detection. the enhancementin deuteration coincides with moderate co depletion onto dust grains. there isno evidence of a correlation between the two processes, though an underlyingcorrelation cannot be ruled out as the depletion factor is very likely to beonly a lower limit. in summary, we find co depletion and high deuterationtowards cold cores in massive star forming regions. therefore, these are goodcandidates for sources at the early phases of massive star formation. while oursensitive upper limits on nhd2 do not prove the predictions of the gas-phaseand grain chemistry models wrong, an enhancement of ~10^4 over the cosmic d/hratio from nh2d warrants explanation.

astro-ph;0702560	interferometric multi-wavelength (sub)millimeter continuum study of the  young high-mass protocluster iras05358+3543	the young massive star-forming region iras05358+3543 was observed athigh-spatial resolution in the continuum emission at 3.1 and 1.2mm with theplateau de bure interferometer, and at 875 and 438mum with the submillimeterarray. we resolve at least four continuum sub-sources that are likely ofprotostellar nature. two of them are potentially part of a proto-binary systemwith a projected separation of 1700au. additional (sub)mm continuum peaks arenot necessarily harboring protostars but maybe caused by the multiple molecularoutflows. the spectral energy distributions (seds) of the sub-sources showseveral features. the main power house mm1, which is associated with ch3ohmaser emission, a hypercompact hii region and a mid-infrared source, exhibits atypical sed with a free-free emission component at cm and long mm wavelengthsand a cold dust component in the (sub)mm part of the spectrum (spectral indexbetween 1.2mm and 438mum alpha~3.6). the free-free emission corresponds to alyman continuum flux of an embedded 13msun b1 star. the coldest source of theregion, mm3, has alpha~3.7 between 1.2mm and 875mum, but has lower thanexpected fluxes in the shorter wavelength 438mum band. this turnover of theplanck-function sets an upper limit on the dust temperature of mm3 ofapproximately 20k. the uv-data analysis of the density structure of individualsub-cores reveals distributions with power-law indices between 1.5 and 2. thisresembles the density distributions of the larger-scale cluster-forming clumpas well as those from typical low-mass cores.

astro-ph;9707276	carbon recombination lines in the orion bar	we have carried out vla d-array observations of the c91alpha carbonrecombination line as well as effelsberg 100-m observations of the c65alphaline in a 5 arcmin square region centered between the bar and the trapeziumstars in the orion nebula with spatial resolutions of 10 arcsec and 40 arcsec,respectively. the results show the ionized carbon in the pdr associated withthe orion bar to be in a thin, clumpy layer sandwiched between the ionizationfront and the molecular gas. from the observed line widths we get an upperlimit on the temperature in the c+ layer of 1500 k and from the line intensitya hydrogen density between 5 10^4 and 2.5 10^5 cm-3 for a homogeneous medium.the observed carbon level population is not consistent with predictions ofhydrogenic recombination theory but could be explained by dielectronicrecombination. the layer of ionized carbon seen in c91alpha is found to beessentially coincident with emission in the v=1-0 s(1) line of vibrationallyexcited molecular hydrogen. this is surprising in the light of current pdrmodels and some possible explanations of the discrepancy are discussed.
