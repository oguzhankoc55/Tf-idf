0905.4354	o and na abundance patterns in open clusters of the galactic disk	aims. a global o-na abundance anti-correlation is observed in globularclusters, which is not present in the galactic field population. open clustersare thought to be chemically homogeneous internally. we aim to explore the oand na abundance pattern among the open cluster population of the galacticdisk.  methods. we combine open cluster abundance ratios of o and na fromhigh-resolution spectroscopic studies in the literature and normalize them to acommon solar scale. we compare the open cluster abundances against the globularclusters and disk field.  results. we find that the different environments show different abundancepatterns. the open clusters do not show the o-na anti-correlation at theextreme o-depletion / na-enhancement as observed in globular clusters.furthermore, the high na abundances in open clusters do not match the diskfield stars. if real, it may be suggesting that the dissolution of present-dayopen clusters is not a significant contribution to building the galactic disk.large-scale homogeneous studies of clusters and field will further confirm thereality of the na enhancement.

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1010.1004	hierarchical formation of bulgeless galaxies: why outflows have low  angular momentum	using high resolution, fully cosmological smoothed particle hydro-dynamicalsimulations of dwarf galaxies in a lambda cold dark matter universe, we showhow baryons attain a final angular momentum distribution which allows pure discgalaxies to form. blowing out substantial amounts of gas through supernovae andstellar winds, which is well supported observationally, is a key ingredient informing bulgeless discs. we outline why galactic outflows preferentially removelow angular momentum material, and show that this is a natural result whenstructure forms in a cold dark matter cosmology. the driving factors are a) themean angular momentum of accreted material increases with time, b) lowerpotentials at early times, c) the existence of an extended reservoir of highangular momentum gas which is not within star forming regions, meaning thatonly gas from the inner region (low angular momentum gas) is expelled and d)the tendency for outflows to follow the path of least resistance which isperpendicular to the disc. we also show that outflows are enhanced duringmergers, thus expelling much of the gas which has lost its angular momentumduring these events, and preventing the formation of "classical", merger drivenbulges in low mass systems. stars formed prior to such mergers form a diffuse,extended stellar halo component.

1010.4491	the rave survey: rich in very metal-poor stars	very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemicalevolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. finding complete samples ofsuch stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individualanalyses is of considerable interest. we demonstrate here that stars with ironabundances [fe/h] &lt; -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficientlyidentified within the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey of bright stars,without requiring additional confirmatory observations. we determine acalibration of the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines measured fromthe rave spectra onto true [fe/h], using high spectral resolution data for asubset of the stars. these rave iron abundances are accurate enough to obviatethe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. our initial study hasidentified 631 stars with [fe/h] &lt;= -2, from a rave database containingapproximately 200,000 stars. this rave-based sample is complete for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. we identify three starswith [fe/h] &lt;= -4. of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [fe/h]= -4.0,rather than the published [fe/h]=-3.3, and derive [c/fe] = +0.9, and [n/fe] =+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our s/n. rave observations are on-goingand should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poorstars.

1011.4092	detection of a radial velocity gradient in the extended local disc with  rave	using a sample of 213,713 stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave)survey, limited to a distance of 2 kpc from the sun and to |z|&lt;1 kpc, we reportthe detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,directed radially from the galactic centre. in the direction of the galacticcentre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and ofgalactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the rave data.this velocity gradient corresponds to |k+c| &lt; 3 km/s/kpc, where k and c are theoort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocityfield, respectively. in order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radialvelocity of the local standard of rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensionalgalactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions andphotometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on k-bandmagnitudes, and considering two sets of values for the galactocentric radius ofthe sun and local circular speed. further observational confirmation of ourfinding with line-of-sight velocities of stars at low latitudes, together withfurther modelling, should help constrain the non-axisymmetric components of thegalactic potential, including the bar, the spiral arms and possibly theellipticity of the dark halo.

1105.2562	hierarchical formation of bulgeless galaxies ii: redistribution of  angular momentum via galactic fountains	within a fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we form a galaxy whichrotates at 140 km/s, and is characterised by two loose spiral arms and a bar,indicative of a hubble type sbc/d galaxy. we show that our simulated galaxy hasno classical bulge, with a pure disc profile at z=1, well after the majormerging activity has ended. a long-lived bar subsequently forms, resulting inthe formation of a secularly-formed "pseudo" bulge, with the finalbulge-to-total light ratio b/t=0.21. we show that the majority of gas whichloses angular momentum and falls to the central region of the galaxy during themerging epoch is blown back into the hot halo, with much of it returning laterto form stars in the disc. we propose that this mechanism of redistribution ofangular momentum via a galactic fountain, when coupled with the results fromour previous study which showed why gas outflows are biased to have low angularmomentum, can solve the angular momentum/bulgeless disc problem of the colddark matter paradigm.

1107.2922	the cold gas content of bulgeless dwarf galaxies	we present an analysis of the neutral hydrogen (hi) properties of a fullycosmological hydrodynamical dwarf galaxy, run with varying simulationparameters. as reported by governato et al. (2010), the high resolution, highstar formation density threshold version of this galaxy is the first simulationto result in the successful reproduction of a (dwarf) spiral galaxy without anyassociated stellar bulge. we have set out to compare in detail the hidistribution and kinematics of this simulated bulgeless disk with what isobserved in a sample of nearby dwarfs. to do so, we extracted the radial gasdensity profiles, velocity dispersion (e.g., velocity ellipsoid, turbulence),and the power spectrum of structure within the cold interstellar medium fromthe simulations. the highest resolution dwarf, when using a high density starformation threshold comparable to densities of giant molecular clouds,possesses bulk characteristics consistent with those observed in nature, thoughthe cold gas is not as radially extended as that observed in nearby dwarfs,resulting in somewhat excessive surface densities. the lines-of-sight velocitydispersion radial profiles have values that are in good agreement with observeddwarf galaxies, but due to the fact that only the streaming velocities ofparticles are tracked, a correction to include the thermal velocities can leadto profiles that are quite flat. the ism power spectra of the simulationsappear to possess more power on smaller spatial scales than that of the smc. weconclude that unavoidable limitations remain due to the unresolved physics ofstar formation and feedback within pc-scale molecular clouds.

1107.6045	advanced morphological galaxy classification: a comparison of real and  simulated galaxies	encoded within the morphological structure of galaxies are clues related totheir formation and evolutionary history. recent advances pertaining to thestatistics of galaxy morphology include sophisticated measures of concentration(c), asymmetry (a), and clumpiness (s). in this study, these three parameters(cas) have been applied to a suite of simulated galaxies and compared withobservational results inferred from a sample of nearby galaxies. thesimulations span a range of late-type systems, with masses between ~1e10 msunand ~1e12 msun, and employ star formation density thresholds between 0.1 cm^-3and 100 cm^-3. we have found that the simulated galaxies possess comparableconcentrations to their real counterparts. however, the results of the casanalysis revealed that the simulated galaxies are generally more asymmetric,and that the range of clumpiness values extends beyond the range of thoseobserved. strong correlations were obtained between the three cas parametersand colour (b-v), consistent with observed galaxies. furthermore, the simulatedgalaxies possess strong links between their cas parameters and hubble type,mostly in-line with their real counterparts.

1201.3359	magicc disks: matching observed galaxy relationships over a wide stellar  mass range	we use the same physical model to simulate four galaxies that match therelation between stellar and total mass, over a mass range that includes thevast majority of disc galaxies. the resultant galaxies, part of the makinggalaxies in a cosmological context (magicc) program, also match observedrelations between luminosity, rotation velocity, size, colour, star formationrate, hi mass, baryonic mass, and metallicity. radiation from massive stars andsupernova energy regulate star formation and drive outflows, balancing thecomplex interplay between cooling gas, star formation, large scale outflows,and recycling of gas in a manner which correctly scales with the mass of thegalaxy. outflows also play a key role in simulating galaxies with exponentialsurface brightness profiles, flat rotation curves and dark matter cores. ourstudy implies that large scale outflows are the primary driver of thedependence of disc galaxy properties on mass. we show that the amount ofoutflows invoked in our model is required to meet the constraints provided byobservations of ovi absorption lines in the circum-galactic-media of localgalaxies.

1201.6359	metallicity gradients in disks: do galaxies form inside-out?	we examine radial and vertical metallicity gradients using a suite of diskgalaxy simulations, supplemented with two classic chemical evolutionapproaches. we determine the rate of change of gradient and reconciledifferences between extant models and observations within the `inside-out' diskgrowth paradigm. a sample of 25 disks is used, consisting of 19 from our rades(ramses disk environment study) sample, realised with the adaptive meshrefinement code ramses. four disks are selected from the mugs (mcmasterunbiased galaxy simulations) sample, generated with the smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) code gasoline, alongside disks from rahimi et al. (gcd+)and kobayashi &amp; nakasato (grape-sph). two chemical evolution models ofinside-out disk growth were employed to contrast the temporal evolution oftheir radial gradients with those of the simulations. we find that systematicdifferences exist between the predicted evolution of radial abundance gradientsin the rades and chemical evolution models, compared with the mugs sample;specifically, the mugs simulations are systematically steeper at high-redshift,and present much more rapid evolution in their gradients. we find that themajority of the models predict radial gradients today which are consistent withthose observed in late-type disks, but they evolve to this self-similarity indifferent fashions, despite each adhering to classical `inside-out' growth. wefind that radial dependence of the efficiency with which stars form as afunction of time drives the differences seen in the gradients; systematicdifferences in the sub-grid physics between the various codes are responsiblefor setting these gradients. recent, albeit limited, data at redshift z=1.5 areconsistent with the steeper gradients seen in our sph sample, suggesting amodest revision of the classical chemical evolution models may be required.

1204.1051	the stellar metallicity distribution of disc galaxies and bulges in  cosmological simulations	by means of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of milkyway-like disc galaxies, we conduct an analysis of the associated stellarmetallicity distribution functions (mdfs). after undertaking a kinematicdecomposition of each simulation into spheroid and disc sub-components, wecompare the predicted mdfs to those observed in the solar neighbourhood and thegalactic bulge. the effects of the star formation density threshold are visiblein the star formation histories, which show a modulation in their behaviourdriven by the threshold. the derived mdfs show median metallicities lower by0.2-0.3 dex than the mdf observed locally in the disc and in the galacticbulge. possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy include the use of lowstellar yields and/or centrally-concentrated star formation. the dispersionsare larger than the one of the observed mdf; this could be due to simulateddiscs being kinematically hotter relative to the milky way. the fraction of lowmetallicity stars is largely overestimated, visible from the more negativelyskewed mdf with respect to the observational sample. for our fiducial milky wayanalog, we study the metallicity distribution of the stars born "in situ"relative to those formed via accretion (from disrupted satellites), anddemonstrate that this low-metallicity tail to the mdf is populated primarily byaccreted stars. enhanced supernova and stellar radiation energy feedback to thesurrounding interstellar media of these pre-disrupted satellites is suggestedas an important regulator of the mdf skewness.

1204.2273	the vmc survey. v. first results for classical cepheids	the vista magellanic cloud (vmc, pi m.r. cioni) survey is collecting deepks-band time-series photometry of the pulsating variable stars hosted by thesystem formed by the two magellanic clouds (mcs) and the "bridge" connectingthem. in this paper we present the first results for classical cepheids, fromthe vmc observations of two fields in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the vmcks-band light curves of the cepheids are well sampled (12-epochs) and ofexcellent precision. we were able to measure for the first time the ksmagnitude of the faintest classical cepheids in the lmc (ks\sim17.5 mag), whichare mostly pulsating in the first overtone (fo) mode, and to obtain foperiod-luminosity (pl), period-wesenheit (pw), and period-luminosity-color(plc) relations, spanning the full period range from 0.25 to 6 day. since thelongest period cepheid in our dataset has a variability period of 23 day, wehave complemented our sample with literature data for brighter f cepheids. onthis basis we have built a pl relation in the ks band that, for the first time,includes short period pulsators, and spans the whole range from 1.6 to 100 daysin period. we also provide the first ever empirical pw and plc relations usingthe (v-ks) color and time-series ks photometry. the very small dispersion(\sim0.07 mag) of these relations makes them very well suited to study thethree-dimensional (3d) geometry of the magellanic system. the use of "direct"(parallax- and baade-wesselink- based) distance measurements to both galacticand lmc cepheids, allowed us to calibrate the zero points of the pl, pw, andplc relations obtained in this paper, and in turn to estimate an absolutedistance modulus of (m-m)0=18.46\pm0.03 for the lmc. this result is inagreement with most of the latest literature determinations based on classicalcepheids.

1204.6502	exploring the morphology of rave stellar spectra	the radial velocity experiment (rave) is a medium resolution r~7500spectroscopic survey of the milky way which already obtained over half amillion stellar spectra. they present a randomly selected magnitude-limitedsample, so it is important to use a reliable and automated classificationscheme which identifies normal single stars and discovers different types ofpeculiar stars. to this end we present a morphological classification of350,000 rave survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding, adimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectralmorphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving theproperties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. we find that the majority ofall spectra in the database ~90-95% belong to normal single stars, but there isalso a significant population of several types of peculiars. among them themost populated groups are those of various types of spectroscopic binary andchromospherically active stars. both of them include several thousands ofspectra. particularly the latter group offers significant further investigationopportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of stellar ages.applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single starsalone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional spacecorrelates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.

1205.0546	kinematic groups beyond the solar neighbourhood with rave	we analyse the kinematics of disc stars observed by the rave survey in andbeyond the solar neighbourhood.we detect significant overdensities in thevelocity distributions using a technique based on the wavelet transform.we findthat the main local kinematic groups are large scale features, surviving atleast up to ~1 kpc from the sun in the direction of anti-rotation, and also at~700 pc below the galactic plane.we also find that for regions located atdifferent radii than the sun, the known groups appear shifted in the velocityplane. for example, the hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity forregions inside the solar circle and a lower value outside. we have alsodiscovered a new group at (u, v) = (92,-22) km/s in the solar neighbourhood andconfirmed the significance of other previously found groups. some of thesetrends detected for the first time are consistent with dynamical models of theeffects of the bar and the spiral arms. more modelling is required todefinitively characterise the non-axisymmetric components of our galaxy usingthese groups.

1205.4796	the distribution of metals in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of  dwarf disk galaxies	we examine the chemical properties of 5 cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations of an m33-like disc galaxy which have been shown to be consistentwith the morphological characteristics and bulk scaling relations expected oflate-type spirals. these simulations are part of the making galaxies in acosmological context (magicc) project, in which stellar feedback is tuned tomatch the stellar mass -- halo mass relationship. each realisation employedidentical initial conditions and assembly histories, but differed from oneanother in their underlying baryonic physics prescriptions, including (a) theefficiency with which each supernova energy couples to the ism, (b) the impactof feedback associated with massive star radiation pressure, (c) the role ofthe minimum shut-off time for radiative cooling of type ii sne remnants, (d)the treatment of metal diffusion, and (e) varying the imf. our analysisfocusses on the resulting stellar metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) ineach simulated (analogous) `solar neighbourhood' and central `bulge' region. wecompare the simulated mdfs' skewness, kurtosis, and dispersion (inter-quartile,inter-decile, inter-centile, and inter-tenth-percentile regions) with that ofthe empirical solar neighbourhood mdf and local group dwarfs. we find that themdfs of the simulated discs are more negatively skewed, with higher kurtosis,than those observed locally. we can trace this difference to the simulations'tight and correlated age-metallicity relations (compared with that of the milkyway), suggesting that these relations within `dwarf' discs might be steeperthan in l* discs and/or the degree of stellar orbital re-distribution andmigration inferred locally has not been captured in their entirety, at theresolution of our simulations. the important role of metal diffusion inameliorating the over-production of extremely metal-poor stars is highlighted.

1206.0740	thin disc, thick disc and halo in a simulated galaxy	within a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we form a disc galaxy withsub- components which can be assigned to a thin stellar disc, thick disk, and alow mass stellar halo via a chemical decomposition. the thin and thick discpopulations so selected are distinct in their ages, kinematics, andmetallicities. thin disc stars are young (&lt;6.6 gyr), possess low velocitydispersion ({\sigma}u,v,w = 41, 31, 25 km/s), high [fe/h], and low [o/fe]. thethick disc stars are old (6.6&lt;age&lt;9.8 gyrs), lag the thin disc by \sim21 km/s,possess higher velocity dispersion ({\sigma}u,v,w = 49, 44, 35 km/s),relatively low [fe/h] and high [o/fe]. the halo component comprises less than4% of stars in the "solar annulus" of the simulation, has low metallicity, avelocity ellipsoid defined by ({\sigma}u,v,w = 62, 46, 45 km/s) and is formedprimarily in-situ during an early merger epoch. gas-rich mergers during thisepoch play a major role in fuelling the formation of the old disc stars (thethick disc). this is consistent with studies which show that cold accretion isthe main source of a disc galaxy's baryons. our simulation initially forms arelatively short (scalelength \sim1.7 kpc at z=1) and kinematically hot disc,primarily from gas accreted during the galaxy's merger epoch. far from being acompeting formation scenario, migration is crucial for reconciling the short,hot, discs which form at high redshift in {\lambda}cdm, with the properties ofthe thick disc at z=0. the thick disc, as defined by its abundances maintainsits relatively short scale-length at z = 0 (2.31 kpc) compared with the totaldisc scale-length of 2.73 kpc. the inside-out nature of disc growth isimprinted the evolution of abundances such that the metal poor {\alpha}-youngpopulation has a larger scale-length (4.07 kpc) than the more chemicallyevolved metal rich {\alpha}-young population (2.74 kpc).

1206.5570	the halo shape and evolution of polar disc galaxies	we examine the properties and evolution of a simulated polar disc galaxy.this galaxy is comprised of two orthogonal discs, one of which contains oldstars (old stellar disc), and the other, containing both younger stars and thecold gas (polar disc) of the galaxy. by exploring the shape of the inner regionof the dark matter halo, we are able to confirm that the halo shape is a oblateellipsoid flattened in the direction of the polar disc. we also note that thereis a twist in the shape profile, where the innermost 3 kpc of the halo flattensin the direction perpendicular to the old disc, and then aligns with the polardisc out until the virial radius. this result is then compared to the haloshape inferred from the circular velocities of the two discs. we also use thetemporal information of the simulation to track the system's evolution, andidentify the processes which give rise to this unusual galaxy type. we confirmthe proposal that the polar disc galaxy is the result of the last major merger,where the angular moment of the interaction is orthogonal to the angle of theinfalling gas. this merger is followed by the resumption of coherent gasinfall. we emphasise that the disc is rapidly restored after the major mergerand that after this event the galaxy begins to tilt. a significant proportionof the infalling gas comes from filaments. this infalling gas from the filamentgives the gas its angular momentum, and, in the case of the polar disc galaxy,the direction of the gas filament does not change before or after the lastmajor merger.

1207.0363	the properties of the local spiral arms from rave data: two-dimensional  density wave approach	using the rave survey, we recently brought to light a gradient in the meangalactocentric radial velocity of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.this gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of thepotential, among which a perturbation by spiral arms is a possible explanation.here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model theradial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. provided that theradial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms thatcan affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model providesnew independent estimates for the parameters of the milky way spiral structure.our analysis favours a two-armed perturbation with the sun close to the innerultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance, with a pattern speed \omega_p=18.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}km/s/kpc and a small amplitude a=0.55 \pm 0.02% of the background potential(14% of the background density). this model can serve as a basis for numericalsimulations in three dimensions, additionally including a possible influence ofthe galactic bar and/or other non-axisymmetric modes.

1209.0456	thick disk kinematics from rave and the solar motion	radial velocity surveys such as the radial velocity experiment (rave) provideus with measurements of hundreds of thousands of nearby stars most of whichbelong to the galactic thin, thick disk or halo. ideally, to study the galacticdisks (both thin and thick) one should make use of the multi-dimensionalphase-space and the whole pattern of chemical abundances of their stellarpopulations. in this paper, with the aid of the rave survey, we study the thinand thick disks of the milky way, focusing on the latter. we present atechnique to disentangle the stellar content of the two disks based on thekinematics and other stellar parameters such as the surface gravity of thestars. using the padova galaxy model, we checked the ability of our method tocorrectly isolate the thick disk component from the galaxy mixture of stellarpopulations. we introduce selection criteria in order to clean the observedradial velocities from the galactic differential rotation and to take intoaccount the partial sky coverage of rave. we developed a numerical technique tostatistically disentangle thin and thick disks from their mixture. we deducethe components of the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest (lsr)in the radial and vertical direction, the rotational lag of the thick diskcomponent relative to the lsr, and the square root of the absolute value of thevelocity dispersion tensor for the thick disk alone. the analysis of the thindisk is presented in another paper. we find good agreement with previousindependent parameter determinations. in our analysis we used photometricallydetermined distances. in the appendix we show that similar values can be foundfor the thick disk alone as derived in the main sections of our paper evenwithout the knowledge of photometric distances.

1210.1030	properties of simulated milky way-mass galaxies in loose group and field  environments	we test the validity of comparing simulated field disk galaxies with theempirical properties of systems situated within environments more comparable toloose groups, including the milky way's local group. cosmological simulationsof milky way-mass galaxies have been realised in two different environmentsamples: in the field and in environments with similar properties to the localgroup. apart from the environments of the galaxies, the samples are kept ashomogeneous as possible with equivalent ranges in last major merger time, halomass and halo spin. comparison of these two samples allow for systematicdifferences in the simulations to be identified. metallicity gradients, diskscale lengths, colours, magnitudes and age-velocity dispersion relations arestudied for each galaxy in the suite and the strength of the link between theseand environment of the galaxies is studied. the bulge-to-disk ratio of thegalaxies show that these galaxies are less spheroid dominated than many othersimulated galaxies in literature with the majority of both samples being diskdominated. we find that secular evolution and mergers dominate the spread ofmorphologies and metallicity gradients with no visible differences between thetwo environment samples. in contrast with this consistency in the two samplesthere is tentative evidence for a systematic difference in the velocitydispersion-age relations of galaxies in the different environments. loose groupgalaxies appear to have more discrete steps in their velocity dispersion-agerelations. we conclude that at the current resolution of cosmological galaxysimulations field environment galaxies are sufficiently similar to those inloose groups to be acceptable proxies for comparison with the milky wayprovided that a similar assembly history is considered.

1302.2468	the wobbly galaxy: kinematics north and south with rave red clump giants	the rave survey, combined with proper motions and distance estimates, can beused to study in detail stellar kinematics in the extended solar neighbourhood(solar suburb). using the red clump, we examine the mean velocity components in3d between an r of 6 and 10 kpc and a z of -2 to 2 kpc, concentrating onnorth-south differences. simple parametric fits to the r, z trends for vphi andthe velocity dispersions are presented. we confirm the recently discoveredgradient in mean galactocentric radial velocity, vr, finding that the gradientis more marked below the plane, with a z gradient also present. the verticalvelocity, vz, also shows clear structure, with indications of ararefaction-compression pattern, suggestive of wave-like behaviour. we performa rigorous error analysis, tracing sources of both systematic and randomerrors. we confirm the north-south differences in vr and vz along theline-of-sight, with the vr estimated independent of the proper motions. thecomplex three-dimensional structure of velocity space presents challenges forfuture modelling of the galactic disk, with the galactic bar, spiral arms andexcitation of wave-like structures all probably playing a role.

1302.3466	the relation between chemical abundances and kinematics of the galactic  disc with rave	aims: we study the relations between stellar kinematics and chemicalabundances of a large sample of rave giants in search for selection criterianeeded for disentangling different galactic stellar populations. methods: weselect a sample of 2167 giant stars with signal-to-noise per spectralmeasurements above 75 from the rave chemical catalogue and follow the analysisperformed by gratton and colleagues on 150 subdwarf stars spectroscopicallyobserved at high-resolution. we then use a larger sample of 9131 giants (withsignal-to-noise above 60) to investigate the chemo-kinematical characteristicsof our stars by grouping them into nine subsamples with common eccentricity($e$) and maximum distance achieved above the galactic plane ($z_max$).results: the rave kinematical and chemical data proved to be reliable byreproducing the results by gratton et al. obtained with high-resolutionspectroscopic data. our analysis, based on the $e$-$z_max$ plane combined withadditional orbital parameters and chemical information, provides an alternativeway of identifying different populations of stars. in addition to extractingcanonical thick- and thin-disc samples, we find a group of stars in thegalactic plane ($z_max&lt;1$ kpc and 0.4 $&lt; e &lt; $0.6), which show homogeneouskinematics but differ in their chemical properties. we interpret this as aclear sign that some of these stars have experienced the effects of heatingand/or radial migration, which have modified their original orbits. theaccretion origin of such stars cannot be excluded.

1304.3020	constraining sub-grid physics with high-redshift spatially-resolved  metallicity distributions	we examine the role of energy feedback in shaping the distribution of metalswithin cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of l* disc galaxies. whilenegative abundance gradients today provide a boundary condition for galaxyevolution models, in support of inside-out disc growth, empirical evidence asto whether abundance gradients steepen or flatten with time remains highlycontradictory. we made use of a suite of l* discs, realised with and without`enhanced' feedback. all the simulations were produced using the smoothedparticle hydrodynamics code gasoline, and their in situ gas-phase metallicitygradients traced from redshift z~2 to the present-day. present-dayage-metallicity relations and metallicity distribution functions were derivedfor each system. the `enhanced' feedback models, which have been shown to be inagreement with a broad range of empirical scaling relations, distribute energyand re-cycled ism material over large scales and predict the existence ofrelatively `flat' and temporally invariant abundance gradients. enhancedfeedback schemes reduce significantly the scatter in the local stellarage-metallicity relation and, especially, the [o/fe]-[fe/h] relation. the local[o/fe] distribution functions for our l* discs show clear bimodality, withpeaks at [o/fe]=-0.05 and +0.05 (for stars with [fe/h]&gt;-1), consistent with ourearlier work on dwarf discs. our results with `enhanced' feedback areinconsistent with our earlier generation of simulations realised with`conservative' feedback. we conclude that spatially-resolved metallicitydistributions, particularly at high-redshift, offer a unique and under-utilisedconstraint on the uncertain nature of stellar feedback processes.

0801.2120	galactic kinematics with rave data: i. the distribution of stars towards  the galactic poles	we analyze the distribution of g and k type stars towards the galactic polesusing rave and elodie radial velocities, 2mass photometric star counts, anducac2 proper motions. the combination of photometric and 3d kinematic dataallows us to disentangle and describe the vertical distribution of dwarfs,sub-giants and giants and their kinematics. we identify discontinuities withinthe kinematics and magnitude counts that separate the thin disk, thick disk anda hotter component. the respective scale heights of the thin disk and thickdisk are 225$\pm$10 pc and 1048$\pm$36 pc. we also constrain the luminosityfunction and the kinematic distribution function. the existence of a kinematicgap between the thin and thick disks is incompatible with the thick disk havingformed from the thin disk by a continuous process, such as scattering of starsby spiral arms or molecular clouds. other mechanisms of formation of the thickdisk such as `created on the spot' or smoothly `accreted' remain compatiblewith our findings.

1307.6073	the asymmetric drift, the local standard of rest, and implications from  rave data	the determination of the lsr is still a matter of debate. the classical valueof the tangential peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the lsr waschallenged in recent years, claiming a significantly larger value. we show thatthe radial velocity experiment (rave) sample of dwarf stars is an excellentdata set to derive tighter boundary conditions to chemodynamical evolutionmodels of the extended solar neighbourhood. we present an improved jeansanalysis, which allows a better interpretation of the measured kinematics ofstellar populations in the milky way disc. we propose an improved version ofthe str\"omberg relation with the radial scalelengths as the only unknown.binning rave stars in metallicity reveals a bigger asymmetric drift(corresponding to a smaller radial scalelength) for more metal-richpopulations. with the standard assumption of velocity-dispersion independentradial scalelengths in each metallicity bin, we redetermine the lsr. the newstr\"omberg equation yields a joint lsr value of v_\sun=3.06 \pm 0.68 km/s,which is even smaller than the classical value based on hipparcos data. thecorresponding radial scalelength increases from 1.6 kpc for the metal-rich binto 2.9 kpc for the metal-poor bin, with a trend of an even larger scalelengthfor young metal-poor stars. when adopting the recent sch\"onrich value ofv_\sun=12.24 km/s for the lsr, the new str\"omberg equation yields much largerindividual radial scalelengths of the rave subpopulations, which seemunphysical in part. the new str\"omberg equation allows a cleanerinterpretation of the kinematic data of disc stars in terms of radialscalelengths. lifting the lsr value by a few km/s compared to the classicalvalue results in strongly increased radial scalelengths with a trend of smallervalues for larger velocity dispersions.

1308.5226	the influence of ram pressure on the evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies	the formation mechanism of tidal dwarf galaxies means they are expected tocontain little or no dark matter. as such, they might be expected to be verysensitive to their environment. we investigate the impact of ram pressure ontidal dwarf galaxies in a parameter study, varying dwarf galaxy properties andram pressures. we submit model tidal dwarf galaxies to wind-tunnel style testsusing a toy ram pressure model. the effects of ram pressure are found to besubstantial. if tidal dwarf galaxies have their gas stripped, they may becompletely destroyed. ram pressure drag causes acceleration of our dwarf galaxymodels, and this further enhances stellar losses. the dragging can also causestars to lie in a low surface brightness stellar stream that points in theopposite direction to the stripped gas, in a manner distinctive from tidalstreams. we investigate the effects of ram pressure on surface densityprofiles, the dynamics of the stars, and discuss the consequences for dynamicalmass measurements.

1309.4272	constraints on the galactic bar from the hercules stream as traced with  rave across the galaxy	non-axisymmetries in the galactic potential (spiral arms and bar) inducekinematic groups such as the hercules stream. assuming that hercules is causedby the effects of the outer lindblad resonance of the galactic bar, we modelanalytically its properties as a function of position in the galaxy and itsdependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. using data from the ravesurvey we find that the azimuthal velocity of the hercules structure decreasesas a function of galactocentric radius, in a manner consistent with ouranalytical model. this allows us to obtain new estimates of the parameters ofthe milky way's bar. the combined likelihood function of the bar's patternspeed and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\omega_b=(1.89 \pm0.08) \times \omega_0$ where $\omega_0$ is the local circular frequency.assuming a solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular velocity of 238 km/s,this corresponds to $\omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. on the other hand, the bar'sorientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. in fact,the likelihood function shows that a tight correlation exists between thepattern speed and the orientation, implying that a better description of ourbest fit results is given by the linear relation $\omega_b/\omega_0=1.91 +0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. for example, for anangle of $\phi_b=30\deg$ the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. theseresults are not very sensitive to the other galactic parameters such as thecircular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the sun, and are robust tobiases in distance.

1309.4279	chemical gradients in the milky way from the rave data. i. dwarf stars	aim: we aim at measuring the chemical gradients of the elements mg, al, si,and fe along the galactic radius to provide new constraints on the chemicalevolution models of the galaxy and galaxy models such as the besancon model.  methods: we analysed three different samples selected from three independentdatasets: a sample of 19,962 dwarf stars selected from the rave database, asample of 10,616 dwarf stars selected from the geneva-copenhagen survey (gcs)dataset, and a mock sample (equivalent to the rave sample) created by using thegalaxia code, which is based on the besancon model. we measured the chemicalgradients as functions of the guiding radius (rg) at different distances fromthe galactic plane reached by the stars along their orbit (zmax).  results: the chemical gradients of the rave and gcs samples are negative andshow consistent trends, although they are not equal: at zmax&lt;0.4 kpc and4.5&lt;rg(kpc)&lt;9.5, the iron gradient for the rave sample is d[fe/h]/drg=-0.065dex kpc^{-1}, whereas for the gcs sample it is d[fe/h]/drg=-0.043 dex kpc^{-1}with internal errors +-0.002 and +-0.004 dex kpc^{-1}, respectively. thegradients of the rave and gcs samples become flatter at larger zmax.conversely, the mock sample has a positive iron gradient ofd[fe/h]/drg=+0.053+-0.003 dex kpc^{-1} at zmax&lt;0.4 kpc and remains positive atany zmax. these positive and unrealistic values originate from the lack ofcorrelation between metallicity and tangential velocity in the besancon model.the discrepancies between the observational samples and the mock sample can bereduced by i) decreasing the density, ii) decreasing the vertical velocity, andiii) increasing the metallicity of the thick disc in the besancon model.

1310.1919	in the thick of it: metal-poor disc stars in rave	by selecting in the rave-dr4 survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpcabove the galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplestthree-component model (thin disc, thick disc, halo) for the milky way. weconfirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions ofthe thick disc are not gaussian. in particular, we find that the thick disc hasan extended metallicity tail going at least down to [m/h]=-2 dex, contributingroughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorterscale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. the mean azimuthal velocityof these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between themetallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on theformation mechanisms of the galactic thick disc. given our simple approach, wefind dvphi/d[m/h] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement withprevious literature values. we complete the study with a brief discussion onthe implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggestthat given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed byradial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.

1310.4497	the [alpha/fe] ratios of very metal-poor stars within the igimf theory	the aim of this paper is to quantify the amplitude of the predicted plateauin [alpha/fe] ratios associated with the most metal-poor stars of a galaxy. weassume that the initial mass function in galaxies is steeper if the starformation rate (sfr) is low -- as per the integrated galactic initial massfunction (igimf) theory. a variant of the theory, in which the igimf dependsupon the metallicity of the parent galaxy, is also considered. the igimf theorypredicts low [alpha/fe] plateaus in dwarf galaxies, characterised by smallsfrs. the [alpha/fe] plateau is up to 0.7dex lower than the correspondingplateau of the milky way. for a universal imf one should expect instead thatthe [alpha/fe] plateau is the same for all the galaxies, irrespective of theirmasses or sfrs. assuming a strong dependence of the imf on the metallicity ofthe parent galaxy, dwarf galaxies can show values of the [alpha/fe] plateausimilar to those of the milky way, and almost independent on the sfr. the[mg/fe] ratios of the most metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies satellites of themilky way can be reproduced either if we consider metallicity-dependent imfs orif the early sfrs of these galaxies were larger than we presently think.present and future observations of dwarf galaxies can help disentangle betweenthese different igimf formulations.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

1311.1507	phase mixing due to the galactic potential: steps in the position and  velocity distributions of popped star clusters	as star clusters are expected to form with low star formation efficiencies,the gas in the cluster is expelled quickly and early in their development: thestar cluster "pops." this leads to an unbound stellar system, evolving in thegalactic potential. previous n-body simulations have demonstrated the existenceof a stepped number density distribution of cluster stars after popping, bothin vertical position and vertical velocity, with a passing resemblance to achristmas tree. using numerical and analytical methods, we investigate thesource of this structure, which arises due to the phase mixing of theout-of-equilibrium stellar system, determined entirely by the backgroundanalytic potential. considering only the vertical motions, we construct atheoretical model to describe the time evolution of the phase spacedistribution of stars in a miyamoto-nagai disk potential and a full milky-waytype potential comprising bulge, halo and disk components, which is thencompared with n-body simulations. using our theoretical model, we investigatethe possible observational signatures and the feasibility of detection.

1312.3133	the environmental dependence of neutral hydrogen in the gimic  simulations	we use the galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic)cosmological hydrodynamic simulation at z=0 to study the distribution andenvironmental dependence of neutral hydrogen (hi) gas in the outskirts ofsimulated galaxies. this gas can currently be probed directly in, for example,ly$\alpha$ absorption via the observation of background quasars. radiofacilities, such as the square kilometre array, will provide a complementaryprobe of the diffuse hi in emission and will constrain the physics underpinningthe complex interplay between accretion and feedback mechanisms which affectthe intergalactic medium. we extract a sample of 488 galaxies from are-simulation of the average cosmic density gimic region. we estimate theneutral hydrogen content of these galaxies and the surrounding intergalacticmedium within which they reside. we investigate the average hi radial profilesby stacking the individual profiles according to both mass and environment. wefind high hi column densities at large impact parameters in group environmentsand markedly lower hi densities for non-group galaxies. we suggest that theseresults likely arise from the combined effects of ram pressure stripping andtidal interactions present in group environments.

1403.0488	the role of feedback in shaping the structure of the interstellar medium	we present an analysis of the role of feedback in shaping the neutralhydrogen (hi) content of simulated disc galaxies. for our analysis, we haveused two realisations of two separate milky way-like (~l*) discs - oneemploying a conservative feedback scheme (mugs), the other significantly moreenergetic (magicc). to quantify the impact of these schemes, we generate zerothmoment (surface density) maps of the inferred hi distribution; construct powerspectra associated with the underlying structure of the simulated cold ism, inaddition to their radial surface density and velocity dispersion profiles. ourresults are compared with a parallel, self-consistent, analysis of empiricaldata from things (the hi nearby galaxy survey). single power-law fits(p~k^gamma) to the power spectra of the stronger-feedback (magicc) runs (overspatial scales corresponding to 0.5 kpc to 20 kpc) result in slopes consistentwith those seen in the things sample (gamma = -2.5). the weaker-feedback (mugs)runs exhibit shallower power law slopes (gamma = -1.2). the power spectra ofthe magicc simulations are more consistent though with a two-component fit,with a flatter distribution of power on larger scales (i.e., gamma = -1.4 forscales in excess of 2 kpc) and a steeper slope on scales below 1 kpc (gamma =-5), qualitatively consistent with empirical claims, as well as our earlierwork on dwarf discs. the radial hi surface density profiles of the magicc discsshow a clear exponential behaviour, while those of the mugs suite areessentially flat; both behaviours are encountered in nature, although thethings sample is more consistent with our stronger (magicc) feedback runs.

1404.0043	the main sequence and the fundamental metallicity relation in magicc  galaxies: evolution and scatter	using cosmological galaxy simulations from the magicc project, we study theevolution of the stellar masses, star formation rates and gas phase abundancesof star forming galaxies. we derive the stellar masses and star formation ratesusing observational relations based on spectral energy distributions byapplying the new radiative transfer code grasil-3d to our simulated galaxies.the simulations match well the evolution of the stellar mass-halo massrelation, have a star forming main sequence that maintains a constant slope outto redshift z $\sim$ 2, and populate projections of the stellar mass - starformation - metallicity plane, similar to observed star forming disc galaxies.we discuss small differences between these projections in observational dataand in simulations, and the possible causes for the discrepancies. thelight-weighted stellar masses are in good agreement with the simulation values,the differences between the two varying between 0.06 dex and 0.20 dex. we alsofind a good agreement between the star formation rate tracer and the true(time-averaged) simulation star formation rates. regardless if we use mass- orlight-weighted quantities, our simulations indicate that bursty star formationcycles can account for the scatter in the star forming main sequence.

0803.0385	the chemical evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies: dissecting the  inner regions and their stellar populations	using 3-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of isolated dwarf spheroidalgalaxies (dsphs), we undertake an analysis of the chemical properties of theirinner regions, identifying the respective roles played by type ia (sne ia) andtype ii (sne ii) supernovae. the effect of inhomogeneous pollution from sne iais shown to be prominent within two core radii, with the stars forming thereinamounting to ~20% of the total. these stars are relatively iron-rich andalpha-element-depleted compared to the stars forming in the rest of the galaxy.at odds with the projected stellar velocity dispersion radial profile, theactual 3-dimensional one shows a depression in the central region, where themost metal-rich (ie. [fe/h]-rich) stars are partly segregated. this naturallyresults in two different stellar populations, with an anti-correlation between[fe/h] and velocity dispersion, in the same sense as that observed in thesculptor and fornax dsphs. because the most iron-rich stars in our model arealso the most alpha-depleted, a natural prediction and test of our model isthat the same radial segregation effects should exist between [alpha/fe] andvelocity dispersion.

1405.7435	kinematic modelling of the milky way using the rave and gcs stellar  surveys	we investigate the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using the raveand gcs stellar surveys. we do this by fitting a kinematic model to the datataking the selection function of the data into account. for stars in the gcs weuse all phase-space coordinates, but for rave stars we use only $(l,b,v_{\rmlos})$. using mcmc technique, we investigate the full posterior distributionsof the parameters given the data. we investigate the `age-velocity dispersion'relation for the three kinematic components($\sigma_r,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocitydispersions, the solar peculiar motion ($u_{\odot},v_{\odot}, w_{\odot} $), thecircular speed $\theta_0$ at the sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion withheight above the mid-plane. we confirm that the besan\c{c}on-style gaussianmodel accurately fits the gcs data, but fails to match the details of the morespatially extended rave survey. in particular, the shu distribution function(df) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit tothe kinematic data. the gaussian distribution function not only fits the datapoorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion withradius. we find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, whichhighlights the importance of doing joint fits. the large size of the ravesurvey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. however, largesystematic uncertainties remain, especially in $v_{\odot}$ and $\theta_0$. wefind that, for an extended sample of stars, $\theta_0$ is underestimated by asmuch as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion isneglected. using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we findthat it is possible to match the sgr a* proper motion without any need for$v_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like gcs.

1408.6236	spectroscopic signatures of extra-tidal stars around the globular  clusters ngc 6656 (m22), ngc 3201 and ngc 1851 from rave	stellar population studies of globular clusters have suggested that thebrightest clusters in the galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarfspheroidal galaxies. if the present galactic globular clusters formed withinlarger stellar systems, they are likely surrounded by extra-tidal halos and/ortails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems.the stellar surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the bestplaces to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. here an attempt ismade to search for tidal debris around the supernovae enriched globularclusters m22 and ngc 1851 as well as the kinematically unique cluster ngc 3201.the stellar parameters from the radial velocity experiment (rave) are used toidentify stars with rave metallicities, radial velocities andelemental-abundances consistent with the abundance patterns and properties ofthe stars in m22, ngc 1851 and ngc 3201. the discovery of rave stars that maybe associated with m22 and ngc 1851 are reported, some of which are atprojected distances of ~10 degrees away from the core of these clusters.numerous rave stars associated with ngc 3201 suggest that either the tidalradius of this cluster is underestimated, or that there are some unbound starsextending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. no furtherextra-tidal stars associated with ngc 3201 could be identified. the brightmagnitudes of the rave stars make them easy targets for high resolutionfollow-up observations, allowing an eventual further chemical tagging tosolidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidaldebris. in both our radial velocity histograms of the regions surrounding ngc1851 and ngc 3201, a peak of stars at 230 km/s is seen, consistent withextended tidal debris from omega centauri.

0804.1284	fluorine abundances in the milky way bulge	fluorine (19f) abundances are derived in a sample of 6 bulge red giants inbaade's window. these giants span a factor of 10 in metallicity and this is thefirst study to define the behavior of 19f with metallicity in the bulge. thebulge results show an increase in f/o with increasing oxygen. this trendoverlaps what is found in the disk at comparable metallicities, with the mostoxygen-rich bulge target extending the disk trend. the increase in f/o in thedisk arises from 19f synthesis in both asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars andmetal-rich wolf-rayet (wr) stars through stellar winds. the lack of ans-process enhancement in the most fluorine-rich bulge giant in this study,suggests that wr stars represented a larger contribution than agb stars to 19fproduction in the bulge when compared to the disk. if this result for fluorineis combined with the previously published overall decline in the o/mg abundanceratios in metal-rich bulge stars, it suggests that wr winds played a role inshaping chemical evolution in the bulge. one star in this study exhibits a verylow value of f/o while having a large o-abundance; this chemical mixture can beunderstood if this star formed from gas that was enriched by metal-poorcore-collapse supernovae and may indicate that chemical evolution in the bulgewas inhomogeneous.

1412.1484	characterizing the high-velocity stars of rave: the discovery of a  metal-rich halo star born in the galactic disk	we aim to characterize high-velocity (hivel) stars in the solar vicinity bothchemically and kinematically using the fourth data release of the radialvelocity experiment (rave). we used a sample of 57 hivel stars with galacticrest-frame velocities larger than 275 km s$^{-1}$. with 6d position andvelocity information, we integrated the orbits of the hivel stars and foundthat, on average, they reach out to 13 kpc from the galactic plane and haverelatively eccentric orbits consistent with the galactic halo. using thestellar parameters and [$\alpha$/fe] estimates from rave, we found themetallicity distribution of the hivel stars peak at [m/h] = -1.2 dex and ischemically consistent with the inner halo. there are a few notable exceptionsthat include a hypervelocity star (hvs) candidate, an extremely high-velocitybound halo star, and one star that is kinematically consistent with the halobut chemically consistent with the disk. high-resolution spectra were obtainedfor the metal-rich hivel star candidate and the second highest velocity star inthe sample. using these high-resolution data, we report the discovery of ametal-rich halo star that has likely been dynamically ejected into the halofrom the galactic thick disk. this discovery could aid in explaining theassembly of the most metal-rich component of the galactic halo.

1412.5649	the rich are different: evidence from the rave survey for stellar radial  migration	using the radial velocity experiment fourth data release (rave dr4), and anew metallicity calibration that will be also taken into account in the futurerave dr5, we investigate the existence and the properties of super-solarmetallicity stars ([m/h] &gt; +0.1 dex) in the sample, and in particular in thesolar neighbourhood. we find that rave is rich in super-solar metallicitystars, and that the local metallicity distribution function declines remarkablyslowly up to +0.4 dex. our results show that the kinematics and heightdistributions of the super-solar metallicity stars are identical to those ofthe [m/h] &lt; 0 thin-disc giants that we presume were locally manufactured. theeccentricities of the super-solar metallicity stars indicate that half of themare on a roughly circular orbit (e &lt; 0.15), so under the assumption that themetallicity of the interstellar medium at a given radius never decreases withtime, they must have increased their angular momenta by scattering atcorotation resonances of spiral arms from regions far inside the solar annulus.the likelihood that a star will migrate radially does not seem to decreasesignificantly with increasing amplitude of vertical oscillations within rangeof oscillation amplitudes encountered in the disc.

1502.00444	observationally-motivated analysis of simulated galaxies	the spatial and temporal relationships between stellar age, kinematics, andchemistry are a fundamental tool for uncovering the physics driving galaxyformation and evolution. observationally, these trends are derived usingcarefully selected samples isolated via the application of appropriatemagnitude, colour, and gravity selection functions of individual stars;conversely, the analysis of chemodynamical simulations of galaxies hastraditionally been restricted to the age, metallicity, and kinematics of`composite' stellar particles comprised of open cluster-mass simple stellarpopulations. as we enter the gaia era, it is crucial that this approachchanges, with simulations confronting data in a manner which better mimics themethodology employed by observers. here, we use the \textsc{syncmd} syntheticstellar populations tool to analyse the metallicity distribution function of amilky way-like simulated galaxy, employing an apparent magnitude plus gravityselection function similar to that employed by the radial velocity experiment(rave); we compare such an observationally-motivated approach with thattraditionally adopted - i.e., spatial cuts alone - in order to illustrate thepoint that how one analyses a simulation can be, in some cases, just asimportant as the underlying sub-grid physics employed.

1503.02072	the imprints of the galactic bar on the thick disk with rave	we study the kinematics of a local sample of stars, located within a cylinderof 500 pc radius centered on the sun, in the rave dataset. we find clearasymmetries in the $v_r$-$v_\phi$ velocity distributions of thin and thick diskstars: here are more stars moving radially outwards for low azimuthalvelocities and more radially inwards for high azimuthal velocities. suchasymmetries have been previously reported for the thin disk as being due to thegalactic bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures areseen in the thick disk. our findings imply that the velocities of thick diskstars should no longer be described by schwarzschild's, multivariate gaussianor purely axisymmetric distributions. furthermore, the nature of previouslyreported substructures in the thick disk needs to be revisited as these couldbe associated with dynamical resonances rather than to accretion events. it isclear that dynamical models of the galaxy must fit the 3d velocitydistributions of the disks, rather than the projected 1d, if we are tounderstand the galaxy fully.

1504.07695	identification of globular cluster stars in rave data i: application to  stellar parameter calibration	we present the identification of potential members of nearby galacticglobular clusters using radial velocities from the radial velocity experimentdata release 4 (rave-dr4) survey database. our identifications are based onthree globular clusters -- ngc 3201, ngc 5139 ($\omega$ cen) and ngc 362 -- allof which are shown to have |rv|&gt;100 km/s. the identification of globularcluster stars in rave dr4 data offers a unique opportunity to test theprecision and accuracy of the stellar parameters determined with the currentlyavailable stellar parameter pipelines (spps) used in the survey, as globularclusters are ideal testbeds for the validation of stellar atmosphericparameters, abundances, distances and ages. for both ngc 3201 and $\omega$ cen,there is compelling evidence for numerous members (&gt; 10) in the rave database;in the case of ngc 362 the evidence is more ambiguous, and there may besignificant foreground and/or background contamination in ourkinematically-selected sample. a comparison of the rave-derived stellarparameters and abundances with published values for each cluster and with bastiisochrones for ages and metallicities from the literature reveals overall goodagreement, with the exception of the apparent underestimation of surfacegravities for giants, in particular for the most metal-poor stars. moreover, ifthe selected members are part of the main body of each cluster our resultswould also suggest that the distances from binney et al. 2013, where onlyisochrones more metal-rich than -0.9 dex were used, are typicallyunderestimated by ~ 40% with respect to the published distances for theclusters, while the distances from zwitter et al. 2010 show stars ranging from1 to ~ 6.5 kpc -- with indications of a trend toward higher distances at lowermetallicities -- for the three clusters analysed in this study.

1512.00625	the imprint of satellite accretion on the chemical and dynamical  properties of disc galaxies	aims: we study the effects of the cosmological assembly history on thechemical and dynamical properties of the discs of spiral galaxies as a functionof radius. methods: we make use of the simulated milky-way mass,fully-cosmological discs, from {\tt rades} (ramses disc environment study). weanalyse their assembly history by examining the proximity of satellites to thegalactic disc, instead of their merger trees, to better gauge which satellitesimpact the disc. we present stellar age and metallicity profiles,age-metallicity relation (amr), age-velocity dispersion relation (avr), andstellar age distribution (sad) in several radial bins for the simulatedgalaxies. results: assembly histories can be divided into three differentstages: i) a merger dominated phase, when a large number of mergers with massratios of $\sim$1:1 take place (lasting $\sim$3.2$\pm$0.4 gyr on average); ii)a quieter phase, when $\sim$1:10 mergers take place (lasting $\sim$4.4$\pm$2.0gyr) - these two phases are able to kinematically heat the disc and produce adisc that is chemically mixed over its entire radial extension; iii) a"secular" phase where the few mergers that take place have mass ratios below1:100, and which do not affect the disc properties (lasting $\sim$5.5$\pm$2.0gyr). phase ii ends with a final merger event (at time $t_\mathrm{jump}$)marking the onset of important radial differences in the amr, avr, and sad.conclusions: inverted amr trends in the outer parts of discs, for stars youngerthan $t_\mathrm{jump}$, are found as the combined effect of radial motions andstar formation in satellites temporarily located in these outer parts."u-shaped" stellar age profiles change to an old plateau ($\sim$10 gyr) in theouter discs for the entire {\tt rades} sample. this shape is a consequence ofinside-out growth of the disc, radial motions of disc stars ...

1512.02680	the history of stellar metallicity in a simulated disc galaxy	we explore the chemical distribution of stars in a simulated galaxy. usingsimulations of the same initial conditions but with two different feedbackschemes (mugs and magicc), we examine the features of the age-metallicityrelation (amr), and the three-dimensional age-metallicity-[o/fe] distribution,both for the galaxy as a whole and decomposed into disc, bulge, halo, andsatellites. the mugs simulation, which uses traditional supernova feedback, isreplete with chemical substructure. this sub- structure is absent from themagicc simulation, which includes early feedback from stellar winds, a modifiedimf and more efficient feedback. the reduced amount of substructure is due tothe almost complete lack of satellites in magicc. we identify a significantseparation between the bulge and disc amrs, where the bulge is considerablymore metal-rich with a smaller spread in metallicity at any given time than thedisc. our results suggest, however, that identifying the substructure inobservations will require exquisite age resolution, on the order of 0.25 gyr.certain satellites show exotic features in the amr, even forming a 'sawtooth'shape of increasing metallicity followed by sharp declines which correspond topericentric passages. this fact, along with the large spread in stellar age ata given metallicity, compromises the use of metallicity as an age indicator,although alpha abundance provides a more robust clock at early times. this mayalso impact algorithms that are used to reconstruct star formation historiesfrom resolved stellar populations, which frequently assume amonotonically-increasing amr.

astro-ph;0005012	fuse observations of o vi in high velocity clouds	we have used moderate-resolution (fwhm ~ 25 km/sec) spectra of agns and qsosobserved by the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) to make the firstdefinitive measurements of absorption by hot gas in high velocity clouds (hvcs)at large distances from the galactic plane. seven of the 11 sight lines studiedexhibit high velocity (|v(lsr)| &gt; 100 km/sec) o vi 1031.93 a absorption withlog n(o vi) = 13.79-14.62. high velocity o vi absorption is detected in thedistant gas of h i hvc complex c, the magellanic stream, several hvcs believedto be in the local group, and the outer galaxy. the fraction of o vi in hvcsalong the seven sight lines containing high velocity o vi averages about 30percent, with a full range of 10-70 percent. the o vi detections imply that hot(log t(k) = 5-6) collisionally-ionized gas is an important constituent of thehvcs since o vi is difficult to produce by photoionization unless the pathlengths over which the absorption occurs are very large (&gt;100 kpc). theassociation of o vi with h i hvcs in many cases suggests that the o vi may beproduced at interfaces or mixing layers between the h i clouds and hot, lowdensity gas in the galactic corona or local group. alternatively, the o vi mayoriginate within cooling regions of hot gas clouds as they are accreted ontothe galaxy.

astro-ph;0005267	an extragalactic hi cloud with no optical counterpart?	we report the discovery, from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass), of anisolated cloud of neutral hydrogen which we believe to be extragalactic. the himass of the cloud (hipass j1712-64) is very low, 1.7 x 10^7 msun, using anestimated distance of ~3.2 mpc. most significantly, we have found no opticalcompanion to this object to very faint limits (mu(b)~ 27 mag arcsec^-2). hipassj1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than,hi 1225+01 (the virgo hi cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. the meanvelocity dispersion, measured with the australia telescope compact array(atca), is only 4 km/s for the main component and because of the weak ornon-existent star-formation, possibly reflects the thermal linewidth (t&lt;2000 k)rather than bulk motion or turbulence. the peak column density for hipassj1712-64, from the combined parkes and atca data, is only 3.5 x 10^19 cm^-2,which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for starformation. apart from its significantly higher velocity, the properties ofhipass j1712-64 are similar to the recently recognised class of compact highvelocity clouds. we therefore consider the evidence for a local group orgalactic origin, although a more plausible alternative is that hipass j1712-64was ejected from the interacting magellanic cloud/galaxy system atperigalacticon ~ 2 x 10^8 yr ago.

(1999). on the other hand, if themetallicity of complex c is also 0.1 solar along this line of sight, theobserved value of n(fe ii)/(n(h i) suggests there may be a significan t amountof h+ along the line of sight. in any case, little, if any, iron can bedepleted into dust grains if the intrinsic metallicity of complex c issubsolar. absorption from complex c is also seen in c ii, n i, and n ii, andupper limits based on non-detections can be determined for ar i, p ii, and feiii. although molecular hydrogen in the milky way is obvious in the fuse data,no h_2 absorption is seen in the high velocity cloud to a limitn(h_2)&lt;2.0x10^14 cm^-2. future fuse observations of extragalactic objectsbehind galactic high velocity clouds will allow us to better constrain modelsof hvc origins.

0808.3111	the evolution of carbon, sulphur, and titanium isotopes from  high-redshift to the local universe	recent observations of carbon, sulphur, and titanium isotopes at redshiftsz~1 and in the local stellar disc and halo have opened a new window into thestudy of isotopic abundance patterns and the origin of the chemical elements.using our galactic chemical evolution code getool, we have examined theevolution of these isotopes within the framework of a milky way-like system. wehave three aims in this work: first, to test the claim that novae are required,in order to explain the carbon isotope patterns in the milky way; second, totest the claim that sulphur isotope patterns at high-redshift require aninitial mass function biased towards massive stars; and third, to test extantchemical evolution models against new observations of titanium isotopes thatsuggest an anti-correlation between trace-to-dominant isotopes withmetallicity. based upon our dual-infall galactic chemical evolution modellingof a milky way-like system, and the subsequent comparison with these new andunique datasets, we conclude the following: novae are not required tounderstand the evolution of 12c/13c in the solar neighbourhood; a massivestar-biased initial mass function is consistent with the low ratios of 12c/13cand 32s/34s seen in one high-redshift late-type spiral, but the consequentsuper-solar metallicity prediction for the interstellar medium in this systemseems highly unlikely; and deficient isotopes of titanium are predicted tocorrelate positively with metallicity, in apparent disagreement with the newdatasets; if confirmed, classical chemical evolution models of the milky way(and the associated supernovae nucleosynthetic yields) may need a substantialoverhaul to be made consistent.

astro-ph;0401440	hst observations of the main sequence of m4	this paper presents new results from a photometric study of the main-sequencestars in m4, the closest globular cluster to the sun. multi-field, multi-epochobservations at approximately 1, 2, and 6 core-radii were obtained with thewfpc2 camera on the hst. the multi-epoch observations allowed us to clean thedata on the basis of proper motion. in all the fields the cluster main sequencecan be traced to at least v = 27.0 but there remains a trail of stars to thelimit of the data near v = 30 in the deepest outer field. there is no evidencethat we have reached the end of the hydrogen burning main sequence in any ofour fields, however, there is some indication that very few stars remain to bedetected in the deepest data.  the scatter about the cluster main sequence yields a surprisingly small andvariable binary fraction; f_b = 2% in the inner parts of the cluster falling tothe 1% range outside. for the currently visible main sequence stars, thecluster mass function is very flat (alpha =0.1) in the outer field and flattensfurther in the inner fields suggesting well developed mass segregation. theobserved variation in the mass function is broadly consistent with isotropic,multi-mass michie-king models. because we have a large sample of white dwarfsin the outer field we are able to show that the cluster imf above 0.8msun wasconsiderably steeper than the present day mass function for low mass stars.  two appendicies are included in this contribution; a detailed discussion ofthe techniques used to reduce the data and a direct comparison between thecluster stars and those belonging to the inner spheroid of the galaxy yieldinga galactocentric distance of 7.5+/-0.6 kpc.

astro-ph;0401446	concerning the white dwarf cooling age of m4: a response to the paper by  de marchi et al. on "a different interpretation of recent hst observations"	we respond to the paper by de marchi, paresce, straniero and moroni (2003) onthe white dwarf cooling age of m4. the authors question the data analysis andinterpretation that led to the conclusions in hansen et al. (2002). in theirpaper, de marchi et al. are unable to obtain photometry as deep as ours fromthe same data set and therefore assert that only a lower limit to the whitedwarf cooling age for this cluster of approximately 9 gyr can be obtained.  in this short contribution we show that shortcomings in the data analysis andreduction techniques of de marchi et al. are responsible for their inability toreach the photometry limits that our study reports. in a forthcoming paper inwhich the complete techniques for age determination with white dwarfs are laidout, we demonstrate that their method of fitting the luminosity function givesa spuriously low white dwarf cooling age.

astro-ph;0406360	modelling self-pollution of globular clusters from agb stars	a self-consistent model of the chemical evolution of the globular cluster ngc6752 is presented to test a popular theory that observed abundance anomaliesare due to ``internal pollution'' from intermediate mass asymptotic giantbranch stars. we simulated the chemical evolution of the intracluster mediumunder the assumption that the products of type ii sne are completely expelledfrom the globular cluster, whereas material ejected from stars with m &lt; 7 m_sunis retained, due to their weak stellar winds. by tracing the chemical evolutionof the intracluster gas, we tested an internal pollution scenario in which thena- and al-enhanced ejecta from intermediate mass stars is either accreted ontothe surfaces of other stars, or goes toward forming new stars. the observedspread in na and al was reproduced, but not the o-na and mg-alanticorrelations. in particular, neither o nor mg are sufficiently depleted toaccount for the observations. we predict that the mg content of na-rich clusterstars should be overwhelmingly dominated by the 25,26mg isotopes, whereas thelatest data shows only a mild 26mg enhancement and no correlation with 25mg.furthermore, stars bearing the imprint of intermediate mass stellar ejecta arepredicted to be strongly enhanced in both c and n, in conflict with theempirical data. we find that while standard agb stellar models do show the hoth burning that seems required to explain the observations, this is accompaniedby he burning, producing primary c, n, mg and na (via hbb) which do not matchthe observations.

astro-ph;0406564	globular cluster and galaxy formation: m31, the milky way and  implications for globular cluster systems of spiral galaxies	the globular cluster (gc) systems of the milky way and of our neighboringspiral galaxy, m31, comprise 2 distinct entities, differing in 3 respects. 1.m31 has young gcs, ages from ~100 myr to 5 gyr old, as well as old globularclusters. no such young gcs are known in the milky way. 2. we confirm that theoldest m31 gcs have much higher nitrogen abundances than do galactic gcs atequivalent metallicities. 3. morrison et al. found m31 has a subcomponent ofgcs that follow closely the disk rotation curve of m31. such a gc system in ourown galaxy has yet to be found. these data are interpreted in terms of thehierarchical-clustering-merging (hcm) paradigm for galaxy formation. we inferthat m31 has absorbed more of its dwarf systems than has the milky way. thisinference has 3 implications: 1. all spiral galaxies likely differ in their gcproperties, depending on how many companions each galaxy has, and when theparent galaxy absorbs them. the the milky way ties down one end of thisspectrum, as almost all of its gcs were absorbed 10-12 gyr ago. 2. it suggeststhat young gcs are preferentially formed in the dwarf companions of parentgalaxies, and then absorbed by the parent galaxy during mergers. 3. young gcsseen in tidally-interacting galaxies might come from dwarf companions of thesegalaxies, rather than be made a-new in the tidal interaction. there is no readyexplanation for the marked difference in nitrogen abundance for old m31 gcsrelative to the oldest galactic gcs. the predictions made by li &amp; bursteinregarding the origin of nitrogen abundance in globular clusters are consistentwith what is found for the old m31 gcs compared to that for the two 5 gyr-oldm31 gcs.

astro-ph;0409628	the cosmological significance of low surface brightness galaxies found  in a deep blind neutral-hydrogen survey	we have placed limits on the cosmological significance of gas-rich lowsurface-brightness (lsb) galaxies as a proportion of the total population ofgas-rich galaxies by carrying out a very deep survey (hideep) for neutralhydrogen (hi) with the parkes multibeam system. such a survey avoids thesurface-brightness selection effects that limit the usefulness of opticalsurveys for finding lsb galaxies. to complement the hideep survey we havedigitally stacked eight 1-hour r-band tech pan films from the uk schmidttelescope covering 36 square degrees of the survey area to reach a very deepisophotal limit of 26.5 r mag/sq. arcsec. at this level, we find that all ofthe 129 hi sources within this area have optical counterparts and that 107 ofthem can be identified with individual galaxies. we have used the properties ofthe galaxies identified as the optical counterparts of the hi sources toestimate the significance of lsb galaxies (defined to be those at least 1.5magnitudes dimmer in effective surface-brightness than the peak in the observeddistribution seen in optical surveys). we calculate the contribution of lsbgalaxies to the total number, neutral hydrogen density, luminosity density,baryonic mass density, dynamical mass density and cross-sectional area ofgas-rich galaxies. we do not find any `crouching giant' lsb galaxies such asmalin 1, nor do we find a population of extremely low surface-brightnessgalaxies not previously found by optical surveys. such objects must either berare, gas-poor or outside the survey detection limits.

astro-ph;0501168	on variations in the fine-structure constant and stellar pollution of  quasar absorption systems	at redshifts z_abs &lt; 2, quasar absorption-line constraints on space-timevariations in the fine-structure constant, alpha, rely on the comparison ofmgii and feii transition wavelengths. one potentially important uncertainty isthe relative abundance of mg isotopes in the absorbers which, if different fromsolar, can cause spurious shifts in the measured wavelengths and, therefore,alpha. here we explore chemical evolution models with enhanced populations ofintermediate-mass (im) stars which, in their asymptotic giant branch (agb)phase, are thought to be the dominant factories for heavy mg isotopes at thelow metallicities typical of quasar absorption systems. by design, these modelspartially explain recent keck/hires evidence for a smaller alpha in z_abs &lt; 2absorption clouds than on earth. however, such models also over-produce n,violating observed abundance trends in high-z_abs damped lyman-alpha systems(dlas). our results do not support the recent claim of ashenfelter, mathews &amp;olive (2004b) that similar models of im-enhanced initial mass functions (imfs)may simultaneously explain the hires varying-alpha data and dla n abundances.we explore the effect of the im-enhanced model on si, al and p abundances,finding it to be much-less pronounced than for n. we also show that the 13c/12cratio, as measured in absorption systems, could constitute a future diagnosticof non-standard models of the high-redshift imf.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0601314	spitzer/mips infrared imaging of m31: further evidence for a spiral/ring  composite structure	new images of m31 at 24, 70, and 160 micron taken with the multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) reveal the morphology of the dust in this galaxy.this morphology is well represented by a composite of two logarithmic spiralarms and a circular ring (radius ~10 kpc) of star formation offset from thenucleus. the two spiral arms appear to start at the ends of a bar in thenuclear region and extend beyond the star forming ring. as has been found inprevious work, the spiral arms are not continuous but composed of spiralsegments. the star forming ring is very circular except for a region near m32where it splits. the lack of well defined spiral arms and the prominence of thenearly circular ring suggests that m31 has been distorted by interactions withits satellite galaxies. using new dynamical simulations of m31 interacting withm32 and ngc 205 we find that, qualitatively, such interactions can produce anoffset, split ring like that seen in the mips images.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.

astro-ph;9803126	on the trend of [mg/fe] among giant elliptical galaxies	we revisit the problem of the flat slope of the mg2 versus &lt;fe&gt; relationshipfound for nuclei of elliptical galaxies (faber et al. 1992; worthey et al.1992; carollo et al. 1993; davies et al. 1993), indicating that the mg/fe ratioshould increase with galactic luminosity and mass. we transform the abundanceof fe, as predicted by classic wind models and alternative models for thechemical evolution of elliptical galaxies, into the metallicity indices mg2 and&lt;fe&gt;, by means of the more recent index calibrations and show that none of thecurrent models for the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies is able toreproduce exactly the observed slope of the &lt;fe&gt; versus mg2 relation, althoughthe existing spread in the data makes this comparison quite difficult. in otherwords, we can not clearly discriminate between models predicting a decrease(classic wind model) or an increase of such a ratio with galactic mass. thereason for this resides in the fact that the available observations show alarge spread due mostly to the errors in the derivation of the &lt;fe&gt; index. inour opinion this fact prevents us from drawing any firm conclusion on thebehaviour of mg and fe in these galaxies.

astro-ph;9808023	the disruption of nearby galaxies by the milky way	interactions between galaxies are common and are an important factor indetermining their physical properties such as position along the hubblesequence and star-formation rate. there are many possible galaxy interactionmechanisms, including merging, ram-pressure stripping, gas compression,gravitational interaction and cluster tides. the relative importance of thesemechanisms is often not clear, as their strength depends on poorly knownparameters such as the density, extent and nature of the massive dark halosthat surround galaxies. a nearby example of a galaxy interaction where themechanism is controversial is that between our own galaxy and two of itsneighbours -- the large and small magellanic clouds. here we present the firstresults of a new hi survey which provides a spectacular view of thisinteraction. in addition to the previously known magellanic stream, whichtrails 100 degrees behind the clouds, the new data reveal a counter-streamwhich lies in the opposite direction and leads the motion of the clouds. thisresult supports the gravitational model in which leading and trailing streamsare tidally torn from the body of the magellanic clouds.

0706.0347	chemical and dynamical properties of the stellar halo	the difference in density profiles of the contributions from differentdensity peaks to dark matter halos results in certain expectations about themilky way's stellar halo. we cut our simulated halo stars into two populations:those forming before/during the last major merger, and those accreted after thelast major merger. the former population are more centrally located at z=0,while stars forming in low mass late forming proto-galaxies are spread throughthe halo. a difference in observed binding energy distinguishes these twopopulations. we look at possible chemical abundance signatures of the twopopulations. we also show that galaxies forming in isolated low sigma peakswill form from primordial material. thus, even though the oldest stars arecentrally concentrated as they originated in the early collapsing, densestregions, primordial stars would be found distributed throughout the halo. thus,the lack of observed metal free stars can be taken as directly constraining thepopulation iii imf, and the lowest metallicity observed stars can beinterpreted as holding clues to the chemical yields of pop iii stars.
