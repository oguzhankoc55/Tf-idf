0904.2725	nature of x-shaped sources	the nature of x-shaped sources is a matter of considerable debate: it haseven been proposed that they provide evidence for black hole mergers$ / $spinreorientation, and therefore constrain the rate of strong gravitational waveevents (merritt &amp; ekers 2002). based on morphological and spectralcharacteristics of these sources, currently a strong contender to explain thenature of these sources is the `alternative' model of lal &amp; rao (2007), inwhich these sources consist of two pairs of jets, which are associated with twounresolved agns. detailed morphological and spectral results onmilliarcsecond-scales (mas) provide a crucial test of this model, and hencethese sources are excellent candidates to study on mas; {\it i.e.}, to detecthe presence/absence of double nuclei/agns, signs of helical/disrupted jets,thereby, to investigate spatially resolved/unresolved binary agn systems andproviding clues to understanding the physics of merging of agns on mas. weconducted a systematic study of a large sample of known x-shaped, comparison frii radio galaxies, and newly discovered x-shaped candidate sources using giantmetrewave radio telescope and very large array at several radio frequencies. inour new observations of `comparison' fr ii radio galaxies we find that almostall of our targets show standard spectral steepening as a function of distancefrom the hotspot. however, one source, 3c 321, has a low-surface-brightnessextension that shows a flatter spectral index than the high-surface-brightnesshotspots$ / $lobes, as found in `known' x-shaped sources.

0904.3925	variability timescales in the m87 jet: signatures of e-squared losses,  discovery of a quasi-period in hst-1, and the site of tev flaring	we investigate the variability timescales in the jet of m87 with two goals.the first is to use the rise times and decay times in the radio, ultravioletand x-ray lightcurves of hst-1 to constrain the source size and the energy lossmechanisms affecting the relativistic electron distributions. hst-1 is thefirst jet knot clearly resolved from the nuclear emission by chandra and is thesite of the huge flare of 2005. we find clear evidence for afrequency-dependent decrease in the synchrotron flux being consistent withe-squared energy losses. assuming that this behavior is predominantly caused bysynchrotron cooling, we estimate a value of 0.6 mg for the average magneticfield strength of the hst-1 emission region, a value consistent with previousestimates of the equipartition field. in the process of analyzing the firstderivative of the x-ray light curve of hst-1, we discovered a quasi-periodicoscillation which was most obvious in 2003 and 2004 prior to the major flare in2005. the four cycles observed have a period of order 6 months. the second goalis to search for evidence of differences between the x-ray variabilitytimescales of hst-1 and the unresolved nuclear region (diameter &lt;0.6"). thesefeatures, separated by more than 60 pc, are the two chief contenders for theorigin of the tev variable emissions observed by hess in 2005 and by magic andveritas in 2008. the x-ray variability of the nucleus appears to be at leasttwice as rapid as that of the hst-1 knot. however, the shortest nuclearvariability timescale we can measure from the chandra data (&lt;= 20 days) isstill significantly longer than the shortest tev variability of m87 reported bythe hess and magic telescopes (1-2 days).

0906.0019	a chandra view of ngc 3621: a bulgeless galaxy hosting an agn in its  early phase?	we report the detection of a weak x-ray point source coincident with thenucleus of the bulgeless disk galaxy ngc 3621, recently discovered by spitzerto display high ionization mid-infrared lines typically associated with agn.these chandra observations provide confirmation for the presence of an agn inthis galaxy, adding to the growing evidence that black holes do form and growin isolated bulgeless disk galaxies. although the low signal-to-noise ratio ofthe x-ray spectrum prevents us from carrying out a detailed spectral analysisof the nuclear source, the x-ray results, combined with the ir and opticalspectroscopic results, suggests that ngc 3621 harbors a heavily absorbed agn,with a supermassive black hole of relatively small mass accreting at a highrate. chandra also reveals the presence of two bright sources straddling thenucleus located almost symmetrically at 20" from the center. both sources havex-ray spectra that are well-fitted by an absorbed power-law model. assumingthey are at the distance of ngc 3621, these two sources have luminosities ofthe order of 1.e39 erg/s, which make them ulxs and suggest that they are blackhole systems. estimates of the black hole mass based on the x-ray spectralanalysis and scaling laws of black hole systems suggest that the 2 brightsources might be intermediate mass black holes with m_bh of the order of a fewthousand solar masses. however, higher quality x-ray data combined withmulti-wavelength observations are necessary to confirm these conclusions.

0910.3611	x-ray emitting ghz-peaked spectrum galaxies: testing a  dynamical-radiative model with broad-band spectra	in a dynamical-radiative model we recently developed to describe the physicsof compact, ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) sources, the relativistic jets propagateacross the inner, kpc-sized region of the host galaxy, while the electronpopulation of the expanding lobes evolves and emits synchrotron andinverse-compton (ic) radiation. interstellar-medium gas clouds engulfed by theexpanding lobes, and photoionized by the active nucleus, are responsible forthe radio spectral turnover through free-free absorption (ffa) of thesynchrotron photons. the model provides a description of the evolution of thespectral energy distribution (sed) of gps sources with their expansion,predicting significant and complex high-energy emission, from the x-ray to thegamma-ray frequency domain. here, we test this model with the broad-band sedsof a sample of eleven x-ray emitting gps galaxies with compact-symmetric-object(cso) morphology, and show that: (i) the shape of the radio continuum atfrequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for bythe ffa mechanism; (ii) the observed x-ray spectra can be interpreted asnon-thermal radiation produced via ic scattering of the local radiation fieldsoff the lobe particles, providing a viable alternative to the thermal,accretion-disk dominated scenario. we also show that the relation between thehydrogen column densities derived from the x-ray (n_h) and radio (n_hi) data ofthe sources is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, if confirmed byfuture observations, would provide further support to our scenario ofhigh-energy emitting lobes.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

0707.3980	deep chandra and multicolor hst observations of the jets of 3c 371 and  pks 2201+044	this paper presents multiwavelength imaging and broad-band spectroscopy ofthe relativistic jets in the two nearby radio galaxies 3c 371 and pks 2201+044,acquired with chandra, hst, vla, and merlin. radio polarization images are alsoavailable. the two sources stand out as "intermediate'' between fris and friis;their cores are classified as bl lacs, although broad and narrow opticalemission lines were detected at times. the multiwavelength images show jetmorphologies with the x-ray emission peaking closer to the nucleus than thelonger wavelengths. the jets are resolved at all wavelengths in a directionperpendicular to the jet axis. the jets seds are consistent with a singlespectral component from radio to x-rays, interpreted as synchrotron emission.the seds show a progressive softening from the inner to the outer regions ofthe jet, indicating that the electron break energy moves to lower energies withdistance from the core. overall, the x-ray and multiwavelength properties ofthe jets of 3c 371 and pks 2201+044 appear intermediate between those of frisand friis.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1003.0976	the classification of extragalactic x-ray jets	the overall classification of x-ray jets has clung to that prevalent in theradio: fri vs. frii (including quasars). indeed, the common perception is thatx-ray emission from fri's is synchrotron emission whereas that from frii's maybe ic/cmb and/or synchrotron. now that we have a sizable collection of sourceswith detected x-ray emission from jets and hotspots, it seems that a moreunbiased study of these objects could yield additional insights on jets andtheir x-ray emission. the current contribution is a first step in the processof analyzing all of the relevant parameters for each detected component for thesources collected in the xjet website. this initial effort involves measuringthe ratio of x-ray to radio fluxes and evaluating correlations with other jetparameters. for single zone synchrotron x-ray emission, we anticipate thatlarger values of fx/fr should correlate inversely with the average magneticfield strength (if the acceleration process is limited by loss time equalsacceleration time). beamed ic/cmb x-rays should produce larger values of fx/frfor smaller values of the angle between the jet direction and the line of sightbut will also be affected by the low frequency radio spectral index.

1004.2352	gamma-ray spectral evolution of ngc1275 observed with fermi-lat	we report on a detailed investigation of the high-energy gamma-ray emissionfrom ngc\,1275, a well-known radio galaxy hosted by a giant elliptical locatedat the center of the nearby perseus cluster. with the increased photonstatistics, the center of the gamma-ray emitting region is now measured to beseparated by only 0.46' from the nucleus of ngc1275, well within the 95%confidence error circle with radius ~1.5'. early fermi-lat observationsrevealed a significant decade-timescale brightening of ngc1275 at gev photonenergies, with a flux about seven times higher than the one implied by theupper limit from previous egret observations. with the accumulation of one-yearof fermi-lat all-sky-survey exposure, we now detect flux and spectralvariations of this source on month timescales, as reported in this paper. theaverage &gt;100 mev gamma-ray spectrum of ngc1275 shows a possible deviation froma simple power-law shape, indicating a spectral cut-off around an observedphoton energy of e = 42.2+-19.6 gev, with an average flux of f = (2.31+-0.13) x10^{-7} ph/cm^2/s and a power-law photon index, gamma = 2.13+-0.02. the largestgamma-ray flaring event was observed in april--may 2009 and was accompanied bysignificant spectral variability above e &gt; 1-2 gev. the gamma-ray activity ofngc1275 during this flare can be described by a hysteresis behavior in the fluxversus photon index plane. the highest energy photon associated with thegamma-ray source was detected at the very end of the observation, with theobserved energy of e = 67.4gev and an angular separation of about 2.4' from thenucleus. in this paper we present the details of the fermi-lat data analysis,and briefly discuss the implications of the observed gamma-ray spectralevolution of ngc1275 in the context of gamma-ray blazar sources in general.

0708.1265	evolution of a powerful radio loud quasar 3c186 and its impact on the  cluster environment at z=1	x-ray cluster emission has been observed mainly in clusters with "inactive"cd galaxies (l_bol ~1e40-1e43erg/sec), which do not show signs of accretiononto a smbh. our recent chandra discovery of ~100kpc scale diffuse x-rayemission revealed the presence of an x-ray cluster associated with the radioloud quasar 3c186 at redshift z=1.1 and suggests interactions between thequasar and the cluster. in contrast to the majority of x-ray clusters the 3c186cluster contains a quasar in the center whose radiative power alone exceedsthat which would be needed to quench the cluster cooling. we present thechandra x-ray data and new deep radio and optical images of this cluster. the3c186 quasar is a powerful compact steep spectrum radio source expanding intothe cluster medium. the 2arcsec radio jet is unresolved in the chandraobservation, but its direction is orthogonal to the elliptical surfacebrightness of the cluster. the radio data show the possible presence of oldradio lobes on 10 arcsec scale in the direction of the radio jet. we discussthe nature of this source in the context of intermittent radio activity and theinteraction of the young expanding radio source with the cluster medium.

0708.1312	the case of the 300 kpc long x-ray jet in pks 1127-145 at z=1.18	the complex x-ray morphology of the 300 kpc long x-ray jet in pks1127-145(z=1.18 quasar) is clearly discerned in a ~100 ksec chandra observation. thejet x-ray surface brightness gradually decreases by an order of magnitude goingout from the core. the x-ray spectrum of the inner jet is relatively flat withalpha_x=0.66+/-0.15 and steep in the outer jet with alpha_x=1.0+/-0.2. thex-ray and radio jet intensity profiles are strikingly different, with the radioemission peaking strongly at the two outer knots while the x-ray emission isstrongest in the inner jet region. we discuss the constraints implied by thesedata on the x-ray emission models and conclude that ``one-zone'' models failand that at least a two-component model is needed to explain the jet'sbroadband emission. we propose that the x-ray emission originates in the jetproper while the bulk of the radio emission comes from a surrounding jetsheath. we also consider intermittent jet activity as a possible cause of theobserved jet morphology.

1008.1739	high redshift x-ray cooling-core cluster associated with the luminous  radio loud quasar 3c186	we present the first results from a new, deep (200ks) chandra observation ofthe x-ray luminous galaxy cluster surrounding the powerful (l ~10^47 erg/s),high-redshift (z=1.067), compact-steep-spectrum radio-loud quasar 3c186. thediffuse x-ray emission from the cluster has a roughly ellipsoidal shape andextends out to radii of at least ~60 arcsec (~500 kpc). the centroid of thediffuse x-ray emission is offset by 0.68(+/-0.11) arcsec (5.5+/-0.9 kpc) fromthe position of the quasar. we measure a cluster mass within the radius atwhich the mean enclosed density is 2500 times the critical density,r_2500=283(+18/-13)kpc, of 1.02 (+0.21/-0.14)x10^14 m_sun. the gas massfraction within this radius is f_gas=0.129(+0.015/-0.016). this value isconsistent with measurements at lower redshifts and implies minimal evolutionin the f_gas(z) relation for hot, massive clusters at 0&lt;z&lt;1.1. the measuredmetal abundance of 0.42(+0.08/-0.07) solar is consistent with the abundanceobserved in other massive, high redshift clusters. the spatially-resolvedtemperature profile for the cluster shows a drop in temperature, from kt~8 kevto kt~3 kev, in its central regions that is characteristic of cooling coreclusters. this is the first spectroscopic identification of a cooling corecluster at z&gt;1. we measure cooling times for the x-ray emitting gas at radii of50 kpc and 25 kpc of 1.7(+/-0.2)x10^9 years and 7.5(+/-2.6)x 10^8 years, aswell as a nominal cooling rate (in the absence of heating) of400(+/-190)m_sun/year within the central 100 kpc. in principle, the cooling gascan supply enough fuel to support the growth of the supermassive black hole andto power the luminous quasar. the radiative power of the quasar exceeds by afactor of 10 the kinematic power of the central radio source, suggesting thatradiative heating may be important at intermittent intervals in cluster cores.

1012.0834	black holes in bulgeless galaxies: an xmm-newton investigation of ngc  3367 and ngc 4536	the vast majority of optically identified active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe local universe reside in host galaxies with prominent bulges, supportingthe hypothesis that black hole formation and growth is fundamentally connectedto the build-up of galaxy bulges. however, recent mid-infrared spectroscopicstudies with spitzer of a sample of optically "normal" late-type galaxiesreveal remarkably the presence of high-ionization [nev] lines in severalsources, providing strong evidence for agns in these galaxies. we presentfollow-up x-ray observations recently obtained with xmm-newton of two suchsources, the late-type optically normal galaxies ngc 3367 and ngc 4536. bothsources are detected in our observations. detailed spectral analysis revealsthat for both galaxies, the 2-10 kev emission is dominated by a power law withan x-ray luminosity in the 10^39 - 10^40 ergs s^-1 range, consistent with lowluminosity agns. while there is a possibility that x-ray binaries account forsome fraction of the observed x-ray luminosity, we argue that this fraction isnegligible. these observations therefore add to the growing evidence that thefraction of late-type galaxies hosting agns is significantly underestimatedusing optical observations alone. a comparison of the mid-infrared [nev]luminosity and the x-ray luminosities suggests the presence of an additionalhighly absorbed x-ray source in both galaxies, and that the black hole massesare in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 m_solar for ngc 3367 and 10^4 - 10^6 m_solarfor ngc 4536.

1107.3370	broad line radio galaxies observed with fermi-lat: the origin of the gev  gamma-ray emission	we report on a detailed investigation of the gamma-ray emission from 18 broadline radio galaxies (blrgs) based on two years of fermi large area telescope(lat) data. we confirm the previously reported detections of 3c 120 and 3c 111in the gev photon energy range; a detailed look at the temporal characteristicsof the observed gamma-ray emission reveals in addition possible fluxvariability in both sources. no statistically significant gamma-ray detectionof the other blrgs was however found in the considered dataset. though thesample size studied is small, what appears to differentiate 3c 111 and 3c 120from the blrgs not yet detected in gamma-rays is the particularly strongnuclear radio flux. this finding, together with the indications of thegamma-ray flux variability and a number of other arguments presented, indicatethat the gev emission of blrgs is most likely dominated by the beamed radiationof relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles. in this paper wealso analyzed a comparison sample of high accretion-rate seyfert 1 galaxies,which can be considered radio-quiet counterparts of blrgs, and found none weredetected in gamma-rays. a simple phenomenological hybrid model applied for thebroad-band emission of the discussed radio-loud and radio-quiet type 1 activegalaxies suggests that the relative contribution of the nuclear jets to theaccreting matter is &gt; 1 percent on average for blrgs, whilst &lt;0.1 percent forseyfert 1 galaxies.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1109.6252	optical polarization and spectral variability in the m87 jet	during the last decade, m87's jet has been the site of an extraordinaryvariability event, with one knot (hst-1) increasing by over a factor 100 inbrightness. variability was also seen on timescales of months in the nuclearflux. here we discuss the optical-uv polarization and spectral variability ofthese components, which show vastly different behavior. hst-1 shows a highlysignificant correlation between flux and polarization, with p increasing from$\sim 20%$ at minimum to &gt;40% at maximum, while the orientation of its electricvector stayed constant. hst-1's optical-uv spectrum is very hard($\alpha_{uv-o}\sim0.5$, $f_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$), and displays "hard lags"during epochs 2004.9-2005.5, including the peak of the flare, with soft lags atlater epochs. we interpret the behavior of hst-1 as enhanced particleacceleration in a shock, with cooling from both particle aging and therelaxation of the compression. we set 2$\sigma$ upper limits of $0.5 \delta$parsecs and 1.02$c$ on the size and advance speed of the flaring region. theslight deviation of the electric vector orientation from the jet pa, makes itlikely that on smaller scales the flaring region has either a double or twistedstructure. by contrast, the nucleus displays much more rapid variability, witha highly variable electric vector orientation and 'looping' in the $(i,p)$plane. the nucleus has a much steeper spectrum ($\alpha_{uv-o} \sim 1.5$) butdoes not show uv-optical spectral variability. its behavior can be interpretedas either a helical distortion to a steady jet or a shock propagating through ahelical jet.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1111.5343	an experiment to locate the site of tev flaring in m87	we describe a chandra x-ray too project designed to isolate the site of tevflaring in the radio galaxy m87. to date, we have triggered the chandraobservations only once (2010 april) and by the time of the first of our 9observations, the tev flare had ended. however, we found that the x-rayintensity of the unresolved nucleus was at an elevated level for our firstobservation. of the more than 60 chandra observations we have made of the m87jet covering 9 years, the nucleus was measured at a comparably high level only3 times. two of these occasions can be associated with tev flaring, and at thetime of the third event, there were no tev monitoring activities. from therapidity of the intensity drop of the nucleus, we infer that the size of theemitting region is of order a few light days times the unknown beaming factor;comparable to the same sort of estimate for the tev emitting region. we alsofind evidence of spectral evolution in the x-ray band which seems consistentwith radiative losses affecting the non-thermal population of the emittingelectrons within the unresolved nucleus.

1201.3629	discovery of an unidentified fermi object as a black widow-like  millisecond pulsar	the fermi gamma-ray space telescope has revolutionized our knowledge of thegamma-ray pulsar population, leading to the discovery of almost 100 gamma-raypulsars and dozens of gamma-ray millisecond pulsars (msps). although theouter-gap model predicts different sites of emission for the radio andgamma-ray pulsars, until now all of the known gamma-ray msps have been visiblein the radio. here we report the discovery of a "radio-quiet" gamma-rayemitting msp candidate by using fermi, chandra, swift, and opticalobservations. the x-ray and gamma-ray properties of the source are consistentwith known gamma-ray pulsars. we also found a 4.63-hr orbital period in opticaland x-ray data. we suggest that the source is a black widow-like msp with a~0.1 solar-mass late-type companion star. based on the profile of the opticaland x-ray light-curves, the companion star is believed to be heated by thepulsar while the x-ray emissions originate from pulsar magnetosphere and/orfrom intra-binary shock. no radio detection of the source has been reported yetand although no gamma-ray/radio pulsation has been found, we estimated that thespin period of the msp is ~3-5 ms based on the inferred gamma-ray luminosity.

1202.0868	suzaku x-ray imaging of the extended lobe in the giant radio galaxy  ngc6251 associated with the fermi-lat source 2fglj1629.4+8236	we report the results of a suzaku x-ray imaging study of ngc6251, a nearbygiant radio galaxy with intermediate fr i/ii radio properties. our pointingdirection was centered on the gamma -ray emission peak recently discovered withfermi-lat around the position of the north-west radio lobe 15 arcmin offsetfrom the nucleus. after subtracting two "off-source" pointings adjacent to theradio lobe, and removing possible contaminants in the xis field of view, wefound significant residual x-ray emission most likely diffuse in nature. thespectrum of the excess x-ray emission is well fit by a power law with photonindex \gamma = 1.90 +- 0.15 and a 0.5 - 8 kev flux of 4 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}. we interpret this diffuse x-ray emission component as being due toinverse-compton up-scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons byultrarelativistic electrons within the lobe, with only a minor contributionfrom the beamed emission of the large-scale jet. utilizing archival radio datafor the source, we demonstrate by means of broad-band spectral modeling thatthe -ray flux of the fermi-lat source 2fgl j1629.4+8236 may well be accountedfor by the high-energy tail of the inverse-compton continuum of the lobe. thus,this claimed association of gamma-rays from the north-west lobe of ngc6251,together with the recent fermi-lat imaging of the extended lobes of centaurusa, indicates that particles may be efficiently (re-)accelerated up toultrarelativistic energies within extended radio lobes of nearby radio galaxiesin general.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1308.0595	fermi large area telescope detection of two very-high-energy (e&gt;100 gev)  gamma-ray photons from the z = 1.1 blazar pks 0426-380	we report the fermi large area telescope (lat) detection of twovery-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray photons from the directionalvicinity of the distant (redshift, z = 1.1) blazar pks 0426-380. the nullhypothesis that both the 134 and 122 gev photons originate from unrelatedsources can be rejected at the 5.5 sigma confidence level. we therefore claimthat at least one of the two vhe photons is securely associated with theblazar, making pks 0426-380 the most distant vhe emitter known to date. theresults are in agreement with the most recent fermi-lat constraints on theextragalactic background light (ebl) intensity, which imply a $z \simeq 1$horizon for $\simeq$ 100 gev photons. the lat detection of the two vhegamma-rays coincided roughly with flaring states of the source, although we didnot find an exact correspondence between the vhe photon arrival times and theflux maxima at lower gamma-ray energies. modeling the gamma-ray continuum ofpks 0426-380 with daily bins revealed a significant spectral hardening aroundthe time of detection of the first vhe event (lat photon index \gamma\ $\simeq$1.4) but on the other hand no pronounced spectral changes near the detectiontime of the second one. this combination implies a rather complex variabilitypattern of the source in gamma rays during the flaring epochs. an additionalflat component is possibly present above several tens of gev in theebl-corrected fermi-lat spectrum accumulated over the ~8-month high state.

1310.3553	suzaku observations of the diffuse x-ray emission across the fermi  bubbles' edges	we present suzaku x-ray observations along two edge regions of the fermibubbles, with eight ~20 ksec pointings across the northern part of the northpolar spur (nps) surrounding the north bubble and six across the southernmostedge of the south bubble. after removing compact x-ray features, diffuse x-rayemission is clearly detected and is well reproduced by a three-componentspectral model consisting of unabsorbed thermal emission (temperature kt ~0.1kev from the local bubble (lb), absorbed kt ~0.3 kev thermal emission relatedto the nps and/or galactic halo (gh), and a power-law component at a levelconsistent with the cosmic x-ray background. the emission measure (em) of the0.3 kev plasma decreases by ~50% toward the inner regions of the north-eastbubble, with no accompanying temperature change. however, such a jump in the emis not clearly seen in the south bubble data. while it is unclear if the npsoriginates from a nearby supernova remnant or is related to previous activitywithin/around the galactic center, our suzaku observations provide evidencesuggestive of the latter scenario. in the latter framework, the presence of alarge amount of neutral matter absorbing the x-ray emission as well as theexistence of the kt ~ 0.3 kev gas can be naturally interpreted as a weak shockdriven by the bubbles' expansion in the surrounding medium, with velocity v_exp~300 km/s (corresponding to shock mach number m ~1.5), compressing the gh gasto form the nps feature. we also derived an upper limit for any non-thermalx-ray emission component associated with the bubbles and demonstrate, that inagreement with the findings above, the non-thermal pressure and energyestimated from a one-zone leptonic model of its broad-band spectrum, are inrough equilibrium with that of the surrounding thermal plasma.

1401.0548	fermi-lat detection of gravitational lens delayed gamma-ray flares from  blazar b0218+357	using data from the fermi large area telescope (lat), we report the firstclear gamma-ray measurement of a delay between flares from the gravitationallylensed images of a blazar. the delay was detected in b0218+357, a knowndouble-image lensed system, during a period of enhanced gamma-ray activity withpeak fluxes consistently observed to reach &gt;20-50 times its previous averageflux. an auto-correlation function analysis identified a delay in the gamma-raydata of 11.46 +/- 0.16 days (1 sigma) that is ~1 day greater than previousradio measurements. considering that it is beyond the capabilities of the latto spatially resolve the two images, we nevertheless decomposed individualsequences of superposing gamma-ray flares/delayed emissions. in three such~8-10 day-long sequences within a ~4-month span, considering confusion due tooverlapping flaring emission and flux measurement uncertainties, we found fluxratios consistent with ~1, thus systematically smaller than those from radioobservations. during the first, best-defined flare, the delayed emission wasdetailed with a fermi pointing, and we observed flux doubling timescales of~3-6 hrs implying as well extremely compact gamma-ray emitting regions.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1404.0248	peculiar radio structures in the central regions of galaxy cluster abell  585	in this paper we analyze the peculiar radio structure observed across thecentral region of the galaxy cluster abell 585 (z=0.12). in the low-resolutionradio maps, this structure appears uniform and diffuse on angular scales of ~3arcmin, and is seemingly related to the distant (z=2.5) radio quasar b30727+409 rather than to the cluster itself. however, after a carefulinvestigation of the unpublished archival radio data with better angularresolution, we resolve the structure into two distinct arcmin-scale features,which resemble typical lobes of cluster radio galaxies with no obviousconnection to the background quasar. we support this conclusion by examiningthe spectral and polarization properties of the features, demonstrating inaddition that the analyzed structure can hardly be associated with any sort ofa radio mini-halo or relics of the cluster. yet at the same time we are notable to identify host galaxies of the radio lobes in the available optical andinfrared surveys. we consider some speculative explanations for our findings,including gravitational wave recoil kicks of smbhs responsible for the lobes'formation in the process of merging massive ellipticals within the centralparts of a rich cluster environment, but we do not reach any robust conclusionsregarding the origin of the detected radio features.

1404.5703	on the interaction of the pks b1358-113 radio galaxy with the abell 1836  cluster	[abridged] here we present the analysis of multifrequency data gathered forthe frii radio galaxy pks b1358-113, hosted in the brightest cluster galaxy ofabell 1836. the galaxy harbors one of the most massive black holes known todate and our analysis of the optical data reveals that this black hole is onlyweakly active. based on new chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations andarchival radio data we derive the preferred range for the jet kineticluminosity $\sim (0.5-3) \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. this is above the valuesimplied by various scaling relations proposed for radio sources in galaxyclusters, being instead very close to the maximum jet power allowed for thegiven accretion rate. we constrain the radio source lifetime as $\sim 40-70$myrs, and the total amount of deposited jet energy $\sim (2-8) \times10^{60}$\,ergs. the detailed analysis of the x-ray data provides indication forthe presence of a bow-shock driven by the expanding radio lobes into the abell1836 cluster environment, with the corresponding mach number $\sim 2-4$. this,together with the recently growing evidence that powerful frii radio galaxiesmay not be uncommon in the centers of clusters at higher redshifts, supportsthe idea that jet-induced shock heating may indeed play an important role inshaping the properties of clusters, galaxy groups, and galaxies in formation.we speculate on a possible bias against detecting jet-driven shocks in poorerenvironments, resulting from an inefficient electron heating at the shockfront, combined with a relatively long electron-ion equilibration timescale.

1405.1082	a strong radio brightening at the jet base of m87 during the elevated  very-high-energy gamma-ray state in 2012	we report our intensive radio monitoring observations of the jet in m87 withthe vlbi exploration of radio astrometry (vera) and the european vlbi network(evn) from february 2011 to october 2012, together with contemporaneoushigh-energy gamma-ray light curves obtained by the fermi-lat. during thisperiod, an elevated level of the m87 flux is reported at vhe gamma rays. wedetected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolvedjet base (radio core) with vera at 22 and 43ghz coincident with the vheactivity. meanwhile, we confirmed with evn at 5ghz that hst-1 (an alternativegamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its fluxdensity and structure. these results in the radio bands strongly suggest thatthe vhe gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or56 schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. we furtherconducted vera astrometry for the m87 core during the flaring period, anddetected core shifts between 22 and 43ghz. we also discovered a clearfrequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5ghz; theradio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a largeramplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at22 and 43ghz. this indicates that a new radio-emitting component was creatednear the black hole in the period of the vhe event, and then propagated outwardwith progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. by combining these results,we estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived asub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. this value is significantly slower thanthe super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during theprominent vhe flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger vhe activitycan be associated with the production of the higher lorentz factor jet.

1410.3473	binary orbits as the driver of gamma-ray emission and mass ejection in  classical novae	classical novae are the most common astrophysical thermonuclear explosions,occurring on the surfaces of white dwarf stars accreting gas from companions inbinary star systems. novae typically expel ~10^(-4) solar masses of material atvelocities exceeding 1,000 kilometres per second. however, the mechanism ofmass ejection in novae is poorly understood, and could be dominated by theimpulsive flash of thermonuclear energy, prolonged optically thick winds, orbinary interaction with the nova envelope. classical novae are now routinelydetected in gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray wavelengths, suggesting thatrelativistic particles are accelerated by strong shocks in the ejecta. here wereport high-resolution radio imaging of the gamma-ray-emitting nova v959 mon.we find that its ejecta were shaped by the motion of the binary system: somegas was expelled rapidly along the poles as a wind from the white dwarf, whiledenser material drifted out along the equatorial plane, propelled by orbitalmotion. at the interface between the equatorial and polar regions, we observesynchrotron emission indicative of shocks and relativistic particleacceleration, thereby pinpointing the location of gamma-ray production. binaryshaping of the nova ejecta and associated internal shocks are expected to bewidespread among novae, explaining why many novae are gamma-ray emitters.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

1412.3903	six years of fermi-lat and multi-wavelength monitoring of the broad-line  radio galaxy 3c 120: jet dissipation at sub-parsec scales from the central  engine	we present multi-wavelength monitoring results for the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c 120 in the mev/gev, sub-millimeter, and 43 ghz bands over six years.over the past two years, fermi-lat sporadically detected 3c 120 with highsignificance and the 230 ghz data also suggest an enhanced activity of thesource. after the mev/gev detection from 3c 120 in mjd 56240-56300, 43 ghz vlbamonitoring revealed a brightening of the radio core, followed by the ejectionof a superluminal knot. since we observed the gamma-ray and vlba phenomena intemporal proximity to each other, it is naturally assumed that they arephysically connected. this assumption was further supported by the subsequentobservation that the 43 ghz core brightened again after a gamma-ray flareoccurred around mjd 56560. we can then infer that the mev/gev emission tookplace inside an unresolved 43 ghz core of 3c 120 and that the jet dissipationoccurred at sub-parsec distances from the central black hole, if we take thedistance of the 43 ghz core from the central black hole as ~ 0.5 pc, aspreviously estimated from the time lag between x-ray dips and knot ejections(marscher et al. 2002; chatterjee et al. 2009). based on our constraints on therelative locations of the emission regions and energetic arguments, we concludethat the gamma rays are more favorably produced via the synchrotronself-compton process, rather than inverse compton scattering of externalphotons coming from the broad line region or hot dusty torus. we also derivedthe electron distribution and magnetic field by modeling the simultaneousbroadband spectrum.

1502.06862	discovery of gamma-ray pulsations from the transitional redback psr  j1227-4853	the 1.69 ms spin period of psr j1227-4853 was recently discovered in radioobservations of the low-mass x-ray binary xss j12270-4859 following theannouncement of a possible transition to a rotation-powered millisecond pulsarstate, inferred from decreases in optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray flux from thesource. we report the detection of significant (5$\sigma$) gamma-ray pulsationsafter the transition, at the known spin period, using ~1 year of data from thelarge area telescope on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. thegamma-ray light curve of psr j1227-4853 can be fit by one broad peak, whichoccurs at nearly the same phase as the main peak in the 1.4 ghz radio profile.the partial alignment of light-curve peaks in different wavebands suggests thatat least some of the radio emission may originate at high altitude in thepulsar magnetosphere, in extended regions co-located with the gamma-rayemission site. we folded the lat data at the orbital period, both pre- andpost-transition, but find no evidence for significant modulation of thegamma-ray flux. analysis of the gamma-ray flux over the mission suggests anapproximate transition time of 2012 november 30. continued study of the pulsedemission and monitoring of psr j1227-4853, and other known redback systems, forsubsequent flux changes will increase our knowledge of the pulsar emissionmechanism and transitioning systems.

1503.07244	on the merging cluster abell 578 and its central radio galaxy 4c +67.13	here we analyze radio, optical, and x-ray data for a peculiar cluster abell578. this cluster is not fully relaxed and consists of two merging sub-systems.the brightest cluster galaxy, cgpg 0719.8+6704, is a pair of interactingellipticals with projected separation $\sim$10 kpc, the brighter of which hoststhe radio source 4c +67.13. the fanaroff-riley type-ii radio morphology of 4c+67.13 is unusual for central radio galaxies in local abell clusters. our newoptical spectroscopy revealed that both nuclei of the cgpg 0719.8+6704 pair areactive, albeit at low accretion rates corresponding to the eddington ratio$\sim10^{-4}$ (for the estimated black hole masses of $\sim 3 \times10^8\,m_\odot$ and $\sim 10^9 \, m_\odot$). the gathered x-ray ({\it chandra})data allowed us to confirm and to quantify robustly the previously notedelongation of the gaseous atmosphere in the dominant sub-cluster, as well as alarge spatial offset ($\sim 60$\,kpc projected) between the position of thebrightest cluster galaxy and the cluster center inferred from the modeling ofthe x-ray surface brightness distribution. detailed analysis of the brightnessprofiles and temperature revealed also that the cluster gas in the vicinity of4c\,+67.13 is compressed (by a factor of about $\sim 1.4$) and heated (from$\simeq 2.0$\,kev up to 2.7\,kev), consistent with the presence of a weak shock(mach number $\sim 1.3$) driven by the expanding jet cocoon. this would thenrequire the jet kinetic power of the order of $\sim 10^{45}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$,implying either a very high efficiency of the jet production for the currentaccretion rate, or a highly modulated jet/accretion activity in the system.

0805.1021	a kpc-scale x-ray jet in the bl lac source s5 2007+777	x-ray jets in agn are commonly observed in frii and fri radio-galaxies, butrarely in bl lacs, most probably due to their orientation close to the line ofsight and the ensuing foreshortening effects. only three bl lacs are known sofar to contain a kpc-scale x-ray jet. in this paper, we present the evidencefor the existence of a fourth extended x-ray jet in the classicalradio-selected source s5 2007+777, which for its hybrid fri/ii radio morphologyhas been classified as a hymor (hybrid morphology radio source). our chandraacis-s observations of this source revealed an x-ray counterpart to the19"-long radio jet. interestingly, the x-ray properties of the kpc-scale jet ins5 2007+777 are very similar to those observed in frii jets. first, the x-raymorphology closely mirrors the radio one, with the x-rays being concentrated inthe discrete radio knots. second, the x-ray continuum of the jet/brightest knotis described by a very hard power law, with photon index gamma_x~1, althoughthe uncertainties are large. third, the optical upper limit from archival hstdata implies a concave radio-to-x-ray sed. if the x-ray emission is attributedto ic/cmb with equipartition, strong beaming (delta=13) is required, implying avery large scale (mpc) jet. the beaming requirement can be somewhat relaxedassuming a magnetic field lower than equipartition. alternatively, synchrotronemission from a second population of very high-energy electrons is viable.comparison to other hymor jets detected with chandra is discussed, as well asgeneral implications for the origin of the fri/ii division.

0808.1593	high-energy particle acceleration and production of ultra-high-energy  cosmic rays in the giant lobes of centaurus a	the nearby radio galaxy centaurus a is poorly studied at high frequencieswith conventional radio telescopes because of its very large angular size, butis one of a very few extragalactic objects to be detected and resolved by thewilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap). we have used the five-year wmapdata for cen a to constrain the high-frequency radio spectra of the 10-degreegiant lobes and to search for spectral changes as a function of position alongthe lobes. we show that the high-frequency radio spectra of the northern andsouthern giant lobes are significantly different: the spectrum of the southernlobe steepens monotonically (and is steeper further from the active nucleus)whereas the spectrum of the northern lobe remains consistent with a power law.the inferred differences in the northern and southern giant lobes may be theresult of real differences in their high-energy particle accelerationhistories, perhaps due to the influence of the northern middle lobe, anintermediate-scale feature which has no detectable southern counterpart. inlight of these results, we discuss the prospects for fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope detections of inverse-compton emission from the giant lobes and thelobes' possible role in the production of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays(uhecr) detected by the pierre auger observatory. we show that the possibilityof a fermi detection depends sensitively on the physical conditions in thegiant lobes, with the northern lobe more likely to be detected, and that anyemission observed by fermi is likely to be dominated by photons at the soft endof the fermi energy band. on the other hand we argue that the estimatedconditions in the giant lobes imply that uhecrs can be accelerated there, witha potentially detectable gamma-ray signature at tev energies.

astro-ph;0201412	a survey of extended radio jets in agn with chandra and hst: first  results	we present the first results from an x-ray and optical survey of a sample ofagn radio jets with chandra and hst. we focus here on the first six sourcesobserved at x-rays, in four of which a bright x-ray jet was detected for thefirst time. in three out of four cases optical emission from the jet is alsodetected in our hst images. we compare the x-ray morphology with the radio asderived from improved processing of archival vla data and we construct spectralenergy distributions (sed) for the most conspicuous emission knots. in mostcases the seds, together with the similarity of the x-ray and radiomorphologies, favor an inverse compton origin of the x-rays. the most likelyorigin of the seed photons is the cosmic microwave background, implying thejets are still relativistic on kiloparsec scales. however, in the first knot ofthe pks 1136-135 jet, x-rays are likely produced via the synchrotron process.in all four cases bulk lorentz factors of a few are required. the radio maps ofthe two jets not detected by either chandra or hst suggest that they are lessbeamed at large scales than the other four detected sources. our resultsdemonstrate that, at the sensitivity and resolution of chandra, x-ray emissionfrom extragalactic jets is common, yielding essential information on theirphysical properties.

astro-ph;0302265	chandra observations of nuclear x-ray emission from a sample of radio  sources	we present the x-ray properties of a sample of 17 radio sources observed withthe chandra x-ray observatory as part of a project aimed at studying the x-rayemission from their radio jets. in this paper, we concentrate on the x-rayproperties of the unresolved cores. the sample includes 16 quasars (11core-dominated and 5 lobe-dominated) in the redshift range z=0.30--1.96, andone low-power radio-galaxy at z=0.064. no diffuse x-ray emission is presentaround the cores of the quasars, except for the nearby low-power galaxy thathas diffuse emission on a scale and with a luminosity consistent with otherfris. no high-amplitude, short-term variability is detected within therelatively short chandra exposures. however, 1510-089 shows low-amplitude fluxchanges with a timescale of $\sim$25 minutes. the x-ray spectra of the quasarcores are generally well described by a single power law model with galacticabsorption. however, in six quasars we find soft x-ray excess emission below1.6 kev. interestingly, we detect an fe k-shell emission line, consistent withfluorescent kalpha emission from cold iron, in one lobe- and two core-dominatedsources. the average x-ray photon index for the quasars in the sample isgamma=1.66 and dispersion, sigma=0.23. the average spectral slope for oursample is flatter than the slope found for radio-quiet quasars and forradio-loud agns with larger jet orientations; this indicates that beamingaffects the x-ray emission from the cores in our sample of quasars.

astro-ph;0310722	the xmm-newton view of the x-ray halo and jet of ngc 6251	we present an xmm observation of the radio jet and diffuse halo of the nearbyradio galaxy ngc6251. the epic spectrum of the galaxy's halo is best-fitted bya thermal model with temperature kt~1.6 kev and subsolar abundances.interestingly, an additional hard x-ray component is required to fit the epicspectra of the halo above 3 kev, and is independently confirmed by an archivalchandra observation. however, its physical origin is not clear. contributionfrom a population of undetected low mass x-ray binaries seems unlikely.instead, the hard x-ray component could be due to inverse compton scattering ofthe cmb photons off relativistic electrons scattered throughout the halo of thegalaxy, or non-thermal bremsstrahlung emission. the ic/cmb interpretation,together with limits on the diffuse radio emission, implies a very weakmagnetic field, while a non-thermal bremsstrahlung origin implies the presenceof a large number of very energetic electrons. we also detect x-ray emissionfrom the outer (~3.5') jet, confirming previous rosat findings. both the epicand acis spectra of the jet are best-fitted by a power law with photon index\~1.2. a thermal model is formally ruled out by the data. assuming an origin ofthe x-rays from the jet via ic/cmb, as suggested by energetic arguments, andassuming equipartition implies a large doppler factor (delta~10).alternatively, weaker beaming is possible for magnetic fields several orders ofmagnitude lower than the equipartition field.

astro-ph;0401475	a survey of extended radio jets with chandra and hst	we present the results from an x-ray and optical survey of a sample of 17radio jets in agn performed with chandra and hst. the sample was selected fromthe radio and is unbiased toward detection at shorter wavelengths, butpreferentially it includes beamed sources. we find that x-ray emission iscommon on kpc-scales, with over half radio jets exhibiting at least one x-rayknot on the chandra images. the distributions of the radio-to-x-ray andradio-to-optical spectral indices for the detected jets are similar to thelimits for the non-detections,suggesting all bright radio jets have x-raycounterparts which will be visible in longer observations. comparing the radioand x-ray morphologies shows that the majority of the x-ray jets havestructures that closely map the radio. analysis of the sed of the jet knotssuggest the knots in which the x-ray and radio morphologies track each otherproduce x-rays by ic scattering of the cosmic microwave background. theremaining knots produce x-rays by the synchrotron process. spectral changes aredetected along the jets, with the ratio of the x-ray-to-radio andoptical-to-radio flux densities decreasing from the inner to the outer regions.this suggests the presence of an additional contribution to the x-ray flux inthe jet's inner part, either from synchrotron or ic of the stellar light.alternatively, in a pure ic/cmb scenario, the plasma decelerates as it flowsfrom the inner to the outer regions. finally, the x-ray spectral indices forthe brightest knots are flat, indicating that the bulk of the luminosity of thejets is emitted at gev energies, and raising the interesting possibility offuture detections with glast.

astro-ph;0605530	shedding new light on the 3c 273 jet with the spitzer space telescope	we have performed infrared imaging of the jet of the quasar 3c 273 atwavelengths 3.6 and 5.8 microns with the infrared array camera (irac) on thespitzer space telescope. when combined with the radio, optical and x-raymeasurements, the irac photometry clearly shows that the optical emission isdominated by the high-energy component of the jet, not by the radio synchrotroncomponent, as had been assumed to date. the high-energy component may be due toa second synchrotron component or to ic scattering of ambient photons. in theformer case, we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding 10^16 ev orpossibly even to 10^19 ev would be taking place in the jet. in contrast, the icmodel, into which highly relativistic doppler beaming has to be incorporated,requires very low-energy electrons (~ 1 mev). the present polarization data inthe radio and optical would favor the former interpretation in the case of the3c 273 jet. sensitive and detailed measurements of optical polarization areimportant to establish the radiation mechanism responsible for the high-energyemission. the present study offers new clues as to the controversial origin ofthe x-ray emission seen in many quasar jets.

0810.0941	gmrt study of x-shaped radio sources	context. the nature of x-shaped sources is a matter of considerable debate inthe literature: it has even been proposed that they provide evidence forblack-hole-mergers/spin-reorientation, and therefore constrain the rate ofstrong gravitational wave events. aim. to explore the nature of these x-shapedradio galaxies. method. we conduct a systematic study of a large sample ofknown and newly discovered x-shaped sources along with a comparison sample. weused the giant metrewave radio telescope with resolution of$\sim6^{\prime\prime}$ to $\sim15^{\prime\prime}$ at 610 mhz and 240 mhz in thedual-frequency mode. preliminary result. based on our careful analysis andestimation of the possible systematic errors, the known x-shaped sources divideinto the following three categories: (i) the wings have flatter spectralindices than the active lobes, (ii) the wings and the active lobes havecomparable spectral indices, and (iii) the wings have steeper spectral indicesthan the active lobes. in addition, based on our preliminary analysis, onesample source from our comparison sample shows a spectral index resultbelonging to category (i). future. milliarcsecond scale imaging will beconducted on some of these x-shaped sources to investigate if they are examplesof binary agn systems and thereby understand the nature of these sources.
