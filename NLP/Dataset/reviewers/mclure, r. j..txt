0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0912.0039	x-ray groups and clusters of galaxies in the subaru-xmm deep field	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in subaru-xmm deep  field. we reach a depth for a total cluster flux in the 0.5-2 kev band of2x10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} over one of the widest xmm-newton contiguousraster surveys, covering an area of 1.3 square degrees. cluster candidates areidentified through a wavelet detection of extended x-ray emission. the redsequence technique allows us to identify 57 cluster candidates. we report onthe progress with the cluster spectroscopic follow-up and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray luminosity and cluster scaling relations. inaddition, 3 sources are identified as x-ray counterparts of radio lobes, and in3 further sources, x-ray counterpart of radio lobes provides a significantfraction of the total flux of the source. in the area covered by nir data, ouridentification success rate achieves 86%. we detect a number of radio galaxieswithin our groups and for a luminosity-limited sample of radio galaxies wecompute halo occupation statistics using a marked cluster mass function. wecompare the cluster detection statistics in the sxdf with the predictions ofconcordance cosmology and current knowledge of the x-ray cluster properties,concluding that a reduction of concordance sigma_8 value by 5% is required inorder to match the prediction of the model and the data. this conclusion stillneeds verification through the completion of cluster follow-up.

1001.5419	the environments of z~1 active galactic nuclei at 3.6um	we present an analysis of a large sample of agn environments at z~1 usingstacked spitzer data at 3.6um. the sample contains type-1 and type-2 agn in theform of quasars and radio galaxies, and spans a large range in both optical andradio luminosity. we find, on average, that 2 to 3 massive galaxies containinga substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300 kpc radius of theagn, constituting a &gt;8-sigma excess relative to the field. secondly, we findevidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radioluminosity of agn, but not with black-hole mass. this is shown first bydividing the agn into their classical agn types, where we see more significantover-densities in the fields of the radio-loud agn. if instead we dispense withthe classical agn definitions, we find that the source over-density as afunction of radio luminosity for all our agn exhibits a positive correlation.one interpretation of this result is that the mpc-scale environment is in someway influencing the radio emission that we observe from agn. this could beexplained by the confinement of radio jets in dense environments leading toenhanced radio emission or, alternatively, may be linked to more rapidblack-hole spin brought on by galaxy mergers.

1002.3158	a spitzer-selected galaxy cluster at z=1.62	we report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at z=1.62 located in the spitzerwide-area infrared extragalactic survey xmm-lss field. this structure wasselected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red spitzer/irac colors,satisfying [3.6]-[4.5] &gt; -0.1 ab mag. photometric redshifts derived from subaruxmm deep survey (bviz-bands), ukirt infrared deep survey-ultra-deep survey(ukidss-uds, jk-bands), and from the spitzer public uds survey (3.6-8.0 micron)show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z ~ 1.6that is more than 20 sigma above the mean at this redshift. we obtained opticalspectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using imacs on themagellan telescope. we measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the rangez=1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin (&lt;1.4 mpc) of the astrometric center of thecluster. a posteriori analysis of the xmm data in this field reveal a weak (4sigma) detection in the [0.5-2 kev] band compatible with the expected thermalemission from such a cluster. the color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies inthis cluster shows a prominent red-sequence, dominated by a population of redgalaxies with (z-j) &gt; 1.7 mag. the photometric redshift probabilitydistributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z=1.62, coincidentwith the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. the rest-frame (u-b) color andscatter of galaxies on the red-sequence are consistent with a meanluminosity-weighted age of 1.2 +/- 0.1 gyr, yielding a formation redshift z_f =2.35 +/- 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star-formation periodin these galaxies.

1005.5176	a near-infrared morphological comparison of high-redshift submm and  radio galaxies: massive star-forming discs vs relaxed spheroids	we present deep, high-quality k-band images of complete subsamples ofpowerful radio and sub-mm galaxies at z=2. the data were obtained in the bestavailable seeing at ukirt and gemini north, with integration times scaled toensure that comparable rest-frame surface brightness levels are reached for allgalaxies. we fit two-dimensional axi-symmetric galaxy models to determinegalaxy morphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths &gt; 4000a, varyingluminosity, axial ratio, half-light radius, and sersic index. we find that,while some images show evidence of galaxy interactions, &gt;95% of the rest-frameoptical light in all galaxies is well-described by these simple models. we alsofind a clear difference in morphology between these two classes of galaxy; fitsto the individual images and image stacks reveal that the radio galaxies aremoderately large (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=8.4+-1.1kpc; median r{1/2}=7.8), de vaucouleursspheroids (&lt;n&gt; = 4.07+-0.27; median n=3.87), while the sub-mm galaxies appearto be moderately compact (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=3.4+-0.3kpc; median r{1/2}=3.1kpc)exponential discs (&lt;n&gt;=1.44+-0.16; median n=1.08). we show that the z=2 radiogalaxies display a well-defined kormendy relation but that, while larger thanother recently-studied high-z massive galaxy populations, they are still ~1.5times smaller than their local counterparts. the scalelengths of the starlightin the sub-mm galaxies are comparable to those reported for the molecular gas.their sizes are also similar to those of comparably massive quiescent galaxiesat z&gt;1.5. in terms of stellar mass surface density, the majority of the radiogalaxies lie within the locus defined by local ellipticals. in contrast, whilebest modelled as discs, most of the sub-mm galaxies have higher stellar massdensities than local galaxies, and appear destined to evolve into present-daymassive ellipticals.

0704.2136	the colour selection of distant galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey  early data release	we investigate colour selection techniques for high redshift galaxies in theukidss ultra deep survey early data release (uds edr). combined with very deepsubaru optical photometry, the depth (k_ab = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of theuds edr allows us to investigate optical/near-ir selection using a large sampleof over 30,000 objects. by using the b-z, z-k colour-colour diagram (the bzktechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z &gt; 1.4, which can befurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pbzk and sbzkrespectively). our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature notpreviously seen in bzk diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving trackof early type galaxies at z &lt; 1.4. we also compare the bzk technique with ther-k colour selection of extremely red objects (eros) and the j-k selection ofdistant red galaxies (drgs), and quantify the overlap between thesepopulations. we find that the majority of drgs, at these relatively brightmagnitudes are also eros. since previous studies have found that drgs at thesemagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these drg/ero galaxieshave seds consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or agn at z &lt; 2.finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pbzk galaxies, similarto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosityfunction of passive z &gt; 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.

1008.5244	the stellar mass function of the most massive galaxies at 3&lt;=z&lt;5 in the  ukidss ultra deep survey	we have analysed a sample of 1292 4.5 micron-selected galaxies at z&gt;=3, over0.6 square degrees of the ukirt infrared deep survey (ukidss) ultra deep survey(uds). using photometry from the u band through 4.5 microns, we have obtainedphotometric redshifts and derived stellar masses for our sources. only two ofour galaxies potentially lie at z&gt;5. we have studied the galaxy stellar massfunction at 3&lt;=z&lt;5, based on the 1213 galaxies in our catalogue with [4.5]&lt;=24.0. we find that: i) the number density of m &gt; 10^11 msun galaxies increasedby a factor &gt; 10 between z=5 and 3, indicating that the assembly rate of thesegalaxies proceeded &gt; 20 times faster at these redshifts than at 0&lt;z&lt;2; ii) theschechter function slope alpha is significantly steeper than that displayed bythe local stellar mass function, which is both a consequence of the steeperfaint end and the absence of a pure exponential decline at the high-mass end;iii) the evolution of the comoving stellar mass density from z=0 to 5 can bemodelled as log10 (rho_m) =-(0.05 +/- 0.09) z^2 - (0.22 -/+ 0.32) z + 8.69. at3&lt;=z&lt;4, more than 30% of the m &gt; 10^11 msun galaxies would be missed by opticalsurveys with r&lt;27 or z&lt;26. thus, our study demonstrates the importance of deepmid-ir surveys over large areas to perform a complete census of massivegalaxies at high z and trace the early stages of massive galaxy assembly.

1102.4881	a robust sample of galaxies at redshifts 6.0&lt;z&lt;8.7: stellar populations,  star-formation rates and stellar masses	we present the results of a photometric redshift analysis designed toidentify z&gt;6 galaxies from the near-ir hst imaging in three deep fields (hudf,hudf09-2 &amp; ers). by adopting a rigorous set of criteria for rejecting low-zinterlopers, and by employing a deconfusion technique to allow the availableirac imaging to be included in the candidate selection process, we have deriveda robust sample of 70 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) spanning the redshift range6.0&lt;z&lt;8.7. based on our final sample we investigate the distribution of uvspectral slopes (beta), finding a variance-weighted mean value of &lt;beta&gt;=-2.05+/- 0.09 which, contrary to some previous results, is not significantly bluerthan displayed by lower-redshift starburst galaxies. we confirm the correlationbetween uv luminosity and stellar mass reported elsewhere, but based on fittinggalaxy templates featuring a range of star-formation histories, metallicitiesand reddening we find that, at z&gt;=6, the range in mass-to-light ratio (m*/l_uv)at a given uv luminosity could span a factor of ~50. focusing on a sub-sampleof twenty-one candidates with irac detections at 3.6-microns we find that l*lbgs at z~6.5 have a median stellar mass of m* = (2.1 +/- 1.1) x 10^9 msun anda median specific star-formation rate of 1.9 +/- 0.8 gyr^-1. using the samesub-sample we have investigated the influence of nebular continuum and lineemission, finding that for the majority of candidates (16 out of 21) thebest-fitting stellar-mass estimates are reduced by less than a factor of 2.5.finally, a detailed comparison of our final sample with the results of previousstudies suggests that, at faint magnitudes, several high-redshift galaxysamples in the literature are significantly contaminated by low-redshiftinterlopers (abridged).

1102.5005	a critical analysis of the uv-continuum slopes of high-redshift  galaxies; no evidence (yet) for extreme stellar populations at z &gt; 6	it has recently been reported that the faintest galaxies at z~6-7 displayextremely blue uv continuum slopes, with a uv power-law index beta ~ -3. suchslopes are bluer than previously reported for any other galaxy population, andimply extinction-free, young, very low-metallicity stellar populations with ahigh ionizing photon escape fraction. here we undertake a critical study of theevidence for such extreme values of beta, combining three new wfc3/ir-selectedsamples of galaxies spanning ~2 decades in uv luminosity over the redshiftrange z~4.5-8. we explore the impact of inclusion/exclusion of less robusthigh-z candidates, and use the varying depths of the samples to explore theeffects of noise and selection bias. simple data-consistency arguments suggestthat artificially blue average values of beta can result when the analysis isextended into the deepest ~ 0.5-mag bin of these wfc3/ir-selected samples,regardless of the actual luminosity or z range probed. by confining attentionto robust, well-detected high-z galaxy candidates, we find that the averagevalue of beta is consistent with -2.05 +/- 0.10 for z=5-7, and -22 &lt; m_uv &lt;-18. we create and analyse a set of simulations which demonstrate that a biastowards artifically low/blue average values of beta is indeed expected when theuv slope analysis is extended towards the source detection threshold, andconclude that there is as yet no clear evidence for uv slopes significantlybluer than beta ~ -2, the typical value displayed by the bluest star-forminggalaxies at more modest z. a robust measurement of beta for the faintestgalaxies at z~7-8 remains a key observational goal, as it provides afundamental test for high escape fractions from a potentially abundant sourceof reionizing photons. this goal is achievable with hst, but requires stilldeeper wfc3/ir imaging in the hudf.

1104.2904	agn environments at z&lt;1.5 in the ukidss ultra-deep survey	we investigate the environments of both x-ray and radio-loud agn within theukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) using deep infrared selection to sample thegalaxy density field in the redshift range 1.0 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.5. using angularcross-correlation techniques we find that both x-ray and radio-loud agnpreferentially reside in overdense environments. we also find that both typesof agn cluster more strongly with those galaxies classified as `passive' ratherthan those that are actively star-forming. we infer clustering scale lengthscomparable to those of passive red galaxies, suggesting that typical agn atthese epochs reside in dark-matter halos of mass m &gt;~ 10^13 m_sun. a closerlook at the small-scale environments of the agn reveals that the neighbouringgalaxies of radio-loud agn have u-b colours more skewed towards the`green-valley' and the red sequence, whereas the neighbours of x-ray agn showno difference to the general galaxy population. this suggests that althoughboth agn types live in overdense environments, the radio-loud agn may bepreferentially located in more evolved cluster cores, in a similar environmentto low-powered radio agn in the local universe.

1107.1261	keck spectroscopy of faint 3&lt;z&lt;8 lyman break galaxies:- evidence for a  declining fraction of emission line sources in the redshift range 6&lt;z&lt;8	using deep keck spectroscopy of lyman break galaxies selected from infraredimaging data taken with wfc3/ir onboard the hubble space telescope, we presentnew evidence for a reversal in the redshift-dependent fraction of star forminggalaxies with detectable lyman alpha emission in the redshift range 6.3 &lt; z &lt;8.8. our earlier surveys with the deimos spectrograph demonstrated asignificant increase with redshift in the fraction of line emitting galaxiesover the interval 4 &lt; z &lt; 6, particularly for intrinsically faint systems whichdominate the luminosity density. using the longer wavelength sensitivities oflris and nirspec, we have targeted 19 lyman break galaxies selected usingrecent wfc3/ir data whose photometric redshifts are in the range 6.3 &lt; z &lt; 8.8and which span a wide range of intrinsic luminosities. our spectroscopicexposures typically reach a 5-sigma sensitivity of &lt; 50 a for the rest-frameequivalent width (ew) of lyman alpha emission. despite the high fraction ofemitters seen only a few hundred million years later, we find only 2 convincingand 1 possible line emitter in our more distant sample. combining withpublished data on a further 7 sources obtained using fors2 on the eso vlt, andassuming continuity in the trends found at lower redshift, we discuss thesignificance of this apparent reversal in the redshift-dependent lyman alphafraction in the context of our range in continuum luminosity. assuming all thetargeted sources are at their photometric redshift and our assumptions aboutthe lyman alpha ew distribution are correct, we would expect to find so fewemitters in less than 1% of the realizations drawn from our lower redshiftsamples. our new results provide further support for the suggestion that, atthe redshifts now being probed spectroscopically, we are entering the era wherethe intergalactic medium is partially neutral.

1110.1722	a remarkably high fraction of strong ly_alpha emitters amongst luminous  redshift 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 lyman break galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey	we present spectroscopic confirmation of ten highly luminous (l &gt;= 2l*) lymanalpha emitters in the redshift range 6.01&lt;z&lt;6.49 (nine galaxies and one agn),initially drawn from a sample of fourteen z_phot &gt;= 6 lyman break galaxies(lbgs) selected from an area of 0.25 square degrees within the ukidssultra-deep survey (uds). overall, our high rate of spectroscopic confirmation(&gt;= 71%) and low rate of contamination provides a strong vindication of thephotometric redshift analysis used to define the original sample. byconsidering star-formation rate estimates based on the ly_alpha and uvcontinuum luminosity we conclude that our sample is consistent with a ly_alphaescape fraction of ~25%. moreover, after careful consideration of the potentialuncertainties and biases, we find that 40%-50% of our sample of l &gt;= 2l*galaxies at 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 display strong ly_alpha emission (rest-frame equivalentwidth &gt;= 25 angs), a fraction which is a factor of ~2 higher than previouslyreported for l &lt;= l* galaxies at z~6. our results suggest that, as the epoch ofreionization is approached, it is plausible that the ly_alpha emitter fractionamongst luminous (l &gt;=2 l*) lbgs shows a similarly sharp increase to thatobserved in their lower-luminosity (l &lt;= l*) counterparts.

1110.3794	candels observations of the structural properties and evolution of  galaxies in a cluster at z=1.62	we discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in az=1.62 proto-cluster using near-ir imaging data from hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 data of the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphologyrelation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally havemorphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistentwith ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. the sizedistribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (&lt;1kpc), massive galaxies compared to candels field galaxies at z=1.6. as aresult the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizescompared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance.combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent clustergalaxies is relatively slow from z~1.6 to the present, growing as(1+z)^(-0.6+/-0.1). if this result is generalizable, then it implies thatphysical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to havecaused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slowersubsequent growth at z&lt;1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. thequiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lowerredshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggestthat they contain extended stellar disks. we argue the cluster galaxies requiredissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the diskmaterial and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, andcolor of early-type galaxies in z&lt;1 clusters.

0710.3136	on the evolution of clustering of 24um-selected galaxies	this paper investigates the clustering properties of a complete sample of1041 24um-selected sources brighter than f[24um]=400 ujy in the overlappingregion between the swire and ukidss uds surveys. we have concentrated on thetwo (photometric) interval ranges z=[0.6-1.2] (low-z sample) and z&gt;1.6 (high-zsample) as it is in these regions were we expect the mid-ir population to bedominated by intense dust-enshrouded activity such as star formation and blackhole accretion. investigations of the angular correlation function produce acorrelation length are r0~15.9 mpc for the high-z sample and r0~8.5 mpc for thelow-z one. comparisons with physical models reveal that the high-z sources areexclusively associated with very massive (m&gt;~10^{13} m_sun)haloes, comparableto those which locally host groups-to-clusters of galaxies, and are very commonwithin such (rare) structures. conversely, lower-z galaxies are found to residein smaller halos (m_min~10^{12} m_sun) and to be very rare in such systems.while recent studies have determined a strong evolution of the 24um luminosityfunction between z~2 and z~0, they cannot provide information on the physicalnature of such an evolution. our clustering results instead indicate that thisis due to the presence of different populations of objects inhabiting differentstructures, as active systems at z&lt;~1.5 are found to be exclusively associatedwith low-mass galaxies, while very massive sources appear to have concludedtheir active phase before this epoch. finally, we note that the small-scaleclustering data seem to require steep profiles for the distribution of galaxieswithin their halos. this is suggestive of close encounters and/or mergers whichcould strongly favour both agn and star-formation activity.

1205.4058	the sizes, masses and specific star-formation rates of massive galaxies  at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5: strong evidence in favour of evolution via minor mergers	we report the results of a comprehensive study of the relationship betweengalaxy size, stellar mass and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) at redshifts1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5. based on a mass complete (m_star &gt;= 6x10^10 msun), spectroscopicsample from the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), with accurate stellar-massmeasurements derived from spectro photometric fitting, we find that at z~1.4the location of massive galaxies on the size-mass plane is determined primarilyby their ssfr. at this epoch we find that massive galaxies which are passive(ssfr &lt;= 0.1 gyr^-1) follow a tight size-mass relation, with half-light radii afactor f=2.4+/-0.2 smaller than their local counterparts. moreover, amongst thepassive sub-sample we find no evidence that the off-set from the localsize-mass relation is a function of stellar population age. based on asub-sample with dynamical mass estimates we also derive an independent estimateof f=2.3+/-0.3 for the typical growth in half-light radius between z~1.4 andthe present day. focusing on the passive sub-sample, we conclude that toproduce the necessary evolution predominantly via major mergers would requirean unfeasible number of merger events and over populate the high-mass end ofthe local stellar mass function. in contrast, we find that a scenario in whichmass accretion is dominated by minor mergers can produce the necessaryevolution, whereby an increase in stellar mass by a factor of ~2, accompaniedby an increase in size by a factor of ~3.5, is sufficient to reconcile thesize-mass relation at z~1.4 with that observed locally. finally, we note that asignificant fraction (44+/-12%) of the passive galaxies in our sample have adisk-like morphology, providing additional evidence that separate physicalprocesses are responsible for the quenching of star-formation and themorphological transformation of massive galaxies (abridged).

1206.4060	the spitzer extragalactic representative volume survey (servs): survey  definition and goals	we present the spitzer extragalactic representative volume survey (servs), an18 square degrees medium-deep survey at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with thepost-cryogenic spitzer space telescope to ~2 microjy (ab=23.1) depth of fivehighly observed astronomical fields (elais-n1, elais-s1, lockman hole, chandradeep field south and xmm-lss). servs is designed to enable the study of galaxyevolution as a function of environment from z~5 to the present day, and is thefirst extragalactic survey both large enough and deep enough to put rareobjects such as luminous quasars and galaxy clusters at z&gt;1 into theircosmological context. servs is designed to overlap with several key surveys atoptical, near- through far-infrared, submillimeter and radio wavelengths toprovide an unprecedented view of the formation and evolution of massivegalaxies. in this paper, we discuss the servs survey design, the dataprocessing flow from image reduction and mosaicing to catalogs, as well ascoverage of ancillary data from other surveys in the servs fields. we alsohighlight a variety of early science results from the survey.

1206.4263	the vista deep extragalactic observations (video) survey	in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible andinfrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) deep extragalactic observations(video) survey. video is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared z,y,j,h andk_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and largestructures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from thepresent day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (agn) and the most massivegalaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. with its depth and area,video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn andstarburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters werebeginning to virialize. video therefore offers a unique data set with which toinvestigate the interplay between agn, starbursts and environment, and the roleof feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.  we provide data over the video-xmm3 tile, which also covers thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey deep-1 field (cfhtls-d1). thereleased video data reach a 5-sigma ab-magnitude depth of z=25.7, y=24.5,j=24.4, h=24.1 and k_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth ofy=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find goodastrometric agreement with the two-micron all sky survey, and source counts inagreement with the recently released ultravista survey data. the addition ofthe video data to the cfhtls-d1 optical data increases the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophicoutliers over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absenceof an i-band luminosity prior.

1206.4322	the morphologies of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels-uds field:  compact bulges, and the rise and fall of massive disks	we have used deep, hst, near-ir imaging to study the morphological propertiesof the most massive galaxies at high z, modelling the wfc3/ir h-band images ofthe ~200 galaxies in the candels-uds field with 1 &lt; z_phot &lt; 3, and stellarmasses m_star &gt; 10^11 m_sun. we have used both single-sersic and bulge+diskmodels, have investigated the errors/biases introduced by uncertainties in thebackground and the psf, and have obtained formally-acceptable model fits to&gt;90% of the galaxies. our results indicate that these massive galaxies at 1 &lt; z&lt; 3 lie both on and below the local size-mass relation, with a median r_e~2.6kpc, a factor of ~2.3 smaller than comparably-massive local galaxies. moreover,we find that bulge-dominated objects in particular show evidence for a growingbimodality in the size-mass relation with increasing z, and by z &gt; 2 thecompact bulges display effective radii a factor ~4 smaller than localellipticals of comparable mass. these trends appear to extend to the bulgecomponents of disk-dominated galaxies, and vice versa. we also find that, whilesuch massive galaxies at low z are bulge-dominated, at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 they arepredominantly mixed bulge+disk systems, and by z &gt; 2 they are mostlydisk-dominated. the majority of the disk-dominated galaxies are activelyforming stars, but this is also true for many of the bulge-dominated systems.interestingly, however, while most of the quiescent galaxies arebulge-dominated, we find that a significant fraction (25-40%) of the mostquiescent galaxies have disk-dominated morphologies. thus, while our resultsshow that the massive galaxy population is undergoing dramatic changes at thiscrucial epoch, they also suggest that the physical mechanisms which quenchstar-formation activity are not simply connected to those responsible for themorphological transformation of massive galaxies into present-day giantellipticals.

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

1208.0506	the size-luminosity relation at z=7 in candels and its implication on  reionization	the exploration of the relation between galaxy sizes and other physicalparameters has provided important clues for understanding galaxy formation. weuse the candels deep+wide surveys in the goods-south, uds and egs fields,complemented by data from the hudf09 program, to address the relation betweensize and luminosity at z\sim7. we select 153 z-band drop-out galaxies in sixdifferent fields characterized by a wide combination of depth and arealcoverage, ideally suited to sample without biases the observed size-magnitudeplane. detailed simulations allow us to derive the completeness as a functionof size and magnitude and to quantify measurements errors/biases. we find thatthe half light radius distribution function of z\sim7 galaxies fainter thanj=26.6 is peaked at &lt;0.1 arcsec (or equivalently 0.5 kpc proper), while atbrighter magnitudes high-z galaxies are typically larger than ~0.15 arcsec. wealso find a well defined size-luminosity relation, rh\siml^1/2. we compute theluminosity function in the hudf and p12hudf fields, finding large spatialvariation on the number density of faint galaxies. adopting the sizedistribution and the size-luminosity relation found for faint galaxies at z=7,we derive a mean slope of -1.7\pm0.1 for the luminosity function of lbgs atthis redshift. using this lf, we find that the amount of ionizing photonscannot keep the universe re-ionized if the igm is clumpy (c_hii&gt;3) and thelyman continuum escape fraction of high-z lbgs is relatively low (f_esc&lt;0.3).with future candels data, we can put severe limits to the role of galaxies inthe reionization of the universe.

1208.3464	the properties of (sub)millimetre-selected galaxies as revealed by  candels hst wfc3/ir imaging in goods-south	we have exploited the hst candels wfc3/ir imaging to study the properties of(sub-)mm galaxies in goods-south. after using the deep radio and spitzerimaging to identify galaxy counterparts for the (sub-)mm sources, we have usedthe new candels data in two ways. first, we have derived improved photometricredshifts and stellar masses, confirming that the (sub-)mm galaxies are massive(&lt;m*&gt;=2.2x10^11 m_solar) galaxies at z=1-3. second, we have exploited the depthand resolution of the wfc3/ir imaging to determine the sizes and morphologiesof the galaxies at rest-frame optical wavelengths, fitting two-dimensionalaxi-symmetric sersic models. crucially, the wfc3/ir h-band imaging enablesmodelling of the mass-dominant galaxy, rather than the blue high-surfacebrightness features which often dominate optical (rest-frame uv) images of(sub-)mm galaxies, and can confuse visual morphological classification. as aresult of this analysis we find that &gt;95% of the rest-frame optical light inalmost all of the (sub-)mm galaxies is well-described by either a singleexponential disk, or a multiple-component system in which the dominantconstituent is disk-like. we demonstrate that this conclusion is consistentwith the results of high-quality ground-based k-band imaging, and explain why.the massive disk galaxies which host luminous (sub-)mm emission are reasonablyextended (r_e=4 kpc), consistent with the sizes of other massive star-formingdisks at z~2. in many cases we find evidence of blue clumps within the sources,with the mass-dominant disk becoming more significant at longer wavelengths.finally, only a minority of the sources show evidence for a major galaxy-galaxyinteraction. taken together, these results support the view that most (sub-)mmgalaxies at z~2 are simply the most extreme examples of normal star-forminggalaxies at that era.

1209.4636	the unbiased measurement of uv spectral slopes in low luminosity  galaxies at z=7	the ultraviolet (uv) continuum slope beta, typically observed at z=7 inhubble space telescope (hst) wfc3/ir bands via the j-h colour, is a usefulindicator of the age, metallicity, and dust content of high-redshift stellarpopulations. recent studies have shown that the redward evolution of beta withcosmic time from redshift 7 to 4 can be largely explained by a build up ofdust. however, initial claims that faint z=7 galaxies in the hubble ultra deepfield wfc3/ir imaging (hudf09) were blue enough to require stellar populationsof zero reddening, low metallicity and young ages, hitherto unseen instar-forming galaxies, have since been refuted and revised. here we revisit thequestion of how best to measure the uv slope of z=7 galaxies through sourcerecovery simulations, within the context of present and future ultra-deepimaging from hst. we consider how source detection, selection and colourmeasurement have each biased the measurement of beta in previous studies. afterfinding a robust method for measuring beta in the simulations (via a power lawfit to all the available photometry), we remeasure the uv slopes of a sample ofpreviously published low luminosity z=7 galaxy candidates. the mean uv slope offaint galaxies in this sample appears consistent with an intrinsic distributionof normal star-forming galaxies with beta=-2, although properly decoding theunderlying distribution will require further imaging from the ongoing hudf12programme. we therefore go on to consider strategies for obtaining betterconstraints on the underlying distribution of uv slopes at z=7 from these newdata, which will benefit particularly from the addition of imaging in a secondj-band filter: f140w. we find that a precise and unbiased measurement of betashould then be possible.

1212.0860	the uv continua and inferred stellar populations of galaxies at z ~ 7 -  9 revealed by the hubble ultra deep field 2012 campaign	we use the new ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra-deepfield (hudf) provided by our udf12 hst wfc3/ir campaign to explore therest-frame uv properties of galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 6.5. we present the firstunbiased measurement of the average uv power-law index, beta, for faintgalaxies at z ~ 7, the first meaningful measurements of beta at z ~ 8, andtentative estimates for a new sample of galaxies at z ~ 9. utilising galaxyselection in the new f140w imaging to minimize colour bias, and applying bothcolour and power-law estimators of beta, we find beta = -2.1 (+/-0.2) at z ~ 7for galaxies with m_uv ~ -18. this means that the faintest galaxies uncoveredat this epoch have, on average, uv colours no more extreme than those displayedby the bluest star-forming galaxies at low redshift. at z ~ 8 we find a similarvalue, beta = -1.9 (+/-0.3). at z ~ 9, we find beta = -1.8 (+/-0.6),essentially unchanged from z ~ 6 - 7 (albeit highly uncertain). finally, weshow that there is as yet no evidence for a significant intrinsic scatter inbeta within our new, robust z ~ 7 galaxy sample. our results are most easilyexplained by a population of steadily star-forming galaxies with either ~ solarmetallicity and zero dust, or moderately sub-solar (~ 10-20%) metallicity withmodest dust obscuration (a_v ~ 0.1-0.2). this latter interpretation isconsistent with the predictions of a state-of-the-art galaxy-formationsimulation, which also suggests that a significant population of very-lowmetallicity, dust-free galaxies with beta ~ -2.5 may not emerge until m_uv &gt;-16, a regime likely to remain inaccessible until the james webb spacetelescope.

1304.7276	high velocity outflows from young star-forming galaxies in the ukidss  ultra-deep survey	we investigate galactic-scale outflows in the redshift range 0.71 &lt; z &lt; 1.63,using 413 k-band selected galaxies observed in the spectroscopic follow-up ofthe ukidss ultra-deep survey (udsz). the galaxies have an average stellar massof ~10^9.5 solar masses and span a wide range in rest-frame colours,representing typical star-forming galaxies at this epoch. we stack the spectraby various galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [oii] equivalent width,star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate and rest-frame spectralindices. we find that outflows are present in virtually all spectral stacks,with velocities ranging from 100-1000 km s^-1, indicating that large-scaleoutflowing winds are a common property at these redshifts. the highest velocityoutflows (&gt;500 km s^-1) are found in galaxies with the highest stellar massesand the youngest stellar populations. our findings suggest that high velocitygalactic outflows are mostly driven by star-forming processes rather than agn,with implied mass outflow rates comparable to the rates of star formation. suchbehaviour is consistent with models required to reproduce the high-redshiftmass-metallicity relation.

1310.0816	the mass-metallicity-sfr relation at z &gt;~ 2 with 3d-hst	we present new accurate measurements of the physical properties of astatistically significant sample of 103 galaxies at z~2 using near-infraredspectroscopy taken as part of the 3d-hst survey. we derive redshifts,metallicities and star formation rates (sfrs) from the [oii], [oiii] and hbetanebular emission lines and exploit the multi-wavelength photometry available incandels to measure stellar masses. we find the mass-metallicity relation (mzr)derived from our data to have the same trend as previous determinations in therange 0&lt;z&lt;3, with lower mass galaxies having lower metallicities. however wefind an offset in the relation compared to the previous determination of thez~2 mzr by erb et al. 2006b, who measure metallicities using the [nii]/halpharatio, with metallicities lower at a given mass. incorporating our sfrinformation we find that our galaxies are offset from the fundamentalmetallicity relation (fmr) by ~0.3 dex. we investigate the photoionizationconditions and find that our galaxies are consistent with the elevatedionization parameter previously reported in high-redshift galaxies. using thebpt diagram we argue that, if this is the case, metallicity indicators based on[nii] and halpha may not be consistent with the ones obtained via oxygen linesand hbeta. using a recent determination of the theoretical evolution of thestar forming sequence in the bpt diagram we convert our measured [oiii]/hbetaline ratios to [nii]/halpha ratios. from the [nii]/halpha ratio we infersystematically higher metallicities in better agreement with the fmr. ourresults thus suggest the evolution of the fmr previously reported at z~2-3 maybe an artifact of the differential evolution in metallicity indicators, andcaution against using locally calibrated metallicity relations at high redshiftwhich do not account for evolution in the physical conditions of star-formingregions.

1312.4975	the colour distribution of galaxies at redshift five	we present the results of a study investigating the rest-frame ultra-violet(uv) spectral slopes of redshift z~5 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs). by combiningdeep hubble space telescope imaging of the candels and hudf fields withground-based imaging from the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds), we have produceda large sample of z~5 lbgs spanning an unprecedented factor of &gt;100 in uvluminosity. based on this sample we find a clear colour-magnitude relation(cmr) at z~5, such that the rest-frame uv slopes (beta) of brighter galaxiesare notably redder than their fainter counterparts. we determine that the z~5cmr is well described by a linear relationship of the form: d beta = (-0.12 +/-0.02) d muv, with no clear evidence for a change in cmr slope at faintmagnitudes (i.e. muv &gt; -18.9). using the results of detailed simulations we areable, for the first time, to infer the intrinsic (i.e. free from noise)variation of galaxy colours around the cmr at z~5. we find significant (12sigma) evidence for intrinsic colour variation in the sample as a whole. ourresults also demonstrate that the width of the intrinsic uv slope distributionof z~5 galaxies increases from delta(beta)=0.1 at muv=-18 to delta(beta)=0.4 atmuv=-21. we suggest that the increasing width of the intrinsic galaxy colourdistribution and the cmr itself are both plausibly explained by a luminosityindependent lower limit of beta=-2.1, combined with an increase in the fractionof red galaxies in brighter uv-luminosity bins.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1405.1736	the bulge-disk decomposed evolution of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  candels	we present the results of a new and improved study of the morphological andspectral evolution of massive galaxies over the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3. ouranalysis is based on a bulge-disk decomposition of 396 galaxies withmstar&gt;10^11 msolar from the candels wfc3/ir imaging within the cosmos andukidss uds survey fields. we find that, by modelling the h(160) image of eachgalaxy with a combination of a de vaucouleurs bulge (sersic index n=4) and anexponential disk (n=1), we can then lock all derived morphological parametersfor the bulge and disk components, and successfully reproduce theshorter-wavelength j(125), i(814), v(606) hst images simply by floating themagnitudes of the two components. this then yields sub-divided 4-band hstphotometry for the bulge and disk components which, with no additional priors,is well described by spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution. armed withthis information we are able to properly determine the masses andstar-formation rates for the bulge and disk components, and find that: i) fromz=3 to z=1 the galaxies move from disk-dominated to increasinglybulge-dominated, but very few galaxies are pure bulges/ellipticals by z=1; ii)while most passive galaxies are bulge-dominated, and most star-forming galaxiesdisk-dominated, 18+/-5% of passive galaxies are disk-dominated, and 11+/-3% ofstar-forming galaxies are bulge-dominated, a result which needs to be explainedby any model purporting to connect star-formation quenching with morphologicaltransformations; iii) there exists a small but significant population of purepassive disks, which are generally flatter than their star-forming counterparts(whose axial ratio distribution peaks at b/a~0.7); iv) flatter/larger disksre-emerge at the highest star-formation rates, consistent with recent studiesof sub-mm galaxies, and with the concept of a maximum surface-density forstar-formation activity.

1405.5221	the decomposed bulge and disk size-mass relations of massive galaxies at  1&lt;z&lt;3 in candels	we have constructed a mass-selected sample of mstar&gt;10^11msolar galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels uds and cosmos fields and have decomposed these systemsinto their separate bulge and disk components according to their h(160)-bandmorphologies. by extending this analysis to multiple bands we have been able toconduct individual bulge and disk component sed fitting which has provided uswith stellar-mass and star-formation rate estimates for the separate bulge anddisk components. these have been combined with size measurements to explore theevolution of these massive high-redshift galaxies. by utilising the newdecomposed stellar-mass estimates, we confirm that the bulge components displaya stronger size evolution than the disks. this can be seen from both thefraction of bulge components which lie below the local relation and the mediansizes of the bulge components, where the bulges are a median factor of2.93+/-0.32 times smaller than similarly massive local galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and3.41+/-0.58 smaller at 2&lt;z&lt;3; for the disks the corresponding factors are1.65+/-0.14 and 1.99+/-0.25. moreover, by splitting our sample into the passiveand star-forming bulge and disk sub-populations and examining their sizes as afraction of their present-day counter-parts, we find that the star-forming andpassive bulges are equally compact, star-forming disks are larger, while thepassive disks have intermediate sizes. this trend is not evident whenclassifying galaxy morphology on the basis of single-sersic fits and adoptingthe overall star-formation rates. finally, by evolving the star-formationhistories of the passive disks back to the redshifts when the passive diskswere last active, we show that the passive and star-forming disks haveconsistent sizes at the relevant epoch. these trends need to be reproduced byany mechanisms which attempt to explain the morphological evolution ofgalaxies.

1409.7083	a mass threshold in the number density of passive galaxies at z$\sim$2	the process that quenched star formation in galaxies at intermediate and highredshift is still the subject of considerable debate. one way to investigatethis puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies atz~2, and its dependence on mass. here we present the results of a new studybased on very deep ks-band imaging (with the hawk-i instrument on the vlt) oftwo hst candels fields (the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) field andgoods-south). the new hawk-i data (taken as part of the hugs vlt large program)reach detection limits of ks&gt;26 (ab mag). we select a sample ofpassively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5. thanks to thedepth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend theselection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.through extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that theobserved turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at k&gt;22 is real. thishas enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescentgalaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter thanks~22(ab mag.). we show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold$m_*10^{10.8}\,{\rm m_{\odot}}$ below which the mechanism that halts the starformation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. finally we comparethe observed pbzk number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted fromfour different semi-analytic models. we find that none of the models provides astatistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescentgalaxies at these redshifts. we conclude that the mass function of quiescentgalaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demandingchallenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.

0805.1335	the luminosity function, halo masses and stellar masses of luminous  lyman-break galaxies at redshifts 5&lt;z&lt;6	we present the results of a study of a large sample of luminous (z'{ab}&lt;26)lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the redshift interval 4.7&lt;z&lt;6.3, selected from acontiguous 0.63 square degree area covered by the ukidss ultra deep survey(uds) and the subaru xmm-newton survey (sxds). utilising the large areacoverage and the excellent available optical+nearir data, we use a photometricredshift analysis to derive a new, robust, measurement of the bright end (l&gt;l*)of the uv-selected luminosity function at high redshift. when combined withliterature studies of the fainter lbg population, our new sample providesimproved constraints on the luminosity function of redshift 5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs over theluminosity range 0.1l*&lt;l&lt;10l*. a maximum likelihood analysis returnsbest-fitting schechter function parameters of m*_1500=-20.73, phi*=0.0009mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.66 for the luminosity function at z=5, and m*_1500 =-20.04, phi*=0.0018 mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.71 at z=6. in addition, an analysis ofthe angular clustering properties of our lbg sample demonstrates that luminous5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs are strongly clustered (r_0 = 8.1 mpc), and are consistent with theoccupation of dark matter halos with masses of ~10^{11.5-12.0} msun. moreover,by stacking the available multi-wavelength imaging data for the high-redshiftlbgs it is possible to place useful constraints on their typical stellar mass.the results of this analysis suggest that luminous lbgs at 5&lt;z&lt;6 have anaverage stellar mass of ~10^10 msun, consistent with the results of theclustering analysis assuming plausible values for the ratio of stellar to darkmatter. finally, by combining our luminosity function results with those of thestacking analysis we derive estimates of ~1x10^7 msun mpc^-3 and 4x10^6 msunmpc^-3 for the stellar mass density at z~5 and z~6 respectively.

astro-ph;0009406	the black-hole masses of seyfert galaxies and quasars	the central black-hole masses of a sample of 30 luminous quasars areestimated using h-beta fwhm measurements from a combination of new andpreviously-published nuclear spectra. the quasar black-hole mass estimates arecombined with reverberation-mapping measurements for a sample of seyfertgalaxies (wandel 1999) in order to study agn black-hole masses over a widerange in nuclear luminosity. it is found that black-hole mass and bulgeluminosity are well correlated and follow a relation consistent with thatexpected if black-hole and bulge mass are directly proportional. contrary tothe results of wandel (1999) no evidence is found that seyfert galaxies followa different mblack-mbulge relation to quasars. however, the black-hole massdistributions of the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasar sub-samples are found tobe significantly different, with the median black-hole mass of the radio-loudquasars a factor of three larger than their radio-quiet counterparts. finally,utilizing the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane to provide stellar velocitydispersion estimates, a comparison is performed between the virial h-betablack-hole mass estimates and those of the mblack-sigma correlations ofgebhardt et al. (2000a) and merritt &amp; ferrarese (2000). with the disc-likegeometry of the broad-line region adopted in this paper, the virial h-betablack-hole masses indicate that the correct normalization of the black-hole vs.bulge mass relation is mblack=0.0025mbulge, while the standard assumption ofpurely random broad-line velocities leads to mblack=0.0008mbulge. thenormalization of mblack=0.0025mbulge provided by the disc model is inremarkably good agreement with that inferred for our quasar sample using the(completely independent) mblack-sigma correlations.

astro-ph;0010007	a nicmos imaging study of high-z quasar host galaxies	we present the first results from a major hubble space telescope programdesigned to investigate the cosmological evolution of quasar host galaxies fromz~2 to the present day. here we describe j and h-band nicmos imaging of twoquasar samples at redshifts of 0.9 and 1.9 respectively. each sample containsequal numbers of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, selected to lie within thesame narrow range of optical absolute magnitude (-24 &gt; m_v &gt; -25). filter andtarget selection were designed to ensure that at each redshift the imagessample the same part of the object's rest-frame spectrum, avoiding potentialcontamination by [oiii]lambda5007 and h-alpha emission lines. at z=1 the hostsof both radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars lie on the same kormendy relationdescribed by 3cr radio galaxies at comparable redshift. there is some evidencefor a gap of ~1 mag between the host luminosities of rlqs and rqqs, adifference that cannot be due to emission-line contamination given the designof our study. however, within current uncertainties, simple passive stellarevolution is sufficient to link these galaxies with the elliptical hosts oflow-redshift quasars of comparable nuclear output, implying that the hosts arevirtually fully assembled by z=1. at z=2 the luminosity gap appears to havewidened further to ~1.5 mag. thus while the hosts of radio-loud quasars remainconsistent with a formation epoch of z&gt;3, allowing for passive evolutionimplies that the hosts of radio-quiet quasars are ~2-4 times less massive atz=2 than at low z.

astro-ph;0108122	coupled spheroid and black-hole formation, and the multifrequency  detectability of active galactic nuclei and submillimetre sources	we use a simple model of spheroid formation to explore the relationshipbetween the creation of stars and dust in a massive proto galaxy and the growthof its central black hole. this model predicts that sub-mm luminosity peaksafter only ~ 0.2 gyr. however, without a very massive seed black hole,eddington-limited growth means that a black hole mass of 10^9 solar masses, andhence very luminous agn activity, cannot be produced until &gt; 0.5 gyr after theformation of the first massive stars in the halo. the model thus predicts atime-lag between the peak of sub-mm luminosity and agn luminosity in a massiveproto-elliptical of a few times 10^8 years. for a formation redshift z = 5,this means that powerful agn activity is delayed until z = 3.5, by which timestar formation in the host is 90% complete, and sub-mm luminosity has declinedto ~ 25% of its peak value. this provides a natural explanation for whysuccessful sub-mm detections of luminous radio galaxies are largely confined toz &gt; 2.5. conversely the model also predicts that while all high-redshiftluminous sub-mm-selected sources should contain an active (and growing) blackhole, the typical luminosity of the agn in such objects is ~1000 times smallerthan that of the most powerful agn. this is consistent with the almost completefailure to detect sub-mm selected galaxies with existing x-ray surveys. finallythe model yields a black-hole:spheroid mass ratio which evolves rapidly in thefirst gyr, but asymptotes to ~ 0.001-0.003 in agreement with results at lowredshift. this ratio arises not because the agn terminates star formation, butbecause fueling of the massive black hole is linked to the total mass of gasavailable for star formation in the host.

astro-ph;0108397	quasars, their host galaxies, and their central black holes	we present the final results from our deep hst imaging study of the hosts ofradio-quiet quasars (rqqs), radio-loud quasars (rlqs) and radio galaxies (rgs).we describe new wfpc2 r-band observations for 14 objects and model these imagesin conjunction with the data already reported in mclure et al (1999). we findthat spheroidal hosts become more prevalent with increasing nuclear luminositysuch that, for nuclear luminosities m_v &lt; -23.5, the hosts of both radio-loudand radio-quiet agn are virtually all massive ellipticals. moreover wedemonstrate that the basic properties of these hosts are indistinguishable fromthose of quiescent, evolved, low-redshift ellipticals of comparable mass. thisresult kills any lingering notion that radio-loudness is determined byhost-galaxy morphology, and also sets severe constraints on evolutionaryschemes which attempt to link low-z ulirgs with rqqs. instead, we show that ourresults are as expected given the relationship between black-hole and spheroidmass established for nearby galaxies, and apply this relation to estimate themass of the black hole in each object. the results agree very well withcompletely-independent estimates based on nuclear emission-line widths; all thequasars in our sample have m(bh) &gt; 5 x 10^8 solar masses, while the radio-loudobjects are confined to m(bh) &gt; 10^9 solar masses. this apparent mass-thresholddifference, which provides a natural explanation for why rqqs outnumber rlqs bya factor of 10, appears to reflect the existence of a minimum and maximum levelof black-hole radio output which is a strong function of black-hole mass.finally, we use our results to estimate the fraction of massivespheroids/black-holes which produce quasar-level activity. this fraction is\~0.1% at the present day, rising to &gt; 10% at z = 2-3.

astro-ph;0108417	on the black hole - bulge mass relation in active and inactive galaxies	new black-hole mass estimates are presented for a sample of 72 agn coveringthree decades in optical luminosity. using a sub-sample of seyfert galaxies,which have black-hole mass estimates from both reverberation mapping andstellar velocity dispersions, we investigate the geometry of the agn broad-lineregion (blr). it is demonstrated that a model in which the orbits of theline-emitting material have a flattened geometry is favoured over randomlyorientated orbits. using this model we investigate the m_{bh}-l_{bulge}relation for a combined 90-object sample, consisting of the agn plus a sampleof 18 nearby inactive elliptical galaxies with dynamical black-hole massmeasurements. it is found that, for all reasonable mass-to-light ratios, them_{bh}-l_{bulge} relation is equivalent to a linear scaling between bulge andblack-hole mass. the best-fitting normalization of the m_{bh}-m_{bulge}relation is found to be m_{bh}=0.0012m_{bulge}, in agreement with recentblack-hole mass studies based on stellar velocity dispersions. furthermore, thescatter around the m_{bh}-l_{bulge} relation for the full sample is found to besignificantly smaller than has been previously reported (delta \log m_{bh}=0.39dex). finally, using the nearby inactive elliptical galaxy sample alone, it isshown that the scatter in the m_{bh}-l_{bulge} relation is only 0.33 dex,comparable to that of the m_{bh}-sigma relation. these results indicate thatreliable black-hole mass estimates can be obtained for high redshift galaxies.

astro-ph;0204473	measuring the black hole masses of high redshift quasars	a new technique is presented for determining the black-hole masses ofhigh-redshift quasars from optical spectroscopy. the new method utilizes thefull-width half maximum (fwhm) of the low-ionization mgii emission line and thecorrelation between broad-line region (blr) radius and continuum luminosity at3000 angstroms. using archival uv spectra it is found that the correlationbetween blr radius and 3000 angstrom luminosity is tighter than the establishedcorrelation with 5100 angstrom luminosity. furthermore, it is found that thecorrelation between blr radius and 3000 ang luminosity is consistent with arelation of the form $r_{blr} \propto lambda l_{lambda}^{0.5}$, as expected fora constant ionization parameter. using a sample of objects with broad-lineradii determined from reverberation mapping it is shown that the fwhm of mgiiand h beta are consistent with following an exact one-to-one relation, asexpected if both h beta and mgii are emitted at the same radius from thecentral ionizing source. the resulting virial black-hole mass estimator basedon rest-frame uv observables is shown to reproduce black-hole mass measurementsbased on reverberation mapping to within a factor of 2.5 (1 sigma). finally,the new uv black-hole mass estimator is shown to produce identical results tothe established optical (h beta) estimator when applied to 128intermediate-redshift (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9) quasars drawn from the large bright quasarsurvey and the radio-selected molonglo quasar sample. we therefore concludethat the new uv virial black-hole mass estimator can be reliably used toestimate the black-hole masses of quasars from z~0.25 through to the peak epochof quasar activity at z~2.5 via optical spectroscopy alone.

astro-ph;0205480	discovery of the host galaxy of hdf850.1, the brightest sub-mm source in  the hubble deep field	despite extensive observational efforts, the brightest sub--mm source in thehubble deep field, hdf850.1, has failed to yield a convincing optical/infraredidentification almost 4 years after its discovery. this failure is all the morenotable given the availability of supporting multi-frequency data ofunparalleled depth, and sub-arcsec positional accuracy for the sub-mm/mmsource. consequently, hdf850.1 has become a test case of the possibility thatthe most violently star-forming objects in the universe are too red and/ordistant to be seen in the deepest optical images. here we report the discoveryof the host galaxy of hdf850.1. this object has been revealed by carefulanalysis of a new, deep k-prime image of the hdf obtained with the subaru 8.2-mtelescope. its reality is confirmed by a similar analysis of the hst nicmosf160w image of the same region. this object is extremely faint (k=23.5), clumpy(on sub-arcsec scales) and very red (i-k &gt; 5.2; h-k = 1.4 +- 0.35). thelikelihood that it is the correct identification is strongly reinforced by areanalysis of the combined merlin+vla 1.4-ghz map of the field which yields anew radio detection of hdf850.1 only 0.1 arcsec from the new near-ircounterpart, and with sufficient positional accuracy to exclude all previouslyconsidered alternative optical candidates. we have calculated new confidencelimits on the estimated redshift of hdf850.1 and find z = 4.1 +- 0.5. we alsocalculate that the flux density of hdf850.1 has been boosted by a factor of ~3through lensing by the intervening elliptical 3-586.0, consistent withpredictions that a small but significant fraction of blank-field sub-mm sourcesare lensed by foreground galaxies. we discuss the wider implications of theseresults for the sub-mm population and cosmic star-formation history.

astro-ph;0207663	old elliptical galaxies at z=1.5 and the kormendy relation	deep spectroscopy of the two mjy radio galaxies lbds 53w069 and 53w091 haspreviously shown them to have old (&gt;3 gyr) stellar populations at z=1.5. herewe present the results of hst observations of these galaxies. 53w069 has anr^1/4 profile in both the f814w &amp; f110w data with an effective radius of 0.30arcsec (2.7 kpc). the restframe u-b colour gradient requires a stellarpopulation of super-solar (3z_sun) metallicity that formed on a very shorttimescale at high redshift (z&gt;5). 53w091 has a regular r^1/4 profile in f110wwith an effective radius of 0.32 arcsec (2.9 kpc). the f814w profile is moreextended and is consistent with a blue exponential disk that contributes 20% ofthe flux within r_e. the restframe u-b colour gradient is significantly largerthan that observed in field ellipticals at z&lt;1, implying a stellar populationof mixed metallicity (1-3z_sun) that formed in a high-redshift rapid burst.  we have compared these two lbds radio galaxies with the kormendy relation often 3cr radio galaxies at z=0.8. the lbds galaxies follow the same relation asthe more radio-luminous 3cr galaxies, assuming passive evolution of theirstellar populations, although they are smaller than the 3cr galaxies whose meaneffective radius is 12 kpc. their sizes and radio luminosities are consistentwith scaling relations applied to the 3cr galaxies, in which both radio powerand effective radius scale with galaxy mass. compared with a sample of z=0.4cluster ellipticals, 53w069 &amp; 53w091 lie well within the scatter of thekormendy relation. we conclude that the hosts of these mjy radio sources atz=1.5 are passively-evolving elliptical galaxies that will evolve into ordinaryl* ellipticals by the present day.

astro-ph;0308436	the host galaxies of luminous quasars	we present results of a deep hst/wfpc2 imaging study of 17 quasars at z~0.4,designed to determine the properties of their host galaxies. the sampleconsists of quasars with absolute magnitudes in the range -24&gt;m_v&gt;-28, allowingus to investigate host galaxy properties across a decade in quasar luminosity,but at a single redshift. we find that the hosts of all the rlqs, and all therqqs with nuclear luminosities m_v&lt;-24, are massive bulge-dominated galaxies,confirming and extending the trends deduced from our previous studies. from thebest-fitting model host galaxies we have estimated spheroid and black-holemasses, and the efficiency (with respect to eddington luminosity) with whicheach quasar is radiating. the largest inferred black-hole mass in our sample is\~3.10^9 m_sun, comparable to those at the centres of m87 and cygnus a. we findno evidence for super-eddington accretion in even the most luminous objects. weinvestigate the role of scatter in the black-hole:spheroid mass relation indetermining the ratio of quasar to host-galaxy luminosity, by generatingsimulated populations of quasars lying in hosts with a schechter mass function.within the subsample of the highest luminosity quasars, the observed variationin nuclear-host luminosity ratio is consistent with being the result of thescatter in the black-hole:spheroid relation. quasars with high nuclear-hostratios can be explained by sub-eddington accretion onto black holes in thehigh-mass tail of the black-hole:spheroid relation. our results imply that,owing to the schechter cutoff, host mass should not continue to increaselinearly with quasar luminosity, at the very highest luminosities. any quasarsmore luminous than m_v=-27 should be found in massive elliptical hosts which atthe present day would have m_v ~ -24.5.

astro-ph;0511571	further constraints on the evolution of ks-selected galaxies in the  goods/cdfs field	we have selected and analysed the properties of a sample of 2905 ks&lt;21.5galaxies in ~ 131 sq.arcmin of the great observatories origins deep survey(goods) chandra deep field south (cdfs), to obtain further constraints on theevolution of ks-selected galaxies with respect to the results already obtainedin previous studies. we made use of the public deep multiwavelength imagingfrom the optical b through the infrared (ir) 4.5 micron bands, in conjunctionwith available spectroscopic and combo17 data in the cdfs, to construct anoptimised redshift catalogue for our galaxy sample. we computed the ks-band lfand determined that its characteristic magnitude has a substantial brighteningand a decreasing total density from z=0 to &lt;z&gt;=2.5. we also analysed thecolours and number density evolution of galaxies with different stellar masses.within our sample, and in contrast to what is observed for less massivesystems, the vast majority (~ 85-90%) of the most massive (m&gt;2.5x10^11 msun)local galaxies appear to be in place before redshift z ~1. around 65-70% of thetotal assemble between redshifts z=1 and z=3 and most of them display extremelyred colours, suggesting that plausible star formation in these very massivesystems should mainly proceed in obscured, short-timescale bursts. theremaining fraction (up to ~ 20%) could be in place at even higher redshiftsz=3-4, pushing the first epoch of formation of massive galaxies beyond thelimits of current near-ir surveys.

astro-ph;0604232	the role of the lirg and ulirg phases in the evolution of ks-selected  galaxies	we investigate the role of the luminous infrared galaxy (lirg) andultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) phases in the evolution of ks-selectedgalaxies and, in particular, extremely red galaxies (ergs). with this aim, wecompare the properties of a sample of 2905 ks&lt;21.5 (vega mag) galaxies in thegoods/cdfs with the sub-sample of those 696 sources which are detected at 24microns. we find that lirgs constitute 30% of the galaxies with stellar massm&gt;1x10^{11} msun assembled at redshift z=0.5. a minimum of 65% of the galaxieswith m&gt;2.5x10^{11} msun at z~2-3 are ulirgs at those redshifts. 60% of theulirgs in our sample have the characteristic colours of ergs. conversely, 40%of the ergs with stellar mass m&gt;1.3x10^{11} msun at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 and a minimum of52% of those with the same mass cut at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.0 are ulirgs. the averageoptical/near-ir properties of the massive ergs at similar redshifts that areidentified with ulirgs and that are not have basically no difference,suggesting that both populations contain the same kind of objects in differentphases of their lives.  lirgs and ulirgs have an important role in galaxy evolution and massassembly, and, although they are only able to trace a fraction of the massive(m&gt;1x10^{11} msun) galaxies present in the universe at a given time, thisfraction becomes very significant (&gt;50%) at redshifts z&gt;~2.

astro-ph;0606116	the discovery of a significant sample of massive galaxies at redshifts 5  &lt; z &lt; 6 in the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we have exploited the large area coverage of the combined ukidss ultra deepsurvey (uds) and subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) to search for brightlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z &gt;= 5. using the availableoptical+near-infrared photometry to efficiently exclude low-redshiftcontaminants, we identify nine z &gt;= 5 lbg candidates brighter than z'=25(ab)within the 0.6 square degree overlap region between the uds early data release(edr) and the optical coverage of the sxds. accounting for selectionincompleteness, we estimate the corresponding surface density of z &gt;= 5 lbgswith z'&lt;=25(ab) to be 0.005+/-0.002 per square arcmin. modelling of theoptical+near-infrared photometry constrains the candidates' redshifts to lie inthe range 5.1 &lt; z &lt; 5.9, and provides estimates for their stellar masses.although the stellar mass estimates are individually uncertain, a stackinganalysis suggests that the typical stellar mass of the lbg candidates is&gt;~5x10^10 msun which, if confirmed, places them amongst the most massivegalaxies currently known at z &gt;= 5. it is found that lambda cdm structureformation can produce sufficient numbers of dark matter halos at z &gt;= 5 toaccommodate our estimated number density of massive lbgs for plausible valuesof sigma_8 and the ratio of stellar to dark matter. moreover, it is found thatrecent galaxy formation models can also account for the existence of suchmassive galaxies at z &gt;= 5. finally, no evidence is found for the existence oflbgs with stellar masses in excess of ~3x10^11 msun at this epoch, despite thelarge co-moving volume surveyed.

astro-ph;0606192	a systematic search for very massive galaxies at z &gt; 4	motivated by the claimed discovery of a very massive galaxy (hudf-jd2;m~5x10^11 msun) at extreme redshift (z = 6.5) within the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf) (mobasher et al. 2005), we have completed a systematic search forcomparably massive galaxies with z &gt; 4 among the 2688 galaxies in our k &lt; 23.5(ab) catalogue within the cdfs/goods-south field. this search was conductedusing redshift estimates based on the recently-completed, uniquely-deep 11-bandimaging in this 125 square arcmin field, ~25 times larger than the nicmos hudf.initial spectral fitting, based on published catalogue sextractor photometry,led us to conclude that at least 2669 of the galaxies in our sample lie at z &lt;4. we carried out a detailed investigation of the 19 remaining z &gt; 4candidates, performing aperture photometry on all images, and includingmarginal detections and formal non-detections in the fitting process. this ledto the rejection of a further 13 galaxies to lower redshift. moreover,subjecting hudf-jd2 to the same analysis, we find that it lies at z ~ 2.2,rather than the extreme redshift favoured by mobasher et al. (2005). the 6remaining candidates appear to be credible examples of galaxies in the redshiftrange z = 4 - 6, with plausible stellar ages. however, refitting with allowancefor extreme values of extinction we find that, even for these objects,statistically acceptable solutions can be found at z &lt; 3. moreover, therecently-released spitzer mips imaging in goods-south has revealed that 5 ofour 6 final z &gt; 4 candidates are detected at 24 microns. we conclude that thereis no convincing evidence for any galaxy with m &gt; 3 x 10^11 msun, and z &gt; 4within the goods-south field (abridged).

astro-ph;0608624	galaxy clusters at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.4 in the ukidss ultra deep survey early  data release	we present the first cluster catalogue extracted from the ukirt infrared deepsky survey early data release. the catalogue is created using ukidss ultra deepsurvey infrared j and k data combined with 3.6 micro-m and 4.5 micro-m spitzerbands and optical bvri'z' imaging from the subaru telescope over 0.5 squaredegrees in the subaru xmm-newton deep field. we have created a newcluster-detection algorithm, based on the friends-of-friends and voronoitessellation methods, which utilises probability distribution functions derivedfrom a photometric redshift analysis. we employ mock catalogues to understandthe selection effects and contamination associated with the algorithm. thecluster catalogue contains 13 clusters at redshifts 0.61 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.39 withluminosities 10 l* &lt;~ l_tot &lt;~ 50 l*, corresponding to masses 5 x 10^13 m_sun&lt;~ m_cluster &lt;~ 3 x 10^14 m_sun for (m/m_sun) / (l/l_sun) = 75h. the measuredsky surface density of ~ 10 deg^-2 for high-redshift (z=0.5-1.5), massive(&gt;10^14 m_sun) clusters is precisely in line with theoretical predictionspresented by kneissl et al.

astro-ph;0609287	the evolution of the near-ir galaxy luminosity function and colour  bimodality up to z ~ 2 from the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near-infraredgalaxy luminosity function, derived from the analysis of a new sample of\~22,000 k(ab) &lt; 22.5 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 square degrees fromthe early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds). our study hasexploited the multi-wavelength coverage of the uds field provided by the newukidss wfcam k and j-band imaging, the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey and thespitzer-swire survey. the unique combination of large area and depth providedby this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and hasallowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sourcesout to z~2 with good statistical accuracy.  in agreement with previous studies we find that the characteristic luminosityof the near-infrared luminosity function brightens by 1 magnitude between z=0and z~2, while the total density decreases by a factor ~2. using the rest-frame(u-b) colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies, we confirm theclassic luminosity-dependent colour bimodality at z&lt;1. however, the strength ofthe colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, andseems to disappear by z&gt;1.5. due to the large size of our sample we are able toinvestigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxypopulations. it is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies(m_k &lt; -23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sourcesdominate the bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&lt;1. incontrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease inspace density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominatethe bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&gt;1.

astro-ph;0610191	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey first data release	the first data release (dr1) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss)took place on 2006 july 21. ukidss is a set of five large near-infraredsurveys, covering a complementary range of areas, depths, and galacticlatitudes. dr1 is the first large release of survey-quality data from ukidssand includes 320 sq degs of multicolour data to (vega) k=18, complete(depending on the survey) in three to five bands from the set zyjhk, togetherwith 4 sq degs of deep jk data to an average depth k=21. in addition therelease includes a similar quantity of data with incomplete filter coverage. injhk, in regions of low extinction, the photometric uniformity of thecalibration is better than 0.02 mag. in each band. the accuracy of thecalibration in zy remains to be quantified, and the same is true of jhk inregions of high extinction. the median image fwhm across the dataset is 0.82arcsec. we describe changes since the early data release in the implementation,pipeline and calibration, quality control, and archive procedures. we providemaps of the areas surveyed, and summarise the contents of each of the fivesurveys in terms of filters, areas, and depths. dr1 marks completion of 7 percent of the ukidss 7-year goals.

0809.2677	the clustering and abundance of star-forming and passive galaxies at $z  \sim 2$	we use the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), currently the deepest panoramicnear infra-red survey, together with deep subaru optical imaging to measure theclustering, number counts and luminosity function of galaxies at $z\sim 2$selected using the bzk selection technique. we find that both star-forming(sbzk) and passive (pbzk) galaxies, to a magnitude limit of $k_{ab} &lt; 23$, arestrongly clustered. the passive galaxies are the most strongly clusteredpopulation, with scale lengths of $r_0 = 15.0^{+1.9}_{-2.2}$h$^{-1}$mpccompared with $r_0 = 6.75^{+0.34}_{-0.37}$h$^{-1}$mpc for star-forminggalaxies. the direct implication is that passive galaxies inhabit the mostmassive dark-matter halos, and are thus identified as the progenitors of themost massive galaxies at the present day. in addition, the pbzks exhibit asharp flattening and potential turn-over in their number counts, in agreementwith other recent studies. this plateau cannot be explained by the effects ofincompleteness. we conclude that only very massive galaxies are undergoingpassive evolution at this early epoch, consistent with the downsizing scenariofor galaxy evolution. assuming a purely passive evolution for the pbzks fromtheir median redshift to the present day, their luminosity function suggeststhat only $\sim 2.5 %$ of present day massive ellipticals had a pbzk as a mainprogenitor.

astro-ph;9809030	a comparative hst imaging study of the host galaxies of radio-quiet  quasars, radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies: paper i	we present the first results from a major hst wfpc2 imaging study aimed atproviding the first statistically meaningful comparison of the morphologies,luminosities, scalelengths and colours of the host galaxies of radio-quietquasars, radio-loud quasars, and radio galaxies. we describe the design of thisstudy and present the images which have been obtained for the first half of our33-source sample. we find that the hosts of all three classes of luminous agnare massive elliptical galaxies, with scalelengths ~=10 kpc, and r-k coloursconsistent with mature stellar populations. most importantly this is the thefirst unambiguous evidence that, just like radio-loud quasars, essentially allradio-quiet quasars brighter than m_r = -24 reside in massive ellipticals. thisresult removes the possibility that radio `loudness' is directly linked to hostgalaxy morphology, but is however in excellent accord with theblack-hole/spheroid mass correlation recently highlighted by magorrian et al.(1998). we apply the relations given by magorrian et al. to infer the expectededdington luminosity of the putative black hole at the centre of each of thespheroidal host galaxies we have uncovered. comparison with the actual nuclearr-band luminosities suggests that the black holes in most of these galaxies areradiating at a few percent of the eddington luminosity; the brightest hostgalaxies in our low-z sample are capable of hosting quasars with m_r = -28,comparable to the most luminous quasars at z = 3. finally we discuss ourhost-derived black-hole masses in the context of theradio-luminosity:black-hole mass correlation recently uncovered for nearbygalaxies by franceschini et al. (1998), and the resulting implications for thephysical origin of radio loudness.

astro-ph;9908214	the evolution of 3cr radio galaxies from z=1	we present the results of a comprehensive re-analysis of the images of avirtually complete sample of 28 powerful 3cr radio galaxies with redshifts0.6&lt;z&lt;1.8 from the hst archive. using a two-dimensional modelling technique wehave derived scalelengths and absolute magnitudes for a total of 16 3crgalaxies with a median redshift of z=0.8. our results confirm the basicconclusions of best, longair &amp; r\"{o}ttgering (1997, 1998) in that we also findz=1 3cr galaxies to be massive, well-evolved ellipticals, whose infraredemission is dominated by starlight. however, we in fact find that thescalelength distribution of 3cr galaxies at z \simeq 1 is completelyindistinguishable from that derived for their low-redshift counterparts fromour own recently-completed hst study of agn hosts at z \simeq 0.2. there isthus no evidence that 3cr radio galaxies at z \simeq 1 are dynamicallydifferent from 3cr galaxies at low redshift. moreover, for a 10-objectsub-sample we have determined the galaxy parameters with sufficient accuracy todemonstrate, for the first time, that the z \simeq 1 3cr galaxies follow akormendy relation which is indistinguishable from that displayed bylow-redshift ellipticals if one allows for purely passive evolution. theimplied rather modest level of passive evolution since z \simeq 1 is consistentwith that predicted from spectrophotometric models provided one assumes a highformation redshift (z \ge 4) within a low-density universe. we conclude thatthere is no convincing evidence for significant dynamical evolution among 3crgalaxies in the redshift interval 0&lt;z&lt;1, and that simple passive evolutionremains an acceptable interpretation of the k-z relation for powerful radiogalaxies.

astro-ph;9912044	two-dimensional modelling of optical hst and infrared tip-tilt images of  quasar host galaxies	a description is given of the method used to extract quasar host-galaxyparameters from the deep hubble space telescope quasar images presented bymclure et al.
