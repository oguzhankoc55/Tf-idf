hep-th;0509059	standard-like model building on type ii orientifolds	we construct new standard-like models on type ii orientifolds. in type iiatheory on $\mathbf{t^6/(\z_2\times \z_2)}$ orientifold with intersectingd6-branes, we first construct a three-family trinification model where the$u(3)_c\times u(3)_l\times u(3)_r$ gauge symmetry can be broken down to the$su(3)_c\times su(2)_l\times u(1)_{y_l}\times u(1)_{i_{3r}}\times u(1)_{y_r}$gauge symmetry by the green-schwarz mechanism and d6-brane splittings, andfurther down to the sm gauge symmetry at the tev scale by higgs mechanism. wealso construct a pati-salam model where we may explain three-family sm fermionmasses and mixings. furthermore, we construct for the first time a pati-salamlike model with $u(4)_c \times u(2)_l \times u(1)' \times u(1)''$ gaugesymmetry where the $u(1)_{i_{3r}}$ comes from a linear combination of u(1)gauge symmetries. in type iib theory on $\mathbf{t^6/(\z_2\times \z_2)}$orientifold with flux compactifications, we construct a new flux model with$u(4)_c \times u(2)_l \times u(2)_r$ gauge symmetry where the magnetizedd9-branes with large negative d3-brane charges are introduced in the hiddensector. however, we can not construct the trinification model with supergravityfluxes because the three su(3) groups already contribute very large rr charges.the phenomenological consequences of these models are briefly discussed aswell.

hep-th;0601064	type iia pati-salam flux vacua	we show that for supersymmetric ads vacua on type iia orientifolds with fluxcompactifications, the rr tadpole cancellation conditions can be completelyrelaxed, and then the four-dimensional n=1 supersymmetry conditions are themain constraints on consistent intersecting d6-brane model building. weconstruct two kinds of three-family pati-salam models. in the first kind ofmodels, the suitable three-family sm fermion masses and mixings can begenerated at the stringy tree level, and then the rank one problem for the smfermion yukawa matrices can be solved. in the second kind of models, only thethird family of the sm fermions can obtain masses at tree level. in thesemodels, the complex structure parameters can be determined by supersymmetricd6-brane configurations, and all the moduli may be stabilized. the initialgauge symmetries u(4)_c \times u(2)_l \times u(2)_r and u(4)_c \times usp(2)_l\times u(2)_r can be broken down to the su(3)_c \times su(2)_l \timesu(1)_{b-l} \times u(1)_{i_{3r}} due to the green-schwarz mechanism and d6-branesplittings, and further down to the sm gauge symmetry around the string scalevia the supersymmetry preserving higgs mechanism. comparing to the previousmodel building, we have less bidoublet higgs fields. however, there genericallyexist some exotic particles.

hep-th;0604107	flipped and unflipped su(5) as type iia flux vacua	on type iia orientifolds with flux compactifications in supersymmetric adsvacua, we for the first time construct su(5) models with three anti-symmetric{\bf 10} representations and without symmetric {\bf 15} representations. weshow that all the pairs of the anti-fundamental {\bf \bar 5} and fundamental{\bf 5} representations can obtain gut/string-scale vector-like masses afterthe additional gauge symmetry breaking via supersymmetry preserving higgsmechanism. then we have exact three {\bf \bar 5}, and no other chiral exoticparticles that are charged under su(5) due to the non-abelian anomaly freecondition. moreover, we can break the su(5) gauge symmetry down to the sm gaugesymmetry via d6-brane splitting, and solve the doublet-triplet splittingproblem. assuming that the extra one (or several) pair(s) of higgs doublets andadjoint particles obtain gut/string-scale masses via high-dimensionaloperators, we only have the mssm in the observable sector below the gut scale.then the observed low energy gauge couplings can be generated via rge runningif we choose the suitable grand unified gauge coupling by adjusting the stringscale. furthermore, we construct the first flipped su(5) model with exact three{\bf 10}, and the first flipped su(5) model in which all the yukawa couplingsare allowed by the global u(1) symmetries.

0903.1303	time delays of strings in d-particle backgrounds and vacuum refractive  indices	using standard techniques in string/d-brane scattering amplitudecomputations, we evaluate the scattering of open strings off d-particles inbrane world scenarios. the d-particles are viewed as d3 branes wrapped uparound three cycles, and their embedding in brane worlds constitutes a case ofintersecting branes, among which strings are stretched, representing varioustypes of excitations of the standard model (sm) particles in the low-energylimit. our analysis, reveals interesting and novel selection rules for theresulting causal time delays, proportional to the energy of the incident matterstate, from the processes of splitting, capture and re-emission of the latterby the d-particles. in particular, we show that there are relatively large timedelays only for excitations that belong to the cartan subalgebra of the smgauge group, which notably includes photons. we discuss the possible relevanceof these results to the models of space time foam predicting a non-trivialvacuum refractive index for photons and the associated cosmic \gamma-rayphenomenology. in particular, we demonstrate how low-string-scale models can befalsified already in this context, by current astrophysical observations ofcosmic photons, and how such observations serve as a way to discriminate low-from high-string scale models.

physics;0505080	towards experimental tests of quantum effects in cytoskeletal proteins	it has become increasingly evident that fabrication of novel biomaterialsthrough molecular self-assembly is going to play a significant role in materialscience and possibly the information technology of the future. tubulin,microtubules (mts) and the cytoskeleton are dynamic, self-assembling systemsand we asked whether their structure and function contain the clues on how tofabricate biomolecular information processing devices.  here we review our neurobiological studies of transgenic drosophila thatstrongly suggest the microtubular cytoskeleton is near the 'front lines' ofintracellular information manipulation and storage. we also establish thatspectroscopic techniques such as refractometry, surface plasmon resonancesensing and dielectric spectroscopy, coupled with molecular dynamic simulationsand (quantum) electrodynamic analytical theory are useful tools in the study ofthe electrodynamic and possible quantum effects in cytoskeletal proteins.  implicit in our driving question is the possibility that if tubulin and mtscan indeed be cast as the basis of a classical or quantum computer, thenperhaps nature has already done so and tubulin and mts already play such a rolein living neural and other cells. if quantum mechanics is found to be importantin cellular function (through its involvement in proteins) it is natural to askwhether there are indeed quantum effects pertinent to consciousness. weconclude this work by suggesting a number of ways towards experimentallytesting this "quantum consciousness idea" (qci), directly at the protein level.

0905.3394	flipped su(5) x u(1)_x models from f-theory	we systematically construct flipped su(5) x u(1)_x models without and withbulk vector-like particles from f-theory. to realize the decoupling scenario,we introduce sets of vector-like particles in complete su(5) x u(1) multipletsat the tev scale, or at the intermediate scale, or at the tev scale and highscale. to avoid the landau pole problem for the gauge couplings, we can onlyintroduce five sets of vector-like particles around the tev scale. thesevector-like particles can couple to the standard model singlet fields, andobtain suitable masses by higgs mechanism. we study gauge coupling unificationin detail. we show that the u(1)_x flux contributions to the gauge couplingspreserve the su(5) x u(1)_x gauge coupling unification. we calculate thesu(3)_c x su(2)_l unification scales, and the su(5) x u(1)_x unification scalesand unified couplings. in most of our models, the high-scale or bulkvector-like particles can be considered as string-scale threshold correctionssince their masses are close to the string scale. futhermore, we discuss thephenomenological consequences of our models. in particular, in the models withtev-scale vector-like particles, the vector-like particles can be observed atthe large hadron collider, the proton decay is within the reach of the futurehyper-kamiokande experiment, the lightest cp-even higgs boson mass can beincreased, the hybrid inflation can be naturally realized, and the correctcosmic primodial density fluctuations can be generated.

1002.4183	generalizing minimal supergravity	in grand unified theories (guts), the standard model (sm) gauge couplingsneed not be unified at the gut scale due to the high-dimensional operators.considering gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking, we study for the firsttime the generic gauge coupling relations at the gut scale, and the generalgaugino mass relations which are valid from the gut scale to the electroweakscale at one loop. we define the index k for these relations, which can becalculated in guts and can be determined at the large hadron collider and thefuture international linear collider. thus, we give a concrete definition ofthe gut scale in these theories, and suggest a new way to test general guts atfuture experiments. we also discuss five special scenarios with interestingpossibilities. with our generic formulae, we present all the gut-scale gaugecoupling relations and all the gaugino mass relations in the su(5) and so(10)models, and calculate the corresponding indices k. especially, the index k is5/3 in the traditional su(5) and so(10) models that have been studiedextensively so far. furthermore, we discuss the field theory realization of theu(1) flux effects on the sm gauge kinetic functions in f-theory guts, andcalculate their indices k as well.

1003.2570	elements of f-ast proton decay	gauge coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm) strongly suggests the existence of a grand unified theory (gut), whichcould be probed by the observation of proton decay. proton lifetime in the p\to (e+|mu+) pi0 dimension six mode is proportional in the fourth power to thegut mass scale, and inversely proportional in the fourth power to the gutcoupling. we provide an updated dictionary of solutions for the relevantunification parameters with generic beta-function coefficients, significantlyupgrading the level of detail with which second order effects are treated, andcorrecting subtle published errors. f-lipped su(5) with strict mssm fieldcontent is known to survive existing null detection limits for proton decayapproaching 10^34 years, and indeed, the lifetime predicted by prior studiescan be so long that successful detection is not currently plausible. recentlystudied classes of f-theory derived gut models postulate additional vector-likemultiplets at the tev scale which modify the renormalization group to yield asubstantial increase in the su(3)_c x su(2)_l unified coupling. we find theconjunction of these models with the f-resh analysis employed to becomparatively f-ast proton decay, only narrowly evading existing detectionlimits, and likely falling within the observable range of proposed nextgeneration detectors such as dusel and hyper-kamiokande. the tev-scale vectormultiplets are themselves suitable for cross correlation by the large hadroncollider. their presence moreover magnifies the gap between the dual massscales of flipped su(5), allowing for an elongated second stagerenormalization, pushing grand unification to the doorstep of the reducedplanck mass.

1003.4186	dark matter, proton decay and other phenomenological constraints in  ${\cal f}$-su(5)	we study gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking in ${\cal f}$-su(5) and itslow-energy supersymmetric phenomenology. the gaugino masses are not unified atthe traditional grand unification scale, but we nonetheless have the sameone-loop gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale as minimal supergravity(msugra). we introduce parameters testable at the colliders to measure thesmall second loop deviation from the msugra gaugino mass relation at theelectroweak scale. in the minimal su(5) model with gravity mediatedsupersymmetry breaking, we show that the deviations from the msugra gauginomass relations are within 5%. however, in ${\cal f}$-su(5), we predict thedeviations from the msugra gaugino mass relations to be larger due to thepresence of vector-like particles, which can be tested at the colliders. wedetermine the viable parameter space that satisfies all the latest experimentalconstraints and find it is consistent with the cdms ii experiment. further, wecompute the cross-sections of neutralino annihilations into gamma-rays andcompare to the first published fermi-lat measurement. finally, thecorresponding range of proton lifetime predictions is calculated and found tobe within reach of the future hyper-kamiokande and dusel experiments.

1101.2197	blueprints of the no-scale multiverse at the lhc	we present a contemporary perspective on the string landscape and themultiverse of plausible string, m- and f-theory vacua. in contrast totraditional statistical classifications and capitulation to the anthropicprinciple, we seek only to demonstrate the existence of a non-zero probabilityfor a universe matching our own observed physics within the solution ensemble.we argue for the importance of no-scale supergravity as an essential commonunderpinning for the spontaneous emergence of a cosmologically flat universefrom the quantum "nothingness". concretely, we continue to probe thephenomenology of a specific model which is testable at the lhc and tevatron.dubbed no-scale f-su(5), it represents the intersection of the flipped su(5)grand unified theory (gut) with extra tev-scale vector-like multiplets derivedout of f-theory, and the dynamics of no-scale supergravity, which in turn implya very restricted set of high energy boundary conditions. by secondarilyminimizing the minimum of the scalar higgs potential, we dynamically determinethe ratio tan \beta \simeq 15-20 of up- to down-type higgs vacuum expectationvalues (vevs), the universal gaugino boundary mass m_{1/2} \simeq 450 gev, andconsequently also the total magnitude of the gut-scale higgs vevs, whileconstraining the low energy standard model gauge couplings. in particular, thislocal minimum minimorum lies within the previously described "golden strip",satisfying all current experimental constraints. we emphasize, however, thatthe overarching goal is not to establish why our own particular universepossesses any number of specific characteristics, but rather to tease out whatgeneric principles might govern the superset of all possible universes.

1103.4160	the ultra-high jet multiplicity signal of stringy no-scale f-su(5) at  the \sqrt{s} = 7 tev lhc	we present the distinctive collider signatures of no-scale f-su(5), a highlyefficient and phenomenologically favored model built on the tripodalfoundations of the f-lipped su(5) x u(1)_x grand unified theory, extra f-theoryderived tev scale vector-like particle multiplets, and the dynamic high scaleboundary conditions of no-scale supergravity. the identifying features of thesupersymmetric spectrum are a light stop and gluino, with both sparticles muchlighter than all the additional squarks. this unique mass hierarchy leads tothe enhanced production of events with an ultra-high multiplicity of hadronicjets which should be clearly visible to the \sqrt{s} = 7 tev lhc at only 1inverse fb of integrated luminosity. we suggest a modest alternative eventcutting procedure based around a reduced minimal transverse momentum per jet(p_t &gt; 20 gev), and an increased minimal multiplicity (&gt;= 9) of distinct jetsper subscribed event. these criteria optimize the f-su(5) signal to backgroundratio, while readily suppressing the contribution of all standard modelprocesses, allowing moreover a clear differentiation from competing models ofnew physics, most notably minimal supergravity. the characteristic no-scalesignature is quite stable across the viable parameter space, modulo an overallrescaling of the mass spectrum; detection by the lhc of the ultra-high jetsignal would constitute a suggestive evocation of the intimately linked stringyorigins of f-su(5), and could possibly provide a glimpse into the underlyingstructure of the fundamental string moduli.

1107.2375	a two-tiered correlation of dark matter with missing transverse energy:  reconstructing the lightest supersymmetric particle mass at the lhc	we suggest that non-trivial correlations between the dark matter particlemass and collider based probes of missing transverse energy h_t^miss mayfacilitate a two tiered approach to the initial discovery of supersymmetry andthe subsequent reconstruction of the lsp mass at the lhc. these correlationsare demonstrated via extensive monte carlo simulation of seventeen benchmarkmodels, each sampled at five distinct lhc center-of-mass beam energies,spanning the parameter space of no-scale f-su(5).this construction is definedin turn by the union of the flipped su(5) grand unified theory, two pairs ofhypothetical tev scale vector-like supersymmetric multiplets with origins inf-theory, and the dynamically established boundary conditions of no-scalesupergravity. in addition, we consider a control sample comprised of a standardminimal supergravity benchmark point. led by a striking similarity between theh_t^miss distribution and the familiar power spectrum of a black body radiatorat various temperatures, we implement a broad empirical fit of our simulationagainst a poisson distribution ansatz. we advance the resulting fit as atheoretical blueprint for deducing the mass of the lsp, utilizing only themissing transverse energy in a statistical sampling of &gt;= 9 jet events.cumulative uncertainties central to the method subsist at a satisfactory 12-15%level. the fact that supersymmetric particle spectrum of no-scale f-su(5) hasthrived the withering onslaught of early lhc data that is steadily decimatingthe constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model and minimal supergravityparameter spaces is a prime motivation for augmenting more conventional lspsearch methodologies with the presently proposed alternative.

1109.2110	natural predictions for the higgs boson mass and supersymmetric  contributions to rare processes	in the context of no-scale f-su(5), a model defined by the convergence of thef-lipped su(5) grand unified theory, two pairs of hypothetical tev scalevector-like supersymmetric multiplets with origins in f-theory, and thedynamically established boundary conditions of no-scale supergravity, wepredict that the lightest cp-even higgs boson mass lies within the range of119.0 gev to 123.5 gev, exclusive of the vector-like particle contribution tothe mass. with reports by the cms, atlas, cdf, and d0 collaborations detailingenticing statistical excesses in the vicinity of 120 gev in searches for thestandard model higgs boson, all signs point to an imminent discovery. whilebasic supersymmetric constructions such as msugra and the cmssm have alreadysuffered overwhelming reductions in viable parameterization during the lhc'sinitial year of operation, about 80% of the original no-scale f-su(5) modelspace remains viable after analysis of the first 1.1 fb^{-1} of integratedluminosity. this model is moreover capable of handily explaining the smallexcesses recently reported in the cms multijet supersymmetry search, and alsofeatures a highly favorable "golden" subspace which may simultaneously accountfor the key rare process limits on the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g - 2)and the branching ratio of the flavor-changing neutral current decay b tos\gamma. in addition, the isolated mass parameter responsible for the globalparticle mass normalization, the gaugino boundary mass m_{1/2}, is dynamicallydetermined at a secondary local minimization of the minimum of the higgspotential v_{min}, in a manner which is deeply consistent with all precisionmeasurements at the physical electroweak scale.

1109.2329	the lightest cp-even higgs boson mass in the testable flipped su(5) x  u(1)_x models from f-theory	we study the lightest cp-even higgs boson mass in five kinds of testableflipped su(5) x u(1)_x models from f-theory. two kinds of models havevector-like particles around the tev scale, while the other three kinds alsohave the vector-like particles at the intermediate scale that can be consideredas messenger fields in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking. we require thatthe yukawa couplings for the tev-scale vector-like particles and the thirdfamily of the standard model (sm) fermions are smaller than three from theelectroweak scale to the su(3)_c x su(2)_l unification scale. with the two-looprenormalization group equation running for the gauge couplings and yukawacouplings, we obtain the maximal yukawa couplings between the tev-scalevector-like particles and higgs fields. to calculate the lightest cp-even higgsboson mass upper bounds, we employ the renormalization group improved effectivehiggs potential approach, and consider the two-loop leading contributions inthe supersymmetric sm and one-loop contributions from the tev-scale vector-likeparticles. we assume maximal mixings between the stops and between thetev-scale vector-like scalars. the numerical results for these five kinds ofmodels are roughly the same. in particular, we show that the lightest cp-evenhiggs boson can have mass up to 146 gev naturally, which is the current upperbound from the cms and atlas collaborations.

1110.0451	background dependent lorentz violation from string theory	we revisit lorentz violation in the type iib string theory with d3-branes andd7-branes. we study the relativistic particle velocities in details, and showthat there exist both subluminal and superluminal particle propagations. inparticular, the additional contributions to the particle velosity \deltav\equiv (v-c)/c from string theory is proportional to both the particle energyand the d3-brane number density, and is inversely proportional to the stringscale. thus, we can realize the background dependent lorentz violationnaturally by varying the d3-brane number density in space time. to explain thesuperluminal neutrino propagations in the opera and minos experiments, thestring scale should be around 10^5 gev. with very tiny d3-brane number densityon the interstellar scale, we can also explain the time delays for the highenergy photons compared to the low energy photons in the magic, hess, and fermiexperiments simultaneously. interestingly, we can automatically satisfy all thestringent constraints from the synchrotron radiation of the crab nebula, thesn1987a observations on neutrinos, and the cosmic ray experiments on chargedleptons. we also address the possible phenomenological challenges to our modelsfrom the relevant experiments done on the earth.

1110.3451	background dependent lorentz violation: natural solutions to the  theoretical challenges of the opera experiment	to explain both the opera experiment and all the known phenomenologicalconstraints/observations on lorentz violation, the background dependent lorentzviolation (bdlv) has been proposed. we study the bdlv in a model independentway, and conjecture that there may exist a "dream special relativity theory",where all the standard model (sm) particles can be subluminal due to thebackground effects. assuming that the lorentz violation on the earth is muchlarger than those on the interstellar scale, we automatically escape all theastrophysical constraints on lorentz violation. for the bdlv from the effectivefield theory, we present a simple model and discuss the possible solutions tothe theoretical challenges of the opera experiment such as the bremsstrahlungeffects for muon neutrinos and the pion decays. also, we address the lorentzviolation constraints from the lep and kamlamd experiments. for the bdlv fromthe type iib string theory with d3-branes and d7-branes, we point out that thed3-branes are flavour blind, and all the sm particles are the conventionalparticles as in the traditional sm when they do not interact with thed3-branes. thus, we not only can naturally avoid all the known phenomenologicalconstraints on lorentz violation, but also can naturally explain all thetheoretical challenges. interestingly, the energy dependent photon velocitiesmay be tested at the experiments.

1111.0236	the f-landscape: dynamically determining the multiverse	we evolve our multiverse blueprints to characterize our local neighborhood ofthe string landscape and the multiverse of plausible string, m- and f-theoryvacua. building upon the tripodal foundations of i) the flipped su(5) grandunified theory (gut), ii) extra tev-scale vector-like multiplets derived out off-theory, and iii) the dynamics of no-scale supergravity, together dubbedno-scale f-su(5), we demonstrate the existence of a continuous family ofsolutions which might adeptly describe the dynamics of distinctive universes.this multiverse landscape of f-su(5) solutions, which we shall refer to as thef-landscape, accommodates a subset of universes compatible with the presentlyknown experimental uncertainties of our own universe. we show that bysecondarily minimizing the minimum of the scalar higgs potential of eachsolution within the f-landscape, a continuous hypervolume of distinct minimumminimorum can be engineered which comprise a regional dominion of universes,with our own universe cast as the bellwether. we conjecture that anexperimental signal at the lhc of the no-scale f-su(5) framework'sapplicability to our own universe might sensibly be extrapolated ascorroborating evidence for the role of string, m- and f-theory as a mastertheory of the multiverse, with no-scale supergravity as a crucial and pervasivereinforcing structure.

1111.4204	profumo di susy: suggestive correlations in the atlas and cms high jet  multiplicity data	we present persistently amassing evidence that the cms and atlascollaborations may indeed be already registering supersymmetry events at thelarge hadron collider (lhc). our analysis is performed in the context of ahighly phenomenologically favorable model named no-scale f-su(5), whichrepresents the unification of the f-lipped su(5) grand unified theory (gut),two pairs of hypothetical tev-scale vector-like supersymmetric multipletsderived out of f-theory, and the dynamically established boundary conditions ofno-scale supergravity. we document highly suggestive correlations between thefirst inverse femtobarn of observations by cms and atlas, where seductiveexcesses in multijet events, particularly those with nine or more jets, areunambiguously accounted for by a precision monte-carlo simulation of thef-su(5) model space. this intimate correspondence is optimized by a unifiedgaugino mass in the neighborhood of m_{1/2}=518 gev. we supplement thisanalysis by extrapolating for the expected data profile to be realized withfive inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity, as expected to be observed atthe lhc by the conclusion of 2011. significantly, we find that this luminositymay be sufficient to constitute a susy discovery for the favored benchmarkspectrum. indeed, the winds wafting our way from geneva may already be heavywith the delicate perfume of supersymmetry.

1111.4994	the superluminal neutrinos from deformed lorentz invariance	we study two superluminal neutrino scenarios where \delta v\equiv (v-c)/c isa constant. to be consistent with the opera, borexino, and icarus experimentsand with the sn1987a observations, we assume that \delta v_{\nu} on the earthis about three order larger than that on the interstellar scale. to explain thetheoretical challenges from the bremsstrahlung effects and pion decays, weconsider the deformed lorentz invariance, and show that the superluminalneutrino dispersion relations can be realized properly while the modificationsto the dispersion relations of the other standard model particles can benegligible. in addition, we propose the deformed energy and momentumconservation laws for a generic physical process. in scenario i the momentumconservation law is preserved while the energy conservation law is deformed. inscenario ii the energy conservation law is preserved while the momentumconservation law is deformed. we present the energy and momentum conservationlaws in terms of neutrino momentum in scenario i and in terms of neutrinoenergy in scenario ii. in such formats, the energy and momentum conservationlaws are exactly the same as those in the traditional quantum field theory withlorentz symmetry. thus, all the above theoretical challenges can beautomatically solved. we show explicitly that the bremsstrahlung processes areforbidden and there is no problem for pion decays.

1112.3024	a higgs mass shift to 125 gev and a multi-jet supersymmetry signal:  miracle of the flippons at the \sqrt{s} = 7 tev lhc	we describe a model named no-scale f-su(5) which is simultaneously capable ofexplaining the dual signals emerging at the lhc of i) a 124-126 gev higgs bosonmass m_h, and ii) tantalizing low-statistics excesses in the multi-jet datawhich may attributable to supersymmetry. these targets tend to be mutuallyexclusive in more conventional approaches. the unified mechanism responsiblefor both effects is the introduction of a rather unique set of vector-likemultiplets at the tev scale, dubbed flippons, which i) can elevate m_h byaround 3-4 gev via radiative loop corrections, and ii) flatten the running ofthe strong coupling and color-charged gaugino, resulting in a prominentcollider signal from production of light gluino pairs. this well motivatedtheoretical framework maintains consistency with all key phenomenologicalconstraints, and all residual parameterization freedom may in principle befixed by a combination of the two experiments described. we project that thealready collected luminosity of 5 fb^-1 may be sufficient to definitivelyestablish the status of this model, given appropriate data selection cuts.

1206.2633	correlating lhcb b_s^0 to \mu^+ \mu^- results with the atlas-cms  multijet supersymmetry search	we show that the no-scale flipped su(5) construction is transparentlyconsistent with recent lhcb results for b_s^0 to \mu^+ \mu^- decays, dueprimarily to suppression from the rather small value of tan\beta ~ 20 that isglobally enforced across the model space. this fact should be interpreted inconjunction with the demonstrated evasion of mass limits from the atlas and cmssusy searches and the more important potential explanation of small observedexcesses in the multijet data. the no-scale flipped su(5) benchmark model thatbest fits these excesses has a gaugino mass scale of m_{1/2} = 708 gev, whichdrives masses for the bino-dominated lsp m_\chi_1^0 = 143.4 gev, light stopm_t1 = 786 gev, gluino m_g = 952 gev, and heavy squark m_ul = 1490 gev. thecorresponding total prediction for the rare b-decay of br(b_s^0 to \mu^+ \mu^-)= 3.5 x 10^-9 suggests that the susy contribution may indeed be much smallerthan that expected from the standard model in this framework, fitting quitecomfortably within the very tightly constrained region remaining viable afterthe most recent lhcb measurements.

1310.3331	no-scale ripple inflation revisited	we revisit the no-scale ripple inflation model, where no-scale supergravityis modified by an additional term for the inflaton field in the kahlerpotential. this term not only breaks one su(n,1) symmetry explicitly, but alsoplays an important role for inflation. we generalize the superpotential in theno-scale ripple inflation model slightly. there exists a discrete z_2symmetry/parity in the scalar potential in general, which can be preserved orviolated by the non-canonical nomalized inflaton kinetic term. thus, there arethree inflation paths: one parity invariant path, and the left and right pathsfor parity violating scenario. we show that the inflations along the parityinvariant path and right path are consistent with the planck results. however,the gavitino mass for the parity invariant path is so large that the inflationresults will be invalid if we consider the inflaton supersymmetry breaking softmass term. thus, only the inflation along the right path gives the correct andconsistent results. notably, the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such case can belarge, with a value around 0.05, which may be probed by the future planckexperiment.

1405.0197	chaotic inflation in no-scale supergravity with string inspired moduli  stabilization	the simple chaotic inflation is highly consistent with the bicep2 experiment,and no-scale supergravity can be realized naturally in various stringcompactifications. thus, we construct a chaotic inflation model in no-scalesupergravity inspired from type iib string compactification with an anomalousu(1)_x gauged symmetry. we introduce two moduli t_1 and t_2 which transformnon-trivially under u(1)_x, and some pairs of fundamental quarks charged underthe su(n) x u(1)_x gauge group. the non-trivial transformations of moduli underu(1)_x lead to a moduli-dependent fayet-iliopoulos (fi) term. the modulus t_2and the real component of t_1 are stabilized by the non-perturbative effectfrom quark condensation and the u(1)_x d-term. in particular, the stabilizationfrom the anomalous u(1)_x d-term with moduli-dependent fi term is crucial forinflation since it gives heavy mass to the real component of the modulus t_1while keeping its axionic part light. choosing the proper parameters, we obtaina global minkowski vacuum where the imaginary part of t_1 has a quadraticpotential for chaotic inflation.

1412.5093	helical phase inflation and monodromy in supergravity theory	we study helical phase inflation in supergravity theory in details. theinflation is driven by the phase component of a complex field along helicaltrajectory. the helicoid structure originates from the monodromy ofsuperpotential with an singularity at origin.  we show that such monodromy can be formed by integrating out heavy fields insupersymmetric field theory. the supergravity corrections to the potentialprovide strong field stabilizations for the scalars except inflaton, thereforethe helical phase inflation accomplishes the "monodromy inflation" withinsupersymmetric field theory.  the phase monodromy can be easily generalized for natural inflation, in whichthe super-planckian phase decay constant is realized with consistent fieldstabilization. the phase-axion alignment is fulfilled indirectly in the processof integrating out the heavy fields.  besides, we show that the helical phase inflation can be naturally realizedin no-scale supergravity with $su(2,1)/su(2)\times u(1)$ symmetry since theno-scale k\"ahler potential provides symmetry factors of phase monodromydirectly. we also demonstrate that the helical phase inflation can reduce tothe shift symmetry realization of supergravity inflation. the super-planckianfield excursion is accomplished by the phase component, which admits nodangerous polynomial higher order corrections. the helical phase inflationprocess is free from the uv-sensitivity problem, and it suggests that inflationcan be effectively studied in supersymmetric field theory close to theunification scale in grand unified theory and a uv-completed frame is notprerequisite.

1502.05005	symmetry breaking indication for supergravity inflation in light of the  planck 2015	the supergravity (sugra) theories with exact global $u(1)$ symmetry or shiftsymmetry in k\"ahler potential provide the natural frameworks for inflation.however, the quadratic inflation is disfavoured by the new results onprimordial tensor fluctuations from the planck collaboration. to be consistentwith the new planck data, we point out that the explicit symmetry breaking isneeded, and study these two sugra inflation in details. for the sugra inflationwith global $u(1)$ symmetry, the symmetry breaking term leads to atrigonometric modulation on inflaton potential. the coefficient of the $u(1)$symmetry breaking term is of the order $10^{-2}$, which is sufficient large toimprove the inflationary predictions while its higher order corrections arenegligible. such models predict sizeable tensor fluctuations and highly agreewith the planck results. in particular, the model with a linear $u(1)$ symmetrybreaking term predicts the tensor-to-scalar ratio around $\textbf{r}\sim0.01$and running spectral index $\alpha_s\sim-0.004$, which comfortably fit with theplanck observations. for the sugra inflation with breaking shift symmetry, theinflaton potential is modulated by an exponential factor. the modulated linearand quadratic models are consistent with the planck observations. in both kindsof models the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be of the order $10^{-2}$, which willbe tested by the near future observations.

1504.07217	an updated historical profile of the higgs boson	the higgs boson was postulated in 1964, and phenomenological studies of itspossible production and decays started in the early 1970s, followed by studiesof its possible production in electron-positron, antiproton-proton andproton-proton collisions, in particular. until recently, the most sensitivesearches for the higgs boson were at lep between 1989 and 2000, which werecomplemented by searches at the fermilab tevatron. then the lhc experimentsatlas and cms entered the hunt, announcing on july 4, 2012 the discovery of a"higgs-like" particle with a mass of about 125~gev. this identification hasbeen supported by subsequent measurements of its spin, parity and couplingproperties. it was widely anticipated that the higgs boson would be accompaniedby supersymmetry, although other options, like compositeness, were notcompletely excluded. so far there are no signs any new physics, and themeasured properties of the higgs boson are consistent with the predictions ofthe minimal standard model. this article reviews some of the key historicaldevelopments in higgs physics over the past half-century.

1507.04687	helical phase inflation via non-geometric flux compactifications: from  natural to starobinsky-like inflation	we show that a new class of helical phase inflation models can be simplyrealized in minimal supergravity, wherein the inflaton is the phase componentof a complex field and its potential admits a deformed helicoid structure. wefind a new unique complex-valued index $\chi$ that characterizes almost theentire region of the $n_s-r$ plane favored by new planck observations.continuously varying the index $\chi$, predictions interpolate fromquadratic/natural inflation parameterized by a phase/axion decay constant tostarobinsky-like inflation parameterized by the $\alpha$-parameter. wedemonstrate that the simple supergravity construction realizingstarobinsky-like inflation can be obtained from a more microscopic model byintegrating out heavy fields, and that the flat phase direction for slow-rollinflation is protected by a mildly broken global $u(1)$ symmetry. %, which ismildly broken at the inflation energy scale. we study the geometrical origin ofthe index $\chi$, and find that it corresponds to a linear constraint relating\kah moduli. we argue that such a linear constraint is a natural result ofmoduli stabilization in type \myroman{2} orientifold compactifications oncalabi-yau threefolds with geometric and non-geometric fluxes. possible choicesfor the index $\chi$ are discrete points on the complex plane that relate tothe distribution of supersymmetric minkowski vacua on moduli space. moreprecise observations of the inflationary epoch in the future may provide abetter estimation of the index $\chi$. since $\chi$ is determined by the fluxesand vacuum expectation values of complex structure moduli, such observationswould characterize the geometry of the internal space as well.

1508.00568	the 14 tev lhc takes aim at susy: a no-scale supergravity model for lhc  run 2	the supergravity model named no-scale ${\cal f}$-$su(5)$, which is based uponthe flipped $su$(5) grand unified theory (gut) with additional tev-scalevector-like flippon multiplets, has been partially probed during the lhc run 1at 7-8 tev, though the majority of its model space remains viable and should beaccessible by the 13-14 tev lhc during run 2. the model framework possesses therather unique capacity to provide a light cp-even higgs boson mass in thefavored 124-126 gev window while simultaneously retaining a testably lightsupersymmetry (susy) spectrum. we summarize the outlook for no-scale ${\calf}$-$su(5)$ at the 13-14 tev lhc and review a promising methodology for thediscrimination of its long-chain cascade decay signature. we further show thatproportional dependence of all model scales upon the unified gaugino mass$m_{1/2}$ minimizes electroweak fine-tuning, allowing the $z$-boson mass $m_z$to be expressed as an explicit function of $m_{1/2}$, $m_z^2 = m_z^2(m_{1/2}^2)$, with implicit dependence upon a dimensionless ratio $c$ of thesupersymmetric higgs mixing parameter $\mu$ and $m_{1/2}$. finally, weelucidate an empirical connection between recent scalar tensor measurements andno-scale supergravity cosmological models that mimic the starobinsky model ofinflation.

0806.0192	flux parameter spaces in type ii vacua	we study the flux parameter spaces for semi-realistic supersymmetricpati-salam models in the ads vacua on type iia orientifold and realisticsupersymmetric pati-salam models in the minkowski vacua on type iiborientifold. because the fluxes can be very large, we show explicitly thatthere indeed exists a huge number of semi-realistic type iia and realistic typeiib flux models. in the type iia flux models, in the very large flux limit, thetheory can become weakly coupled and the ads vacua can approach to theminkowski vacua. in a series of realistic type iib flux models, at the stringscale, the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the standard model (sm) gaugesymmetry, the gauge coupling unification can be achieved naturally, all theextra chiral exotic particles can be decoupled, and the observed sm fermionmasses and mixings can be obtained as well. in particular, the real parts ofthe dilaton, k\"ahler moduli, and the unified gauge coupling are independent ofthe very large fluxes. the very large fluxes only affect the real and/orimaginary parts of the complex structure moduli, and/or the imaginary parts ofthe dilaton and k\"ahler moduli. however, these semi-realistic type iia andrealistic type iib flux models can not be populated in the string landscape.

astro-ph;0510172	robust limits on lorentz violation from gamma-ray bursts	we constrain the possibility of a non-trivial refractive index in free spacecorresponding to an energy-dependent velocity of light: c(e) \simeq c_0 (1 -e/m), where m is a mass scale that might represent effect ofquantum-gravitational space-time foam, using the arrival times of sharpfeatures observed in the intensities of radiation with different energies froma large sample of gamma-ray bursters (grbs) with known redshifts. we usewavelet techniques to identify genuine features, which we confirm insimulations with artificial added noise. using the weighted averages of thetime-lags calculated using correlated features in all the grb light curves, wefind a systematic tendency for more energetic photons to arrive earlier.however, there is a very strong correlation between the parameterscharacterizing an intrinsic time-lag at the source and a distance-dependentpropagation effect. moreover, the significance of the earlier arrival times isless evident for a subsample of more robust spectral structures. allowing forintrinsic stochastic time-lags in these features, we establish a statisticallyrobust lower limit: m &gt; 0.9x10^{16} gev on the scale of violation of lorentzinvariance.

0809.3200	supergravity and superstring signatures of the one-parameter model at  lhc	many string constructions have a classical no-scale structure, resulting in aone-parameter model (opm) for the supersymmetry breaking soft terms. as ahighly constrained subset of msugra, the opm has the potential to bepredictive. conversely, if the observed superpartner spectrum at lhc is asubset of the opm parameter space, then this may provide a clue to theunderlying theory at high energies. we investigate the allowed supersymmetryparameter space for a generic one-parameter model taking into account the mostrecent experimental constraints. we find that in the strict moduli scenario,there are no regions of the parameter space which may satisfy all constraints.however, for the dilaton scenario, there are small regions of the parameterspace where all constraints may be satisfied and for which the observed darkmatter density may be generated. we also survey the possible signatures whichmay be observable at the large hadron collider (lhc). finally, we comparecollider signatures of opm to those from a model with non-universal soft terms,in particular those of an intersecting d6-brane model. we find that it may bepossible to distinguish between these diverse scenarios at lhc.

hep-ph;0610054	testable flipped su(5) x u(1)_x models	the little hierarchy between the gut scale and the string scale may give ussome hints that can be tested at the lhc. to achieve string-scale gaugecoupling unification, we introduce additional vector-like particles. we requirethat these vector-like particles be standard, form complete gut multiplets, andhave masses around the tev scale or close to the string scale. interestingly,only the flipped su(5) x u(1)_x models can work elegantly. we consider allpossible sets of vector-like particles with masses around the tev scale. and weintroduce vector-like particles with masses close to the string scale which canmimic the string-scale threshold corrections. we emphasize that all of thesevector-like particles can be obtained in the interesting flipped su(5) x u(1)_xstring models from the four-dimensional free fermionic string construction.assuming the low-energy supersymmetry, high-scale supersymmetry, and splitsupersymmetry, we show that the string-scale gauge coupling unification canindeed be achieved in the flipped su(5) x u(1)_x models. these models can betested at the lhc by observing simple sets of vector-like particles at the tevscale. moreover, we discuss a simple flipped su(5) x u(1)_x model withstring-scale gauge coupling unification and high-scale supersymmetry byintroducing only one pair of the vector-like particles at the tev scale, and wepredict the corresponding higgs boson masses. also, we briefly comment on thestring-scale gauge coupling unification in the model with low-energysupersymmetry by introducing only one pair of the vector-like particles at theintermediate scale. and we briefly comment on the mixings among the sm fermionsand the corresponding extra vector-like particles.
