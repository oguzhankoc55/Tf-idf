0907.0669	dust properties in m31.i.basic properties and a discussion on  age-dependent dust heating	context. spitzer space telescope observations and dust emission models areused to discuss the distribution of dust and its characteristics in m31.together with galex fuv, nuv, and sdss images we studied the age dependence ofthe dust heating process. methods.spitzer irac/mips maps of m31 were matchedtogether and compared to dust emission models allowing to constrain the dustmass, the intensity of the mean radiation field, the abundance of polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pah) particles. the total infrared emission (tir) wasanalyzed in function of uv and optical colors and compared to predictions ofmodels which consider the age-dependent dust heating. results. we demonstratethat cold-dust component emission dominates the infrared spectral energydistribution of m31. the mean intensity of the radiation field heating the dustis low (typically u&lt;2, where u=1 is the value in the solar surrounding). due tothe lack of submillimetric measurements the dust mass (m_{dust}) is only weaklyconstrained by the infrared spectrum. we show that across the spiral-ringstructure of m31 a fraction &gt;3% of the total dust mass is in pahs. uv andoptical colors are correlated to (tir/fuv) ratios in \sim 670 pc-sized regionsoverall the disk of m31, although deviating from the irx-beta relationship forstarburst galaxies. we derived that in 83% of the regions analyzed across the10kpc ring more than 50% of the energy absorbed by the dust is rediated at\lambda &gt; 4000 \aa and that dust in m31 appears mainly heated by populations afew gyr old even across the star-forming ring. the attenuation is varyingradially peaking near 10kpc and decreasing faster in the inner regions of m31than in the outer regions. we finally derived the attenuation map of m31 at6"/px resolution (\sim 100 pc/px along the plane of m31).[abridged]

0910.5590	the old and heavy bulge of m31 i. kinematics and stellar populations	we present new optical long-slit data along 6 position angles of the bulgeregion of m31. we derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcminfrom the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, andout to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk makes 55% of the totallight. we show that the velocity dispersions of mcelroy (1983) are severelyunderestimated (by up to 50 km/s) and previous dynamical models haveunderestimated the stellar mass of m31's bulge by a factor 2. moreover, thelight-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km/s, thusreducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the blackhole at the center of m31. the kinematic position angle varies with distance,pointing to triaxiality. we detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minoraxis. we measure eight emission-corrected lick indices. they are approximatelyconstant on circles. we derive the age, metallicity and alpha-elementoverabundance profiles. except for the region in the inner arcsecs of thegalaxy, the bulge of m31 is uniformly old (&gt;12 gyr, with many best-fit ages atthe model grid limit of 15 gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant([alpha/fe]~0.2) and at solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of theresolved stellar components. the predicted u-g, g-r and r-i sloan colorprofiles match reasonably well the dust-corrected observations. the stellarpopulations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (m/l_r ~4-4.5 for a kroupa imf), in agreement with stellar dynamical estimates based onour new velocity dispersions. in the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted agedrops to 4-8 gyr, while the metallicity increases to above 3 times the solarvalue.

0912.0744	golden gravitational lensing systems from the sloan lens acs survey. i.  sdss j1538+5817: one lens for two sources	we present a lensing and photometric study of the exceptional system sdssj1538+5817, identified by the slacs survey. the lens is a luminous ellipticalat redshift z=0.143. using hst public images in two different filters, thepresence of two background sources lensed into an einstein ring and a doublesystem is ascertained. our new spectroscopic observations, performed at thenot, reveal that the two sources are located at the same redshift z=0.531. weinvestigate the total mass distribution of the lens between 1 and 4 kpc fromthe galaxy center by means of parametric and non-parametric lensing codes thatdescribe the multiple images as point-like objects. several disparate lensingmodels agree on: (1) reproducing accurately the observed image positions; (2)predicting a nearly axisymmetric total mass distribution, centered and orientedas the light distribution; (3) measuring a value of 8.11 x 10^{10} m_{sun} forthe total mass projected within the einstein radius of 2.5 kpc; (4) estimatinga total mass density profile slightly steeper than an isothermal one. a fit ofthe sdss multicolor photometry with csp models provides a value of 20 x 10^{10}m_{sun} for the total stellar mass of the galaxy and of 0.9 for the fraction ofprojected luminous over total mass enclosed inside the einstein radius. bycombining lensing and photometric mass measurements, we differentiate the lensmass content in terms of luminous and dark matter components. thistwo-component modeling, which is viable only in extraordinary systems like sdssj1538+5817, leads to a description of the global properties of the galaxy darkmatter halo. extending these results to a larger number of lenses would improveconsiderably our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution processes inthe lcdm scenario.

1002.0838	bias-free shear estimation using artificial neural networks	bias due to imperfect shear calibration is the biggest obstacle whenconstraints on cosmological parameters are to be extracted from large area weaklensing surveys such as pan-starrs-3pi, des or future satellite missions likeeuclid. we demonstrate that bias present in existing shear measurementpipelines (e.g. ksb) can be almost entirely removed by means of neuralnetworks. in this way, bias correction can depend on the properties of theindividual galaxy instead on being a single global value. we present aprocedure to train neural networks for shear estimation and apply this tosubsets of simulated great08 realnoise data. we also show that circularizationof the psf before measuring the shear reduces the scatter related to the psfanisotropy correction and thus leads to improved measurements, particularly onlow and medium signal-to-noise data. our results are competitive with the bestperformers in the great08 competition, especially for the medium and highersignal-to-noise sets. expressed in terms of the quality parameter defined bygreat08 we achieve a q = 40, 140 and 1300 without and 50, 200 and 1300 withcircularization for low, medium and high signal-to-noise data sets,respectively.

1005.3021	finite-source and finite-lens effects in astrometric microlensing	the aim of this paper is to study the astrometric trajectory of microlensingevents with an extended lens and/or source. we consider not only a dark lensbut also a luminous lens as well. we find that the discontinuous finite-lenstrajectories given by takahashi (2003) will become continuous in thefinite-source regime. the point lens (source) approximation alone gives anunder (over)estimation of the astrometric signal when the size of the lens andsource are not negligible. while the finiteness of the source is revealed whenthe lens transits the surface of the source, the finite-lens signal is mostprominent when the lens is very close to the source. astrometric microlensingtowards the galactic bulge, small magellanic cloud and m31 are discussed, whichindicate that the finite-lens effect is beyond the detection limit of currentinstruments. nevertheless, it is possible to distinguish between self-lensingand halo lensing through a (non-)detection of the astrometric ellipse. we alsoconsider the case where the lens is luminous itself, as has been observed wherea lensing event was followed up with the hubble space telescope. we show thatthe astrometric signal will be reduced in a luminous-lens scenario. thephysical properties of the event, such as the lens-source flux ratio, the sizeof the lens and source nevertheless can be derived by fitting the astrometrictrajectory.

1009.3930	the massive galaxy cluster xmmu j1230.3+1339 at z ~ 1: colour-magnitude  relation, butcher-oemler effect, x-ray and weak lensing mass estimates	we present results from the multi-wavelength study of xmmu j1230.3+1339 at z~ 1. we analyze deep multi-band wide-field images from the large binoculartelescope, multi-object spectroscopy observations from vlt, as well asspace-based serendipitous observations, from the galex and chandra x-rayobservatories. we apply a bayesian photometric redshift code to derive theredshifts using the fuv, nuv and the deep u, b, v, r, i, z data. we achieve anaccuracy of $\triangle z/(1+z)$ = 0.07 (0.04) and the fraction of catastrophicoutliers is $\eta$ = 13 (0)%, when using all (secure) spectroscopic data,respectively. the i - z against z colour-magnitude relation of the photo-zmembers shows a tight red-sequence with a zero point of 0.935 mag, and slopeequal to -0.027. we observe evidence for a truncation at the faint end of thered-cluster-sequence and the butcher-oemler effect, finding a fraction of bluegalaxies $f_b \approx$ 0.5. further we conduct a weak lensing analysis of thedeep 26' $\times$ 26' r-band lbc image. the observed shear is fitted with asingle-isothermal-sphere and a navarro-frenk-white model to obtain the velocitydispersion and the model parameters, respectively. our best fit values are, forthe velocity dispersion $\sigma_{sis}$ = 1308 $\pm$ 284, concentrationparameter c = 4.0$^{+14}_{-2}$ and scale radius r$_{s}$ = 345$^{+50}_{-57}$kpc. combining our mass estimates from the kinematic, x-ray and weak lensinganalyses we obtain a total cluster mass of $m^{tot}_{200}$ = (4.56 $\pm$ 2.3)$\times$ 10$^{14}$ m$_{\sun}$. this study demonstrates the feasibility ofground based weak lensing measurements of galaxy clusters up to z ~ 1.

1103.3414	dynamical masses of early-type galaxies: a comparison to lensing results  and implications for the stellar imf and the distribution of dark matter	this work aims to study the distribution of luminous and dark matter in comaearly-type galaxies. dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that massfollows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systemsof similar velocity dispersions. instead, dynamical fits with dark matter halosare in good agreement with lensing results. we derive mass-to-light ratios ofthe stellar populations from lick absorption line indices, reproducing well theobserved galaxy colours. even in dynamical models with dark matter halos theamount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with galaxyvelocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function(imf). while galaxies around sigma ~ 200 km/s are consistent with a kroupa imf,the same imf underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigma ~300 km/s by a factor of two and more. a systematic variation of the stellar imfwith galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a salpeter imffor the most massive galaxies. if the imf is instead constant, then some of thedark matter in high velocity dispersion galaxies must follow a spatialdistribution very similar to that of the light. a combination of both, avarying imf and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possibleas well. for a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations we show thatthe tilt in the fundamental plane can be explained by systematic variations ofthe total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius. we tested commonlyused mass estimator formulae, finding them accurate at the 20-30% level.

1103.5618	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): strong  lensing analysis of abell 383 from 16-band hst wfc3/acs imaging	we examine the inner mass distribution of the relaxed galaxy cluster abell383 in deep 16-band hst/acs+wfc3 imaging taken as part of the clash multi-cycletreasury program. our program is designed to study the dark matter distributionin 25 massive clusters, and balances depth with a wide wavelength coverage tobetter identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. thisinformation together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensinganalysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, sothat a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrainthe inner mass profile, $d\log \sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.6\pm 0.1$ (r&lt;160 kpc).we find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the fullrange spanned by the lensed images, 1.01&lt;z&lt;6.03, with the higher redshiftsources deflected through larger angles as expected. the inner mass profilederived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensinganalysis of wide-field subaru images, with good agreement in the region ofoverlap. the overall mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile withm_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h and a relativelyhigh concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\pm 0.23, which lies above thestandard c-m relation similar to other well-studied clusters. the criticalradius of abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,r_{e}\simeq16\pm2\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number oflensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates ourimaging strategy for the clash survey. in total we aim to provide similarlyhigh-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are x-ray selectedrelaxed clusters, enabling a precise determination of the representative massprofile free from lensing bias.

1107.2649	clash: new multiple-images constraining the inner mass profile of macs  j1206.2-0847	we present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847($z$=0.44) using uv, optical, and ir, hst/acs/wfc3 data taken as part of theclash multi-cycle treasury program, with vlt/vimos spectroscopy for some of themultiply-lensed arcs. the clash observations, combined with our mass-model,allow us to identify 47 new multiply-lensed images of 12 distant sources. theseimages, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range $1\laz\la5.5$, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and toaccurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass-profile of thiscluster. we find an inner profile slope of $d\log \sigma/d\log \theta\simeq-0.55\pm 0.1$ (in the range [1\arcsec, 53\arcsec], or $5\la r \la300$ kpc), ascommonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. using the manysystems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and einstein radiifor different source redshifts. for a source at $z_{s}\simeq2.5$, the criticalcurve encloses a large area with an effective einstein radius of$\theta_{e}=28\pm3\arcsec$, and a projected mass of $1.34\pm0.15\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. from the current understanding of structure formation inconcordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at$z\sim0.5$, so that detailed studies of the inner mass distribution of clusterssuch as macs j1206.2-0847 can provide stringent tests of the $\lambda$cdmparadigm.

1111.0989	weak lensing mass estimates of galaxy groups and the line-of-sight  contamination	weak lensing is an important technique to determine the masses of galaxygroups. however, the distortion imprint on the shape of the background galaxiesis affected by all the mass content along the line-of-sight. using cosmos shearmock data we study the shear profile of 165 groups and investigate the level atwhich the neighbouring groups can enhance or suppress the shear signal from themain halo. our mock data are based on cfht and subaru observations and theinformation on the galaxy groups is taken from the cosmos x-ray catalogue ofextended sources. the expected gravitational shear field of these groups iscalculated assuming that the haloes follow nfw density profiles. we concludethat, on average, the signal-to-noise for a detection of the main halo isaffected by ~15%x\sqrt{ngal/30} with respect to the signal-to-noise the samehalo would have if it was isolated in the sky. groups with neighbours that areclose in projected distance (&lt;1') are the most affected, but haloes located atlarger angular distances also cause a measurable shear signal, which can beinterpreted as uncorrelated large-scale structure. the average bias in the massexcess estimate of individual groups that is introduced by the external haloesis zero with an rms of ~6-72%, depending on the aperture size used. the shearsignal introduced by large-scale structure acts as an external source of noise.the averaged uncertainty introduced is \sigma_{\gamma_t}^{lss}~0.006 percomponent for an aperture size of ~5', which corresponds to 1.8% of theone-component intrinsic ellipticity value. this large-scale structure noiseerror becomes equal to intrinsic ellipticity noise if there are measurementsfor ~3000 galaxies within a certain aperture, a number that is already achievedby current deep surveys such as cosmos and, therefore, should not be ignored.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

1308.1692	clash: a census of magnified star-forming galaxies at z ~ 6-8	we utilize 16 band hubble space telescope (hst) observations of 18 lensingclusters obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash) multi-cycle treasury program to search for $z\sim6-8$ galaxies.we report the discovery of 204, 45, and 13 lyman-break galaxy candidates at$z\sim6$, $z\sim7$, and $z\sim8$, respectively, identified from purelyphotometric redshift selections. this large sample, representing nearly anorder of magnitude increase in the number of magnified star-forming galaxies at$z\sim 6-8$ presented to date, is unique in that we have observations in fourwfc3/uvis uv, seven acs/wfc optical, and all five wfc3/ir broadband filters,which enable very accurate photometric redshift selections. we constructdetailed lensing models for 17 of the 18 clusters to estimate objectmagnifications and to identify two new multiply lensed $z \gtrsim 6$candidates. the median magnifications over the 17 clusters are 4, 4, and 5 forthe $z\sim6$, $z\sim7$, and $z\sim8$ samples, respectively, over an averagearea of 4.5 arcmin$^2$ per cluster. we compare our observed number counts withexpectations based on convolving "blank" field uv luminosity functions throughour cluster lens models and find rough agreement down to $\sim27$ mag, where webegin to suffer significant incompleteness. in all three redshift bins, we finda higher number density at brighter observed magnitudes than the fieldpredictions, empirically demonstrating for the first time the enhancedefficiency of lensing clusters over field surveys. our number counts also arein general agreement with the lensed expectations from the cluster models,especially at $z\sim6$, where we have the best statistics.

(2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band hst photometry acquired aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). obtainedas part of the clash-vlt survey, the vimos medium-resolution spectra of thissource show a very faint continuum between ~8700a and ~9300a and a prominentemission line at 8643a, which can be readily identified with lyman-alpha atz=6.110. the emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a morepronounced red wing. the rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ew=79+-10a.after correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (sfr) estimatedfrom the lya line is sfr(lya)=11 m_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the uv datais sfr(uv)=3 m_{sol}/yr. we estimate that the effective radius of the source isr_e&lt;~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density sigma_{sfr}&gt;6m_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the kennicutt-schmidt relation, a gas surface massdensity sigma_{gas}&gt;10^3 m_{sol}/pc^2. our results support the idea that thismagnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 l^* at z=6,with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. future follow-up observationswith alma will provide valuable insight into the sfr and molecular gas contentof this source. in the spirit of the frontier fields initiative, we alsopublish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other backgroundobjects which will help improving the strong lensing model of this galaxycluster.

1403.4979	intra cluster light properties in the clash-vlt cluster macs  j1206.2-0847	we aim at constraining the assembly history of clusters by studying the intracluster light (icl) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction ofbaryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias usingdifferent icl detection techniques. we developed an automated method, galtoicl,based on the software galapagos to obtain a refined version of typical bcg+iclmaps. we applied this method to our test case macs j1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the clash sample. using deepmulti-band subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (sb) profile ofthe bcg+icl and we studied the icl morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to r500. we repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theicl, sblimit method, i.e. a sb cut-off level, to compare the results. the mostpeculiar feature of the icl in macs1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the se direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a post starburst galaxy. this suggests an interactionbetween the bcg and this galaxy that dates back to t &lt;= 1.5 gyr. the bcg+iclstellar content is 8% of m_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. thesblimit method provides systematically higher icl fractions and this effect islarger at lower sb limits. this is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the icl. though more time consuming, thegaltoicl method provides safer icl detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. this is one of the few icl study at redshift z &gt; 0.3. atcompletion, the clash/vlt program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

1412.0023	constraining the galaxy mass content in the core of a383 using velocity  dispersion measurements for individual cluster members	we use velocity dispersion measurements of 21 individual cluster members inthe core of abell 383, obtained with mmt hectospec, to separate the galaxy andthe smooth dark halo (dh) lensing contributions. while lensing usuallyconstrains the overall, projected mass density, the innovative use of velocitydispersion measurements as a proxy for masses of individual cluster membersbreaks inherent degeneracies and allows us to (a) refine the constraints onsingle galaxy masses and on the galaxy mass-to-light scaling relation and, as aresult, (b) refine the constraints on the dm-only map, a high-end goal of lensmodelling. the knowledge of cluster member velocity dispersions improves thefit by 17% in terms of the image reproduction $\chi^2$, or 20% in terms of therms. the constraints on the mass parameters improve by ~10% for the dh, whilefor the galaxy component, they are refined correspondingly by ~50%, includingthe galaxy halo truncation radius. for an l$^*$ galaxy with m$^*_b$=-20.96, forexample, we obtain best fitting truncation radius r$^*_{tr}=20.5^{+9.6}_{-6.7}$kpc and velocity dispersion $\sigma^*=324\pm17 km/s$. moreover, by performingthe surface brightness reconstruction of the southern giant arc, we improve theconstraints on r$_{tr}$ of two nearby cluster members, which have measuredvelocity dispersions, by more than ~30%. we estimate the stripped mass forthese two galaxies, getting results that are consistent with numericalsimulations. in the future, we plan to apply this analysis to other galaxyclusters for which velocity dispersions of member galaxies are available.

1501.01632	cosmic variance of the galaxy cluster weak lensing signal	intrinsic variations of the projected density profiles of clusters ofgalaxies at fixed mass are a source of uncertainty for cluster weak lensing. wepresent a semi-analytical model to account for this effect, based on acombination of variations in halo concentration, ellipticity and orientation,and the presence of correlated haloes. we calibrate the parameters of our modelat the 10 per cent level to match the empirical cosmic variance of clusterprofiles at m_200m=10^14...10^15 h^-1 m_sol, z=0.25...0.5 in a cosmologicalsimulation. we show that weak lensing measurements of clusters significantlyunderestimate mass uncertainties if intrinsic profile variations are ignored,and that our model can be used to provide correct mass likelihoods. effects onthe achievable accuracy of weak lensing cluster mass measurements areparticularly strong for the most massive clusters and deep observations (with~20 per cent uncertainty from cosmic variance alone at m_200m=10^15 h^-1 m_soland z=0.25), but significant also under typical ground-based conditions. weshow that neglecting intrinsic profile variations leads to biases in themass-observable relation constrained with weak lensing, both for intrinsicscatter and overall scale (the latter at the 15 per cent level). these biasesare in excess of the statistical errors of upcoming surveys and can be avoidedif the cosmic variance of cluster profiles is accounted for.

0805.0137	the m31 microlensing event wecapp-gl1/point-agape-s3: evidence for a  macho component in the dark halo of m31?	we re-analyze the m31 microlensing event wecapp-gl1/point-agape-s3 takinginto account that stars are not point-like but extended. we show that thefinite size of stars can dramatically change the self-lensing eventrate and(less dramatically) also the halo lensing eventrate, if events are as bright aswecapp-gl1. the brightness of the brightest events mostly depends on the sourcesizes and fluxes and on the distance distribution of sources and lenses andtherefore can be used as a sensitive discriminator between halo-lensing andself-lensing events, provided the stellar population mix of source stars isknown well enough. using a realistic model for the 3d-light distribution,stellar population and extinction of m31, we show that an event like wecapp-gl1is very unlikely to be caused by self-lensing. in the entire wecapp-field($17.2'\times 17.2'$ centered on the bulge) we expect only one self-lensingevent every 49 years with the approximate parameters of wecapp-gl1 (time-scale1-3d, $r$ flux-excess &lt;19.0 mag). if we assume only 20% of the dark halos ofm31 and the milky-way consist of 1 solar mass machos an event like wecapp-gl1would occur every 10 years. further more, if one uses position, fwhm timescale, flux excess and color of wecapp-gl1, self-lensing is even 13 times lesslikely than lensing by a macho, if machos contribute 20% to the total halo massand have masses in the range of 0.1 to 4 solar masses. we also demonstrate that(i) the brightness distribution of events in general is a good discriminatorbetween self and halo lensing (ii) the time-scale distribution is a gooddiscriminator if the macho mass is larger than 0.5 solar masses. future surveysof m31 like pandromeda (pan-starrs 1) should be able to provide many more suchevents within the next 4 years.

1507.05090	weak lensing by galaxy troughs in des science verification data	we measure the weak lensing shear around galaxy troughs, i.e. the radialalignment of background galaxies relative to underdensities in projections ofthe foreground galaxy field over a wide range of redshift in scienceverification data from the dark energy survey. our detection of the shearsignal is highly significant (10 to 15$\sigma$ for the smallest angular scales)for troughs with the redshift range z in [0.2,0.5] of the projected galaxyfield and angular diameters of 10 arcmin...1{\deg}. these measurements probethe connection between the galaxy, matter density, and convergence fields. byassuming galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density with poissoniannoise, we find agreement of our measurements with predictions in a fiduciallambda cold dark matter model. the prediction for the lensing signal on largetrough scales is virtually independent of the details of the underlying modelfor the connection of galaxies and matter. our comparison of the shear aroundtroughs with that around cylinders with large galaxy counts is consistent witha symmetry between galaxy and matter over- and underdensities. in addition, wemeasure the two-point angular correlation of troughs with galaxies which, incontrast to the lensing signal, is sensitive to galaxy bias on all scales. thelensing signal of troughs and their clustering with galaxies is therefore apromising probe of the statistical properties of matter underdensities andtheir connection to the galaxy field.

1508.00895	performance of internal covariance estimators for cosmic shear  correlation functions	data re-sampling methods such as the delete-one jackknife are a common toolfor estimating the covariance of large scale structure probes. in this paper weinvestigate the concepts of internal covariance estimation in the context ofcosmic shear two-point statistics. we demonstrate how to use log-normalsimulations of the convergence field and the corresponding shear field to carryout realistic tests of internal covariance estimators and find that mostestimators such as jackknife or sub-sample covariance can reach a satisfactorycompromise between bias and variance of the estimated covariance.  in a forecast for the complete, 5-year des survey we show that internallyestimated covariance matrices can provide a large fraction of the trueuncertainties on cosmological parameters in a 2d cosmic shear analysis. thevolume inside contours of constant likelihood in the $\omega_m$-$\sigma_8$plane as measured with internally estimated covariance matrices is on average$\gtrsim 85\%$ of the volume derived from the true covariance matrix. theuncertainty on the parameter combination $\sigma_8 \sim \sigma_8\omega_m^{0.5}$ derived from internally estimated covariances is $\sim 90\%$ ofthe true uncertainty.

1512.04555	clash-vlt: a highly precise strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster  rxc j2248.7-4431 (abell s1063) and prospects for cosmography	we perform a comprehensive study of the total mass distribution of the galaxycluster rxcj2248 ($z=0.348$) with a set of high-precision strong lensingmodels, which take advantage of extensive spectroscopic information on manymultiply lensed systems. in the effort to understand and quantify inherentsystematics in parametric strong lensing modelling, we explore a collection of22 models where we use different samples of multiple image families,parametrizations of the mass distribution and cosmological parameters. as inputinformation for the strong lensing models, we use the clash hst imaging dataand spectroscopic follow-up observations, carried out with the vimos and musespectrographs, to identify bona-fide multiple images. a total of 16 backgroundsources, over the redshift range $1.0-6.1$, are multiply lensed into 47 images,24 of which are spectroscopically confirmed and belong to 10 individualsources. the cluster total mass distribution and underlying cosmology in themodels are optimized by matching the observed positions of the multiple imageson the lens plane. we show that with a careful selection of a sample ofspectroscopically confirmed multiple images, the best-fit model reproducestheir observed positions with a rms of $0.3$ in a fixed flat $\lambda$cdmcosmology, whereas the lack of spectroscopic information lead to biases in thevalues of the model parameters. allowing cosmological parameters to varytogether with the cluster parameters, we find (at $68\%$ confidence level)$\omega_m=0.25^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$ and $w=-1.07^{+0.16}_{-0.42}$ for a flat$\lambda$cdm model, and $\omega_m=0.31^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and$\omega_\lambda=0.38^{+0.38}_{-0.27}$ for a universe with $w=-1$ and freecurvature. using toy models mimicking the overall configuration of rxcj2248, weestimate the impact of the line of sight mass structure on the positional rmsto be $0.3\pm 0.1$.(abridged)

astro-ph;0111146	the evolution of the tully-fisher relation of spiral galaxies	we present the b-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) of 60 late-type galaxieswith redshifts 0.1-1. the galaxies were selected from the fors deep field witha limiting magnitude of r=23. spatially resolved rotation curves were derivedfrom spectra obtained with fors2 at the vlt. high-mass galaxies with v_max&gt;=150km/s show little evolution, whereas the least massive systems in our sample arebrighter by about 1-2 mag compared to their local counterparts. for the entiredistant sample, the tfr slope is flatter than for local field galaxies(-5.77+-0.45 versus -7.92+-0.18). thus, we find evidence for evolution of theslope of the tfr with redshift on the 3-sigma level. this is still true when wesubdivide the sample into three redshift bins. we speculate that the flattertilt of our sample is caused by the evolution of luminosities and an additionalpopulation of blue galaxies at z&gt;=0.2. the mass dependence of the tfr evolutionalso leads to variations for different galaxy types in magnitude-limitedsamples, suggesting that selection effects can account for the discrepantresults of previous tfr studies on the luminosity evolution of late-typegalaxies.

astro-ph;0202323	the dynamical status of the cluster of galaxies 1e0657-56	we present the results of a new spectroscopic and photometric survey of thehot x-ray cluster 1e0657-56, at z=0.296. we determine the presence of a lowvelocity dispersion subcluster, which is offset from the main cluster positionby 0.7 mpc and about 600 km/s. we determine the virial masses and totalluminosities of the cluster and its subcluster, and solve for the two-bodydynamical model. with additional constraints from the results of the analysisof the cluster x-ray emission by markevitch et al. (2001), we find that thesubcluster passed through the cluster centre about 0.15 gyr ago. taken at facevalue the mass of the subcluster is typical of a loose group. it is howeverdifficult to establish the pre-merger mass of the colliding system. we providetentative evidence that the subcluster is in fact the remnant core of amoderately massive cluster, stripped by the collision with 1e0657-56. the maincluster dynamics does not seem to have suffered from this collision. on thecontrary, the cluster x-ray properties seem to have been significantlyaffected. we also discuss the effect of the subcluster collision in relation tostarburst events and the cluster radio halo.

astro-ph;0309263	the tully-fisher relation at intermediate redshift	using the very large telescope in multi object spectroscopy mode, we haveobserved a sample of 113 field spiral galaxies in the fors deep field (fdf)with redshifts in the range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0. the galaxies were selected upon apparentbrightness (r&lt;23) and encompass all late spectrophotometric types from sa tosdm/im. spatially resolved rotation curves have been extracted for 77 galaxiesand fitted with synthetic velocity fields taking into account all observationaleffects from inclination and slit misalignment to seeing and slit width. wealso compared different shapes for the intrinsic rotation curve. to gain robustvalues of v_max, our analysis is focussed on galaxies with rotation curveswhich extend well into the region of constant rotation velocity at large radii.if the slope of the local tully-fisher relation (tfr) is held fixed, we findevidence for a mass-dependent luminosity evolution which is as large as up to 2mag for the lowest-mass galaxies, but is small or even negligible for thehighest-mass systems in our sample. in effect, the tfr slope is shallower atz~0.5 in comparison to the local sample. we argue for a mass-dependentevolution of the mass-to-light ratio. an additional population of blue,low-mass spirals does not seem a very appealing explanation. the flatter tiltwe find for the distant tfr is in contradiction to the predictions of recentsemi-analytic simulations.

astro-ph;0401500	the fors deep field spectroscopic survey	we present a catalogue and atlas of low-resolution spectra of a well definedsample of 341 objects in the fors deep field. all spectra were obtained withthe fors instruments at the eso vlt with essentially the same spectroscopicset-up. the observed extragalactic objects cover the redshift range 0.1 to 5.0.98 objects are starburst galaxies and qsos at z &gt; 2. using this data set weinvestigated the evolution of the characteristic spectral properties of brightstarburst galaxies and their mutual relations as a function of the redshift.significant evolutionary effects were found for redshifts 2 &lt; z &lt; 4. mostconspicuous are the increase of the average c iv absorption strength, of thedust reddening, and of the intrinsic uv luminosity, and the decrease of theaverage ly alpha emission strength with decreasing redshift. in part theobserved evolutionary effects can be attributed to an increase of themetallicity of the galaxies with cosmic age. moreover, the increase of thetotal star-formation rates and the stronger obscuration of the starburst coresby dusty gas clouds suggest the occurrence of more massive starbursts at latercosmic epochs.

astro-ph;0409515	the star formation rate history in the fors deep and goods south fields	we measure the star formation rate (sfr) as a function of redshift z up to z\~4.5, based on b, i and (i+b) selected galaxy catalogues from the fors deepfield (fdf) and the k-selected catalogue from the goods-south field. distancesare computed from spectroscopically calibrated photometric redshifts accurateto (delta_z / (z_spec+1)) ~0.03 for the fdf and ~0.056 for the goods-southfield. the sfrs are derived from the luminosities at 1500 angstroem. we findthat the total sfr estimates derived from b, i and i+b catalogues agree verywell ($\lsim 0.1$ dex) while the sfr from the k catalogue is lower by ~0.2 dex.we show that the latter is solely due to the lower star-forming activity ofk-selected intermediate and low luminosity (l&lt;l_*) galaxies. the sfr of bright(l&gt;l_*) galaxies is independent of the selection band, i.e. the same for b, i,(i+b), and k-selected galaxy samples. at all redshifts, luminous galaxies(l&gt;l_*) contribute only ~1/3 to the total sfr. there is no evidence forsignificant cosmic variance between the sfrs in the fdf and goods-south field,  ~0.1 dex, consistent with theoretical expectations. the sfrs derived here arein excellent agreement with previous measurements provided we assume the samefaint-end slope of the luminosity function as previous works (alpha ~ -1.6).however, our deep fdf data indicate a shallower slope of alpha=-1.07, implyinga sfr lower by ~0.3 dex. we find the sfr to be roughly constant up to z ~4 andthen to decline slowly beyond, if dust extinctions are assumed to be constantwith redshift.

astro-ph;0605470	parametric strong gravitational lensing analysis of abell 1689	(abridged) we measure the mass distribution of galaxy cluster abell 1689within 0.3 mpc/h_70 of the cluster centre using its strong lensing effect on 32background galaxies. the multiple images are based on those of broadhurst etal. 2005 with some modifications. the cluster profile is explored further outto ~2.5 mpc/h_70 with weak lensing shear measurements from broadhurst et al.2005b. the masses of ~200 cluster galaxies are measured with fundamental planein order to accurately model the small scale mass structure in the cluster. thegalaxies are modelled as elliptical truncated isothermal spheres. the darkmatter component of the cluster is described by either non-singular isothermalellipsoids (nsie) or elliptical versions of the universal dark matter profile(enfw). we use two dark matter haloes to model the smooth dm in the cluster.the total mass profile is well described by either an nsis profile withsigma=1514+-18 km/s and core radius of r_c=71+-5kpc/h_70, or an nfw profilewith c=6.0+-0.5 and r_200=2.82+-0.11 mpc/h_70. the errors are assumed to be dueto the error in assigning masses to the individual galaxies in the galaxycomponent. the derived total mass is in good agreement with the mass profile ofbroadhurst et al. 05. using also weak lensing we can constrain the profilefurther out to r~2.5 mpc/h_70. the best fit parameters are then sigma=1499+-15km/s and r_c=66+-5 kpc/h_70 for the nsis profile and c=7.6+-0.5 andr_200=2.55+-0.07 mpc/h_70 for the nfw profile. using the same imageconfiguration as broadhurst et al. 2005 we obtain a strong lensing model thatis superior to that of broadhurst et al. 2005 (rms of 2.7'' compared to 3.2'').

astro-ph;9705122	detection of shear due to weak lensing by large-scale structure	we present evidence for a coherent shear signal in a field containing thez=1.2 radio-source pks1508-05. since there were no intervening massconcentrations known before targeting this field, we interpret this signal asdue to weak lensing by large-scale structure. this result is the outcome of are-analysis of the observations of fort et al. (1996) in the fields of threehigh redshift qso/radio-sources. several tests of the robustness of the signalwere performed: subdivision of the field and tests using simulated data withrandomized ellipticity orientation; using the pixel-to-pixel autocorrelationfunction method to measure the shear; using the correlation function of thegalaxy ellipticities with bootstrap resampling to estimate errors and to findthe typical angular separation that dominates the signal. we find that thefield of pks1508-05 contains a robust shear signal that is coherent over the 2'by 2' field. the signal is detected at a high level of significance (99.6%)using the tests described above. the amplitude of the shear on a scale of 1' isabout 3%, which is consistent with theoretical expectations from weak lensingby large-scale structure.
