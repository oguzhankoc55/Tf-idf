0908.3158	x-ray point sources and radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies	using chandra imaging spectroscopy and vla l-band maps, we have identifiedradio galaxies at p(1.4 ghz) &gt;= 3x10^{23} w hz^{-1} and x-ray point sources(xpss) at l(0.3-8 kev) &gt;= 10^{42} ergs s^{-1} in 11 moderate redshift(0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4) clusters of galaxies. each cluster is uniquely chosen to have atotal mass similar to predicted progenitors of the present-day coma cluster.within a projected radius of 1 mpc we detect 20 radio galaxies and 8 xpssconfirmed to be cluster members above these limits. 75% of these are detectedwithin 500 kpc of the cluster center. this result is inconsistent with a randomselection from bright, red sequence ellipticals at the &gt; 99.999% level. all butone of the xpss are hosted by luminous ellipticals which otherwise show noother evidence for agn activity. these objects are unlikely to be highlyobscured agn since there is no evidence for large amounts of x-ray or opticalabsorption. the most viable model for these sources are low luminosity bl lacobjects. the expected numbers of lower luminosity fr 1 radio galaxies and bllacs in our sample converge to suggest that very deep radio and x-ray images ofrich clusters will detect agn in a large fraction of bright elliptical galaxiesin the inner 500 kpc. because both the radio galaxies and the xpss possessrelativistic jets, they can inject heat into the icm. using the most recentscalings of p_jet ~ l_radio^{0.5} from birzan et al. (2008), radio sourcesweaker than our luminosity limit probably contribute the majority of the heatto the icm. if a majority of icm heating is due to large numbers of low powerradio sources, triggered into activity by the increasing icm density as theymove inward, this may be the feedback mechanism necessary to stabilize coolingin cluster cores.

0911.1946	x-ray point sources and radio galaxies in clusters: source of  distributed heating of the icm?	in our ongoing multi-wavelength study of cluster agn, we find ~75% of thespectroscopically identified cluster x-ray point sources (xps) withl(0.3-8.0kev)&gt;10^{42} erg s^{-1} and cluster radio galaxies with p(1.4 ghz) &gt;3x10^{23} w hz^{-1} in 11 moderate redshift clusters (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4) are locatedwithin 500 kpc from the cluster center. in addition, these sources are muchmore centrally concentrated than luminous cluster red sequence (crs) galaxies.with the exception of one luminous x-ray source, we find that cluster xpss arehosted by passive red sequence galaxies, have x-ray colors consistent with anagn power-law spectrum, and have little intrinsic obscuring columns in thex-ray (in agreement with previous studies). our cluster radio sources haveproperties similar to fr1s, but are not detected in x-ray probably becausetheir predicted x-ray emission falls below our sensitivity limits. based on theobservational properties of our xps population, we suggest that the clusterxpss are low-luminosity bl lac objects, and thus are beamed low-power fr 1s.extrapolating the x-ray luminosity function of bl lacs and the radio luminosityfunction of fr 1s down to fainter radio and x-ray limits, we estimate that alarge fraction, perhaps all crss with l&gt;l* possess relativistic jets which caninject energy into the icm, potentially solving the uniform heating problem inthe central region of clusters.

0912.1603	broad hi absorbers as metallicity-independent tracers of the warm-hot  intergalactic medium	thermally broadened ly alpha absorbers (blas) offer an alternative method tohighly-ionized metal lines for tracing the whim. we compile a catalog ofreliable bla candidates along seven agn sight lines from a larger set of lyaabsorbers observed by hst/stis. we compare our measurements based onindependent reduction and analysis of the data to those published by otherresearch groups. purported blas are grouped into probable (15), possible (48)and non-bla (56) categories. we infer a line frequency (dn/dz)_bla=18+-11,comparable to observed ovi absorbers. there is significant overlap between blaand ovi absorbers (20-40%) and we find that ovi detections in blas are foundcloser to galaxies than ovi non-detections. based on 164 measured cog hi linemeasurements, we statistically correct the observed line widths via a monte-carlo simulation. gas temperature and neutral fraction f(hi) are inferred fromthese statistically-corrected line widths and lead to a distribution of totalhydrogen columns. we find omega_bla=(6.3+1.1-0.8)x10^-3. there are a number ofcritical systematic assumptions implicit in this calculation, and we discusshow each affects our results and those of previously published work. taking ourvalue, current ovi and bla surveys can account for ~20% of the baryons in thelocal universe. finally, we present new, high-s/n observations of several ofthe bla candidate lines from early release observations made by the cosmicorigins spectrograph on hst.

1002.5033	a direct detection of gas accretion: the lyman limit system in 3c 232	the gas added and removed from galaxies over cosmic time greatly affectstheir stellar populations and star formation rates. qso absorption studies inclose qso/galaxy pairs create a unique opportunity to study the physicalconditions and kinematics of this gas. here we present new hubble spacetelescope (hst) images of the qso/galaxy pair 3c 232/ngc 3067. the quasarspectrum contains a lyman-limit absorption system (lls) due to ngc 3067 at cz =1421 km/s that is associated with the nearby sab galaxy ngc 3067. previous workidentifies this absorber as a high-velocity cloud (hvc) in ngc 3067 but thekinematics of the absorbing gas, infalling or outflowing, were uncertain. thehst images presented here establish the orientation of ngc 3067 and soestablish that the lls/hvc is infalling. using this system as a prototype, weextend these results to higher-z mg ii/lls to suggest that mg ii/llss are asight line sampling of the so-called "cold mode accretion" (cma) infalling ontoluminous galaxies. but to match the observed mg ii absorber statistics, the cmamust be more highly ionized at higher redshifts. the key observations needed tofurther the study of low-z llss is hst/uv spectroscopy, for which a newinstrument, the cosmic origins spectrograph, has just been installed greatlyenhancing our observational capabilities.

1004.0952	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of compact symmetric objects: what  powers radio-loud active galactic nuclei?	we present low- and high-resolution mid-infrared (mid-ir) spectra andphotometry for eight compact symmetric objects (csos) taken with the infraredspectrograph on the spitzer space telescope. the hosts of these young, powerfulradio galaxies show significant diversity in their mid-ir spectra. thisincludes multiple atomic fine-structure lines, h2 gas, polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission, warm dust from t = 50 to 150 k, and silicatefeatures in both emission and absorption. there is no evidence in the mid-ir ofa single template for cso hosts, but 5/8 galaxies show similar moderate levelsof star formation (&lt;10 m_sun/yr from pah emission) and silicate dust in aclumpy torus. the total amount of extinction ranges from a_v ~ 10 to 30, andthe high-ionization [ne v] 14.3 and 24.3 um transitions are not detected forany galaxy in the sample. almost all csos show contributions both from starformation and active galactic nuclei (agns), suggesting that they occupy acontinuum between pure starbursts and agns. this is consistent with thehypothesis that radio galaxies are created following a galactic merger; thetiming of the radio activity onset means that contributions to the irluminosity from both merger-induced star formation and the central agn arelikely. bondi accretion is capable of powering the radio jets for almost allcsos in the sample; the lack of [ne v] emission suggests an advection-dominatedaccretion flow mode as a possible candidate. merging black holes (bhs) withm_bh &gt; 10^8 m_sun likely exist in all of the csos in the sample; however, thereis no direct evidence from these data that bh spin energy is being tapped as analternative mode for powering the radio jets.

1005.1633	observations of mass loss from the transiting exoplanet hd 209458b	using the new cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) on the {\it hubble spacetelescope (hst)}, we obtained moderate-resolution, high signal/noiseultraviolet spectra of hd 209458 and its exoplanet hd 209458b during transit,both orbital quadratures, and secondary eclipse. we compare transit spectrawith spectra obtained at non-transit phases to identify spectral features dueto the exoplanet's expanding atmosphere. we find that the mean flux decreasedby $7.8\pm 1.3$% for the c ii 1334.5323\aa\ and 1335.6854\aa\ lines and by$8.2\pm 1.4$% for the si iii 1206.500\aa\ line during transit compared tonon-transit times in the velocity interval --50 to +50 km s$^{-1}$. comparisonof the c ii and si iii line depths and transit/non-transit line ratios showsdeeper absorption features near --10 and +15 km s$^{-1}$ and less certainfeatures near --40 and +30--70 km s$^{-1}$, but future observations are neededto verify this first detection of velocity structure in the expandingatmosphere of an exoplanet. our results for the c ii lines and thenon-detection of si iv 1394.76\aa\ absorption are in agreement with\citet{vidal-madjar2004}, but we find absorption during transit in the si iiiline contrary to the earlier result. the $8\pm 1$% obscuration of the starduring transit is far larger than the 1.5% obscuration by the exoplanet's disk.absorption during transit at velocities between --50 and +50 km s$^{-1}$ in thec ii and si iii lines requires high-velocity ion absorbers, but models thatassume that the absorbers are high-temperature thermal ions are inconsistentwith the cos spectra. assuming hydrodynamic model values for the gastemperature and outflow velocity at the limb of the outflow as seen in the c iilines, we find mass-loss rates in the range (8--40)$\times 10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$.

0708.4362	the metallicity of intergalactic gas in cosmic voids	we have used the hubble/stis and fuse archives of ultraviolet spectra ofbright agn to identify intergalactic lya absorbers in nearby (z &lt; 0.1) voids.  from a parent sample of 651 lya absorbers, we identified 61 void absorberslocated more than 1.4/h_70 mpc from the nearest l* or brighter galaxy.searching for metal absorption in high-quality (s/n &gt; 10) spectra at thelocation of three diagnostic metal lines (o vi 1032, c iv 1548, si iii 1206),we detected no metal lines in any individual absorber, or in any group ofabsorbers using pixel co-addition techniques. the best limits on metal-lineabsorption in voids were set using four strong lya absorbers with n(h i) &gt;10^{14} cm^-2, with 3-sigma equivalent-width limits ranging from 8 ma (o vi),7-15 ma (c iv), and 4-10 ma (si iii). photoionization modeling yieldsmetallicity limits z &lt; 10^{-1.8+/-0.4} z_sun, from non-detections of c iv and ovi, some 6 times lower than those seen in lya and ovi absorbers at z &lt; 0.1.although the void lya absorbers could be pristine material, considerably deeperspectra are required to rule out a universal metallicity floor produced bybursts of early star formation, with no subsequent star formation in the voids.the most consistent conclusion derived from these low-z results, and similarsearches at z = 3-5, is that galaxy filaments have increased their mean igmmetallicity by factors of 30-100 since z = 3.

1102.1980	multiple absorption-line spectroscopy of the intergalactic medium. i.  model	we present a physically-based absorption-line model for the spectroscopicstudy of the intergalactic medium (igm). this model adopts results from cloudysimulations and theoretical calculations by gnat and sternberg (2007) toexamine the resulting observational signatures of the absorbing gas with thefollowing ionization scenarios: collisional ionization equilibrium (cie),photoionization equilibrium, hybrid (photo- plus collisional ionization), andnon-equilibrium cooling. as a demonstration, we apply this model to newobservations made with the cosmic origins spectrograph aboard the hubble spacetelescope of the igm absorbers at z~0.1877 along the 1es 1553+113 sight line.we identify ly alpha, c iii, o vi, and n v absorption lines with two distinctvelocity components (blue at z_b=0.18757; red at z_r=0.18772) separated bydelta(cz)/(1+z)~38 km/s. joint analyses of these lines indicate that none ofthe examined ionization scenarios can be applied with confidence to the bluevelocity component, although photoionization seems to play a dominant role. forthe red component, cie can be ruled out, but pure photoionization and hybridscenarios (with t&lt;1.3e5 k) are more acceptable. the constrained ranges ofhydrogen density and metallicity of the absorbing gas are n_h=(1.9-2.3)e-5cm^-3 and z=(0.43-0.67)z_solar. these constraints indicate ovi and hiionization fractions, f_ovi=0.10-0.15 and f_hi=(3.2-5.1)e-5, with totalhydrogen column density n_h=(0.7-1.2)e18 cm^-2. this demonstration shows thatjoint analysis of multiple absorption lines can constrain the ionization stateof an absorber, and results used to estimate the baryonic matter contained inthe absorber.

1102.4621	spectropolarimetric evidence for radiatively inefficient accretion in an  optically dull active galaxy	we present subaru/focas spectropolarimetry of two active galaxies in thecosmic evolution survey. these objects were selected to be optically dull, withthe bright x-ray emission of an agn but missing optical emission lines in ourprevious spectroscopy. our new observations show that one target has very weakemission lines consistent with an optically dull agn, while the other objecthas strong emission lines typical of a host-diluted type 2 seyfert galaxy. inneither source do we observe polarized emission lines, with 3-sigma upperlimits of p_blr &lt; 2%. this means that the missing broad emission lines (andweaker narrow emission lines) are not due to simple anisotropic obscuration,e.g., by the canonical agn torus. the weak-lined optically dull agn exhibits ablue polarized continuum with p = 0.78 +/- 0.07% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 7200a (p = 1.37 +/- 0.16% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 5050 a). the wavelengthdependence of this polarized flux is similar to that of an unobscured agncontinuum and represents the intrinsic agn emission, either as synchrotronemission or the outer part of an accretion disk reflected by a clumpy dustscatterer. because this intrinsic agn emission lacks emission lines, thissource is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.

1102.5044	broad ly alpha emission from three nearby bl lacertae objects	we present far-uv hst/cos spectra of four nearby bl lac objects. bl lacspectra are dominated by a smooth, power-law continuum which arises in arelativistic jet. however, the spectra are not necessarily featureless; weak,broad- and/or narrow-line emission is sometimes seen in high-quality opticalspectra. we present detections of lya emission in hst/cos spectra of mrk421(z=0.030) and pks2005-489 (z=0.071) as well as an archival hst/ghrs observationof mrk501 (z=0.0337). archival hst/stis observations of pks2155-304 (z=0.116)show no lya emission to a very low upper limit. using the assumption that thebroad-line region (blr) clouds are asymmetrically placed around the agn, we usethese measured lya emission features to constrain either the relativistic gammavalues for the ionizing continuum produced by the jet (in theionization-bounded case) or the mass of warm gas (in the density-bounded case).while realistic gamma values can be obtained for all four cases, the values formrk421 and pks2155-304 are high enough to suggest that covering factors ofbroad-line-region clouds of ~1-2% might be required to provide consistency withearlier values of doppler boosting and viewing angles suggested for this classof bl lacs. this discrepancy also exists in the case of m87, where the amountof doppler boosting in our direction is expected to be minimal, againsuggestive of a small covering factor of broad-line-region clouds. if, as thesesmall covering factors might suggest, the assumptions of a density-boundedmodel could be more correct, then the observed lya luminosities require thatbl\,lac/fri nuclei possess very little warm gas (10^-4 to 10^-5 msun) assuggested by guilbert, fabian &amp; mccray (1983). if these clouds are in pressurebalance with a hotter (~10^6 k) gas, the blr contains too little mass to powerthe agn by accretion alone.

1107.1867	the evolution of radio galaxies and x-ray point sources in coma cluster  progenitors since z~1.2	using chandra imaging spectroscopy and very large array (vla) l-band radiomaps, we have identified radio sources at p_{1.4ghz} &gt;=5x10^{23} w hz^{-1} andx-ray point sources (xpss) at l_{0.3-8kev}&gt;=5x10^{42} erg s^{-1} in l&gt;l*galaxies in 12 high-redshift (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters of galaxies. the radiogalaxies and xpss in this cluster sample, chosen to be consistent with comacluster progenitors at these redshifts, are compared to those found at low-zanalyzed in hart et al. (2009). within a projected radius of 1 mpc of thecluster cores, we find 17 cluster radio galaxies (11 with secure redshifts,including one luminous fr ii radio source at z=0.826, and 6 more with hostgalaxy colors similar to cluster ellipticals). the radio luminosity function(rlf) of the cluster radio galaxies as a fraction of the cluster red sequence(crs) galaxies reveals significant evolution of this population from high-z tolow-z, with higher power radio galaxies situated in lower temperature clustersat earlier epochs. additionally, there is some evidence that cluster radiogalaxies become more centrally concentrated than crs galaxies with cosmic time.within this same projected radius, we identify 7 spectroscopically-confirmedcluster xpss, all with crs host galaxy colors. consistent with the results frommartini et al. (2009), we estimate a minimum x-ray active fraction of1.4+/-0.8% for crs galaxies in high-z clusters, corresponding to an approximate10-fold increase from 0.15+/-0.15% at low-z. although complete redshiftinformation is lacking for several xpss in z&gt;0.4 cluster fields, the increasednumbers and luminosities of the crs radio galaxies and xpss suggest asubstantial (9-10 fold) increase in the heat injected into high redshiftclusters by agn compared to the present epoch.

(2011)firmly establish the high eccentricity of the companion's orbit as predicted bypulsar timing. using all five epochs of optical data, we have provided anindependent estimate of the mass-ratio, r=1.56\pm0.15 as well as the systemicradial velocity of the binary, \gamma= 42.1\pm2.5 km/s. we constrain thespectral type of the pulsar companion to lie between f5 v -- g0 v (a slightlyearlier type than suggested previously) by measuring the equivalent widths oftwo of the three ca-triplet lines (8498 \aa, 8542 \aa) and the paschen line at8598 \aa (p14); we also broadly constrain the metallicity of the companion.additionally, we have placed a somewhat better limit on the rotational velocityof the pulsar companion of v_{rot}\sin{i} \leq 66 km/s which is still notsufficient to allow a test of general relativity using this system.

1202.0010	gamma-ray-burst host galaxy surveys at redshift z&gt;4: probes of star  formation rate and cosmic reionization	measuring the star formation rate (sfr) at high redshift is crucial forunderstanding cosmic reionization and galaxy formation. two commoncomplementary approaches are lyman-break-galaxy (lbg) surveys for large samplesand gamma-ray-burst (grb) observations for sensitivity to sfr in smallgalaxies. the z&gt;4 grb-inferred sfr is higher than the lbg rate, but thisdifference is difficult to understand, as both methods rely on several modelingassumptions. using a physically motivated galaxy luminosity function model,with star formation in dark-matter halos with virial temperature tvir&gt;2e4 k(m_dm&gt;2e8 m_sun), we show that grb and lbg-derived sfrs are consistent if grbsextend to faint galaxies (m_ab&lt;-11). to test star formation below the detectionlimit l_lim~0.05l^*_{z=3} of lbg surveys, we propose to measure the fractionf_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) of grb hosts with l&gt;l_lim. this fraction quantifies themissing star formation fraction in lbg surveys, constraining themass-suppression scale for galaxy formation, with weak dependence on modelingassumptions. because f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) corresponds to the ratio of starformation rates derived from lbg and grb surveys, if these estimators areunbiased, measuring f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) also constrains the redshift evolution ofthe grb production rate per unit mass of star formation. our analysis predictssignificant success for grb host detections at z~5 with f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z)~0.4,but rarer detections at z&gt;6. by analyzing the upper limits on host-galaxyluminosities of six z&gt;5 grbs from literature data, we infer that galaxies withm_ab&gt;-15 were present at z&gt;5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating the key roleplayed by very faint galaxies during reionization.

1212.5658	characterizing the circumgalactic medium of nearby galaxies with hst/cos  and hst/stis absorption-line spectroscopy	the circumgalactic medium (cgm) of late-type galaxies is characterized usinguv spectroscopy of 11 targeted qso/galaxy pairs at z &lt; 0.02 with the hubblespace telescope cosmic origins spectrograph and ~60 serendipitousabsorber/galaxy pairs at z &lt; 0.2 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph.cgm warm cloud properties are derived, including volume filling factors of3-5%, cloud sizes of 0.1-30 kpc, masses of 10-1e8 solar masses andmetallicities of 0.1-1 times solar. almost all warm cgm clouds within 0.5virial radii are metal-bearing and many have velocities consistent with beingbound, "galactic fountain" clouds. for galaxies with l &gt; 0.1 l*, the total massin these warm cgm clouds approaches 1e10 solar masses, ~10-15% of the totalbaryons in massive spirals and comparable to the baryons in their parent galaxydisks. this leaves &gt;50% of massive spiral-galaxy baryons "missing". dwarfs(&lt;0.1 l*) have smaller area covering factors and warm cgm masses (&lt;5% baryonfraction), suggesting that many of their warm clouds escape. constant warmcloud internal pressures as a function of impact parameter ($p/k ~ 10 cm^{-3}k) support the inference that previous cos detections of broad, shallow o viand ly-alpha absorptions are of an extensive (~400-600 kpc), hot (t ~ 1e6 k)intra-cloud gas which is very massive (&gt;1e11 solar masses). while the warm cgmclouds cannot account for all the "missing baryons" in spirals, the hotintra-group gas can, and could account for ~20% of the cosmic baryon census atz ~ 0 if this hot gas is ubiquitous among spiral groups.

1301.4242	hst/cos spectra of three qsos that probe the circumgalactic medium of a  single spiral galaxy: evidence for gas recycling and outflow	we have used the cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) to obtain far-uv spectraof three closely-spaced qso sight lines that probe the circumgalactic medium(cgm) of an edge-on spiral galaxy, eso 157-49, at impact parameters of 74 and93 kpc near its major axis and 172 kpc along its minor axis. h i ly\alpha\absorption is detected at the galaxy redshift in the spectra of all three qsos,and metal lines of si iii, si iv, and c iv are detected along the twomajor-axis sight lines. photoionization models of these clouds suggestmetallicities close to the galaxy metallicity, cloud sizes of ~1 kpc, and gasmasses of ~10^4 solar masses. given the high covering factor of these clouds,eso 157-49 could harbor ~2x10^9 solar masses of warm cgm gas. we detect nometals in the sight line that probes the galaxy along its minor axis, but gasat the galaxy metallicity would not have detectable metal absorption withionization conditions similar to the major-axis clouds. the kinematics of themajor-axis clouds favor these being portions of a "galactic fountain" ofrecycled gas, while two of the three minor-axis clouds are constrainedgeometrically to be outflowing gas.  in addition, one of our qso sight lines probes a second more distant spiral,eso 157-50, along its major axis at an impact parameter of 88 kpc. strong h ily\alpha\ and c iv absorption only are detected in the qso spectrum at theredshift of eso 157-50.

1409.4436	updated models for the creation of a low-z qso absorber by a dwarf  galaxy wind	we present new galex images and optical spectroscopy of j1229+02, a dwarfpost-starburst galaxy located 81 kpc from the 1585 km/s absorber in the 3c 273sight line. the absence of h\alpha\ emission and the faint galex uv fluxesconfirm that the galaxy's recent star formation rate is $&lt;10^{-3}m_{\odot}$/yr. absorption-line strengths and the uv-optical sed give similarestimates of the acceptable model parameters for its youngest stellarpopulation where $f_m$ &lt; 60% of its total stars (by mass) formed in a burst$t_sb$ = 0.7-3.4 gyr ago with a stellar metallicity of -1.7 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; +0.2; wealso estimate the stellar mass of j1229+02 to be 7.3 &lt; log($m_*/m_{\odot}$) &lt;7.8. our previous study of j1229+02 found that a supernova-driven wind wascapable of expelling all of the gas from the galaxy (none is observed today)and could by itself plausibly create the nearby absorber. but, using new data,we find a significantly higher galaxy/absorber velocity difference, a youngerstarburst age, and a smaller starburst mass than previously reported. simpleenergy-conserving wind models for j1229+02 using fiducial values of $f_m$ ~0.1, $t_sb$ ~ 2 gyr, and log(m$_*/m_{\odot}$) ~ 7.5 allow us to conclude thatthe galaxy alone cannot produce the observed qso absorber; i.e., any putativeejecta must interact with ambient gas from outside j1229+02. because j1229+02is located in the southern extension of the virgo cluster ample potentialsources of this ambient gas exist. based on the two nearest examples of strongmetal-line absorbers discovered serendipitously (the current one and the 1700km/s metal-line absorber in the nearby q1230+0115 sight line), we conclude thatabsorbers with $10^{14} &lt; n_{hi} &lt; 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ at impact parameters&gt;1$r_{vir}$ are likely intergalactic systems and cannot be identifiedunambiguously as the circumgalactic material of any one individual galaxy.

1506.04095	on the size and mass of photo-ionized clouds in extended spiral galaxy  halos	the size and mass of two circum-galactic medium (cgm) clouds in the halo(impact parameter = 65 kpc) of a nearby late-type galaxy, mgc-01-04-005 ($cz =1865$ km/s), are investigated using a close triplet of qso sight lines (the"lbqs triplet"; crighton et al. 2010). far ultraviolet spectra obtained withthe cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) aboard the hubble space telescope (hst)find two velocity components in lyman $\alpha$ at $\sim1830$ and 1900 km/s intwo of these sight lines, requiring minimum transverse cloud sizes of $\geq10$kpc. a plausible, but not conclusive, detection of civ 1548 \aa\ absorption atthe higher velocity in the third sight line suggests an even larger lower limitof $\geq23$ kpc for that cloud. using various combinations of constraints,including photo-ionization modeling for one absorber, lower limits on masses ofthese two clouds of $\geq10^6$ m_sun are obtained. ground-based imaging andlong-slit spectroscopy of mcg -01-04-005 obtained at the apache pointobservatory (apo) 3.5m telescope find it to be a relatively normal late-typegalaxy with a current star formation rate (sfr) of $\sim0.01$ m_sun per year.galaxy evolution explorer (galex) photometry finds an sfr only a few timeshigher over the last $10^8$ yrs. we conclude that the cgm clouds probed bythese spectra are typical in being at impact parameters of 0.4-0.5 r_vir from arather typical, non-starbursting late-type galaxy so that these size and massresults should be generic for this class. therefore, at least some cgm cloudsare exceptionally large and massive.

astro-ph;0108371	the ionization and metallicity of the intervening o vi absorber at z =  0.1212 in the spectrum of h1821+643	we use high-resolution uv spectra of the radio-quiet qso h1821+643 (z_em =0.297), obtained with stis and fuse, to study the ionization and metallicity ofan intervening o vi absorption line system at z(abs) = 0.1212. this absorberhas the following notable properties: (1) several galaxies are close to thesight line at the absorber redshift, including an actively star-forming galaxyat a projected distance of 144 kpc. (2) there is a complex cluster of h i lyaabsorption lines near the o vi redshift, including at least five componentsspread over a velocity range of ~700 km/s . (3) the strongest lya line in thecluster appears to be composed of a mildly saturated component with a typicalb-value blended with a broad component with b = 85 km/s . (4) the o viabsorption is not aligned with the strongest h i absorption, but instead iswell-aligned with the broad component. (5) the only detected species (&gt;4sigma)are o vi and h i despite coverage of strong transitions of other abundantelements. based on these constraints, we find that the absorption lineproperties can be produced in collisionally ionized gas with roughly 5.3 &lt; logt &lt; 5.6 and -1.8 &lt; [o/h] &lt; -0.6. however, we find that photoionization is alsoviable if the pathlength l through the absorbing gas is long enough; simplephotoionization models require 85 &lt; l &lt; 1900 kpc and -1.1 &lt; [o/h] &lt; -0.3. webriefly discuss how observations of x-ray absorption lines due to o vii and oviii could be used, in principle, to break the ionization mechanism degeneracy.

astro-ph;0112530	distant cluster hunting i: a comparison between the optical and x-ray  luminosity functions from an optical/x-ray survey	we present a comparison of x-ray and optical luminosities and luminosityfunctions of cluster candidates from a joint optical/x-ray survey, the rosatoptical x-ray survey. completely independent x-ray and optical catalogs of 23rosat fields (4.8 deg2) were created by a matched-filter optical algorithm andby a wavelet technique in the x-ray. we directly compare the results of theoptical and x-ray selection techniques. the matched-filter technique detected74% (26 out of 35) of the most reliable cluster candidates in thex-ray-selected sample; the remainder could be either constellations of x-raypoint sources or z&gt;1 clusters. the matched-filter technique identifiedapproximately 3 times the number of candidates (152 candidates) found in thex-ray survey of nearly the same sky (57 candidates). while the estimatedoptical and x-ray luminosities of clusters of galaxies are correlated, theintrinsic scatter in this relationship is very large. we can reproduce thenumber and distribution of optical clusters with a model defined by the x-rayluminosity function and by an lx lambda cl relation if h0=75 km s-1 mpc-1 andif the lx lambda cl relation is steeper than the expected lx lambda 2cl. onstatistical grounds, a bimodal distribution of x-ray luminous and x-ray faintclusters is unnecessary to explain our observations. follow-up work is requiredto confirm whether the clusters without bright x-ray counterparts are simplyx-ray faint for their optical luminosity because of their low mass or youth orare a distinct population of clusters that do not, for some reason, have denseintracluster media. we suspect that these optical clusters are low-masssystems, with correspondingly low x-ray temperatures and luminosities, or thatthey are not yet completely virialized systems.

astro-ph;0205374	chandra observations of abell 2029: no cooling flow and a steep  abundance gradient	we have obtained high spatial resolution temperature and abundance profilesfor the galaxy cluster abell 2029 with the chandra acis-s instrument. ourobservations reveal that the spectra are well-fit by a single-phase gas in eachannulus. while the temperature of the intracluster medium drops from ~9 kev at3 arcmin (260 kpc) to 3 kev in the central 5 arcsec (5 kpc) of the cluster,there is no evidence for gas emitting at temperatures below 3 kev. the additionof a cooling flow component does not improve the fits, despite previous claimsfor a massive cooling flow. there is also no evidence for excess absorptionabove the galactic n_h value. we also observe a steep fe abundance gradient,such that z_fe &gt;= 2 z_solar (assuming meteoritic solar fe abundance) in thecore, consistent with significant enrichment from fe-rich type ia supernovae inthe cd galaxy. the fe abundance drops to ~0.5 z_solar at 3 arcmin (260 kpc), ingood agreement with previous bepposax measurements. the high resolution imagereveals neither a strong central point source, nor any filamentary structurerelated to a cooling flow or a merger. the absence of a strong merger signatureargues against the creation of the wide-angle-tail radio source morphology in amerger event.

astro-ph;0207304	a study of 3cr radio galaxies from z = 0.15 to 0.65. ii. evidence for an  evolving radio structure	radio structure parameters were measured from the highest quality radio mapsavailable for a sample of 3cr radio galaxies in the redshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt;0.65. combined with similar data for quasars in the same redshift range, thesemorphology data are used in conjunction with a quantification of the richnessof the cluster environment around these objects (the amplitude of thegalaxy-galaxy spatial covariance function, bgg) to search for indirect evidenceof a dense intracluster medium (icm). this is done by searching for confinementand distortions of the radio structure that are correlated with bgg.correlations between physical size and hot spot placement with bgg showevidence for an icm only at z &lt; 0.4 and there are no correlations at z &gt; 0.4,suggesting an epoch of z ~ 0.4 for the formation of an icm in these abellrichness class 0-1, fr2-selected clusters. x-ray selected clusters atcomparable redshifts, which contain fr1 type sources exclusively, aredemonstrably richer than the fr2-selected clusters found in this study. themajority of the radio sources with high bgg values at z &lt; 0.4 can be describedas ``fat doubles'' or intermediate fr2/fr1s. the lack of correlation betweenbgg and bending angle or bgg and lobe length asymmetry suggests that thesetypes of radio source distortion are caused by something other than interactionwith a dense icm. thus, a large bending angle cannot be used as an unambiguousindicator of a rich cluster around powerful radio sources. these resultssupport the hypothesis made in paper 1 that cluster quasars fade to becomefr2s, then fr1s, on a timescale of 0.9 gyrs (for h0 = 50 km s^-1 mpc^-1).

astro-ph;0208167	the apparent host galaxy of pks 1413+135: hst, asca and vlba  observations	pks 1413+135 (z=0.24671) is one of very few radio-loud agn with an apparentspiral host galaxy. previous authors have attributed its nearly exponentialinfrared cutoff to heavy absorption but have been unable to place tight limitson the absorber or its location in the optical galaxy. in addition, doubtsremain about the relationship of the agn to the optical galaxy given theobserved lack of re-emitted radiation. we present new hst, asca and vlbaobservations which throw significant new light on these issues. the hstobservations reveal an extrremely red color (v-h = 6.9 mag) for the activenucleus of pks 1413+135, requiring both a spectral turnover at a few micronsdue to synchrotron aging and a gmc-sized absorber. we derive an intrinsiccolumn n_h = 4.6^{+2.1}_{-1.6} times 10^{22}cm^{-2} and covering fraction f =0.12^{+0.07}_{-0.05}. as the gmc is likely in the disk of the optical galaxy,our sightline is rather unlikely (p ~ 2 times 10^{-4}). the properties of thegmc typical of gmcs in our own galaxy. the hi absorber appears centered 25milliarcseconds away from the nucleus, while the x-ray and nearly all of themolecular absorbers must cover the nucleus, implying a complicated geometry andcloud structure, with a molecular core along our line of sight to the nucleus.interestingly, the hst/nicmos data require the agn to be decentered relative tothe optical galaxy by 13 +/- 4 milliarcseconds. this could be interpreted assuggestive of an agn location far in the background compared to the opticalgalaxy, but it can also be explained by obscuration and/or nuclear structure,which is more consistent with the observed lack of multiple images.

astro-ph;0209205	chandra observations of abell 2029: the dark matter profile down to  &lt;0.01 r_vir in an unusually relaxed cluster	we have used a high resolution chandra observation to examine the core massdistribution of the unusually regular cd cluster abell 2029. this system isespecially well-suited for analysis of its mass distribution under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium: it exhibits an undisturbed x-raymorphology and a single-phase icm. we estimate the total mass, and thecontributions of the gas and dark matter components from &lt;3 arcsec to ~3 arcmin(&lt;4.4-260 kpc, 0.001-0.1 r_vir). the gas density is well fitted by either adouble beta-model, or a ``cusped'' beta-model. the temperature data areincreasing, and can be approximated by a power-law, with alpha_t = 0.27+/-0.01.  fitting smooth functions to density and t, we obtain a mass profile, which isremarkably well described down to 0.002 r_vir by the nfw model, for which wemeasure r_scale = 540+/-90 kpc (~0.2 r_vir) and c = 4.4 +/- 0.9. the massprofile is also approximated by a power-law fit with alpha_m = 1.81+/-0.04(corresponding to a logarithmic density slope of -1.19+/-0.04). the densityprofile is too shallow to be fitted with a moore et al. model. the consistencywith nfw at &lt;0.01 r_vir is incompatible with sidm, and contrasts with theresults from rotation curves of lsb and dwarf galaxies. this suggests thatwhile cdm may adequately describe clusters, it does not currently accountproperly for small halos.  using the cd light, we observe a total m/l_v ~ 12 at r &lt; 20 kpc, rising to &gt;100 beyond 200 kpc. the consistency with an nfw halo model and the large m/lsuggest the cluster is dm-dominated down to &lt;~ 0.005 r_vir. we observe a gasmass fraction = 0.139+/-0.004 at the limit of our observations, finding anupper limit to omega_m &lt;= 0.29+/-0.03 (abridged).

astro-ph;0401036	the local ly-alpha forest iv: stis g140m spectra and results on the  distribution and baryon content of hi absorbers	we present hst stis/g140m spectra of 15 extragalactic targets, which wecombine with ghrs/g160m data to examine the statistical properties of the low-zly-alpha forest. we evaluate the physical properties of these ly-alphaabsorbers and compare them to their high-z counterparts. we determine that thewarm, photoionized igm contains 29+/-4% of the total baryon inventory at z = 0.we derive the distribution in column density, n_hi^(1.65+/-0.07) for 12.5 &lt; log[n_hi] &lt; 14.5, breaking to a flatter slope above log [n_hi] &gt; 14.5. the slowingof the number density evolution of high-w ly-alpha clouds is not as great aspreviously measured, and the break to slower evolution may occur later thanpreviously suggested (z~1.0 rather than 1.6). we find a 7.2sigma excess in thetwo-point correlation function (tpcf) of ly-alpha absorbers for velocityseparations less than 260 km/s, which is exclusively due to the higher columndensity clouds. from our previous result that higher column density ly-alphaclouds cluster more strongly with galaxies, this tpcf suggests a physicaldifference between the higher and lower column density clouds in our sample.

astro-ph;0403119	radio spectra of a sample of x-ray selected bl lacs	we present simultaneous multifrequency radio observations for a completesubsample of 26 xbls from the einstein extended medium-sensitivity survey,obtained with the very large array (vla). spectra are computed using fluxes at20, 6 and 3.6 cm. unlike many radio selected samples, the emss did not imposeany criterion on the radio spectrum to identify bl lac objects. it is thereforepossible to investigate the intrinsic radio spectral slope distribution and todetermine the effect produced by this selection criterion. we find that 15% ofthe observed objects do not meet the flat-spectrum criterion imposed on someother bl lac samples. a dataset that includes non-simultaneous data (that arealso taken with different vla configurations) shows an even higher percentageof steep spectrum sources. this effect can be ascribed to a larger fraction ofextended flux detected with the more compact vla configuration.possible biasesintroduced by the flat--radio-spectrum criterion in the radio-selected bl lacsamples cannot explain the discrepancies observed in the evolutionaryproperties of radio and x-ray selected samples of bl lacs.

astro-ph;0407352	the baryon content of the local intergalactic medium	we describe our surveys of low column density lyman-alpha absorbers [n(hi) =10^(12.5-16.0) cm^-2], which show that the warm photoionized igm contains 30%of all baryons at z &lt; 0.1. this fraction is consistent with cosmologicalsimulations, which also predict that an additional 20-40% of the baryons residein hotter 10^(5-7) k gas, the warm-hot igm (whim). the observed line density oflya absorbers, dn/dz = 170 for n(hi) &gt; 10^(12.8) cm^-2, is dominated bylow-n(hi) systems that exhibit slower redshift evolution than those with n(hi)&gt;10^(14). hst/fuse surveys of ovi absorbers, together with recent detections ofo vii with chandra and xmm/newton, suggest that 20-70% of all baryons couldreside in the whim, depending on its assumed abundance (o/h = 10% solar). atthe highest column densities, n(hi) &gt; 10^(20.3), the damped lya systems areoften identified with gas-rich disks of galaxies over a large range inluminosities (0.03-1 l*) and morphologies. lyman-limit systems [n(hi) =10^(17.3-20.3)] appear to be associated with bound, bright (0.1-0.3 l*) galaxyhalos. the lya absorbers with n(hi) = 10^(13-16) cm^-2 are associated withfilaments of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution, although somemay arise in unbound winds from dwarf galaxies. our discovery that ~20% oflow-z lya absorbers reside in galaxy voids suggests that a substantial fractionof baryons may be entirely unrelated to galaxies. in the future, hubble (andfuse) can provide a census of the local baryons and the distribution of heavyelements in the igm. these studies can be conducted quite efficiently if nasacan install the cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) on hubble, allowing anorder-of-magnitude improvement in throughput and a comparable increase in ourability to study the igm.

astro-ph;9510054	intergalactic hydrogen clouds at low-redshift: connections to voids and  dwarf galaxies	we provide new post-costar data on one sightline (mrk 421) and updated datafrom another (i zw 1) from our hubble space telescope (hst) survey ofintergalactic lyman-alpha clouds located along sightlines to four brightquasars passing through well-mapped galaxy voids (16,000 km/s pathlength) andsuperclusters (18,000 km/s). we report two more definite detections of low-zlyman-alpha clouds in voids: one at 3047 km/s (heliocentric) toward mrk 421 anda second just beyond the local supercluster at 2861 km/s toward i zw 1,confirming our earlier discovery of lyman-alpha absorption clouds in voids(stocke et al. 1995). we have now identified 10 definite and 1 probablelow-redshift neutral hydrogen absorption clouds toward four targets, afrequency of approximately one absorber every 3400 km/s above 10^12.7 cm^-2column density. of these 10 absorption systems, 3 lie within voids; theprobable absorber also lies in a void. thus, the tendency of lyman-alphaabsorbers to ``avoid the voids'' is not as clear as we found previously. if thelyman-alpha clouds are approximated as homogeneous spheres of 100 kpc radius,their masses are ~ 10^9 msun (about 0.01 times that of bright l* galaxies) andthey are 40 times more numerous, comparable to the density of dwarf galaxiesand of low-mass halos in numerical cdm simulations. the lyman-alpha cloudscontribute a fraction omega_cl ~ 0.003 h75^-1 to the closure density of theuniverse, comparable to that of luminous matter. these clouds probably requirea substantial amount of non-baryonic dark matter for gravitational binding.they may represent extended haloes of low- mass protogalaxies which have notexperienced significant star formation or low-mass dwarf galaxies whose starformation ceased long ago, but blew out significant gaseous material.

astro-ph;9707010	a very hot, high redshift cluster of galaxies: more trouble for omega_0  = 1	we have observed the most distant (z=0.829) cluster of galaxies in theeinstein extended medium sensitivity survey, with the asca and rosatsatellites. we find an x-ray temperature of 12.3 +3.1/-2.2 kev for thiscluster, and the rosat map reveals significant substructure. the hightemperature of ms1054-0321 is consistent with both its approximate velocitydispersion, based on the redshifts of 12 cluster members we have obtained atthe keck and the canada-france-hawaii telescopes, and with its weak lensingsignature. the x-ray temperature of this cluster implies a virial mass ~ 7.4 x10^14 h^-1 solar masses, if the mean matter density in the universe equals thecritical value, or larger if omega_0 &lt; 1. finding such a hot, massive clusterin the emss is extremely improbable if clusters grew from gaussianperturbations in an omega_0 = 1 universe. combining the assumptions thatomega_0 = 1 and that the intial perturbations were gaussian with the observedx-ray temperature function at low redshift, we show that the probability ofthis cluster occurring in the volume sampled by the emss is less than a fewtimes 10^{-5}. nor is ms1054-0321 the only hot cluster at high redshift; theonly two other $z &gt; 0.5$ emss clusters already observed with asca also havetemperatures exceeding 8 kev. assuming again that the initial perturbationswere gaussian and omega_0 = 1, we find that each one is improbable at the &lt;10^{-2} level. these observations, along with the fact that these luminositiesand temperatures of the high-$z$ clusters all agree with the low-z l_x-t_xrelation, argue strongly that omega_0 &lt; 1. otherwise, the initial perturbationsmust be non-gaussian, if these clusters' temperatures do indeed reflect theirgravitational potentials.

astro-ph;9903295	a search for low-luminosity bl lacertae objects	many properties of bl lacs have become explicable in terms of the"relativistic beaming" hypothesis whereby bl lacs are fr-1 radio galaxiesviewed nearly along the jet axis. however, a possible problem with this modelis that a transition population between beamed bl lacs and unbeamed fr-1s hasnot been detected. a transition population of "low-luminosity bl lacs" waspredicted to exist in abundance in x-ray-selected samples such as the einsteinextended medium sensitivity survey (emss) by browne &amp; marcha. however, these bllacs may have been misidentified as clusters of galaxies. we have conducted asearch for such objects in the emss with the rosat hri; and here we presentrosat hri images, optical spectra and vla radio maps for a small number of bllacs which were previously misidentified in the emss catalog as clusters ofgalaxies. while these objects are slightly lower in luminosity than other emssbl lacs, their properties are too similar to the other bl lacs in the emsssample to "bridge the gap" between bl lacs and fr-1 radio galaxies. also, thenumber of new bl lacs found are too few to alter significantly the x-rayluminosity function or &lt;v/vmax&gt; value for the x-ray-selected emss bl lacsample. thus, these observations do not explain fully the &lt;v/vmax&gt; discrepancybetween the x-ray and radio-selected bl lac samples.

astro-ph;9906295	the second most distant cluster of galaxies in the emss	we report on our asca, keck, and rosat observations of ms1137.5+6625, thesecond most distant cluster of galaxies in the einstein extended mediumsensitivity survey (emss), at redshift 0.78. we now have x-ray temperatures,velocity dispersions, and x-ray images for a complete, high-redshift sample ofemss clusters. asca observations of ms1137.5+6625 yield a temperature of 5.7+2.1, -1.1 kev and a metallicity of 0.43 +0.40,-0.37 solar (90% confidence).keck-ii spectroscopy of 22 cluster members reveals a velocity dispersion of 884+185, -124 km/s. rosat observations show that ms1137.5+6625 is regular andcentrally concentrated. a beta-model fit yields a core radius of only 71 h^{-1}kpc (q_0=0.1) with beta=0.70 +0.45,-0.15. the gas fraction is 0.06 +/-0.04h^{-3/2}. this is the highest redshift emss cluster with a possible coolingflow (~20-400 solar masses/yr). the velocity dispersion, temperature, gasfraction, and iron abundance of ms1137 are statistically the same as thoseproperties in low-z clusters of similar luminosity. we derive a high-ztemperature function for emss clusters with 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 and compare it withtemperature functions at lower redshifts, showing that evolution of thetemperature function is relatively modest. supplementing our high-z sample withother data, we demonstrate that neither the cluster l-t relation, nor clustermetallicities, nor the cluster gas fraction has detectably evolved withredshift. the very modest degree of evolution in the l-t relation inferred fromthese data is inconsistent with the absence of evolution in the x-rayluminosity functions derived from rosat cluster surveys if a critical-densitystructure formation model is assumed.

astro-ph;9906351	x-ray spectral variability of pks 2005-489 during the spectacular  november 1998 flare	we report on monitoring of the bl lac object pks 2005-489 by the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte) in october-december 1998. during these months, thesource underwent a spectacular flare; at its peak on november 10, its 2-10 kevflux was $3.33 \times 10^{-10} {\rm ~erg ~cm^{-2} ~s^{-1}}$, over 30 timesbrighter than in quiescence. during the rising phase, the x-ray spectrum of pks2005-489 hardened considerably, reaching $\alpha = 1.32~ (f_\nu \propto\nu^{-\alpha})$ near maximum. during the declining phase, the x-ray spectrumsteepened rapidly, reaching $\alpha = 1.82$, then became somewhat hardertowards the end of december ($\alpha \sim 1.6$). while such behavior has beenseen before, the simplicity, magnitude and duration of this flare allowed us tostudy it in great detail. we argue that this flare was caused by either theinjection of particles into the jet or {\it in situ} particle acceleration, andthat the spectral steepening which followed the flare maximum was the result ofsynchrotron cooling. contrary to other recently observed blazar flares (e.g.,mkn 501, 3c 279, pks 2155-304), our results do not imply a major shift in thelocation of the synchrotron peak during this flare.

astro-ph;9907174	new hst observations of the halo gas of ngc 3067: limits on the  extragalactic ionizing background at low redshift and the lyman continuum  escape fraction	we present uv spectroscopy from hst/ghrs and reanalyze existing h_alphaimages of the quasar/galaxy pair 3c 232/ngc 3067 and of the halo gas associatedwith ngc 3067. the spectra permit measurement of, or limits on, the columndensities of fe i, fe ii, mg i, and mg ii in the absorbing cloud. two distinctmodels of the extragalactic radiation field are considered: (1) the ionizingspectrum is dominated by a power-law extragalactic continuum, and (2) thepower-law spectrum contains a lyman break, implying enhanced flux longward of912 a relative to the hydrogen-ionizing flux. the h_alpha images constrain theescape fraction of lyman continuum photons from the galaxy to f_esc &lt;= 0.02.with the assumption that the cloud is shielded from all galactic contributions,we can constrain the intensity and shape of the extragalactic continuum. for anagn-dominated power-law extragalactic spectrum, we derive a limit on theextragalactic ionizing flux phi_ion &gt;= 2600 photons cm^-2 s^-1, or i_0 &gt;=10^-23 erg cm^-2 s^-1 hz^-1 sr^-1 for an ionizing spectrum with power-law indexof 1.8 and a cloud of constant density. when combined with previous upperlimits from the absence of h_alpha recombination emission from intergalacticclouds, our observations require 2600 &lt;= phi_ion &lt;= 10000 photons cm^-2 s^-1.we show that if galactic contributions to the incident radiation are important,it is difficult to constrain phi_ion. these results demonstrate that galactichalo opacities and their wavelength dependence are crucial to understanding theabundance of low-ionization metals in the igm.

astro-ph;9911128	the local lyman-alpha forest. ii: distribution of hi absorbers, doppler  widths, and baryon content	in paper i of this series (astro-ph/9911117) we described observations of 15extragalactic targets taken with the hubble space telescope ghrs/g160m gratingfor studies of the low-z lya forest. we reported the detection of 110 lyaabsorbers at significance level &gt;3 sigma in the redshift range z=0.002-0.069,over a total pathlength of 116,000 km/s. in this second paper, we evaluate thephysical properties of these lya absorbers and compare them to their high-zcounterparts. the distribution of doppler parameters is similar to that at highredshift, with mean b = 35.0 +- 16.6 km/s. the true doppler parameter may besomewhat lower, owing to component blends and non-thermal velocities. thedistribution of equivalent widths exhibits a significant break at w~133ma, withan increasing number of weak absorbers (10ma-100ma). adopting a curve of growthwith b = 25 +- 5km/s and applying a sensitivity correction as a function ofequivalent width and wavelength, we derive the distribution in column density,nh^{-1.72+-0.06} for nh&lt;10^14 cm^-2. we find no redshift evolution in thesample at z&lt;0.07, but we do see a significant decline in dn/dz compared tovalues at z&gt;1.6. a 3 sigma signal in the two-point correlation function of lyaabsorbers for velocity separations delta v &lt;150 km/s is consistent with resultsat high-z. applying a photoionization correction, we find that the low-z lyaforest may contain ~20% of the total number of baryons, with closure parameteromega_lya = (0.008+-0.001), for a standard absorber size and ionizing radiationfield. some of these clouds appear to be primordial matter, owing to the lackof detected metals in a composite spectrum. our data suggest that a fraction ofthe absorbers are associated with gas in galaxy associations (filaments), whilea second population is distributed more uniformly.
