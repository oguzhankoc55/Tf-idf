0907.1305	an hst/wfpc survey of bright young clusters in m31. ii. photometry of  less luminous clusters in the fields	we report on the properties of 89 low mass star clusters located in thevicinity of luminous young clusters (blue globulars) in the disk of m31. 82 ofthe clusters are newly detected. we have determined their integrated magnitudesand colors, based on a series of hubble space telescope wide field/planetarycamera 2 exposures in blue and red (hst filters f450w and f814w). theintegrated apparent magnitudes range from f450w = 17.5 to 22.5, and the colorsindicate a wide range of ages. stellar color-magnitude diagrams for allclusters were obtained and those with bright enough stars were fit totheoretical isochrones to provide age estimates. the ages range from 12 myr to&gt;500 myr. reddenings, which average e(f450 - f814) = 0.59 with a dispersion of0.21 magnitudes, were derived from the main sequence fitting for thoseclusters. comparison of these ages and integrated colors with single populationtheoretical models with solar abundances suggests a color offset of 0.085magnitudes at the ages tested. estimated ages for the remaining clusters arebased on their measured colors. the age-frequency diagram shows a steep declineof number with age, with a large decrease in number per age interval betweenthe youngest and the oldest clusters detected.

0909.4053	an hst/wfpc2 survey of bright young clusters in m31 iii. structural  parameters	surface brightness profiles for 23 m31 star clusters were measured usingimages from the wide field planetary camera 2 on the hubble space telescope,and fit to two types of models to determine the clusters' structuralproperties. the clusters are primarily young (~10^8 yr) and massive (~10^4.5solar masses), with median half-light radius 7 pc and dissolution times of afew gyr. the properties of the m31 clusters are comparable to those of clustersof similar age in the magellanic clouds. simulated star clusters are used toderive a conversion from statistical measures of cluster size to half-lightradius so that the extragalactic clusters can be compared to young massiveclusters in the milky way. all three sets of star clusters fall approximatelyon the same age-size relation. the young m31 clusters are expected to dissolvewithin a few gyr and will not survive to become old, globular clusters.however, they do appear to follow the same fundamental plane relations as oldclusters; if confirmed with velocity dispersion measurements, this would be astrong indication that the star cluster fundamental plane reflects universalcluster formation conditions.

0910.1141	the evolution of the hard x-ray luminosity function of agn	we present new observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10kevx-ray luminosity function (xlf) of agn. we utilise data from a number ofsurveys including both the 2ms chandra deep fields and the aegis-x 200kssurvey, enabling accurate measurements of the evolution of the faint end of thexlf. we combine direct, hard x-ray selection and spectroscopic follow-up orphotometric redshift estimates at z&lt;1.2 with a rest-frame uv colourpre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated withcatastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. only robust opticalcounterparts to x-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matchingtechnique. a bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshiftprobability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our highredshift samples, and allows robust comparison of different evolutionarymodels. we find that the xlf retains the same shape at all redshifts, butundergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z~1, and an overall negativedensity evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolutionat earlier times. we do not find evidence that a luminosity-dependent densityevolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required todescribe the evolution of the xlf. we find significantly higher space densitiesof low-luminosity, high-redshift agn than in prior studies, and a smaller shiftin the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasingluminosity. the total luminosity density of agn peaks at z=1.2+/-0.1, but thereis a mild decline to higher redshifts. we find &gt;50% of black hole growth takesplace at z&gt;1, with around half in lx&lt;10^44 erg/s agn.

0910.3944	localization of the x-ray source in the globular cluster g1 with chandra	we report the most accurate x-ray position of the x-ray source in the giantglobular cluster g1 in m31 by using the chandra x-ray observatory, hubble spacetelescope (hst), and canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). g1 is clearlydetected with chandra and by cross-registering with hst and cfht images, wederive a 1-sigma error radius of 0.15 arcsec, significantly smaller than theprevious measurement by xmm-newton. we conclude that the x-ray emission of g1is likely to come from within the core radius of the cluster. we haveconsidered a number of possibilities for the origin of the x-ray emission butcan rule all but two scenarios out: it could be due to either accretion onto acentral intermediate-mass black hole (imbh), or an ordinary low-mass x-raybinary (lmxb). based on the x-ray luminosity and the bondi accretion rate, animbh accreting from the cluster gas seems unlikely and we suggest that thex-rays are due to accretion from a companion. alternatively, the probabilitythat a 1.5 solar masses cluster lmxb lies within the 95 per cent x-ray errorcircle is about 0.7. therefore we cannot rule out a single lmxb as the originof the x-ray emission. while we cannot distinguish between different modelswith current observations, future high-resolution and high-sensitivity radioimaging observations will reveal whether there is an imbh at the centre of g1.

0911.2470	galactic cepheids with spitzer: i. leavitt law and colors	classical cepheid variable stars have been important indicators ofextragalactic distance and galactic evolution for over a century. the spitzerspace telescope has opened the possibility of extending the study of cepheidsinto the mid- and far-infrared, where interstellar extinction is reduced. wehave obtained photometry from images of a sample of galactic cepheids with theirac and mips instruments on spitzer. here we present the first mid-infraredperiod-luminosity relations for classical cepheids in the galaxy, and the firstever cepheid period-luminosity relations at 24 and 70 um. we compare theserelations with theoretical predictions, and with period-luminosity relationsobtained in recent studies of the large magellanic cloud. we find a significantperiod-color relation for the [3.6]-[8.0] irac color. other mid-infrared colorsfor both cepheids and non-variable supergiants are strongly affected byvariable molecular spectral features, in particular deep co absorption bands.we do not find strong evidence for mid-infrared excess caused by warm (~500 k)circumstellar dust. we discuss the possibility that recent detections withnear-infrared interferometers of circumstellar shells around delta cep, l car,polaris, y oph and rs pup may be a signature of shocked gas emission in adust-poor wind associated to pulsation-driven mass loss.

1005.3331	aegis: a multi-wavelength study of spitzer power-law galaxies	this paper analyzes a sample of 489 spitzer/irac sources in the extendedgroth strip whose spectral energy distributions fit a red power law from 3.6 to8.0 \micron. the median for sources with known redshift is &lt;z&gt;=1.6. though allor nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei, only 33%were detected in the egs x-ray survey (aegis-x) using 200 ks chandraobservations. the detected sources are x-ray luminous with l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/sand moderately to heavily obscured with n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. stacking thex-ray-undetected sample members yields a statistically significant x-raysignal, suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured thansources with x-ray detections. the ratio of x-ray to mid-infrared fluxessuggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in x-rays areobscured at the compton-thick level, in contrast to the x-ray-detected sources,all of which appear to be compton-thin. for the x-ray-detected power-lawsources with redshifts, an x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 10^44 erg/s marks atransition between low-luminosity, blue sources dominated by the host galaxy tohigh-luminosity, red power-law sources dominated by nuclear activity.x-ray-to-optical ratios, infrared variability, and 24 micron properties of thesample are consistent with the identification of infrared power-law sources asactive nuclei, but a rough estimate is that only 22% of agns are selected bythe power law criteria. comparison of the power-law selection technique andvarious irac color criteria for identifying agns confirms that high-redshiftsamples selected via simple irac colors may be heavily contaminated bystarlight-dominated objects.

0704.2057	structural parameters for globular clusters in m31 and generalizations  for the fundamental plane	the structures of globular clusters (gcs) reflect their dynamical states andpast histories. high-resolution imaging allows the exploration of morphologiesof clusters in other galaxies. surface brightness profiles from new hubblespace telescope observations of 34 globular clusters in m31 are presented,together with fits of several different structural models to each cluster. m31clusters appear to be adequately fit by standard king models, and do notobviously require alternate descriptions with relatively stronger halos, suchas are needed to fit many gcs in other nearby galaxies. the derived structuralparameters are combined with corrected versions of those measured in an earliersurvey to construct a comprehensive catalog of structural and dynamicalparameters for m31 gcs with a sample size similar to that for the milky way.clusters in m31, the milky way, magellanic clouds, fornax dwarf spheroidal andngc 5128 define a very tight fundamental plane with identical slopes. thecombined evidence for these widely different galaxies strongly reinforces theview that old globular clusters have near-universal structural propertiesregardless of host environment.

1007.1459	extragalactic background light inferred from aegis galaxy sed-type  fractions	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is of fundamental importance bothfor understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for gamma-rayastronomy, but the overall spectrum of the ebl between 0.1-1000 microns hasnever been determined directly from galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed)observations over a wide redshift range. the evolving, overall spectrum of theebl is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. thisis achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame k-band galaxyluminosity function up to redshift 4 (cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with adetermination of galaxy sed-type fractions. these are based on fitting swiretemplates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshiftrange from 0.2 to 1 from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). the changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forminggalaxies, starburst galaxies and agn galaxies in that redshift range areestimated, and two alternative extrapolations of sed-types to higher redshiftsare considered. this allows calculation of the evolution of the luminositydensities from the uv to the ir, the evolving star formation rate density ofthe universe, the evolving contribution to the bolometric ebl from thedifferent galaxy populations including agn galaxies and the buildup of the ebl.our ebl calculations are compared with those from a semi-analytic model, fromanother observationally-based model and observational data. the ebluncertainties in our modeling based directly on the data are quantified, andtheir consequences for attenuation of very high energy gamma-rays due to pairproduction on the ebl are discussed. it is concluded that the ebl is wellconstrained from the uv to the mid-ir, but independent efforts from infraredand gamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in thefar-ir.

1011.3386	galactic cepheids with spitzer: ii. search for extended infrared  emission	a deep and detailed examination of 29 classical cepheids with the spitzerspace telescope has revealed three stars with strong nearby extended emissiondetected in multiple bands which appears to be physically associated with thestars. rs pup was already known to possess extended infrared emission, whilethe extended emission around the other two stars s mus and delta cep is newlydiscovered in our observations. four other stars gh lup, l car, t mon and x cygshow tentative evidence for extended infrared emission. an unusual elongatedextended object next to sz tau appears to be a background or foreground objectin a chance alignment with the cepheid. the inferred mass loss rates upperlimits for s mus and delta cep are in the range from 1e-9 to 1e-8 msun/yr, withthe upper limit for rs pup as high as 1e-6 msun/yr. mass loss duringpost-main-sequence evolution has been proposed as a resolution to thediscrepancy between pulsational and dynamical masses of cepheid variable stars:dust in the lost material would make itself known by the presence of aninfrared bright nebula, or unresolved infrared excess. the observed frequencyof infrared circumstellar emission (&lt;24%) and the mass loss rate we estimatefor our sources shows that dusty mass loss can only account for part of thecepheid mass loss discrepancy. nevertheless, our direct evidence that mass lossis active during the cepheid phase is an important confirmation that theseprocesses need to be included in evolutionary and pulsation models of thesestars, and should be taken into account in the calibration of the cepheiddistance scale.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1201.5296	comparing mid-infrared globular cluster colors with population synthesis  models	several population synthesis models now predict integrated colors of simplestellar populations in the mid-infrared bands. to date, the models have notbeen extensively tested in this wavelength range. in a comparison of thepredictions of several recent population synthesis models, the integratedcolors are found to cover approximately the same range but to disagree indetail, for example on the effects of metallicity. to test againstobservational data, globular clusters are used as the closest objects toidealized groups of stars with a single age and single metallicity. usingrecent mass estimates, we have compiled a sample of massive, old globularclusters in m31 which contain enough stars to guard against the stochasticeffects of small-number statistics, and measured their integrated colors in thespitzer/irac bands. comparison of the cluster photometry in the irac bands withthe model predictions shows that the models reproduce the cluster colorsreasonably well, except for a small (not statistically significant) offset in[4.5]-[5.8]. in this color, models without circumstellar dust emission predictbluer values than are observed. model predictions of colors formed from the vband and the irac 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands are redder than the observed data athigh metallicities and we discuss several possible explanations. in agreementwith model predictions, v-[3.6] and v-[4.5] colors are found to havemetallicity sensitivity similar to or slightly better than v-ks.

0704.3609	the local galaxy 8 micron luminosity function	a sst survey in the noao deep-wide field in bo\"otes provides a complete,8-micron-selected sample of galaxies to a limiting (vega) magnitude of 13.5. inthe 6.88 deg$^2$ field sampled, 79% of the 4867 galaxies have spectroscopicredshifts, allowing an accurate determination of the local (z&lt;0.3) galaxyluminosity function. stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis ofobserved galaxy colors. dust emission (mostly pah) accounts for 80% of the 8micron luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19%, and agn emissionaccounts for roughly 1 %. a sub-sample of the 8 micron-selected galaxies haveblue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant pah emission.the luminosity functions for the total 8 micron luminosity and for the dustemission alone are both well fit by schechter functions. for the 8 micronluminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is \nu l_{\nu}^*(8.0\micron) = 1.8 \times 10^{10}$ \lsun while for the dust emission alone it is1.6 x 10^{10}$ \lsun\null. the average 8 \micron luminosity density at z&lt;0.3 is3.1 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}, and the average luminosity density from dust aloneis 2.5 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}. this luminos ity arises predominantly fromgalaxies with 8 \micron luminosities ($\nu l_{\nu}$) between $2\times 10^9$ and$2 x 10^{10}$ \lsun, i.e., normal galaxies, not lirgs or ulirgs.

0801.2160	the role of agn in the colour transformation of galaxies at redshifts  z~1	we explore the role of agn in establishing and/or maintaining the bimodalcolour distribution of galaxies by quenching their star-formation and hence,causing their transition from the blue to the red cloud. important tests forthis scenario include (i) the x-ray properties of galaxies in the transitionzone between the two clouds and (ii) the incidence of agn in post-starbursts,i.e. systems observed shortly after (&lt;1gyr) the termination of theirstar-formation. we perform these tests by combining deep chandra observationswith multiwavelength data from the aegis survey. stacking the x-ray photons atthe positions of galaxies (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9) not individually detected at x-raywavelengths suggests a population of obscured agn among sources in thetransition zone and in the red cloud. their mean x-ray and mid-ir propertiesare consistent with moderately obscured low-luminosity agn, compton thicksources or a mix of both. morphologies show that major mergers are unlikely todrive the evolution of this population but minor interactions may play a role.the incidence of obscured agn in the red cloud (both direct detections andstacking results) suggests that bh accretion outlives the termination of thestar-formation. this is also supported by our finding that post-starburstgalaxies at z~0.8 and agn are associated, in agreement with recent results atlow-z. a large fraction of post-starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidencefor at least moderate levels of agn obscuration. this implies that if agnoutflows cause the colour transformation of galaxies, then some nuclear gas anddust clouds either remain unaffected or relax to the central galaxy regionsafter the quenching their star-formation.

1308.6748	m31 globular cluster structures and the presence of x-ray binaries	[abridged] m31 has several times more globular clusters (gcs) than the milkyway. it contains a correspondingly larger number of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxbs) associated with gcs, and can be used to investigate the gc propertieswhich lead to x-ray binary formation. the best tracer of the spatial structureof m31 gcs is high-resolution imaging from the hubble space telescope, and wehave used hst data to derive structural parameters for 29 lmxb-hosting m31 gcs.these measurements are combined with structural parameters from the literaturefor a total of 41 (of 50 known) lmxb gcs and a comparison sample of 65 non-lmxbgcs. structural parameters measured in blue bandpasses are found to showsmaller core radii and higher concentrations than those measured in redbandpasses; this difference is enhanced in lmxb clusters and could be relatedto stellar population differences. clusters with lmxbs show higher collisionrates for their mass compared to those without lmxbs and collision ratesestimated at the core radius show larger offsets than rates estimated at thehalf-light radius. these results are consistent with the dynamical formationscenario for lmxbs. a logistic regression analysis finds that, as expected, theprobability of a gc hosting an lmxb increases with increasing collision rateand proximity to the galaxy center. the same analysis finds that p(lmxb)decreases with increasing gc mass at a fixed collision rate, although wecaution that this could be due to sample selection effects. metallicity isfound to be a less important predictor of p(lmxb) than collision rate, mass, ordistance, even though lmxb gcs have a higher metallicity on average. this maybe due to the interaction of location and metallicity: a sample of m31 lmxbswith a greater range in galactocentric distance would likely contain moremetal-poor gcs and make it possible to disentangle the two effects.

0803.0357	the mid-infrared properties of x-ray sources	we combine the results of the spitzer irac shallow survey and the chandraxbootes survey of the 8.5 square degrees bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey to produce the largest comparison of mid-ir and x-ray sources todate. the comparison is limited to sources with x-ray fluxes &gt;8x10-15 ergcm-2s-1 in the 0.5-7.0 kev range and mid-ir sources with 3.6 um fluxes brighterthan 18.4 mag (12.3 ujy). in this most sensitive irac band, 85% of the 3086x-ray sources have mid-ir counterparts at an 80% confidence level based on abayesian matching technique. only 2.5% of the sample have no irac counterpartat all based on visual inspection. even for a smaller but a significantlydeeper chandra survey in the same field, the irac shallow survey recovers mostof the x-ray sources. a majority (65%) of the chandra sources detected in allfour irac bands occupy a well-defined region of irac [3.6] - [4.5] vs [5.8] -[8.0] color-color space. these x-ray sources are likely infrared luminous,unobscured type i agn with little mid-infrared flux contributed by the agn hostgalaxy. of the remaining chandra sources, most are lower luminosity type i andtype ii agn whose mid-ir emission is dominated by the host galaxy, whileapproximately 5% are either galactic stars or very local galaxies.

1406.4121	faint x-ray binaries and their optical counterparts in m31	x-ray binaries (xrbs) are probes of both star formation and stellar mass, butmore importantly remain one of the only direct tracers of the compact objectpopulation. to investigate the xrb population in m31, we utilized all 121publicly available observations of m31 totalling over 1 ms from$\it{chandra's}$ acis instrument. we studied 83 star clusters in the bulgeusing the year 1 star cluster catalogue from the panchromatic hubble andromedatreasury survey. we found 15 unique star clusters that matched to 17 x-raypoint sources within 1'' (3.8 pc). this population is composed predominantly ofglobular cluster low-mass xrbs, with one previously unidentified star clusterx-ray source. star clusters that were brighter and more compact preferentiallyhosted an x-ray source. specifically, logistic regression showed that the f475wmagnitude was the most important predictor followed by the effective radius,while color (f475w$-$f814w) was not statistically significant. we alsocompleted a matching analysis of 1566 hii regions and found 10 unique matchesto 9 x-ray point sources within 3'' (11 pc). the hii regions hosting x-raypoint sources were on average more compact than unmatched hii regions, butlogistic regression concluded that neither the radius nor h$\alpha$ luminositywas a significant predictor. four matches have no previous classification andthus are high-mass xrb candidates. a stacking analysis of both star clustersand hii regions resulted in non-detections, giving typical upper limits of$\approx10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which probes the quiescent xrb regime.

1509.05781	mid-infrared spectroscopy of the andromeda galaxy	we present spitzer/infrared spectrograph (irs) 5-21 micron spectroscopic mapstowards 12 regions in the andromeda galaxy (m31). these regions include thenucleus, bulge, an active region in the star-forming ring, and 9 other regionschosen to cover a range of mid-to-far-infrared colours. in line with previousresults, pah feature ratios (6.2 micron and 7.7 micron features compared to the11.2 micron feature) measured from our extracted m31 spectra, except thenucleus, strongly correlate. the equivalent widths of the main pah features, asa function of metallicity and radiation hardness, are consistent with thoseobserved for other nearby spiral and starburst galaxies. reprocessed data fromthe isocam instrument on the infrared space observatory agree with the irsdata; early reports of suppressed 6-8 micron features and enhanced 11.3 micronfeature intensity and fwhm apparently resulted from background-subtractionproblems. the nucleus does not show any pah emission but does show strongsilicate emission at 9.7 micron. furthermore, different spectral features (11.3micron pah emission, silicate emission and [neiii] 15.5 micron line emission)have distinct spatial distributions in the nuclear region: the silicateemission is strongest towards the stellar nucleus, while the pah emission peaks15 arcsec north of the nucleus. the pah feature ratios at this position areatypical with strong emission at 11.2 microns and 15-20 microns but weakemission at 6--8 microns. the nucleus itself is dominated by stellar lightgiving rise to a strong blue continuum and silicate emission.

1512.05768	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey x. environmental effects on the  molecular gas and star formation properties of spiral galaxies	we present a study of the molecular gas properties in a sample of 98 hi -flux selected spiral galaxies within $\sim25$ mpc, using the co $j=3-2$ lineobserved with the james clerk maxwell telescope. we use the technique ofsurvival analysis to incorporate galaxies with co upper limits into ourresults. comparing the group and virgo samples, we find a larger mean h$_{2}$mass in the virgo galaxies, despite their lower mean hi mass. this leads to asignificantly higher h$_{2}$ to hi ratio for virgo galaxies. combining our datawith complementary h$\alpha$ star formation rate measurements, virgo galaxieshave longer molecular gas depletion times compared to group galaxies, due totheir higher h$_{2}$ masses and lower star formation rates. we suggest that thelonger depletion times may be a result of heating processes in the clusterenvironment or differences in the turbulent pressure. from the full sample, wefind that the molecular gas depletion time has a positive correlation with thestellar mass, indicative of differences in the star formation process betweenlow and high mass galaxies, and a negative correlation between the moleculargas depletion time and the specific star formation rate.

astro-ph;0011522	the m31 globular cluster luminosity function	we combine our compilation of photometry of m31 globular cluster and probablecluster candidates with new near-infrared photometry for 30 objects. usingthese data we determine the globular cluster luminosity function (gclf) inmultiple filters for the m31 halo clusters. we find a gclf peak and dispersionof v_0^0=16.84 +/-0.11, sigma_t=0.93 +/- 0.13 (gaussian sigma = 1.20 +/- 0.14),consistent with previous results. the halo gclf peak colors (e.g., b^0_0 -v^0_0) are consistent with the average cluster colors. we also measure v-bandgclf parameters for several other subsamples of the m31 globular clusterpopulation. the inner third of the clusters have a gclf peak significantlybrigher than that of the outer clusters (delta v =~ 0.5mag). dividing thesample by both galacticentric distance and metallicity, we find that the gclfalso varies with metallicity, as the metal-poor clusters are on average 0.36mag fainter than the metal-rich clusters. our modeling of the catalog selectioneffects suggests that they are not the cause of the measured differences, but amore complete, less-contaminated m31 cluster catalog is required forconfirmation. our results imply that dynamical destruction is not the onlyfactor causing variation in the m31 gclf: metallicity, age, and cluster initialmass function may also be important.

astro-ph;0101556	the agb phase-transition outside the local group: k-band observations of  young star clusters in ngc 7252	we have extended the study of the young star clusters observed in the mergerremnant galaxy ngc 7252 by obtaining k band photometry for these clusters. ourk band data significantly complement the optical photometry and spectroscopy inthe literature: k band data are fundamental to study the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) population of these clusters, since the agb phase transition(occuring between the age of 200 myr and 1 gyr) causes abrupt changes in thenear-infrared luminosity of the clusters while producing only small changes inthe optical. therefore, the e.g. v-k colour is ideal to study this evolutionaryphase of stellar populations. for the present analysis we present models forsimple stellar populations which include the contribution of the agb stellarphase, calibrated with the young and intermediate age star clusters of themagellanic clouds. the comparison with the colour distribution of the ngc 7252star clusters shows that they are indeed intermediate age clusters undergoingthe agb phase transition. the agb phase transition is observed for the firsttime outside the local group. most of the studied clusters span the very narrowage range 300-500 myr, and likely have metallicities 0.5-1 z_{\odot}. a veryimportant exception is the cluster w32, which has already completed its agbepoch, its colours being consistent with an age of 1-2 gyr. this impacts on theduration of the merger-induced starburst. the strengths of the magnesium andiron lines in the spectrum of the best observed cluster w3, and in the spectrumof the diffuse central light of ngc 7252, do not show an overabundance inalpha-elements, in contrast to the bulk stellar population of ellipticalgalaxies.

astro-ph;0106254	bright x-ray sources in m31 globular clusters	we have conducted chandra observations of ~2560 square arcmin (~131 kpc^2) ofof m31, and find that the most luminous x-ray sources in our fields are inglobular clusters (gcs). of the 28 gc x-ray sources in our fields, 17 are newlydiscovered. approximately 1/3 of all the sources have l_x([0.5-7] kev) &gt;10^{37} ergs/s; approximately 1/10 of all the sources have l_x([0.5-7] kev)close to or above 10^{38} erg/s. the most luminous source, in the globularcluster bo 375, is consistently observed to have l_x greater than 2 x 10^{38}ergs/s.  (1) we present data on the spectra and/or light curves of the 5 most luminousm31 gc sources.  (2)we explore possible explanations for the high x-ray luminosities of thebrightest sources. these include that the x-ray sources may be composites, theradiation we receive may be beamed, metallicity effects could be at work, orthe sources may be accreting black holes. we weigh each of these possibilitiesagainst the data. in addition, we introduce a neutron star model in which masstransfer proceeds on the thermal time scale of the donor star. our model canproduce luminosities of several times 10^{38} ergs/s, and leads to a set ofwell-defined predictions.  (3) we compute the x-ray luminosity function and the distribution of countsin wavebands that span the range of energies to which chandra is sensitive. wefind the peak x-ray luminosity is higher and that systems with l_x &gt; 10^{37}ergs/s constitute a larger fraction of all gc sources than in the mw.  (4) we study the possible reasons for this difference between m31 andgalactic gc x-ray sources and identify three promising explanations.

astro-ph;0512357	an investigation of the submillimeter background radiation using scuba  and spitzer	we investigate the redshift dependence of the contribution to theextragalactic far-infrared/sub-millimeter background from galaxies detected bythe spitzer space telescope at 8um and 24um. using seven-band optical tomid-infrared photometry, we estimate photometric redshifts for the spitzersources which appear to be mostly l* galaxies at a median redshift of z=1.0.these sources, extracted from deep 8um and 24um mosaics of the cudss 14-hourfield with 5sigma limits of 5.8ujy and 70ujy respectively, exhibit significant850um and 450um emission as observed by scuba. at 850um, after removing&gt;=4sigma sources and those securely identified in our previous cross-matchingpaper, we measure stacked flux at the significance level of 4.4sigma and2.9sigma from the full 8um and 24um galaxy catalogue respectively. at 450um,flux is detected from all 8um galaxies at the level of 3.5sigma, while there isno significant emission from the 24um galaxies. we find that the 850um flux isemitted almost exclusively at z&gt;~1.3 from the spitzer sources with 0.44mjy(4.7sigma) per 8um source and 0.51mjy (2.8sigma) per 24um source. thiscorresponds to a contribution of (16+/-3)% toward the 850um extra-galacticbackground from the 8um sources and (5.0+/-1.8)% from the 24um sources. at450um, only the 8um sources within the redshift interval 1&lt;z&lt;2 exhibitsignificant emission with an average flux per source of 3.35mjy (3.0sigma).this is a contribution of (37+/-12)% to the 450um background.

astro-ph;0512618	mid-infrared properties of x-ray sources in the extended groth strip	mid-infrared observations of active galactic nuclei (agn) are important forunderstanding of the physical conditions around the central accretion engines.chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations of a 300 arcmin^2 region in theextended groth strip are used to select a sample of~150 agn. the spitzerinstruments irac and mips detect 68-80% of these sources, which show a widerange of mid-infrared properties. about 40% of the sources have red power-lawspectral energy distributions (f_nu ~ nu^alpha, alpha&lt;0) in the 3.6-8 um iracbands. in these sources the central engine dominates the emission at both x-rayand ir wavelengths. another 40% of the sources have blue mid-ir spectral energydistributions (alpha&gt;0) with their infrared emission dominated by the hostgalaxy; the remaining 20% are not well-fit by a power law. published irac colorcriteria for agn select most of the red sources, but only some of the bluesources. as with all other known methods, selecting agn with mid-ir colors willnot produce a sample that is simultaneously complete and reliable. the irac sedtype does not directly correspond to x-ray spectral type (hard/soft). themid-ir properties of x-ray-detected lyman-break, radio, submillimeter, andoptically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part, are not distinctfrom those of the general x-ray/infrared source population. x-ray sources emit6-11% of the integrated mid--ir light, making them significant contributors tothe cosmic infrared background.

astro-ph;0601314	spitzer/mips infrared imaging of m31: further evidence for a spiral/ring  composite structure	new images of m31 at 24, 70, and 160 micron taken with the multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) reveal the morphology of the dust in this galaxy.this morphology is well represented by a composite of two logarithmic spiralarms and a circular ring (radius ~10 kpc) of star formation offset from thenucleus. the two spiral arms appear to start at the ends of a bar in thenuclear region and extend beyond the star forming ring. as has been found inprevious work, the spiral arms are not continuous but composed of spiralsegments. the star forming ring is very circular except for a region near m32where it splits. the lack of well defined spiral arms and the prominence of thenearly circular ring suggests that m31 has been distorted by interactions withits satellite galaxies. using new dynamical simulations of m31 interacting withm32 and ngc 205 we find that, qualitatively, such interactions can produce anoffset, split ring like that seen in the mips images.

astro-ph;0605452	hubble space telescope observations of star clusters in m101	hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs) images are used toidentify and study star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy m101.about 3000 round, slightly-resolved cluster candidates are identified in 10 acspointings covering an area of 106 arcmin^2. the cluster candidates' color andsize distributions are consistent with those of star clusters in other nearbyspirals. the majority of the m101 candidates are blue and more likely to beassociated with the galaxy's spiral arms, implying that they are young. thegalaxy-luminosity-normalized number of `young massive clusters' in m101 issimilar to that found in other spirals, as is the cluster density at a fiducialabsolute magnitude. we confirm a previous finding that m101 has a large numberof faint, red star clusters: if these are old globular clusters then thisgalaxy has a very large globular cluster population. more plausible is that thefaint red clusters are reddened young clusters; their colors and luminositiesare also consistent with this explanation.

astro-ph;0606139	the deep chandra survey of the groth strip - ii. optical identification  of the x-ray sources	we discuss the optical and x-ray spectral properties of the sources detectedin a single 200ks chandra pointing in the groth-westphal strip region. opticalidentifications and spectroscopic redshifts are primarily from the deep2survey. this is complemented with deeper (r~26mag) multi-waveband data (ugriz)from the canada france hawaii legacy survey to estimate photometric redshiftsand to optically identify sources fainter than the deep2 magnitude limit(r(ab)~24.5mag). we focus our study on the 2-10kev selected sample comprising97 sources to the limit ~8e-16erg/s/cm2, this being the most complete in termsof optical identification rate (86%) and redshift determination fraction (63%;both spectroscopic and photometric). we first construct the redshiftdistribution of the sample which shows a peak at z~1. this is in broadagreement with models where less luminous agns evolve out to z~1 with powerfulqsos peaking at higher redshift, z~2. evolution similar to that of broad-lineqsos applied to the entire agn population (both type-i and ii) does not fit thedata. we also explore the observed n_h distribution of the sample and estimatea fraction of obscured agn (n_h&gt;1e22) of ~48%. this is found to be consistentwith both a luminosity dependent intrinsic n_h distribution, where lessluminous systems comprise a higher fraction of type-ii agns, and models with afixed ratio 2:1 between type-i and ii agns. we further compare our results withthose obtained in deeper and shallower surveys. we argue that a luminositydependent parametrisation of the intrinsic n_h distribution is required toaccount for the fraction of obscured agn observed in different samples over awide range of fluxes.

astro-ph;0609466	far-infrared characterization of an ultra-luminous starburst associated  with a massively-accreting black hole at z=1.15	as part of the "all wavelength extended groth strip international survey"(aegis), we describe the panchromatic characterization of an x-ray luminousactive galactic nucleus (agn) in a merging galaxy at z=1.15. this object isdetected at infrared (8mic, 24mic, 70mic, 160mic), submillimeter (850mic) andradio wavelengths, from which we derive a bolometric luminosity l_bol ~ 9x10^12lsol. we find that the agn clearly dominates the hot dust emission below 40micbut its total energetic power inferred from the hard x-rays is substantiallyless than the bolometric output of the system. about 50% of the infraredluminosity is indeed produced by a cold dust component that probably originatesfrom enshrouded star formation in the host galaxy. in the context of a coevalgrowth of stellar bulges and massive black holes, this source might represent a``transition'' object sharing properties with both quasars and luminousstarbursts. study of such composite galaxies will help address how the starformation and disk-accretion phenomena may have regulated each other at highredshift and how this coordination may have participated to the build-up of therelationship observed locally between the masses of black holes and stellarspheroids.

astro-ph;0610543	an almost head-on collision as the origin of two off-centre rings in the  andromeda galaxy	the unusual morphology of the andromeda spiral (messier 31, the closestspiral galaxy to the milky way) has long been an enigma. although regarded fordecades as showing little evidence of a violent history, m~31 has a well-knownouter ring of star formation at a radius of 10 kpc whose center is offset fromthe galaxy nucleus. in addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped as seen atboth optical and radio wavelengths. the halo contains numerous loops andripples. here we report the discovery, based on analysis of previously-obtaineddata, of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions 1.5 by 1 kpc andoffset by ~0.5kpc from the center of the galaxy. the two rings appear to bedensity waves propagating in the disk. numerical simulations offer a completelynew interpretation for the morphology of m31: both rings result from acompanion galaxy plunging head-on through the center of the disk of m31. themost likely interloper is m32. head-on collisions between galaxies are rare,but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in ourlocal group of galaxies.

astro-ph;0701924	star formation in aegis field galaxies since z=1.1 : the dominance of  gradually declining star formation, and the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies	we analyze star formation (sf) as a function of stellar mass (m*) andredshift z in the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). for 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10^10(10^10.8) msun at z&lt;0.7(1),with keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile sf rates (sfr) fromemission lines, galex, and spitzer mips 24 micron photometry, optical-nir m*measurements, and hst morphologies. galaxies with reliable signs of sf form adistinct "main sequence (ms)", with a limited range of sfr at a given m* and z(1 sigma &lt; +-0.3 dex), and log(sfr) approximately proportional to log(m*). therange of log(sfr) remains constant to z&gt;1, while the ms as a whole moves tohigher sfr as z increases. the range of sfr along the ms constrains theamplitude of episodic variations of sf, and the effect of mergers on sfr.typical galaxies spend ~67(95)% of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of&lt;~ 2(4) of their average sfr at a given m* and z. the dominant mode of theevolution of sf since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average sfr inmost individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, ora decreasing factor by which sfr are enhanced in starbursts. lirgs at z~1 seemto mostly reflect the high sfr typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. thesmooth ms may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs starformation prior to additional quenching processes. a gradual process like gasexhaustion may play a dominant role.

astro-ph;9911152	m31 globular clusters: colors and metallicities	we present a new catalog of photometric and spectroscopic data on m31globular clusters. the catalog includes new optical and near-infraredphotometry for a substantial fraction of the 435 clusters and clustercandidates. we use these data to determine the reddening and intrinsic colorsof individual clusters, and find that the extinction laws in the galaxy and m31are not significantly different. there are significant (up to 0.2mag in v-k)offsets between the clusters' intrinsic colors and simple stellar populationcolors predicted by population synthesis models; we suggest that these are dueto systematic errors in the models. the distributions of m31 clusters'metallicities and metallicity-sensitive colors are bimodal, with peaks at[fe/h] ~ -1.4 and -0.6. the distribution of v-i is often bimodal in ellipticalgalaxies' globular cluster systems, but is not sensitive enough to metallicityto show bimodality in m31 and galactic cluster systems. the radial distributionand kinematics of the two m31 metallicity groups imply that they are analogs ofthe galactic `halo' and `disk/bulge' cluster systems. the globular clusters inm31 have a small radial metallicity gradient, suggesting that some dissipationoccurred during the gcs formation. the lack of correlation between clusterluminosity and metallicity in m31 gcs shows that self-enrichment is notimportant in gc formation.

0810.1902	a spitzer search for cold dust within globular clusters	globular cluster stars evolving off the main sequence are known to lose mass,and it is expected that some of the lost material should remain within thecluster as an intracluster medium (icm). most attempts to detect such an icmhave been unsuccessful. the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer on thespitzer space telescope was used to observe eight galactic globular clusters inan attempt to detect the thermal emission from icm dust. most clusters do nothave significant detections at 70 microns; one cluster, ngc 6341, has tentativeevidence for the presence of dust, but 90 micron observations do not confirmthe detection. individual 70 micron point sources which appear in several ofthe cluster images are likely to be background galaxies. the inferred dust massand upper limits are &lt; 4e-4 solar masses, well below expectations for clusterdust production from mass loss in red and asymptotic giant branch stars. thisimplies that either globular cluster dust production is less efficient, or thaticm removal or dust destruction is more efficient, than previously believed. weexplore several possibilities for icm removal and conclude that present data donot yet permit us to distinguish between them.
