0901.0731	the early phase of a h1743-322 outburst observed by integral, rxte,  swift, and xmm/newton	we investigate the early phase of the first state change during the 2008september-november outburst of h1743-322, first detected by the integralsatellite. we analyse integral, rxte, swift, and xmm/newton observations, whichprovide coverage of the quiescence to outburst evolution in the 3-200 kev rangeevery few days. the energy spectra are well fitted by a phenomenological modelconsisting of an exponentially cut-off power law plus a disc component. a morephysical model of thermal comptonisation (and a disc) represents the spectraequally well. in a first phase (up to mjd 54760), the photon index andtemperature of the disc do not vary significantly, and have values reminiscentof the hard state (hs). the timing analysis is also consistent with that of ahs, and shows in particular a rather high degree of variability (~30%), and astrong ~0.5-1 hz qpo with its first harmonic. the timing and spectralcharacteristics of h1743-322 are similar to those of the first hs during its2003 outburst. after mjd 54760, a change to softer spectra and a ~5-6 hz qpoindicate that the source underwent a state transition into a hard-intermediatestate (hims). we observe in both states a correlation between the qpo frequencyand the photon index, which indicates a strong link between the accretion disc,generally understood to determine the qpo frequency, and the corona, whichdetermines the qpo power. the gradual disappearance of the qpo harmonic, andthe slowly decreasing hard x-ray flux, imply that the accretion disc graduallymoved inwards during the hs.

0903.3416	evidence for x-ray synchrotron emission from simultaneous mid-ir to  x-ray observations of a strong sgr a* flare	this paper reports measurements of sgr a* made with naco in l' -band (3.80um), ks-band (2.12 um) and h-band (1.66 um) and with visir in n-band (11.88 um)at the eso vlt, as well as with xmm-newton at x-ray (2-10 kev) wavelengths. on4 april, 2007, a very bright flare was observed from sgr a* simultaneously atl'-band and x-ray wavelengths. no emission was detected using visir. theresulting sed has a blue slope (beta &gt; 0 for nul_nu ~ nu^beta, consistent withnul_nu ~ nu^0.4) between 12 micron and 3.8 micron.  for the first time our high quality data allow a detailed comparison ofinfrared and x-ray light curves with a resolution of a few minutes. the ir andx-ray flares are simultaneous to within 3 minutes. however the ir flare lastssignificantly longer than the x-ray flare (both before and after the x-raypeak) and prominent substructures in the 3.8 micron light curve are clearly notseen in the x-ray data. from the shortest timescale variations in the l'-bandlightcurve we find that the flaring region must be no more than 1.2 r_s insize.  the high x-ray to infrared flux ratio, blue nul_nu slope mir to l' -band, andthe soft nul_nu spectral index of the x-ray flare together place strongconstraints on possible flare emission mechanisms. we find that it isquantitatively difficult to explain this bright x-ray flare with inversecompton processes. a synchrotron emission scenario from an electrondistribution with a cooling break is a more viable scenario.

0903.4714	detailed radio to soft gamma-ray studies of the 2005 outburst of the new  x-ray transient xte j1818-245	xte j1818-245 is an x-ray nova that experienced an outburst in 2005, firstseen by the rxte satellite. the source was observed simultaneously at variouswavelengths up to soft gamma-rays with the integral satellite, from 2005february to september. x-ray novae are extreme systems that often harbor ablack hole, and are known to emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum whenin outburst. we analyzed radio, (n)ir, optical, x-ray and soft gamma-rayobservations and constructed simultaneous broad-band x-ray spectra. analyzingboth the light curves in various energy ranges and the hardness-intensitydiagram enabled us to study the long-term behavior of the source. spectralparameters were typical of the soft intermediate states and the high softstates of a black hole candidate. the source showed relatively small spectralvariations in x-rays with considerable flux variation in radio. spectralstudies showed that the accretion disc cooled down from 0.64 to 0.27 kev in 100days and that the total flux decreased while the relative flux of the hotmedium increased. radio emission was detected several times, and,interestingly, five days after entering the hss. modeling the spectral energydistribution from the radio to the soft gamma-rays reveals that the radioflares arise from several ejection events. xte j1818-245 is likely a black holecandidate transient source that might be closer than the galactic bulge. theresults from the data analysis trace the physical changes that took place inthe system at a maximum bolometric luminosity of (0.4-0.9)e38 erg/s (assuming adistance between 2.8-4.3 kpc) and they are discussed within the context of discand jet models.

0907.3786	simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of sgr a* during 2007 april  1-11	we report the detection of variable emission from sgr a* in almost allwavelength bands (i.e. centimeter, millimeter, submillimeter, near-ir andx-rays) during a multi-wavelength observing campaign. three new moderate flaresare detected simultaneously in both near-ir and x-ray bands. the ratio of x-rayto near-ir flux in the flares is consistent with inverse compton scattering ofnear-ir photons by submillimeter emitting relativistic particles which followscaling relations obtained from size measurements of sgr a*. we also find thatthe flare statistics in near-ir wavelengths is consistent with the probabilityof flare emission being inversely proportional to the flux. at millimeterwavelengths, the presence of flare emission at 43 ghz (7mm) using vlba withmilli-arcsecond spatial resolution indicates the first direct evidence thathourly time scale flares are localized within the inner 30$\times$70schwarzschild radii of sgr a*. we also show several cross correlation plotsbetween near-ir, millimeter and submillimeter light curves that collectivelydemonstrate the presence of time delays between the peaks of emission up tothree hours. the evidence for time delays at millimeter and submillimeterwavelengths are consistent with the source of emission being optically thickinitially followed by a transition to an optically thin regime. in particular,there is an intriguing correlation between the optically thin near-ir and x-rayflare and optically thick radio flare at 43 ghz that occurred on 2007 april 4.this would be the first evidence of a radio flare emission at 43 ghz delayedwith respect to the near-ir and x-ray flare emission.

1005.4807	fading hard x-ray emission from the galactic centre molecular cloud sgr  b2	the centre of our galaxy harbours a 4 million solar mass black hole that isunusually quiet: its present x-ray luminosity is more than 10 orders ofmagnitude less than its eddington luminosity. the observation of ironfluorescence and hard x-ray emission from some of the massive molecular cloudssurrounding the galactic centre has been interpreted as an echo of a pastflare. alternatively, low-energy cosmic rays propagating inside the cloudsmight account for the observed emission, through inverse bremsstrahlung of lowenergy ions or bremsstrahlung emission of low energy electrons. here we reportthe observation of a clear decay of the hard x-ray emission from the molecularcloud sgr b2 during the past 7 years thanks to more than 20 ms of integralexposure. the measured decay time is compatible with the light crossing time ofthe molecular cloud core . such a short timescale rules out inversebremsstrahlung by cosmic-ray ions as the origin of the x ray emission. we alsoobtained 2-100 kev broadband x-ray spectra by combining integral and xmm-newtondata and compared them with detailed models of x-ray emission due toirradiation of molecular gas by (i) low-energy cosmic-ray electrons and (ii)hard x-rays. both models can reproduce the data equally well, but the timevariability constraints and the huge cosmic ray electron luminosity required toexplain the observed hard x-ray emission strongly favor the scenario in whichthe diffuse emission of sgr b2 is scattered and reprocessed radiation emittedin the past by sgr a*. using recent parallax measurements that place sgr b2 infront of sgr a*, we find that the period of intense activity of sgr a* endedbetween 75 and 155 years ago.

1307.3954	echoes of multiple outbursts of sagittarius a* revealed by chandra	the relatively rapid spatial and temporal variability of the x-ray radiationfrom some molecular clouds near the galactic center shows that this emissioncomponent is due to the reflection of x-rays generated by a source that wasluminous in the past, most likely the central supermassive black hole,sagittarius a*. studying the evolution of the molecular cloud reflectionfeatures is therefore a key element to reconstruct sgr a*'s past activity. theaim of the present work is to study this emission on small angular scales inorder to characterize the source outburst on short time scales. we use chandrahigh-resolution data collected from 1999 to 2011 to study the most rapidvariations detected so far, those of clouds between 5' and 20' from sgr a*towards positive longitudes. our systematic spectral-imaging analysis of thereflection emission, notably of the fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev and itsassociated 4-8 kev continuum, allows us to characterize the variations down to15" angular scale and 1-year time scale. we reveal for the first time abruptvariations of few years only and in particular a short peaked emission, with afactor of 10 increase followed by a comparable decrease, that propagates alongthe dense filaments of the bridge cloud. this 2-year peaked feature contrastswith the slower 10-year linear variations we reveal in all the other molecularstructures of the region. based on column density constraints, we argue thatthese two different behaviors are unlikely to be due to the same illuminatingevent. the variations are likely due to a highly variable active phase of sgra* sometime within the past few hundred years, characterized by at least twoluminous outbursts of a few-year time scale and during which the sgr a*luminosity went up to at least 10^39 erg/s.

1412.3106	the x-ray flux distribution of sagittarius a* as seen by chandra	we present a statistical analysis of the x-ray flux distribution of sgr a*from the chandra x-ray observatory's 3 ms sgr a* x-ray visionary project (xvp)in 2012. our analysis indicates that the observed x-ray flux distribution canbe decomposed into a steady quiescent component, represented by a poissonprocess with rate $q=(5.24\pm0.08)\times10^{-3}$ cts s$^{-1},$ and a variablecomponent, represented by a power law process ($dn/df\propto f^{-\xi},$$\xi=1.92_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$). this slope matches our recently-reporteddistribution of flare luminosities. the variability may also be described by alog-normal process with a median unabsorbed 2-8 kev flux of$1.8^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a shape parameter$\sigma=2.4\pm0.2,$ but the power law provides a superior description of thedata. in this decomposition of the flux distribution, all of the intrinsicx-ray variability of sgr a* (spanning at least three orders of magnitude influx) can be attributed to flaring activity, likely in the inner accretionflow. we confirm that at the faint end, the variable component contributes ~10%of the apparent quiescent flux, as previously indicated by our statisticalanalysis of x-ray flares in these chandra observations. our flux distributionprovides a new and important observational constraint on theoretical models ofsgr a*, and we use simple radiation models to explore the extent to which astatistical comparison of the x-ray and infrared can provide insights into thephysics of the x-ray emission mechanism.

1507.02690	fifteen years of xmm-newton and chandra monitoring of sgr a*: evidence  for a recent increase in the bright flaring rate	we present a study of the x-ray flaring activity of sgr a* during all the 150xmm-newton and chandra observations pointed at the milky way center over thelast 15 years. this includes the latest xmm-newton and chandra campaignsdevoted to monitoring the closest approach of the very red br-gamma emittingobject called g2. the entire dataset analysed extends from september 1999through november 2014. we employed a bayesian block analysis to investigate anypossible variations in the characteristics (frequency, energetics, peakintensity, duration) of the flaring events that sgr a* has exhibited sincetheir discovery in 2001. we observe that the total bright-or-very bright flareluminosity of sgr a* increased between 2013-2014 by a factor of 2-3 (~3.5 sigmasignificance). we also observe an increase (~99.9% significance) from0.27+-0.04 to 2.5+-1.0 day^-1 of the bright-or-very bright flaring rate of sgra*, starting in late summer 2014, which happens to be about six months afterg2's peri-center passage. this might indicate that clustering is a generalproperty of bright flares and that it is associated with a stationary noiseprocess producing flares not uniformly distributed in time (similar to what isobserved in other quiescent black holes). if so, the variation in flaringproperties would be revealed only now because of the increased monitoringfrequency. alternatively, this may be the first sign of an excess accretionactivity induced by the close passage of g2. more observations are necessary todistinguish between these two hypotheses.

1512.03323	the svom gamma-ray burst mission	we briefly present the science capabilities, the instruments, the operations,and the expected performance of the svom mission. svom (space-based multibandastronomical variable objects monitor) is a chinese-french space missiondedicated to the study of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the next decade. the svommission encompasses a satellite carrying four instruments to detect andlocalize the prompt grb emission and measure the evolution of the afterglow inthe visible band and in x-rays, a vhf communication system enabling the fasttransmission of svom alerts to the ground, and a ground segment including awide angle camera and two follow-up telescopes. the pointing strategy of thesatellite has been optimized to favor the detection of grbs located in thenight hemisphere. this strategy enables the study of the optical emission inthe first minutes after the grb with robotic observatories and the earlyspectroscopy of the optical afterglow with large telescopes to measure theredshifts. the study of grbs in the next decade will benefit from a number oflarge facilities in all wavelengths that will contribute to increase thescientific return of the mission. finally, svom will operate in the era of thenext generation of gravitational wave detectors, greatly contributing tosearches for the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave triggers atxray and gamma-ray energies.

0806.4088	x-ray hiccups from sgra* observed by xmm-newton. the second brightest  flare and three moderate flares caught in half a day	[truncated] in spring 2007, we observed sgra* with xmm with a total exposureof ~230ks. we have performed timing and spectral analysis of the new x-rayflares detected during this campaign. to study the range of flare spectralproperties, in a consistent manner, we have also reprocessed, using the sameanalysis procedure and the latest calibration, archived xmm data of previouslyreported rapid flares. the dust scattering was taken into account during thespectral fitting. we also used chandra archived observations of the quiescentstate of sgra* for comparison. on april 4, 2007, we observed for the first timewithin a time interval of ~1/2 day, an enhanced incidence rate of x-rayflaring, with a bright flare followed by three flares of more moderateamplitude. the former event represents the second brightest x-ray flare fromsgr a* on record. this new bright flare exhibits similar light-curve shape(nearly symmetrical), duration (~3ks) and spectral characteristics to the verybright flare observed in october 3, 2002. the measured spectral parameters ofthe new bright flare, assuming an absorbed power law model taken into accountdust scattering effect, are n_h=12.3(+2.1,-1.8)e22 cm-2 and gamma~2.3+/-0.3calculated at the 90% c.l. the spectral parameter fits of the sum of the threefollowing moderate flares, while lower, are compatible within the error barswith those of the bright flares. the column density found, for a power-law,during the flares is at least two times higher than the value expected from the(dust) visual extinction toward sgra* (av~25 mag). however, our fitting of thesgra* quiescent spectra obtained with chandra shows that an excess of columndensity is already present during the non-flaring phase. the two brightestx-ray flares observed so far from sgra* exhibited similar soft spectra.

astro-ph;0102363	integral observations of galaxy clusters	cluster of galaxies are the largest concentrations of visible mass in theuniverse and therefore a fundamental topic of cosmology and astrophysics.recent radio, euv, and x-ray observations suggest that clusters contain largepopulations of diffuse nonthermal relativistic and/or superthermal particles.these particles may be produced by acceleration in cluster merger shocks, agns,and/or supernovae in cluster galaxies. models for the nonthermal populations inclusters indicate that they should produce substantial hard x-ray and $\gamma$luminosities. the possible role of nonthermal particles in the dynamics ofclusters is one of the greatest uncertainties in their use as cosmologicalprobes. integral offers, for the first time, the possibility of simultaneousmedium resolution imaging (~ 12 arcmin) and high resolution spectroscopy(deltae/e ~ 2 kev @ 1.3 mev) with exceptional sensitivity in the hardx-ray/soft gamma-ray band. the spatial resolution will allow discrete sources,such as agns, to be separated from the diffuse emission of the cluster. fornearby clusters, the spatial distribution of emission can be determined andcompared to models for the nonthermal particle populations and observations inother wavebands. the spectral capabilities may allow different components ofthe nonthermal population to be detected separately. we present simulations ofintegral observations of nearby galaxy clusters that show its capability fordetecting the different phenomena responsible of clusters emission.

astro-ph;0507283	discovery of x-ray eclipses from the transient source cxogc  j174540.0-290031 with xmm-newton	we present the xmm-newton observations obtained during four revolutions inspring and summer 2004 of cxogc j174540.0-290031, a moderately bright transientx-ray source, located at only 2.9" from sgra*. we report the discovery of sharpand deep x-ray eclipses, with a period of 27,961+/-5 s and a duration of about1,100+/-100 s, observed during the two consecutive xmm revolutions from august31 to september 2. no deep eclipses were present during the two consecutive xmmrevolutions from march 28 to april 1, 2004. the spectra during all fourobservations are well described with an absorbed power law continuum. while ourfits on the power law index over the four observations yield values that areconsistent with gamma=1.6-2.0, there appears to be a significant increase inthe column density during the summer 2004 observations, i.e. the period duringwhich the eclipses are detected. the intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 kevenergy range is almost constant with 1.8-2.3 x 10^34 (d_8kpc)^2 erg/s over thefour observations. in the framework of eclipsing semidetached binary systems,we show that the eclipse period constrains the mass of the assumedmain-sequence secondary star to less than 1.0 m_odot. therefore, we deduce thatcxogc j174540.0-290031 is a low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb). moreover the eclipseduration constrains the mass of the compact object to less than about 60m_odot, which is consistent with a stellar mass black hole or a neutron star.the absence of deep x-ray eclipses during the spring 2004 observations could beexplained if the centroid of the x-ray emitting region moves from a position onthe orbital plane to a point above the compact object, possibly coincident withthe base of the jet which was detected in radio at this epoch.

astro-ph;0510787	a multi-wavelength study of sgr a*: the role of near-ir flares in  production of x-ray, soft $\gamma$-ray and sub-millimeter emission	(abridged) we describe highlights of the results of two observing campaignsin 2004 to investigate the correlation of flare activity in sgr a* in differentwavelength regimes, using a total of nine ground and space-based telescopes. wereport the detection of several new near-ir flares during the campaign based on{\it hst} observations. the level of near-ir flare activity can be as low as$\sim0.15$ mjy at 1.6 $\mu$m and continuous up to about 40% of the totalobserving time. using the nicmos instrument on the {\it hst}, the {\itxmm-newton} and cso observatories, we also detect simultaneous bright x-ray andnear-ir flare in which we observe for the first time correlated substructuresas well as simultaneous submillimeter and near-ir flaring. x-ray emission isarising from the population of near-ir-synchrotron-emitting relativisticparticles which scatter submillimeter seed photons within the inner 10schwarzschild radii of sgr a* up to x-ray energies. in addition, using theinverse compton scattering picture, we explain the high energy 20-120 kevemission from the direction toward sgr a*, and the lack of one-to-one x-raycounterparts to near-ir flares, by the variation of the magnetic field and thespectral index distributions of this population of nonthermal particles. inthis picture, the evidence for the variability of submillimeter emission duringa near-ir flare is produced by the low-energy component of the population ofparticles emitting synchrotron near-ir emission. based on the measurements ofthe duration of flares in near-ir and submillimeter wavelengths, we argue thatthe cooling could be due to adiabatic expansion with the implication that flareactivity may drive an outflow.

astro-ph;0511429	integral and xmm-newton observations of the x-ray pulsar igr  j16320-4751/ax j1631.9-4752	we report on observations of the x-ray pulsar igr j16320-4751 (a.k.a. axj1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with integral and xmm-newton. we refinethe source position and identify the most likely infrared counterpart. oursimultaneous coverage allows us to confirm the presence of x-ray pulsations at~1300 s, that we detect above 20 kev with integral for the first time. thepulse fraction is consistent with being constant with energy, which iscompatible with a model of polar accretion by a pulsar. we study the spectralproperties of igr j16320-4751 during two major periods occurring during thesimultaneous coverage with both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flareperiod. we detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 kev iron line in both periods.the presence of such a feature is typical of supergiant wind accretors such asvela x-1 or gx 301-2. we inspect the spectral variations with respect to thepulse phase during the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely dueto variations of the x-ray flux emitted by the source and not to variations ofthe spectral parameters.  our results are therefore compatible with the source being a pulsar in a highmass x-ray binary. we detect a soft excess appearing in the spectra as ablackbody with a temperature of ~0.07 kev. we discuss the origin of the x-rayemission in igr j16320-4751: while the hard x-rays are likely the result ofcompton emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar, based on energyargument we suggest that the soft excess is likely the emission by acollisionally energised cloud in which the compact object is embedded.

astro-ph;0511725	bimodal spectral variability of cygnus x-1 in an intermediate state	we report the results of an observation of cygnus x-1 with integral, that wecombine with simultaneous radio observations with the ryle telescope. bothspectral and variability properties of the source indicate that cygnus x-1 wasin an intermediate state. the integral spectrum shows a high-energy cut-off orbreak around 100 kev. the shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermalcomptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higherenergies.the average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybridthermal/non-thermal comptonisation models. during the 4 day long observationthe source showed an important spectral and flux variability. a principalcomponent analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2independent modes. the first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosityon time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikinglyuncorrelated with the variable radio flux. we interpret this variability modeas variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. the second variabilitymode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 kev. it acts on a longertime-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in the first part of theobservation and then softens again. this pivoting pattern is stronglycorrelated with the radio (15 ghz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when theintegral spectrum is harder. we propose that the pivoting mode represents a'mini' state transition from a nearly high soft state to a nearly low hardstate, and back. this mini-transition would be caused by changes in the softcooling photons flux in the hot comptonising plasma associated with an increaseof the temperature of the accretion disc. the jet power then appears to beanti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to the coronal power.

astro-ph;0607330	the x-ray spectrum of the bursting atoll source 4u~1728-34 observed with  integral	we present for the first time a study of the 3-200 kev broad band spectra ofthe bursting atoll source 4u 1728-34 (gx 354-0) along its hardness intensitydiagram. the analysis was done using the integral public and galactic centerdeep exposure data ranging from february 2003 to october 2004. the spectra arewell described by a thermal comptonization model with an electron temperaturefrom 35 kev to 3 kev and thomson optical depth, tau_t, from 0.5 to 5 in a slabgeometry. the source undergoes a transition from an intermediate/hard to a softstate where the source luminosity increases from 2 to 12% of eddington. we havealso detected 36 type i x-ray bursts two of which show photospheric radiusexpansion. the energetic bursts with photospheric radius expansion occurred atan inferred low mass accretion rate per unit area of \dot m ~ 1.7x10e3 g/cm2/s,while the others at a higher one between 2.4x10e3 - 9.4x10e3 g/cm2/s. for4u1728-34 the bursts' total fluence, and the bursts' peak flux areanti-correlated with the mass accretion rate. the type i x-ray bursts involvepure helium burning either during the hard state, or during the soft state ofthe source.

astro-ph;0609776	simultaneous integral and rxte observations of the accreting millisecond  pulsar hete j1900.1-2455	aims: hete j1900.1-2455 is the seventh known x-ray transient accretingmillisecond pulsar and has been in outburst for more than one year. we comparedthe data on hete j1900.1-2455 with other similar objects and made an attempt atderiving constraints on the physical processes responsible for a spectralformation. methods: the broad-band spectrum of the persistent emission in the2-300 kev energy band and the timing properties were studied using simultaneousintegral and the publicly available rxte data obtained in october 2005. theproperties of the x-ray bursts observed from hete j1900.1-2455 were alsoinvestigated. results: the spectrum is well described by a two-component modelconsisting of a blackbody-like soft x-ray emission at 0.8 kev temperature and athermal comptonized spectrum with the electron temperature of 30 kev andthomson optical depth tau_t ~ 2 for the slab geometry. the source is detectedby integral up to 200 kev at the luminosity of 5e36 erg/s (assuming a distanceof 5 kpc) in the 0.1-200 kev energy band. we have also detected one type ix-ray burst which shows the photospheric radius expansion. the burst occurredat an inferred persistent emission level of ~ 3-4% of the eddington luminosity.using the data for all x-ray bursts observed to date from hete j1900.1-2455,the burst recurrence time is estimated to be about 2 days. no pulsations havebeen detected either in the rxte or in the integral data which puts interestingconstraints on theories of the magnetic field evolution in neutron starlow-mass x-ray binaries.
